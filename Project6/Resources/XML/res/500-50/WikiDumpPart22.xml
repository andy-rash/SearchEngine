When changing inside the [[Computer Programming/Control]] do have a look how your change will affect the other languages - you don't have to fix them - but do consider them.

== Subroutines &amp; Subprograms ==

I program a lot in [[Report Program Generator Programming|RPG]] which uses Subroutines &amp; Subprograms which can be like functions.  There are work variables associated with the subroutine or subprogram ... feed the info in, call it, when it is done it returns the answers.  Thus we develop standard routines to do standard functions which can be used as building blocks for many different programs.  Is this considered to be part of Control Statements, or another element of programming? [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 09:08, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

=== Procedures and functions ===

I guess the proper place would be [[Computer Programming/Procedures and functions]]. The X dependency should be removed and replaced by a language independent definition.

== Evil Goto by scenario ==

Perhaps there should be a separate article on the pros &amp; cons of GOTO and perhaps I should write some of it.

When accepting complex input, we can avoid GOTO using cumbersome code like this
# Start Point of setting up variables
# Populate variables associated with starting point of the data to be read
# Clear flags or variables used to track whether input will be Ok, that are neccessary to manage the loop
# Define the loop such that we fall out if after all the rigamarole, there are no problems.
# Start Point of loop
# Give screen to user to supply data, or access file or whatever
# Get the data
# Analyse the data
# If whatever problem, put error message into relevant variable, or reset so as to read next record in file.
# Also set flag indicating problem requiring return to start point of loop
# Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop
# Now that we have good data we can process it

Or we can have much easier to read code with GOTO.
# Start Point of setting up variables
# Populate variables associated with starting point of the data to be read
# Start Point of loop
# Give screen to user to supply data, or access file or whatever
# Get the data
# Analyse the data
# If whatever problem, put error message into relevant variable, or reset so as to read next record in file.
# GOTO Start Point
# Now that we have good data we can process it
[[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 09:02, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

The algorithm using GOTO has some problems:
* The GOTO target 'Start Point' is not defined. There is a 'Start Point of setting up variables' and a 'Start Point of loop', which one do you mean?
* It describes an endless loop, as there seems to be no conditional.  In other words, replace the unconditional GOTO by this step: 'Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop (via GOTO)'
* This step is missing: 'Clear flags or variables used to track whether input will be Ok, that are necessary to manage the loop'
* This step is missing: 'Also set flag indicating problem requiring return to start point of loop'

The description of the algorithm without GOTO mentions the same functionality twice:
* Define the loop such that we fall out if after all the rigamarole, there are no problems.
* Conditions of loop either mean we fall out, or return to Start Point of loop

Also,
* prefer to simplify the discussion by combining all initialization steps (common to both algos) into a single step.
* Similarly, combine all loop body steps (common to both algos) into a single step.

If these points are fixed, both algorithms are of the same subjective complexity.

== Non-local exit considered harmful ==

:&quot;Because the use of a goto needs the declaration of a label, the goto is in fact as twice as readable than the use of return. So if readability is your concern and not a strict &quot;don't use goto&quot; programming rule then you should rather use goto than multiple returns. Best, of course, is the structured approach where neither goto nor multiple returns are needed:&quot;

It's odd to see such an old chestnut from the Structured Programming Wars resurface. The fact is that non-local exits are ''sometimes'' bad, and ''sometimes'' preferable to a morass of if-elses. Consider a C-like language with no exception constructs:
&lt;pre&gt;
        int widgetcontainer_add(container c, widget w) {
            if (w == null) return ERR_NULL_POINTER;
            if (w.chroma &lt; colors.green) return ERR_OFF_COLOR_WIDGET;
            if (c.count &gt;= c.capacity) return ERR_CONTAINER_FULL;

            c.items[c.front++] = w;
            return OK;
        }
&lt;/pre&gt;
The solution here, of course, is &quot;use exceptions, not error codes&quot;, but failing that, multiple returns are a lot more readable than the structured alternative:
&lt;pre&gt;
        int widgetcontainer_add(container c, widget w) {
            int result = OK;
            if (w == null) {
                result = ERR_NULL_POINTER;
            } else if (w.chroma &lt; colors.green) {
                result = ERR_OFF_COLOR_WIDGET;
            } else if (c.count &gt;= c.capacity) {
                result = ERR_CONTAINER_FULL;
            } else {
                c.items[c.front++] = w;
            }
            return result;
        }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here the nature of the checks is completely obscured, as is the &quot;real code&quot;, which is just the last in a long line of alternatives. The reason people promote such code anyway is not readability, but consistency of form, which is actually much of what structured programming is about.

The idea behind restricting (or forbidding) non-local exits is that as the function grows longer, the control flow gets more and more unclear if there are multiple points of exit (&quot;If parameter x is 5, did we exit here or here or here? Does this piece of code ever get executed?&quot;) The &quot;non-structured&quot; answer to this is simply not to use big functions (or methods/blocks/closures/whatever), since they are much more problematic than the control structures you use ''within'' functions will ever be.

A bigger straw man here is claiming that the version with goto is in fact &quot;twice as readable&quot; because a label is involved. Say what? Is the reader supposed to glance over a &quot;return&quot; statement, or something, or forget that &quot;return&quot; exits the function? I don't know what the author was thinking here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Economic policy''' is what a government does to ensure the economy keeps ticking over, and doesn't '''overheat''' or fall into '''recession'''. Look back to the page on [[Macroeconomics/Macroeconomic_objectives| macroeconomic objectives]] to remind yourself of government objectives. This section will go further into the ''reasons'' for government, and ''how'' policy can be applied.

== Reasons for Economic Policy ==
=== Natural Changes in Economic Activity ===
Most economies go through cycles of strong economic growth and recession; it is much debated as to why this happens - arguably as a result of government policies, expectations of such cycles or other reasons. However, &lt;b&gt;negative multiplier effects&lt;/b&gt; can ensure that an economy left to itself would be incapable of getting out of recession. A demonstration of a negative multiplier effect can be seen in areas that have recently suffered increased unemployment. Those recently unemployed will have less disposable income, causing other industries to suffer a fall in demand, resulting potentially in further layoffs of workers. When this happens on a national scale, targetted government spending may be the only way of getting out of this situation.

Secondly, remember that a macroeconomic objective is '''stable and sustainable''' economic growth. Economies, left to themselves, also have a tendency for runaway increases in demand without comparable increases in supply, resulting in high levels of inflation and borrowing and a booming stock market, which will hurt all the more when economic growth slows down.

=== Economic Shocks ===
These are unexpected, sudden changes in the situation of the world economy or domestically. For example, a housing market crash or recently 9/11 are examples where the home/world economy was entirely unprepared. These shocks have an effect on the demand and supply of goods, as a result of changes in consumer confidence, business confidence and expectations of the future. In order for a government to reduce the impact of such blows, it must be able to partially control the demand and supply curves.
''diagrams of SRAS and D-side shocks''

== Application of Economic Policy ==
There are three main method of government macroecnomic intervention in an economy, all of which will be investigated in more detail later in this section (the imbedded links are to wikipedia, the links to the relevant section in the wikibook are in the template on the right):
* [[w:Fiscal policy| Fiscal policy]] - is the use of government spending and taxation as a means of controlling levels of AD, both directly and indirectly
* [[w:Monetary policy| Monetary policy]] - is the use of changing interest rates and the money supply to control the exchange rate, level of borrowing and levels of saving (remember MPC and MPS)
* Supply-side Policies - are a general term for all the other policies the government can employ to aid the level of supply, which is particularly important in increasing the potential output of an economy, and reducing growth-induced inflation

I hope you won't mind my asking you to look at [[Mishnah Sotah 3:1]] (the last mishnah you contributed), to see how links at the top of the mishnah page can be set up. You can simply copy the links on 3:1 for other mishnayot too, and change the numbers. It's easy.

I've also added a &quot;category&quot; for the seder (look at the bottom of 3:1).

It would be wonderful if you logged in, so you could take credit for your translations!

== New discussion ==
''Moved to [[:s:Wikisource talk:Annotations]].''

== Suggested Additions ==
I would like to see the text thats been removed from WB:WIW/Unstable added/incorporated to this policy. Which was:

Annotated texts are guides for helping readers study and understand published literature and other media that includes a copy of the original work within it. For example, Introduction to Shakespeare or Darwin's The Descent of Man. By developing these guides, we are trying to make it easier for students to study such material. Our sister project Wikisource, which collects public domain and freely licensed works that already exist, also allows annotated texts; it is a place of overlap between the two projects.

See Wikibooks:Annotated texts for our complete policy. Briefly there are two main limitations:

# Planned annotated texts with only slim prospects of ever actually becoming annotated may become candidates for deletion.
# Annotated editions of previously published works may only be written if use of the source text does not constitute a copyright infringement. Otherwise, these works are the property of someone else; we should respect their rights and avoid legal trouble. Copyright violations are suitable grounds for speedy deletion.

:Just to know more about it, who removed the text and did he or anyone provide any info on why the removal was performed ?
: On point 1) I disagree, a bare book structures (or plan) is not a valid candidate for deletion, can you extend on that point ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Clarification to text ==

On the main namespace version it says {{cquote|The source text has absolutely no annotations, or the annotation is so minimal that its erasure constitutes no loss of educational material.}} Can I suggest that this has an element of ambiguity, especially where the work itself may be inherently educational material.  I presume that we are meaning the ''loss of (one of) '''additional/annotated/complementary''' educational material.'' [[User:Billinghurst|Billinghurst]] ([[User talk:Billinghurst|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Billinghurst|contribs]]) 14:32, 17 June 2011 (UTC)
:Well, this hasn't been really modified since 2007 and I may be one of the few watching it, but my interpretation is that if a book is just a source text or has worthless annotations that if removed would leave it just as a source text, then it should be moved to Wikisource. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:43, 18 June 2011 (UTC)
:: As I understand the text, the qualification being asked about is already there.  The passage in question is the third of three criteria, all of which must hold at once for the text to be recommended for deletion.  (I've tried to clarify that in the text.)  The second criterion says that if the text is inherently educational, it should probably stay here, as sooner or later someone will want to write annotations.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:59, 18 June 2011 (UTC)

== Wikisource ==

Wikisource is [[s:Wikisource:Requests for comment/Annotation policy discussing their annotation policies]]. I as a Wikisource admin would like to see that Wikibooks and Wikisource cover all the annotated texts that Wikimedia should cover, so I invite people interested in annotated texts to drop by.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Prosfilaes|contribs]]) 19:41, 18 July 2014 (UTC)</text>

== What is an annotated text? ==

An '''annotated text''' contains two elements:
#A copy of a published original [[:w:primary source|primary source]] text or other established narrative, academic or literary media, available under a Wikibooks-compatible license.
#Various kinds of study aids for understanding or teaching the text. These annotations may include introductions, explanatory notes, summaries, translations, questions and answers, charts, lists, indices, references, wikilinks, media, etc.

In an annotated text the annotations are interwoven with the primary source text in order to make the book more reader-friendly. The goal of an annotated text is to facilitate reading and comprehension of the source media, especially in a classroom environment in preparation for formal examinations, or even for private study (for instance, the classic ''Cliff's Notes'' on Shakespeare are meant to help students prepare for examinations on literature that they read at home.) Because annotated texts are a kind of educational material it has been declared as Wikibooks policy to include them. This is despite the fact that most primary source texts normally belong at [[:s:|Wikisource]].

It may also be possible for Wikibookians to annotate other forms of narrative media besides just written texts. For instance, it may be possible to annotate a motion picture, a video game, or a musical song/album. Such cases might be permitted under this policy if they are shown to be academic and well-written.

For guidelines on how to distinguish which texts belong on which project, please see Wikisource's article [[:s:Wikisource:Wikisource and Wikibooks|Wikisource and Wikibooks]]. There are no absolute rules for texts of this kind and any reasonable decision by the contributor(s) should be respected.

== Source texts without annotations ==

A number of source texts have been contributed to Wikibooks over the course of time with the express intention of using them as part of annotated text and a few have actually been annotated to one degree or another. However, little or no annotation has been written for the majority of these texts. Source texts without annotations belong at [[:s:|Wikisource]]. Even some texts with annotations may reasonably be kept at Wikisource, provided that the primary focus is on the source text, not on classroom instruction or test preparation.

In general, the good-faith intentions and work of a contributor who added an important source text to Wikibooks should be honored. This is true even if its takes a very long time until annotations are written. Nevertheless, these texts are really more appropriate for Wikisource than for Wikibooks. Therefore, they may become candidates for deletion if and when the following criteria are all met:

*The source text also exists in the same format at Wikisource.
*The source text is not a text widely used in classrooms for which there will clearly be a need for future annotations and interest in writing them.
**For an example that does '''not''' meet this criterion, take the works of Shakespeare. These are central classroom texts and cultural icons. Thus there is a clear demand for annotations of them, and there are clearly people who will be interested in writing them at some point. Therefore, the copies of these texts might as well be left at Wikibooks, even though they also exist at Wikisource.
*The source text has absolutely no annotations, or the annotation is so minimal that its erasure constitutes no loss of educational material.

When all of the above criteria are met, a book may become a candidate for deletion.

It should also be noted that Wikibooks is a multilingual project. A text here at English Wikibooks may also be part of a larger multilingual annotation project. If annotations to a book are proceeding in another language, and the passages are linked, then the English version should be kept even if it has no annotations. For example, if Shakespeare is being annotated in German, then the German contributors should be able to simply put an &quot;en:&quot; link to connect to the original English version of each unit of text. They should not be forced to link to the Wikisource version just because there is very little annotation yet in English.

== Creating an annotated text ==

In general, break your text into user-friendly sections (e.g. chapters), each of which must be linked to and from the title page using the standard  [[WB:NP|naming convention]].

If you want to start annotating a large text, there is no need to add the entire source text immediately at the beginning. Instead, start by copying and annotating a limited initial portion of the text. Later sections can be added to Wikibooks at a future date when the annotation is already substantial. By implementing this suggestion you can maintain a reasonable balance between the source text and your annotations at all stages of the project from beginning to end.

When you start a Wikibooks project to annotate a text, please list the main title page in the following place:
*[[Subject:Literature]] - The related subjects cover texts of different genres.  Please list your book in its respective genre(s) by adding it to the subject category of the same name using {{tl|subjects}}.

== Other relevant pages ==
*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#A repository for source texts|Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]
*[[s:Wikisource:Annotations|Wikisource:Annotations]]

| Pat was confused.  Choosing a college to attend was an important decision with life-long implications, but it was difficult to know which school was the right one to attend.  Pat had applied to and been accepted by several schools, but now was the time to make a commitment.  Pat sought out information from various sources to help make the choice, but received different answers.  Pat’s parents thought the best choice was to attend the school closest to their home.  It was inexpensive and Pat could save money by living at home.  Pat’s best friend wanted both of them to attend the same school where they could be roommates, while Pat’s grandparents thought attending college at all was pretty much a waste of time and money.  

In spite of these conflicts, Pat continued to think about the recommendations mentioned in an article written by a social scientist, who had carefully examined the life trajectories of large numbers of people who had graduated from various colleges across the U.S.  Those recommendations were again completely different than those made by friends and family.  With all this different information, how could Pat make the right choice?

==Introduction==
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the methods employed by sociologists in their study of social life.  This is not a chapter on statistics nor does it detail specific methods in sociological investigation.  The primary aim is to illustrate how sociologists go beyond common sense understandings in trying to explain or understand social phenomena.They do not see the world as we normally do, they question and analyze why things happen and if there is a way to stop a problem before it happens.

At issue in this chapter are the methods used by sociologists to claim to speak authoritatively about social life.  There are dozens of different ways that human beings claim to acquire knowledge.  A few common examples are:

&lt;u&gt;Authority&lt;/u&gt;:  Choosing to trust another source for information is the act of making that source an authority in your life.  Parents, friends, the media, religious leaders, your professor, books, or web pages are all examples of secondary sources of information that some people trust for information.

&lt;u&gt;Experience&lt;/u&gt;:  People often claim to have learned something through an experience, such as a car accident or using some type of drug.  Some physical skills, such as waterskiing or playing basketball, are acquired primarily through experience.  On the other hand, some experiences are subjective and are not generalizable to all.  

&lt;u&gt;Logic&lt;/u&gt;:  Simple deduction is often used to discern truth from falsity and is the primary way of knowing used in philosophy.  I might suggest that if I fall in a swimming pool full of water, I will get wet.  If that premise is true and I fall in a swimming pool, you could deduce that I got wet.  

&lt;u&gt;Tradition&lt;/u&gt;:  Many people who live in societies that have not experienced industrialization decide what to do in the future by repeating what was done in the past.  Even in modern societies, many people get satisfaction out of celebrating holidays the same way year after year.  Fast-paced change in modern societies, however, makes traditional knowledge less and less helpful in making good choices.

&lt;u&gt;Revelation&lt;/u&gt;:  Some people claim to acquire knowledge believed to be valid by consulting religious texts and believing what is written in them, such as the Torah, the Bible, the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, or the Book of Mormon.  Others claim to receive revelations from a higher power in the form of voices or a general intuitive sense of what one should do.

&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;:  The scientific method combines the use of logic with ''controlled'' experience, creating a novel way of discovery that marries sensory input with careful thinking.  By adopting a model of cause and effect, scientists produce knowledge that can explain certain phenomena and even predict various outcomes before they occur.

These methods of claiming to know certain things are referred to as epistemologies.  An [[w:epistemology|epistemology]] is simply a way of knowing.  In Sociology, information gathered through science is privileged over all others.  That is, information gleaned using other epistemologies will be rejected if it is not supported by evidence gathered using the scientific method.

==The Scientific Method==
A scientific method or process is considered fundamental to the scientific investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon verifiable evidence. In addition to employing the scientific method in their research, sociologists explore the social world with several different purposes in mind.  Like the physical sciences (i.e., chemistry, physics, etc.), sociologists can be and often are interested in predicting outcomes given knowledge of the variables and relationships involved.  This approach to ''doing science'' is often termed ''[[w:positivism|positivism]]'' (though perhaps more accurately should be called ''[[w:empiricism|empiricism]]'').  The positivist approach to social science seeks to explain and predict social phenomena, often employing a quantitative approach where aspects of social life are assigned numerical codes and subjected to in-depth analyses to uncover trends often missed by a casual observer.  This approach most often makes use of [[w:Deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]], which initially forms a theory and hypothesis, which are then subjected to empirical testing.

Unlike the physical sciences, sociology (and other social sciences, like [[w:anthropology|anthropology]]) also often seek simply to ''understand'' social phenomena.  Max Weber labeled this approach ''[[w:Verstehen|Verstehen]]'', which is German for understanding.  This approach, called qualitative sociology, aims to understand a [[w:culture|culture]] or phenomenon on its own terms rather than trying to develop a theory that allows for prediction.  Qualitative sociologists more frequently use [[w:Inductive reasoning|inductive reasoning]] where an investigator will take time to make repeated observations of the phenomena under study, with the hope of coming to a thorough and grounded understanding of what is really going on.

Both approaches employ a scientific method as they make observations and gather data, propose hypotheses, and test or refine their hypotheses in the formulation of theories.  These steps are outlined in more detail below.

Sociologists use observations, hypotheses, deductions, and inductions to understand and ultimately develop explanations for social phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested. If a prediction turns out to be correct, the theory survives. If not, the theory is modified or discarded.  The method is commonly taken as the underlying logic of scientific practice. Science is essentially an extremely cautious means of building a supportable, evidenced understanding of our natural and social worlds.

The essential elements of a scientific method are iterations and recursions of the following four steps:

# Characterization (operationalization or quantification, observation and / or measurement)
# Hypothesis (a theoretical, hypothetical explanation of the observations and / or measurements)
# Prediction (logical deduction from the hypothesis or logical induction from the data)
# Testing (informing the validity of the hypothesis by comparing it against carefully gathered, meaningful sensory input)

===Characterization===
A scientific method depends upon a careful characterization of the subject of the investigation. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subject, this careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations; the observation often demands careful categorization, measurement and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements, counts or categorical distinctions of relevant quantities or qualities is often the critical difference between [[w:pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences,]] such as [[w:alchemy|alchemy]], and a science, such as [[w:chemistry|chemistry]]. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[w:correlation|correlation]] and [[w:regression|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as human populations. The measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers, spectroscopes, or voltmeters, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and development.  In a similar fashion, categorical distinctions are often outlined, graphed and / or arranged in relation to the variation of qualities found within and between natural settings (mostly) free of manipulation.  These categorical distinctions generally require specialized coding or sorting protocols that allow differential qualities to be sorted into distinct categories, which may be compared and contrasted over time, and the progress of scientific fields in this vein are generally tied to the accumulation of systematic categories and observations across multiple natural sites.  In both cases, scientific progress relies upon ongoing intermingling between measurement and categorical approaches to data analysis.  

Measurements demand the use of ''operational definitions'' of relevant quantities (a.k.a. ''[[w:operationalization|operationalization]]''). That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or ''idealized'' definition. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of ''mass'' ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a certain kilogram of platinum kept in a laboratory in France.  In short, to operationalize a variable means creating an operational definition for a concept someone intends to measure.  Similarly, categorical distinctions rely upon the use of previously observed categorizations.  A scientific category is thus described or defined based upon existing information gained from prior observations and patterns in the natural world as opposed to socially constructed &quot;measurements&quot; and &quot;standards&quot; in order to capture potential missing pieces in the logic and definitions of previous studies.  In short, to categorize observed patterns scientists must initially reject and / or critique existing operational definitions and standards.  In both cases, however, how this is done is very important as it should be done with enough precision that independent researchers should be able to use your description of your measurement or construction of categories, and repeat either or both. 

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage. For example, ''sex'' and ''gender'' are often used interchangeably in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in sociology. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work while scientific categorizations are generally characterized by their shared qualities which can later be described in terms of conventional linguistic patterns of communication.

Measurements and categorizations in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty or disclaimers concerning the scope of initial observations. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities that are used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to limitations of the method used. Counts may only represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken (see the [[w:central limit theorem|central limit theorem]]).  Similarly, the scope of initial observations may be recorded via count and / or qualitative assessments of the nature and method of previous studies, which allows researchers to expand and / or replicate categorizations dependent upon and contextualized via a specific scope of observational data.

===Hypothesis Development===
A hypothesis includes a suggested explanation of the subject. In quantitative work, it will generally provide a causal explanation or propose some association between two variables.  If the hypothesis is a causal explanation, it will involve at least one ''[[w:dependent variable|dependent variable]]'' and one ''[[w:independent variable|independent variable]]''.  In qualitative work, hypotheses generally involve potential assumptions built into existing causal statements, which may be examined in a natural setting.  

Variables are measurable phenomena whose values or qualities can change (e.g., class status can range from lower- to upper-class). A dependent variable is a [[w:variable (social science)|variable]] whose values or qualities are presumed to change as a result of the independent variable.  In other words, the value or quality of a dependent variable ''depends'' on the value of the independent variable.  Of course, this assumes that there is an actual relationship between the two variables.  If there is no relationship, then the value or quality of the ''dependent variable'' does not depend on the value of the independent variable.  An ''independent variable'' is a variable whose value or quality is manipulated by the experimenter (or, in the case of non-experimental analysis, changes in the society and is measured or observed systematically). Perhaps an example will help clarify.  In a study of the influence of gender (as a value) on promotion, the independent variable would be gender/sex.  Promotion would be the dependent variable.  Change in promotion is hypothesized to be dependent on gender.  Similarly, in a study of gender's (as a quality) relation to promotion, the independent variables are gender/sex and promotion, and the dependent variable is the way people use, discuss, and / or make sense of both sex/gender and promotion in their ongoing activities or narratives.   

Scientists use whatever they can — their own creativity, ideas from other fields, induction, deduction, systematic guessing, etc. — to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. There are no definitive guidelines for the production of new hypotheses. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a ''flash of inspiration'', or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support, refute, or refine their idea or develop an entirely new framework.

===Prediction===
A useful quantitative hypothesis will enable predictions, by deductive reasoning, that can be experimentally assessed. If results contradict the predictions, then the hypothesis under examination is incorrect or incomplete and requires either revision or abandonment. If results confirm the predictions, then the hypothesis might be correct but is still subject to further testing. Predictions refer to experimental designs with a currently unknown outcome. A prediction (of an unknown) differs from a consequence (which can already be known).  On the other hand, a useful qualitative hypothesis will enable question or critique, by inductive reasoning, of existing and / or taken-for-granted beliefs, assumptions, and theories developed within or beyond scientific settings.  

===Testing===
Once a prediction is made, a method is designed to test or critique it. The investigator may seek either confirmation or falsification of the hypothesis, and refinement or understanding of the data. Though a variety of methods are used by both natural and social scientists, laboratory experiments remain one of the most respected methods by which to test hypotheses.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and providing evidence of the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results. 

[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|thumb|200px|right|This is a diagram of the famous [[w:Milgram Experiment|Milgram Experiment]] which explored [[w:obedience|obedience]] and [[w:authority|authority]] in light of the crimes committed by the Nazis in World War II.]]

The experiment's integrity should be ascertained by the introduction of a control or by observation of existing controls in natural settings. In experiments where controls are observed rather than introduced, researchers take into account potential variables (e.g., the demographics of the sample and researchers as well as the behaviors of both groups) that could influence the findings without intention.  On the other hand, in experiments where a control is introduced, two virtually identical experiments are run, in only one of which the factor being tested is varied. This serves to further isolate any causal phenomena. For example in testing a drug it is important to carefully test that the supposed effect of the drug is produced only by the drug. Doctors may do this with a double-blind study: two virtually identical groups of patients are compared, one of which receives the drug and one of which receives a [[w:placebo|placebo]]. Neither the patients nor the doctor know who is getting the real drug, isolating its effects.  This type of experiment is often referred to as a ''[[w:experiment|true experiment]]'' because of its design.  It is contrasted with alternative forms below.

Once an experiment is complete, a researcher determines whether the results (or data) gathered are what was predicted or assumed in the literature beforehand. If the experimental conclusions fail to match the predictions/hypothesis and / or existing scientific arguments, then one returns to the failed hypothesis and re-iterates the process - modifying one's theory or developing a new one - or attempts to publish the results as a suggestion for gaps in existing theories or findings. If the experiment appears ''successful'' - i.e. fits the hypothesis and existing scientific arguments - the experimenter often will attempt to publish the results so that others (in theory) may reproduce the same experimental results, verifying the findings and / or the existing scientific narrative of the time in the process.

An experiment is not an absolute requirement. In observation based fields of science actual experiments must be designed differently than for the classical laboratory based sciences. Sociologists are more likely to employ quasi-experimental designs where data are collected from people by surveys or interviews, but statistical means are used to create groups that can be compared.  For instance, in examining the effects of gender on promotions, sociologists may ''control'' for the effects of social class as this variable will likely influence the relationship.  Unlike a ''true experiment'' where these variables are held constant in a laboratory setting, quantitative sociologists use statistical methods to hold constant social class (or, better stated, partial out the variance accounted for by social class) so they can see the relationship between gender and promotions without the interference of social class.  

The four components of research described above are integrated into the following steps of the research process.

#&lt;u&gt;Define the topic/problem&lt;/u&gt;:  Identify your topic of interest and develop a research question in the form of a cause-and-effect relationship.
#&lt;u&gt;Conduct a review of the literature&lt;/u&gt;:  Access studies that have already been performed by other researchers and published in peer-reviewed journals.  You'll find out what is already known about the topic and where more research is needed.
#&lt;u&gt;Formulate a hypothesis&lt;/u&gt;:  Refine your research question in a way that will add new information to the existing research literature, expressing it in the form of a testable research hypothesis.  This includes identifying two or more variables and articulating how one variable is thought to influence the other.
#&lt;u&gt;Design the research&lt;/u&gt;:  Decide on a way to approach data collection that will provide a meaningful test of the research hypothesis.  Some designs include data collection at only one point in time, but more complex questions require data gathering over time and with different groups of people.
#&lt;u&gt;Select a research method&lt;/u&gt;:  Once a design has been established, one or more actual data gathering strategies will need to be identified.  Each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, so sociologists are increasingly incorporating mixed-methods approaches in their research designs to enrich their knowledge of the topic.  Some of the more popular research methods used by sociologists are:  Surveys or Interviews, Experiments, Unobtrusive measures, and Participant Observation or Field Research
#&lt;u&gt;Operationalize variables&lt;/u&gt;:  Operationalizing means deciding exactly how each variable of interest will be measured.  In survey research, this means deciding on the exact wording of the question or questions used to measure each variable, a listing of all possible responses to closed-ended questions, and a decision as to how to compute variables using multiple indicators.
#&lt;u&gt;Identify the population and draw a sample&lt;/u&gt;:  A population is the group a researcher is interested in learning about.  Is it all students at one particular University?  All residents of the United States?  All nonprofit organizations in a particular city?  Because it is frequently too expensive to try to collect data from all units in a population, a sample of those units is often selected.  Samples that use principles of random selection, where every unit in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample, have the best chance of reflecting the views and behaviors of the entire population of focus.
#&lt;u&gt;Collect the data&lt;/u&gt;:  Data collection must be systematic and rigorous so that procedural mistakes do not create artificial results.
#&lt;u&gt;Analyze the results&lt;/u&gt;:  Powerful statistical packages today make data analysis easier than it has ever been.  Still, great care needs to be taken to accurately code the data (i.e. transpose responses into numbers), enter it into the computer, and to choose the appropriate statistics to be calculated for analysis.
#&lt;u&gt;Reporting the Results&lt;/u&gt;:  Research results are shared with the larger community through presentations, reports, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  This allows others to consider the findings, the methods used, and any limitations of the study.

Qualitative sociologists generally employ observational and analytic techniques that allow them to contextualize observed patterns in relation to existing hierarchies or assumptions within natural settings.  Using an earlier example, qualitative sociologists examining the experience of gender and promotion may ascertain the existing beliefs about gender and about promotion by the people being studied, official documentation outlining the rules of promotion and / or policies concerning gender within the setting, and variations in the ways people occupying different racial, classed, gendered, sexual, religious, or aged social locations interpret and make sense of both gender and promotion.  Since variables (such as social class) cannot be &quot;held constant&quot; or &quot;controlled for&quot; in natural settings, qualitative sociologists explore the potential influence of these factors on actual behaviors in order to refine existing mathematical and / or experimental theories containing assumptions and controls unavailable beyond the laboratory or mathematical software.  Thus, while the ''true experiment'' is ideally suited for the performance of quantitative science, especially because it is the best quantitative method for deriving ''causal relationships'', other methods of ''hypothesis testing'' are commonly employed in the social sciences, and qualitative methods of critique and analysis are utilized to fact check the assumptions and theories created upon the basis of &quot;controlled&quot; (rather than natural) circumstances.

===Evaluation and Iteration===
The scientific process is iterative. At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. For instance, failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject.  Similarly, advances in qualitative research generally lead to reformulation of quantitative and experimental techniques and assumptions (this relationship also occurs regularly in the other direction where findings from quantitative studies direct qualitative attention to new areas and / or potential relationships).  

It is also important to note that science is a social enterprise, and scientific work will become accepted by the community only if it can be verified and it &quot;makes sense&quot; within existing scientific beliefs and assumptions about the world (when new findings complicate these assumptions and beliefs, we generally witness paradigm shifts in science&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhn2012&quot;&gt;Kuhn, Thomas S.  2012.  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 50th Anniversary, 4th Edition.  Chicago, Illinois:  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Crucially, experimental and quantitative results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community while qualitative studies are designed to complicate, advance, and / or call into question these results. All scientific knowledge is in a state of flux, for at any time new evidence could be presented that contradicts a long-held hypothesis, and new perspectives (e.g., the entrance of minority communities into the academy in the past 50 years) may emerge that call existing scientific techniques, assumptions, and beliefs into question. For this reason, scientific journals use a process of [[w:peer review|peer review]], in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three) fellow (usually anonymous) scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. The referees may or may not recommend publication, publication with suggested modifications, or, sometimes, publication in another journal. This serves to keep the scientific literature free of unscientific work, helps to cut down on obvious errors, and generally otherwise improves the quality and consistency of the scientific literature, but may also lead to the silencing or delay of new and / or controversial scientific findings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moghissi2010&quot;&gt;Moghissi, A. Alan. 2010. “Peer Review and Scientific Assessment.” Technology &amp; Innovation 12:187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; Work announced in the popular press before going through this process is generally frowned upon. Sometimes peer review inhibits the circulation of unorthodox work, and at other times may be too permissive. The peer review process is not always successful, but has been very widely adopted by the scientific community.

The ''[[w:reproducibility|reproducibility]]'' or replication of quantitative scientific observations, while usually described as being very important in a scientific method, is actually seldom reported, and is in reality often not done. Referees and editors often reject papers purporting only to reproduce some observations as being unoriginal and not containing anything new. Occasionally reports of a failure to reproduce results are published - mostly in cases where controversy exists or a suspicion of fraud develops. The threat of failure to replicate by others (as well as the ongoing qualitative enterprise designed to explore the veracity of quantitative findings in non-controlled settings), however, serves as a very effective deterrent for most quantitative scientists, who will usually replicate their own data several times before attempting to publish.

Sometimes useful observations or phenomena themselves cannot be reproduced (in fact, this is almost always the case in qualitative science spanning physical and social science disciplines). They may be rare, or even unique events. Reproducibility of quantitative observations and replication of experiments is not a guarantee that they are correct or properly understood. Errors can all too often creep into more than one laboratory or pattern of interpretation (mathematical or qualitative) utilized by scientists.  As a result, science itself is an ongoing dialogue and debate wherein each finding (new or old) is continuously subject to new testing and / or critique.

==Correlation and Causation==
[[File:Correlation vs causation.png|thumb|250px|right|This diagram illustrates the difference between correlation and causation, as ice cream consumption is correlated with crime, but both are dependent on temperature.  Thus, the correlation between ice cream consumption and crime is spurious.]]

In the scientific pursuit of quantitative prediction and explanation, two relationships between variables are often confused: [[w:correlation|correlation]] and [[w:causation|causation]].  While these terms are rarely used in qualitative science, they lie at the heart of quantitative methods, and thus constitute a cornerstone of scientific practice.  Correlation refers to a relationship between two (or more) variables in which they change together.  A correlation can be positive/direct or negative/inverse.  A positive correlation means that as one variable increases (e.g., ice cream consumption) the other variable also increases (e.g., crime).  A negative correlation is just the opposite; as one variable increases (e.g., [[w:socioeconomic|socioeconomic status]]), the other variable decreases (e.g., [[w:infant mortality rate|infant mortality rates]]).

Causation refers to a relationship between two (or more) variables where one variable causes the other.  In order for a variable to cause another, it must meet the following three criteria:
* the variables must be correlated
* change in the independent variable must precede change in the dependent variable in time
* it must be shown that a different (third) variable is not causing the change in the two variables of interest (a.k.a., ''[[w:spurious|spurious correlation]]'')

An example may help explain the difference. Ice cream consumption is positively correlated with incidents of crime.  

Employing the quantitative method outlined above, the reader should immediately question this relationship and attempt to discover an explanation. It is at this point that a simple yet noteworthy phrase should be introduced: ''correlation is not causation''.  If you look back at the three criteria of causation above, you will notice that the relationship between ice cream consumption and crime meets only one of the three criteria (they change together).  The real explanation of this relationship is the introduction of a third variable: temperature.  Ice cream consumption and crime increase during the summer months.  Thus, while these two variables are correlated, ice cream consumption does not cause crime or vice versa.  Both variables increase due to the increasing temperatures during the summer months.

It is important to not confound a correlation with a cause/effect relationship.  It is often the case that correlations between variables are found but the relationship turns out to be spurious.  Clearly understanding the relationship between variables is an important element of the quantitative scientific process.

==Quantitative and Qualitative==
Like the distinction drawn between ''positivist'' sociology and ''Verstehen'' sociology, there is - as noted above in the elaboration of general scientific methods - often a distinction drawn between two types of sociological investigation: ''quantitative'' and ''qualitative''.  

[[w:Quantitative method|Quantitative methods]] of sociological research approach social phenomena from the perspective that they can be measured and/or ''quantified''.  For instance, social class, following the quantitative approach, can be divided into different groups - upper-, middle-, and lower-class - and can be measured using any of a number of variables or a combination thereof: income, educational attainment, prestige, power, etc. Quantitative sociologists also utilize mathematical models capable of organizing social experiences into a rational order that may provide a necessary foundation for more in depth analyses of the natural world (importantly, this element of quantitative research often provides the initial or potential insights that guide much theoretical and qualitative analyses of patterns observed - numerically or otherwise - beyond the confines of mathematical models).  Quantitative sociologists tend to use specific methods of data collection and hypothesis testing, including: [[w:experiment|experimental designs]], [[w:survey|surveys]], [[w:secondary data analysis|secondary data analysis]], and [[w:statistics|statistical analysis]].  Further, quantitative sociologists typically believe in the possibility of scientifically demonstrating causation, and typically utilize analytic deduction (e.g., explore existing findings and deduce potential hypotheses that may be tested in new data).  Finally, quantitative sociologists generally attempt to utilize mathematical realities (e.g., existing assumptions and rules embedded within statistical practices) to make sense of natural (e.g., the experience of the actual worlds of people) realities.  

[[w:Qualitative method|Qualitative methods]] of sociological research tend to approach social phenomena from the ''Verstehen'' perspective.  Rather than attempting to measure or quantify reality via mathematical rules, qualitative sociologists explore variation in the natural world people may see, touch, and experience during their lives.  As such, these methods are primarily used to (a) develop a deeper understanding of a particular phenomenon, (b) explore the accuracy or inaccuracy of mathematical models in the world people experience, (c) critique and question the existing assumptions and beliefs of both scientists and other social beings, and (d) refine measurements and controls used by quantitative scientists via insights gleaned from the experiences of actual people.  While qualitative methods may be used to propose or explore relationships between variables, these studies typically focus on explicating the realities people experience that lie at the heart or foundation of such relationships rather than focusing on the relationships themselves.  Qualitatively oriented sociologists tend to employ different methods of data collection and analysis, including: [[w:participant observation|participant observation]], [[w:interview|interviews]], [[w:focus group|focus groups]], [[w:content analysis|content analysis]], [[w:visual sociology|visual sociology]], and [[w:historical comparison|historical comparison]].  Further, qualitative sociologists typically reject measurement or quantities (essential to quantitative approaches) and the notion or belief in causality (e.g., qualitative sociologists generally argue that since there is no demonstrated possibility of ever exploring all potential variables or influences in one study, causality is always incomplete and beyond empirical means).  Finally, qualitative sociologists generally attempt to utilize natural realities (e.g., the experience of the actual worlds of people) to make sense of these natural realities and complicate mathematical assumptions and rules that may lead scientists into misguided findings that lack applicability to the actual worlds people inhabit.  

While there are sociologists who employ and encourage the use of only one or the other method, many sociologists see benefits in combining the approaches. They view quantitative and qualitative approaches as complementary. Results from one approach can fill gaps in the other approach. For example, quantitative methods could describe large or general patterns in society while qualitative approaches could help to explain how individuals understand those patterns.  Similarly, qualitative patterns in society can reveal missing pieces in the mathematical models of quantitative research while quantitative patterns in society can guide more in-depth analysis of actual patterns in natural settings.  In fact, it is useful to note that many of the major advancements in social science have emerged in response to the combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques that collectively created a more systematic picture of probable and actual social conditions and experiences.

==Objective vs. Critical vs. Subjective==
Sociologists, like all humans, have values, beliefs, and even pre-conceived notions of what they might find in doing their research. Because sociologists are not immune to the desire to change the world, two approaches to sociological investigation have emerged.  By far the most common is the ''objective'' approach advocated by Max Weber.  Weber recognized that social scientists have opinions, but argued against the expression of non-professional or non-scientific opinions in the classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1946&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1946. Science As Vocation. Gerth, H. H. and Mills, C. Wright, Editors and Translators. From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology. New York: Oxford University Press; pp. 129-156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weber took this position for several reasons, but the primary one outlined in his discussion of ''Science as Vocation'' is that he believed it is not right for a person in a position of authority (a professor) to force his/her students to accept his/her opinions in order for them to pass the class.  Weber did argue that it was acceptable for social scientists to express their opinions outside of the classroom and advocated for social scientists to be involved in politics and other social activism.  The ''objective'' approach to social science remains popular in sociological research and refereed journals because it refuses to engage social issues at the level of opinions and instead focuses intently on data and theories.

The ''objective'' approach is contrasted with the ''critical'' approach, which has its roots in Karl Marx's work on economic structures.  Anyone familiar with Marxist theory will recognize that Marx went beyond describing society to advocating for change.  Marx disliked capitalism and his analysis of that economic system included the call for change.  This approach to sociology is often referred to today as ''critical'' sociology (see also ''[[w:action research|action research]]'').  Some sociological journals focus on critical sociology and some sociological approaches are inherently critical (e.g., feminism, black feminist thought).  

Building on these early insights, the rise of Feminist methods and theories in the 1970's ushered in an ongoing debate concerning critical versus objective realities.  Drawing on early Feminist writings by social advocates including but not limited to [[w: Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[w: Alice Paul|Alice Paul]], [[w: Ida Wells Barnett|Ida Wells Barnett]], [[w: Betty Friedan|Betty Friedan]], and sociological theorists including but not limited to [[w: Dorothy Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[w: Joan Acker|Joan Acker]], and [[w: Patricia Yancey Martin|Patricia Yancey Martin]], Feminist sociologists critiqued &quot;objective&quot; traditions as unrealistic and unscientific in practice.  Specifically, they - along with critical theorists like [[w: Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault]], [[w: bell hooks|bell hooks]], and [[w: Patricia Hill Collins|Patricia Hill Collins]] - argued that since all science was conducted and all data was interpreted by human beings and all human beings have beliefs, values, and biases that they are often unaware of and that shape their perception of reality (see [[w: The Social Construction of Reality|The Social Construction of Reality]]), objectivity only existed within the beliefs and values of the people that claimed it.  Stated another way, since human beings are responsible for scientific knowledge despite the fact that human beings cannot be aware of all the potential biases, beliefs, and values they use to do their science, select their topics, construct measurements, and interpret data, &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;value free&quot; science are not possible.  Rather, these theorists argued that the &quot;personal is political&quot; (e.g., our personal decisions - no matter how small - are ultimately influenced by the political context of our lives and ultimately will shape the personal and political realities of others whether or not we are aware of these consequences).  As a result, every scientist - regardless of their intentions and / or awareness - may seek to follow Weber's advice concerning objective teaching and research, but must also remain aware that they will ultimately fail to achieve this ideal.  Whether or not scientists explicitly invoke their personal opinions in their teaching and research, every decision scientists make will ultimately rely upon - and thus demonstrate to varying degrees - their subjective realities.  As a result, current debates typically center around objective (an ideal) versus subjective (data-based) interpretations of science while scholars continue to debate the merits and limitations of subjective/objective versus critical approaches.     

Some examples of the subjective basis of both &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;critical&quot; sociology may illustrate the point.  First, we may examine the research process for both objective and critical sociologists while paying attention to the many decisions people must make to engage in any study from either perspective.  These decisions include:

* The selection of a research topic (this selection reveals something the author believes is important whether or not it is)
* The selection of data (this selection reveals data the author believes is reliable whether or not it is)
*  If the researcher decides to collect their own data, then they must:
** Decide where to collect data
** Decide who to collect data from 
** Decide what questions to ask (which ones they believe will answer the question) and how to ask these questions (which forms of talk they believe are best for getting the answers they want)
** Decide how much data to collect
** Decide how to analyze the data collected (if mathematically, which protocols will be used and which software program, and if qualitatively which themes will ze look for and / or what software program)
** Decide how to measure or categorize the data (if mathematically, what set of parameters counts as a good measure, and if qualitatively what must a category contain)
** Decide how to interpret the measurements or categories (if mathematically, what exactly do the numbers mean socially, and if qualitatively what do the categories say about society)
** Decide how to discuss the interpretation (which theories should be used and which ones should be ignored)
* If the researcher decides to use secondary data, this becomes even more complicated.  While they will have to do the final four items listed above, they must also:
** Trust that the data collection occurred properly
** Trust that the data was organized properly
** Trust that the questions were answered properly
** Trust that the sample is appropriate

As you can see above, the research process itself is full of decisions that each researcher must make.  As a result, researchers themselves have no opportunity to conduct objective studies because doing research requires them to use their personal experiences and opinions (whether these arise from personal life, the advice of the people that taught them research methods, or the books they have read that were ultimately subject to the same subjective processes) throughout the process.  As a result, researchers can - as Feminists have long argued - attempt to be as objective as possible, but never actually hope to reach objectivity.  This same problem arises in Weber's initial description of teaching.  For someone to teach any course, for example, they must make a series of decisions including but not limited to:

* Deciding what subjects to cover within the overall course
* Deciding which readings to use to convey information 
* Deciding what measures of learning will be used and what measures will be left out of the course
* Deciding what counts as an appropriate or inappropriate answer on any and all measures used in the course

As a result, Weber's objectivity dissolves before the teacher ever enters the classroom.  Whether or not the teacher (or researcher) explicitly takes a political, religious, or social stance, he or she will ultimately demonstrate personal stances, beliefs, values, and biases implicitly throughout the course.  

Although the recognition of all science as ultimately subjective to varying degrees is fairly well established at this point, the question of whether or not scientists should embrace this subjectivity remains an open one (e.g., to be or not to be political in classrooms and research projects).  Further, there are many scientists (in sociology and other sciences) that still cling to beliefs about objectivity, and thus promote this belief (political in and of itself) in their teaching, research, and peer review.  As a result, the debate within the field continues without resolution, and will likely be an important part of scientific knowledge and scholarship for some time to come.

==Ethics==
Ethical considerations are of particular importance to sociologists because of the subject of investigation - people.  Because ethical considerations are of so much importance, sociologists adhere to a rigorous set of ethical guidelines.  The most important ethical consideration of sociological research is that participants in sociological investigation are not harmed.  While exactly what this entails can vary from study to study, there are several universally recognized considerations.  For instance, research on children and youth always requires parental consent.  Research on adults also requires ''[[w:informed consent|informed consent]]'' and participants are never forced to participate.  ''[[w:Confidentiality|Confidentiality]]'' and ''[[w:anonymity|anonymity]]'' are two additional practices that ensure the safety of participants when sensitive information is provided (e.g., sexuality, income, etc.). To ensure the safety of participants, most universities maintain an ''[[w:institutional review board|institutional review board]]'' (IRB) that reviews studies that include human participants and ensures ethical rigor.

It has not always been the case that scientists interested in studying humans have followed ethical principles in their research.  Several studies that, when brought to light, led to the introduction of ethical principles guiding human subjects research and [[w:Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] to ensure compliance with those principles, are worth noting, including the [[w:Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], in which 399 impoverished black men with [[w:syphilis|syphilis]] were left untreated to track the progress of the disease and [[w:Nazi human experimentation|Nazi experimentation on humans]].  A recent paper by Susan M. Reverby &lt;ref name=&quot;Reverby2011&quot;&gt;Reverby, Susan M. 2011. &quot;Normal Exposure&quot; and Inoculation Syphilis: A PHS &quot;Tuskegee&quot; Doctor in Guatemala, 1946-48. Journal of Policy History.&lt;/ref&gt; found that such unethical experiments were more widespread than just the widely known Tuskegee study and that the US Government funded a study in which thousands of Guatemalan prisoners were infected with syphilis to determine whether they could be cured with penicillin.  Ethical oversight in science is designed to prevent such egregious violations of human rights today.

Sociologists also have professional ethical principles they follow.  Obviously honesty in research, analysis, and publication is important.  Sociologists who manipulate their data are ostracized and can have their memberships in professional organizations revoked.  [[w:Conflict of interest|Conflicts of interest]] are also frowned upon.  A conflict of interest can occur when a sociologist is given funding to conduct research on an issue that relates to the source of the funds.  For example, if Microsoft were to fund a sociologist to investigate whether users of Microsoft's product users are happier than users of [[w:open source|open source]] software (e.g., [[w:Linux|Linux]], [[w:LibreOffice|LibreOffice]]), the sociologist would need to disclose the source of the funding as it presents a significant conflict of interest.  Unfortunately, this does not always happen, as several high profile cases illustrate (e.g., [http://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2013/08/06/regnerus-affair-timeline-with-maze/ the Regnerus Affair]).  But the disclosure of conflicts of interest is  recommended by most professional organizations and many academic journals. A comprehensive explanation of sociological guidelines is provided on the website of the [http://www.asanet.org/about/ethics.cfm American Sociological Association].

==What Can Sociology Tell Us?==
Having discussed the sociological approach to understanding society, it is worth noting the limitations of sociology.  Because of the subject of investigation (society), sociology runs into a number of problems that have significant implications for this field of inquiry:
* human behavior is complex, making prediction - especially at the individual level - difficult or even impossible
* the presence of researchers can affect the phenomenon being studied ([[w:Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Effect]])
* society is constantly changing, making it difficult for sociologists to maintain current understandings; in fact, society might even change as a result of sociological investigation (for instance, sociologists testified in the [[w:Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education]] decision to integrate schools)
* it is difficult for sociologists to strive for objectivity and handle the subjective components of scientific practice - especially when the phenomena they study is also part of their social life

While it is important to recognize the limitations of sociology, sociology's contributions to our understanding of society have been significant and continue to provide useful theories and tools for understanding humans as social beings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic premise of conflict theory is that individuals and groups in society struggle to maximize their share of the limited resources that exist and are desired by humans.  Given that there are limited resources, the struggle inevitably leads to conflict and competition.  These struggles can lead to changes in institutions and societies as different groups come into power. 

==Detailed Description==
--[[Special:Contributions/165.155.200.66|165.155.200.66]] ([[User talk:165.155.200.66|discuss]]) 19:58, 11 February 2013 (UTC)===Theoretical Assumptions===
Assumptions are taken for granted statements about reality that theories drawn upon as their foundation.  Following are some of assumptions of modern conflict theory:&lt;ref name=&quot;Plunkett&quot;&gt;[Plunkett, Scott, and Scott Williams. n.d. “CONFLICT THEORY.” Retrieved April 19, 2011 (http://www.csun.edu/~whw2380/542/Conflict%20theory.htm).]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Interactions'': Human interaction results in conflict.  
* ''Change'': Conflict and change are normal and inevitable in society.
* ''Competition'': Competition over scarce resources (e.g., money, leisure, sexual partners, etc.) is part of all social groups. Competition rather than consensus is characteristic of human relationships.  If everyone had the resources they needed, conflict would not exist.
* ''Structural Inequality'': Inequalities in power and rewards are built into all social structures.  Resources are scarce and groups will always compete over these resources.
* ''Degree of Inequality'': Inequality exists in varying degrees with people having different amounts of resources; hierarchies exist.
* ''Revolution'': Macro changes occur as a result of conflict between competing interests rather than through adaptation. It is often abrupt and revolutionary rather than evolutionary.

===Key Terms===
Below are some of the key terms employed in social conflict theories.

*Class conflict: The struggle between groups occupying different socioeconomic positions in the same society. These groups compete for control of economic, political and social resources. Class conflict can manifest as physical violence, [[w:propaganda|propaganda]] (e.g., the spread of ideologies, such as &quot;[[w:homeless|homeless]] people are lazy&quot;), economic threats (e.g., the middle class boycotting &quot;[[w:Big Business|Big Business]]&quot;), or legal battles (e.g., [[w:class action lawsuits|class action lawsuits]] by consumers against large [[w:corporations|corporations]]).
*[[w:Ideology|Ideology]]: the collection of beliefs that justify a social arrangement
*Social class: an aspect of social location that is determined by either your relationship to the means of production (Marx) or your power, prestige and wealth (Weber). 
*[[w:Deviance|Deviance]]: going against prevailing social norms
*[[w:Proletariat|Proleteriat]]: in Marx’s economic conflict theory, the proletariat are the working class who did not own the resources, land or tools they use to produce goods for the bourgeoisie
*[[w:Bourgeoisie|Bourgeoisie]]: in Marx’s economic conflict theory, the bourgeoisie are the capitalist class who own the resources, land and tools. They exploit the proletariat by paying them less than their work is worth.
*[[w:Capitalism|Capitalism]]: an economic system with private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit.

===Propositions===
Propositions are relationships proposed between the conceptual components of a theory.  Various proponents of conflict theory have delineated propositions based on the above assumptions.  Below are some of these propositions.

*Marx (1818-1883): The proletariat and bourgeoisie compete for control over scant resources. 
*Gumplowicz (1838-1909): Societies evolve out of war and conquest resulting in the development of nation-states and unequal systems with master and slave relationships. &lt;ref name=&quot;Adamek 2006&quot;&gt; Adamek, W., &amp; Radwan-Pragłowski, J. (2006). Ludwik Gumplowicz. Journal of Classical Sociology, 6(3), 381-398.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Weber (1864-1920): The [[w:Protestant Ethic|Protestant Ethic]] promoted hard work, creating an environment in which a capitalistic struggle for resources would thrive.
*Mills (1916-1962): Conflict exists between people of lower social statuses and the &quot;Power Elite&quot; (those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy) resulting in a struggle for resources and unequal distribution of influence. 
*Feminine Conflict Theory: Historically oppressed, women struggle to gain equal access to power and resources from men. 
*Postcolonialism: In an effort to increase their wealth, more powerful countries spread around the world. 
*World Systems Theory: Countries compete with each other for status, wealth, and technology. Countries are divided into core countries, semi-periphery countries, and periphery countries, which are, respectively, arranged in a social hierarchy with the core countries at the top and the periphery countries at the bottom.  Core countries extract resources from the semi-periphery and periphery countries and use their technology to turn those resources into consumer goods, which they can then sell back to people in the peripheral countries.

==History of Conflict Theory==
The ideas that make up the foundations of conflict theory can be traced back to early philosophy. [[w:Han Fei Tzu|Han Fei Tzu]] (280 - 233 BC) and other ancient Chinese philosophers taught that men are innately weak and lazy. This assumption leads to the obvious conclusion that the only way men can be controlled, then, is through punishment.  Those who have the power to punish can control society, as the fear of the power of punishment keeps men in check.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;&gt;Martindale, Don. 2010. The Nature and Types of Sociological Theory. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Polybius|Polybius]], a Greek philosopher (205-125 BC), focused his studies on the [[w:Roman Republic|Roman Republic]]. He believed that people were like herds of animals. Weaknesses lead man to form communities in which the strongest and bravest person became the leader. He believed societies change and transition into a monarchy and that monarchies are based on justice and legitimate authority. Monarchies have an obligation to keep peace in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;/&gt;  However, the same problems with men will be exhibited in their kings, leading to corrupt and unjust monarchies.  The result: [[w:tyrant|tyrants]] and tyranny. Tyranny is, however, self-limiting.  Once it becomes unbearable, the elite in society will figure out ways to over throw the monarchy. Society will be in support of these new leaders because they give more liberty and equality.  This cycle will repeat itself because the new leader will take some of the liberty and sense of equality away from the people. Polybius believed the only way to stop this cycle is to form a government that combines the best elements from monarchies, aristocracies, and democracy, like the Roman government during his time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale2010&quot;/&gt;

Many philosophers had similar ideas about conflict and society.{{fact}}  They believed that conflict was a necessary part of society.{{fact}} Conflict, as a sociological theory, was formalized in the 19th and 20th Centuries, building upon the ideas of people like those mentioned above. Many sociologists have contributed to the development of conflict theory, including [[w:Max Gluckman|Max Gluckman]], [[w:John Rex|John Rex]], [[w:Lewis A. Coser|Lewis A. Coser]], [[w:Randall Collins|Randall Collins]], [[w:Ralf Dahrendorf|Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[w:Ludwig Gumplovicz|Ludwig Gumplovicz]], [[w:Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[w:Georg Simmel|Georg Simmel]].  However, [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] is often credited as being the father of conflict theory. 

Karl Heinrich Marx (1818 – 1883) was a German philosopher, sociologist, historian, political economist, political theorist and revolutionary socialist, who developed the socio-political theory of Marxism. His ideas have since played a significant role in both the development of social science and also in the socialist political movement. He published various books during his lifetime, with the most notable being The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Capital (1867–1894), many of which were co-written with his friend, the fellow German revolutionary socialist [[w:Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels]]. Marx’s dedication to social change led him to focus most of his work on revolutionary class conflicts in industrial societies. Karl Marx died a poor man but his work and ideas have influenced the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;Wolff, Jonathan. n.d. “Karl Marx.” http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ (Accessed April 29, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx saw conflict as primarily resulting from class conflicts within industry and the economic segment of society.  [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] (1864-1920) proposed that power, prestige and property also added to social conflict and that such conflict was found in all aspects of society (e.g., politics, gender, and religion).

[[w:C. Wright Mills|C. Wright Mills]] (1916-1962) also contributed to modern conflict theory. According to Mills, one of the results of conflict between people with competing interests and resources is the creation of a social structure. Social structure refers to the relatively fixed institutions and norms of society that heavily influence, consciously or not, peoples' everyday behavior (e.g., getting your license at a department of motor vehicles reflects the fact that social structure dictates who gets to grant licenses, how, when, and to whom).  However, control over the social structure is largely in the hands of the elite (wealthy), who generally oppose the interests of the non-elite.

== Modern Examples ==
=== Social Stratification ===
As civilizations undergo change from agrarian, rural groups into industrialized, modern societies, a social hierarchy emerges that effectively creates distinct classes based on wealth, power and prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrante 2005&quot;&gt; Ferrante, J. (2005). &quot;Sociology: A Global Perspective.&quot; Wadsworth Publishing; 6 edition. &lt;/ref&gt;  According to conflict theory, it is this structure of social stratification that pits those in the upper class (i.e., those with the most power, wealth and prestige) against the lower classes.

Conflict theory also asserts that modern society and the &quot;...criminal justice system and criminal law...operates on the behalf of the rich and powerful social elites, with the resulting policies aimed at controlling the poor,&quot;{{fact|page number?}} thus perpetuating a system in which the upper class maintains power and all other classes remain economically disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and nearly powerless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek 2005&quot;&gt; Greek, C. (2005). &quot;Conflict Theory in Criminology.&quot; URL: http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/conflict.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  Marx foresaw such conflicts, asserting that &quot;...every society has been based... on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes,&quot; with modernization and industrialization significantly increasing this conflict and the oppression of the lower classes by the upper class&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx Engles 1848&quot;&gt; Marx, K; Engels, F. (1948). “Manifesto of the Communist Party.” Progress Publishers: Moscow 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern society presents several examples of the main ideas and mechanisms of conflict theory in practice, showing the process by which the upper class power elites systematically work to disenfranchise and exploit the lower classes to maintain and increase their power.&lt;ref name=Mills 1956&quot;&gt; Mills, C.W. (1956). “The Power Elite.” Oxford University Press, USA. &lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, conflict theory does not apply only to one type of government or society; it can be applied to democracies, socialist nations and dictatorships alike.

=== Wealth and Power Inequality ===
While the United States is purportedly a nation that values principles of equality, egalitarianism, meritocracy, hard work, and the pursuit of the &quot;American Dream,&quot; the U.S. also has a very high level of economic and social inequality.  Domhoff (2011) provides striking evidence of this inequality, finding that &quot;as of 2007, the top 1% of households (the upper class) owned 34.6% of all privately held wealth, and the next 19% (the managerial, professional, and small business stratum) had 50.5%.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domoff 2011&quot;&gt; Domhoff, G.W. (2011). “Power in America: Wealth, Income and Power.” URL: http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to state that this means that the top 20% of Americans own 85% of the nation’s wealth as a whole, with the other 80% of Americans having only 15% of the wealth.  This extreme inequality in the level of power and wealth that currently exist in the United States exemplifies the central themes of conflict theory, namely that there is a competition for power between classes.  The implications of this large disparity in wealth between social classes in the United States includes many disadvantages for those in the lower classes, such as a lack of access to quality health care, increased risk of violent crime, fewer educational opportunities (especially post-secondary education), and the absence of a social network to provide opportunities for upward mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lareau 2003&quot;&gt; Lareau, A. (2003). &quot;Unequal Childhoods.&quot; U. California Press. Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug Abuse and Crime ===
Proponents of conflict theory argue that crime and criminal justice in the modern world is designed to benefit the upper, powerful classes, while subjugating and disenfranchising the lower classes.  Greek (2005) provides an excellent explanation of this phenomenon:

:&quot;Thus, street crimes, even minor monetary ones are routinely punished quite severely, while large scale financial and business crimes are treated much more leniently. Theft of a television might receive a longer sentence than stealing millions through illegal business practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek 2005&quot;/&gt;

This example illustrates the manner in which conflict theory can be applied to deviance in society as the upper classes seek to maintain their position and power by ensuring that the lower classes remain poor and relatively powerless.

Conflict theory has also been applied to the current trends of drug abuse in the United States, finding that societal and social class position effect one's rate of drug abuse.  More specifically, &quot;Conflict theory holds that there are higher numbers of chronic drug abusers found in lower social classes, disorganized neighborhoods. lower income families, and relatively politically powerless places.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lo2003&quot;&gt; Lo, C. C. (2003). An Application of Social Conflict Theory to Arrestees' Use of Cocaine and Opiates. Journal of Drug Issues, 33(1), 237-266.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|page number?}}  Lo (2003) found that, in accordance with conflict theory, social environments negatively effect inequality &quot;...widespread poverty and severe social disorganization, lacking legitimate opportunities as well as adequate education
and training, have a [strong] association with opiate and cocaine use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lo2003&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This approach stands in contrast to the strict behaviorism of psychological theories prevalent at the time it was first formulated (in the 1920s and 1930s),  [[w:behaviorism|behaviorism]] and [[w:ethology|ethology]], and also contrasts with [[w:functionalism|structural-functionalism]].  According to Symbolic Interactionism, humans are distinct from infrahumans (lower animals)simply respond to their environment (i.e., a stimulus evokes a response or stimulus -&gt; response) whereas humans have the ability to interrupt that process (i.e., stimulus -&gt; cognition -&gt; response).  Additionally, infrahumans are unable to conceive of alternative responses to gestures. Humans, however, can.  This understanding should not be taken to indicate that humans never behave in a strict ''stimulus -&gt; response'' fashion, but rather that humans have the capability of not responding in that fashion (and do so much of the time).

This perspective is also rooted in phenomenological thought (see [[w:social constructionism|social constructionism]] and [[w:phenomenology|phenomonology]].  According to symbolic interactionism, the objective world has no reality for humans, only subjectively-defined objects have meaning. Meanings are not entities that are bestowed on humans and learned by habituation. Instead, meanings can be altered through the creative capabilities of humans, and individuals may influence the many meanings that form their society (Herman and Reynolds 1994).  Human society, therefore, is a social product.

It should also be noted that symbolic interactionists advocate a particular methodology.  Because they see ''meaning'' as the fundamental component of human/society interaction, studying human/society interaction requires ''getting at'' that meaning.  Thus, symbolic interactionists tend to employ more [[w:qualitative|qualitative]] rather than [[w:quantitative|quantitative]] methods in their research.

==Additional Concepts==
===Society===
In symbolic interactionist thought, there is a difference between infrahuman and human society.  In infrahuman life, cooperation is physiologically determined.  In other words, it is not a cognitive process; it results from instinct and biological programming rather than conscious thinking.  In human society, cooperation is cognitive and conscious.  Human cooperation can only be brought about by:
*each acting individual ascertaining the intention of the acts of others
*each acting individual deciding on his/her own response on the basis of that intention

Another distinction drawn between infrahumans and humans is in the types of communication employed.  Infrahuman communication is gestural; it takes place immediately, without any interruption of the act for interpretation or assigning meaning.  In contrast to infrahuman communication, human communication is meaningful in that gestures are symbolic and do not invoke immediate responses - humans must interpret gestures and assign them meaning.  Because human communication involves interpretation and the assignment of meaning, it is only possible when there is consensus in meaning.  Meanings for symbols must be shared. 

Shared meaning necessarily takes place through role-taking; in order to complete an act, the actor must put himself in the position of the other person. Behavior is viewed as ''social'' not simply when it is a response to others, but rather when it has incorporated in it the behavior of others. Human beings respond to themselves as other persons respond to them, and in so doing they imaginatively share the conduct of others.

===Self===
The '''self''' refers to the conscious, reflective personality of an individual. It is the entity the person envisions when he/she thinks about who they are. In order to understand the concept of self, it is important to understand that the development of self is only possible through [[w:role|role-taking]].  In order to look upon your ''self'', you have to be able to take the role of another, which, in turn, allows you to reflect upon your ''self''.  Because role-taking is a necessary part of self-development, it is concurrent with the development of self.

According to Mead (1967), the self develops in a series of three stages:
#preparatory stage - meaningless imitation by the infant
#play stage - actual playing of roles occurs; but no unified conception of self develops
#game stage - this is the completion stage of self-development; the child finds who he or she is; the child also must respond to simultaneous roles; the individual can act with a certain amount of consistency in a variety of situations because he/she acts in accordance with a generalized set of expectations and definitions he/she has internalized

The ''self'' consists of two parts, the ''I'' and the ''Me''.  The ''I'' is the impulsive tendency of the individual (similar to Freud's notion of the [[w:Id|Id]]).  The ''I'' is the spontaneous, unorganized aspect of human existence. The ''Me'' is the incorporated other (see [[w:generalized other|generalized other]]) within the individual.  The incorporated or generalized other supplies an organized set of attitudes and definitions, understandings and expectations (or [[w:meaning|meanings]]) that are common to the group to which the individual belongs (similar to Freud's concept of the [[w:superego|superego]]).

According to Mead's presentation of the ''I'' and the ''Me'', action begins in the form of the ''I'' and ends in the form of the ''Me''; the ''I'' gives propulsion while the ''Me'' gives direction.  Additionally, the ''I'', being creative and spontaneous, provides for change in society.  The ''Me'', being regulatory, works to maintain society.  Thus, in the concept of ''self'' is a powerful and comprehensive understanding of how humans function in society and, in turn, how society functions (by both changing and remaining constant).  The concept also depicts the relationship between the individual and society (Meltzer 1978).

According to Meltzer (1978), there are three implications of selfhood:
#the possession of self makes of the individual a society in miniature; humans can engage themselves in interaction; they can view themselves in a new way
#the ability to act toward oneself makes possible an inner experience which need not reach overt expression; humans can have a mental life
#an individual with a self can direct and control his behavior

It is also important to recognize that the self and the mind are twin emergents in the social process...

===Mind===
The ''Mind'' or mental component of man emerges out of human communication.  The mind is only present when significant symbols (as opposed to gestures that do not have meaning but simply evoke responses) are being used in communication. In this sense, ''mind'' is a process manifested whenever the individual is interacting with himself using significant symbols (symbols or gestures with interpretations or meanings).

The mind is also the component of the individual that interrupts responses to stimuli.  It is the mind that attempts to pre-vision the future by exploring possible outcomes of actions before proceeding with actions. In minded behavior, the individual carries on an internal conversation.

==Notes==
The basic assumptions of symbolic interactionism, according to Herman and Reynolds (1994), are:
#humans live in a symbolic world of learned meanings
#symbols arise in the social process and are shared
#symbols have motivational significance; meaning and symbols allow individuals to carry out distinctively human action and interaction
#the mind is a functional, volitional, teleological entity serving the interests of the individual; Humans, unlike the lower animals, are endowed with the capacity for thought; the capacity for thought is shaped by social interaction
#the self is a social construct; just as individuals are born mindless, so too, are they born selfless; our selves arise in social interaction with others
#society is a linguistic or symbolic construct arising out of the social process; it consists of individuals interacting
#sympathetic introspection is a mandatory mode of inquiry

| Every semester, I use an activity to introduce my students to economic inequalities.  First, I split them into groups of 3 to 5 people.  Next, I put a series of average costs for living in our county on the board in the form of an easily readable Powerpoint slide (i.e., average rent, average cost of transportation with and without a car, average utility bill, average health insurance cost, etc., etc.).  Then, I assign each group a household income (i.e., an income the 3 – 5 of them make together and must live off of as a family).  The household income I give them varies due to official variations, but it is always just barely above the cutoff for receiving aid so the students have to try to “make due” without any handouts.  Finally, I have the students design a budget for their family based upon the combination of average costs and their total income.  After they are finished, we discuss their budgets as a class.  

While this exercise is rudimentary and will not actually cause them any real world trouble, I find it fascinating that the most “just work harder,” “self made American,” and “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” students very quickly decide they will run meth labs out of their houses, figure out ways to scam other people out of money, beg for money on the streets, or otherwise suggest the only way they could survive managing wages and costs typical among the working poor of America would be by breaking the law or (in the words of more than one student so far) “living like an animal.”  After a bit of discussion, I ask them why don’t they “pull themselves up by their bootstraps” and they very quickly realize that’s not really possible when you can’t even afford the bootstraps.  Finally, I ask them how the money their families had (or didn’t have) contributed to the difference between them sitting in a college classroom and starting their own meth lab.

Stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of people in a society.  This chapter focuses on economic stratification; meaning how people are differentiated based upon their wealth (and/or power). Sociology has a long history of studying stratification and teaching about various kinds of inequality, including economic inequality, racial/ethnic inequality, gender inequality, and other types of inequality. Inequality means people have unequal access to scarce and valued resources in society.  These resources might be economic or political, such as health care, education, jobs, property and land ownership, housing, and ability to influence government policy. 

Statistics on United States and global inequality are widespread and alarming.  Consider this:

*Life expectancy in Harlem is shorter than in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rank2011&quot;/&gt;

Although inequality is everywhere, there are many controversies and questions about inequality that sociologists are interested in such as where did inequality come from? Why does it continue?  Do we justify inequality?  Can we eliminate inequality?  Can we make a society in which people are equal?  Before answering these complex questions, we will broadly define socioeconomic status and social class in America.  The chapter then turns to dominant theories on stratification, and explores class, race, and gender inequality in more detail.  We look at how capitalism is an important context in inequality.  We end with consequences of inequality and theories explaining global inequality.

==Socioeconomic Status==
Building on the ideas of Max Weber, who saw three main dimensions of stratification (class, status, and party), contemporary sociologists often define stratification in terms of socioeconomic status (or SES).  There are a variety of ways to measure SES, including educational attainment, income, wealth, and occupational prestige.  These measures reflect three characteristics of individuals: power, property, and prestige.  These three characteristics combine to indicate someone’s social class or socioeconomic status.

===Power===
Power refers to someone’s ability to get others to do his/her will, regardless of whether or not they want to.  Legitimate power, power given to individuals willingly by others, is called authority.  Illegitimate power, power taken by force or the threat of force, is called coercion.

===Property===
Property, as used in this context, refers to the sum total of one’s possessions as well as their regular income.  Property goes beyond income as a measure of social class as it reflects the accumulated wealth (e.g., homes, stocks, bonds, savings and how many children you have) in addition to one’s earning potential and accumulated debt.  Property is a better overall measure of social class than income as many individuals who are considered wealthy actually have very small incomes.

===Prestige===
Prestige refers to the reputation or esteem associated with one’s position in society.  Prestige used to be associated with one's family name, but for most people in developed countries, prestige is now generally tied to one's occupation.  Occupations like physicians or lawyers tend to have more prestige associated with them than occupations like bartender or janitor.  An individual’s prestige is closely tied to their social class – the higher the prestige of an individual (through their occupation or maybe family name), the higher the social class.

These three indicators tend to go hand-in-hand or lead to each other, such as a Supreme Court justice who is usually wealthy, enjoys a great deal of prestige, and exercises significant power.  In some cases, however, a person ranks differently on these indicators, such as funeral directors.  Their prestige is fairly low, but most have higher incomes than college professors, who are among the most educated people in America and have high prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;&gt;Benokraitis, N., 2010. SOC, 2nd edition. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Class in America==

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert and Joseph Kahl developed a model of the American class social class structure.  Briefly, the upper class in America (3% of the population) is divided into upper-upper class (1% of the U.S. population), earning hundreds of millions to billions in income per year while the lower-upper class (2%) earns millions in annual income.  The middle class (40%) is divided into upper-middle class (14%) earning $76,000 or more per year while the lower-middle class (26%) earns $46,000 to $75,000.  The working class (30%) earns $19,000 to $45,000.  The lower class (27%) is divided into working poor (13%, earning $9000 to 18,000) and underclass (14%, earning under $9000).&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

Among America’s working class and working poor are hotel housekeepers, waitresses, house maids, and retail clerks.  In ''Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America'', Barbara Ehrenreich describes her experience of working a series of low-wage jobs in 1998 and trying to survive on her wages.  Among other low-wage jobs, she worked in Wal-Mart, earning $6.00 per hour.  In addition to trying to survive on her wages, she described how working overtime without pay was the custom at Wal-Mart.  Managers informed workers to punch out of the time clock and to begin some additional work (without pay).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich2002&quot;&gt;Ehrenreich, B., 2002. Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[w:Great Recession|Great Recession]] from 2007-2009, the gap between the rich and poor has increased in America.  Today, the richest one percent of Americans earn nearly a quarter of the country’s income and control 40 percent of its wealth.  The gap between the wealth of white families and the wealth of African-American families and Hispanics has also increased.  The average wealth of a white family in 2009 was 20 times greater than that of the average black family, and 18 times greater than the average Hispanic family.  In other words, the average white family had $113,149 in net worth, compared to $6,325 for Hispanics and $5,677 for African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rakesh2011&quot;&gt;Rakesh K., Fry, R., &amp; Taylor, P., 2011.

Let’s take a step back now and see where inequality really began.

===Origins of Inequality and Private Property===
The origins of inequality can be found in the transition from hunter/gatherer societies to horticultural/pastoralist societies.  Here, it might be useful to describe a few characteristics of these societies.

In hunter/gather societies, (around 50,000 B.C.), small groups of people gathered what they could find and they also hunted and fished.  People grew and collected their food for all of their needs.  There was very little trading between the groups and there were not many inequalities between groups.  There was not a surplus of goods.  Everyone possessed basically the same as everyone else.  The division of labor was small.  People did almost the same jobs as each other.  Food gathering and food production was the focus of work.  

In horticultural/pastoralist societies (around 12,000 B.C.), groups grew to be very large and humans settled down in one place.  For the first time, people had more time to do other work besides producing food, such as making leather and making weapons and other special skills.  This new division of labor led to surplus of goods.  The groups then traded with each other.  This led to inequality because some people accumulated more possessions than others.    

Fast forward many millennia later to just before Industrialization began.  In the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, there was collectivity in the space and land in Europe.  Life was brutal and harsh, but there was a joint and shared responsibility in the way people lived their lives and went about their work.  People farmed land in a collective way because they saw it as something for everyone to take care of and for everyone to enjoy the fruits of their labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achbar2004&quot;&gt;Achbar, M., Abbott J., &amp; Bakan J., 2004. The Corporation. Zeitgeist Video.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of private taking and private property began to flourish in the late 15th century beginning in Europe and spreading around the world.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau linked private property with inequality in his book, ''Discourse on Inequality''.  Collective land and space, once shared by all, began to be divided up into private takings and private ownership (and this continues today).  Land, oceans, and air, once shared by everyone in the world, began being bought and sold like products in a store.  The great land masses of the world were reduced to private property.  Laws and regulations were created that allowed a country to claim a certain amount of water for exploitation.  Air was divided into air corridors that were bought and sold for commercial traffic for airplanes.  Today, the right to private property is an important value in most societies.  With deregulation, privatization, and free trade, we continue to see a private taking and private ownership of entities once shared by everyone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achbar2004&quot;/&gt;

The idea that there should be equality in society emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries in the writings of Hobbes and Locke.  Their thinking helped people consider that inequality was the result of the actions and intentions of social institutions and specific groups and not the will of God.  Even so, the question of the origin of inequality remains today in addition to why inequality continues.

===The Persistence of Inequality===
Sociologist Joel Charon&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;&gt;Charon, J., 2007. 10 questions. A Sociological Perspective, 6th edition. Belmont:  Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a few reasons why inequality continues in society.  His arguments reflect social reproduction theory, which focuses on the roles of institutions and cultures in the perpetuation of inequality and the process by which the social class structure is maintained.  First, the rich and powerful protect the system of inequality.  They are typically the owners of the means of production (factories, machinery, land, transportation) and have the resources to protect themselves and their positions.  This control is heightened in societies with advanced technology as more developed technology facilitates the ability of the wealthy to pass on their wealth to their offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulder2009&quot;&gt;Mulder, Monique Borgerhoff et al. 2009. “Intergenerational Wealth Transmission and the Dynamics of Inequality in Small-Scale Societies.” Science 326(5953):682–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in modern societies, the transition of wealth is basically as simple as changing the names on the bank accounts or transferring stock from parents to children, which can be done at the push of a button. But in less developed economies - like hunter-gatherer or pastoralist - the transmission of wealth is far more difficult as it involves the physical transferring of goods.  Thus, technology has the potential to substantially heighten inequality by facilitating the intergenerational transmission of wealth.

Karl Marx argued that the rich and powerful have control over the means of production, which is economic power, and they also have great influence on government power, including the rules governments follow, the people who work for the government, and the laws governments make.  The rich and powerful also have control over the media, the schools, the courts, and many other parts of society and they support institutions (religion, economy, and education) that favor them.  For example, the Walton family made $3.2 million in political contributions in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;&gt;Wal-Mart-the high cost of low price, 2005. Brave new films.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Waltons have great economic power and also the ability to influence government through large donations to political actors that protect their positions and their businesses.  Inequality continues because those at the top protect their positions and use their power to influence other parts of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;

Second, culture teaches the acceptance of inequality.  Research shows that Americans believe in equality.  Research also shows that Americans view inequality as justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;  One belief system that people commonly embrace--mistakenly, according to contemporary economic research-- is that the rich and powerful are more talented, hardworking, and intellectually superior and thus more deserving.  The poor are poor because they are lazy or irresponsible or unmotivated.  If they can’t make it, it is their fault.  These are ideologies that protect the system of inequality.  These ideologies legitimatize the position of the rich and powerful and explain and justify the position of the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;&gt;Johnson, A. 2006. Privilege, Power, and Difference, 2nd edition. Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to accept inequality, not because they are happy with their situation, but because over time people believe their situation is natural and normal and it is what they expect from life. 

In the United States, important cultural values are taught early on which support the system of inequality.  These include a focus on the individual, a value of hard work, measurable achievement, and the ‘sacred’ ideal of equal opportunity.  People accept as truth these beliefs: ‘If you work hard, you can rise to the top.’ ‘You can be anything you want to be.’ ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way.’ ‘America is the land of opportunity; anyone can make it if they try hard enough.’ ‘Work hard, get an education, and don’t give up when the going gets rough.’  These values support the inequality that already exists and these values deny the impacts of inequality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

The American dream contains the belief that every individual can achieve prosperity and success through hard work and self discipline.  For example, U.S. President Barack Obama said in a speech in 2005, “…whether chance of birth or circumstance decides life’s big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, at the very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama2005&quot;&gt;Obama, B., 2005. [Online]. Available at http://www.notable-quotes.com/o/obama_barack.html [accessed August 1, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  While these might be inspirational words, they focus on the individual and leave out the social structural causes of inequality and poverty, such as the high unemployment rate, inheritance laws that allow families to pass on wealth, lack of state supported child care or health care, and tax policies that favor the wealthy.  As a startling example, the Walton family received a federal tax cut of $91,500 per hour during the 2004 tax year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt;

Third, people are socialized to accept their position in life.  The rich and powerful socialize their children to expect wealth and power.  Parents, teachers, and friends show us our position in society and teach us to expect that same level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt; Parents who attended prestigious boarding schools and Ivy League colleges such as Harvard, Yale, or Princeton expect their future offspring will attend such schools.  Harvard researcher Michael Hurwitz found that legacy students were 45% more likely to be admitted to elite colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurwitz2011&quot;&gt;Huwitz, Michael. 2011. Legacy students up to 45% more likely to be admitted to elite colleges. [Online]. Available at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/06/legacy-students-45-percen_n_805272.html [accessed August 1, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 analysis of schools in the District of Columbia illustrates how wealth perpetuates wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moored2015&quot;&gt;The cost of a guaranteed spot in a DCPS elementary school. July 20, 2015. http://districtmeasured.com/2015/07/20/the-cost-of-a-guaranteed-spot-in-a-dcps-elementary-school/&lt;/ref&gt;  The very best schools in the District of Columbia were located in areas where median home prices were very high, close to $800,000.  The worst schools were located in areas where median home prices were very low. In other words, in order to send a child to a top school, parents had to live in a home that cost close to $800,000 to purchase it, otherwise the students would get an inferior education.  This illustrates how inequality and stratification get passed on from generation to generation, as children raised in wealthy families get the best education.

Ivy League colleges, private country clubs, debutante balls (a formal introduction and presentation of young women to society) and the social register (a book listing the most important and famous American families) are ways that the wealthy maintain their cohesion and pass on their prestigious positions to their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higley2003&quot;&gt;Higley, S., 2003. The U.S. Upper Class. In J. Henslin, ed. Down to Earth Sociology,12th edition. New York: The Free Press. 347-359.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, education helps to reinforce an acceptance of inequality and education prepares each social class differently, depending on the roles they will play when leaving school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charon2007&quot;/&gt;  This means teaching the appropriate skills but also the appropriate values for each social class.  Elementary and high schools in the U.S., in particular, teach different values to different social classes.  Working-class students learn obedience; upper-middle class students learn leadership and creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;  Upper-middle class students participate in activities that focus on public performance and skill development.  Working-class students participate in informal play, visiting family, and ‘hanging out.’&lt;ref name=&quot;Lareau2000&quot;&gt;Lareau, A., 2000. Social class and the daily lives of children: a study from the United States. Childhood, 7 (2), 155-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization brings the acceptance of a culture that justifies inequality, and it normally brings an acceptance of one’s relative position in the system of inequality.

Finally, police, courts, and prisons work together to protect the system of inequality.  Research has shown that the criminal justice system in the U.S. is biased against the poor from start to finish, from the definition of what constitutes a crime through the process of arrest, trial, and sentencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiman2006&quot;&gt;Reiman, J., 2006. The rich get richer and the poor get prison: ideology, class, and criminal justice, 8th edition. London: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of society seems to encourage and protect the system of inequality.  Given all of these ways inequality is perpetuated in a society, is it at all possible to eliminate it?

===Eliminating Inequality===
Inequality and poverty didn’t just drop down from the sky, like an apple does from a tree. The previous section shows it is embedded in society in many ways, but if the conditions that generate social inequality are conscious and intentional creations of human actions, they can be changed.  We will examine this complex issue in the next section.

==Dominant Perspectives==
Two classic approaches to stratification provide interesting insights into this phenomenon, structural-functionalism and conflict theories.  

===Structural-Functionalism on Stratification===
The structural-functional approach to stratification asks the same question that it does of the other components of society:  What function or purpose does it serve?  The answer is that all parts of society, even poverty, contribute in some way to the larger system’s overall stability, according to this theory.  Stratification and inequalities are inevitable and beneficial to society.  The layers (stratification) are the inevitable sorting of unequal people.  The layering is useful because it ensures that the best people are at the top and those who are less worthy are further down the pyramid and therefore have less power and are given fewer rewards than the high quality people at the top.  Inequality ensures that the most functionally important jobs are filled by the best qualified people.  In other words, it makes sense for the CEO of a company whose position is more important functionally to make more money than a janitor working for the same company.  A job’s functional importance is determined by the degree to which the job is unique, meaning whether few other people can perform the same function adequately.  Garbage collectors are important to public sanitation, but do not need to be rewarded highly, because little training or talent is required to perform their job.  Doctors should be rewarded highly, because great training is required to do their job.  It is logical that society must offer greater rewards (e.g., income, vacations, promotion) to motivate the most qualified people to fill the most important positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;

There are several obvious problems with this approach to stratification.  First, it is difficult to determine the functional importance of any job, as the accompanying specialization and inter-dependence make every position necessary to the overall operation.  The engineers in a factory for example are just as important as the other workers in the factory to the success of a project.  In another example, a primary school teacher in the U.S. earns $29,000 per year whereas a National Basketball Association Player can earn as much as $21 million per year.  Are basketball players more essential to society than teachers?  Are basketball players more functionally important than teachers?  In 2009, comedian Jerry Seinfeld earned $85 million.  Do his earnings demonstrate his contribution to society?  If NBA players or famous comedians went on strike and decided not to work, most people would not notice.  However, if teachers, bus drivers, nurses, cleaners, garbage collectors, or waitresses stopped working, society would close down.  There is little connection between income and jobs that are functionally important in a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

Second, this approach assumes that the system of stratification is fair and rational, and that the ‘best’ people end up on top because of their superiority.  But, in real life, the system does not work so easily or perfectly.  Former U.S. president [[w:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]], for example, was not the smartest or most politically talented individual but he was well connected and born at the top of the stratification system (white, male, wealthy, American, heterosexual), and therefore was elected to a position with great power – the U.S. presidency.  

Another problem with this approach is that it assumes that only a few ‘chosen’ people should have all the power and all the material wealth, rather than distributing it equitably, or distributing it to those who need it most.

===Conflict Theorists on Stratification===
Conflict theorists argue that stratification is dysfunctional and harmful in society.  Stratification benefits the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor.  For example, many wealthy families pay low wages to nannies to care for their children, gardeners to attend to their rose gardens and maids to pick up their dirty socks.  Capitalism, in particular, benefits the rich.  Corporate welfare is one example where an arrangement of direct subsidies, tax breaks, and other support that the government has created for big businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt; As mentioned previously, the Walton family receives enormous tax breaks.  Inequality is inevitable within a system that has individual competition at its core, and therefore, ‘winners’ and ‘losers.’  Conflict theorists believe that this competitive system, together with the way the game is ‘fixed’, ends up creating and perpetuating stratification systems.  Competition and inequality are not inevitable but are created and maintained by people.  

Functionalists criticize this approach by arguing that people do not always act largely out of economic self-interest.  For example, Chuck Feeney, the creator of Duty Free Shoppers, has given $4 billion to charities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;  Bill Gates has given 58% of his wealth to charity.  In contrast, the Walton family has given less than 1% of their wealth to charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt; Functionalists also argue that conflict theorists underestimate people’s ability to move upward in society.  They argue that if people really want to succeed, they can do so through hard work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;

===Towards a More Egalitarian Society===
Societies could be redesigned so that they are based on cooperation.  [[w:Marxists|Marxists]] argue that a central component of a more equitable and humane society would be based on the idea, “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.”  In other words, each person should produce or work to the best of their ability according to their talents, and each person should receive the fruits of this labor according to their need, irrespective of what they have produced.  Conflict theorists also believe that democracy or some sort of group decision making is more humane and more effective.  Stratification systems that concentrate decision making and power in the hands of a few are destined to not serve the interests of most people at the bottom of the pyramid.

==Intersections of Class, Race, and Gender==
Economic class, in conjunction with race and gender, shape the opportunities, the privileges, and the inequalities experienced for individuals and groups.  The United States continues to be greatly stratified along these three lines.  This was seen when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005.  In New Orleans, the roles of class, race, and gender were made apparent to the U.S. public.  Many of the televised images showed poor, African Americans, many who were women and their children, abandoned in the storm, without resources for several days and without basic necessities of food and water.  Though the storm displaced hundreds of people from all backgrounds, classes, colors and gender ‘equally,’ all were not affected the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersen2007&quot;&gt;Andersen, M., &amp; Collins, P.H., 2007. Why race, class, and gender still matter. In M. Andersen &amp; P.H. Collins, eds. Race, Class and Gender. An Anthology, 6th edition. Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy had cars to leave New Orleans, and credit cards and bank accounts for emergency hotels and supplies.  They also had insurance policies for rebuilding.  The unequal impact of this tragedy was not unique.  In the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 for example, 60% of first class passengers survived, while only 24% of third class passengers survived.  One child in first class died, while 49 children in third class died.  The poor in the U.S. and around the world are most likely to suffer from ‘natural’ and human tragedies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman2008&quot;&gt;Bowman, J., 2008. Guided Fantasy: The Titanic Game. In K. McKinney &amp; B. Heyl, eds. Sociology through active learning: student exercises. Newbury Park: Pine Forge Press. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Titanic2011&quot;&gt;The Titanic Page. [Online]. Available at: http://www.eszlinger.com/titanic/titanfacts.html [accessed September 10, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism, class, privilege, and oppression==
Class plays an important role in the forms of privilege and oppression.  Capitalism produces enormous amounts of wealth, in addition to increasing levels of inequality, both within the U.S. and around the world. These inequalities result from a class system based on increasing gaps in income, wealth, and power between the few people on top and the masses of people at the bottom.  Capitalism is a system that produces cruel consequences.  For those at the bottom, the costs are great, with living conditions among the poor comparable to those found in developing countries.  Capitalism causes competition, stress, and anxiety among members of the working class and middle class, as people do not have any control over their work and whether they can keep their jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;  Despite the myth that hard work leads to getting ahead and making it, for the most part people have little power to improve their class position.  Research shows people are as likely to move downward as they are upward in the class system.  Currently, corporate downsizing, the loss of industrial jobs going overseas, the expansion of low-paying service occupations, and the Great Recession beginning in 2007, have combined to result in many people struggling to keep the jobs that they have, rather than being able to move upward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

==Capitalism, race and gender inequality==
The increase of immigrants in the U.S. and the loss of jobs to other countries illustrate a core belief that the greatest problem American workers experience is unfair competition from immigrants in the U.S. and workers abroad.  The belief, ‘they are taking our jobs’ ignores the capitalist system itself, which by its nature increases the wealth of the few owners by controlling workers and keeping wages as low as possible, and it allows a few owners to control the majority of wealth, leaving a tiny share to be distributed among everyone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

Capitalism also takes advantage of gender inequality.  Women workers are exploited for cheap labor as nannies and maids in New York, in clothing sweatshops in Los Angeles, and on rose farms in Ethiopia which pay women a dollar a day.  Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, in particular has been accused of discrimination against women.  Although over seventy percent of Wal-Mart’s hourly workers are female, they account for only a third of all management.  Wal-Mart has been sued for unfair practices in the training, payment, and promotion of its female employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt2001&quot;&gt;Hunt, J., 2001. Perspective: Barbara Ehrenreich on the Wal-Mart Suit. Time U.S. [Online]. Available at: http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,132362,00.html [accessed  September 8, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  Capitalism would no longer function if the mass of women stopped doing the shopping, cooking, cleaning, and caretaking.  For the most part, women raise the next generation of workers on which capitalism depends.  Women do this work without receiving any extra pay or benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;

==Points of View: Micro-Meso-Macro==
We now turn to three levels of analysis on stratification.  

===Micro-level Prestige and Influence===
Stratification occurs in small groups and face-to-face interaction.  At the beginning of the chapter, we looked at how stratification begins when we are young.  Clothing, expensive toys, a new bicycle, a fancy car, and what job our parents had (and even whether or not we had parents) were symbols that differentiated us and separated us in elementary schools and impacted which friends we played with and the interactions we had.  

Throughout our lives, wealth, power, and prestige are given to individuals who have knowledge and access to important information and influential people in society.  Gender and race influence our degrees of networks, as well as individual qualities of leadership, self confidence, and physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2007&quot;/&gt;

===Meso-level Access to Resources===
Our positions and connections in organizations and institutions lie within the stratification system.  This impacts how we experience life and how we interact with other individuals and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2007&quot;/&gt;  As mentioned earlier, parents, teachers, and friends show us our position in society and teach us to expect that same level.  Education prepares each social class differently, with different skills and values taught to each class.  The police, courts, and prisons reinforce the stratification system.  Our position in the system reflects the type of health care we receive.  All of these institutions support the stratification system by favoring the rich and powerful.

===Macro-Level Factors Influencing Stratification===
Our position in the international economic system in the world shapes our opportunities throughout our life and our access to important resources.  Let’s look at Cape Verde as an example.  Located 450 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, West Africa, it is geographically and economically isolated from the rest of the world. (See Picture 1.)  About one quarter of the population remains unemployed and an additional 26 percent are underemployed.  The poverty rate in 2003 was 37 percent including 20 percent who are identified as extremely poor.  The country is ranked 38 in the Human Poverty Index by the United Nations.  Cape Verde is a debtor nation with a total external debt of $360 million at the end of 2002.  Besides being in debt to countries of the North, (the U.S. and Europe) Cape Verde is part of the global economy in other ways. The country’s major industries are owned by nations of the North.  Forty-nine percent of the banks, hotels, airlines and shipping lines formerly owned by the Cape Verdean government have been sold to foreign investors.  In addition, Portuguese investors own forty percent of the state telecommunications company.  The dominance of foreigner investors in even the industries that supply the most basic needs, such as water, are a result of policies of privatization, a key element of [[w:neoliberal|neoliberal]] and Washington Consensus economic “reforms.” (See Picture 2).  And the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] continues to push its privatization drive demanding that Cape Verde privatize its few remaining public enterprises, including the national airlines, the national oil supply company, the national transportation company, and others.  Both the country’s private sector business class and low-income households have been greatly impacted, experiencing job loss and price hikes.  On one island, the increased cost of privatized energy has forced people who cannot afford the electricity to return to traditional oil lamps.  Low-income women especially have been impacted from structural adjustment programs, which have cut governmental provisions on health, education, and food.  Macro level factors such as policies implemented by the World Bank and International Monetary fund impact the job opportunities, prices of food, water, and electricity, and day to day life for citizens in Cape Verde and around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2009&quot;&gt;Carter, K., &amp; Aulette, J., 2009. Cape Verdean women and globalization: the politics of gender, culture and resistance. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (See picture 3).

===Consequences of Inequality===
In the opening paragraph and throughout this chapter, we presented many consequences of inequality.  What class we belong to directly relates to our individual life chances.  Let’s look at a few more points in detail.  The wealthy and well-educated are much more likely to be in good health, and have access to good medical care than the poor.  The poor have shorter life expectancies and are at greater risk for chronic illnesses.  Children born into poor families are at much greater risk of dying during their first year of life from disease, accidents, or violence.  When medical attention is needed, its huge cost prevents the poor from seeking care.  For many, the high cost of insurance prevents Americans from having good medical care.  Approximately 45.7 million people in the United States were without health insurance coverage in 2007.  Hunger is also connected to class.  It is estimated that 13 percent of children under age 12 are hungry or at risk of being hungry.  Among the working poor, almost 75% of the children are thought to be in this category.  In addition to the high cost of food, the lack of affordable housing is a critical concern for poor families and many families live in weekly hotels which are cheaper than paying monthly rent.  In Orange County, California, low-income parents working full-time at Disneyland for $9 per hour still struggle to find affordable housing, so parents with young children live across the street in motels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelosi2010&quot;&gt;Pelosi, A., 2010. Homeless: The motel kids of Orange County.  HBO Summer Series. [Online]. Available at: http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/homeless-the-motel-kids-of-orange-county/index.html [accessed August 29, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;&gt;Kendall, D., 2011. Sociology in our times, 8th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor are not able to provide the same educational opportunities for their children as the wealthy are.  School districts in wealthy suburban areas tend to pay higher teachers’ salaries, have newer buildings, and provide sophisticated equipment.  Students in central city schools and poverty stricken rural areas often attend rundown schools that lack necessary equipment and teaching materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty and thoughts related to poverty may take up so many cognitive resources for the poor that it actually impedes cognitive functioning, which accounts, in part, for the lower IQs measured among poor people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mani2013&quot;&gt;Mani, Anandi, Sendhil Mullainathan, Eldar Shafir, and Jiaying Zhao. 2013. “Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function.” Science 341(6149):976–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutors, SAT preparation courses, and charter schools allow children from wealthy families to gain entrance to elite colleges and find jobs more quickly after graduation.  And, as previously mentioned, their children have a good chance of attending the same elite college.  The cycle of wealth, power, and prestige continues.

Our final section explores global inequality.

==Global Inequality==  
[[File:Pic 4 ethiopian children.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 4. Children enjoying traditional bread during a celebration in Ethiopia.]]
Almost half the world, over 3 billion people, lives on less than $2.50 a day.  78 percent of Ethiopians earn less than $2.00 a day. (See Pictures 4, 5, and 6).  86% of the population in Zambia lives in poverty while 4% of the population in Belgium lives in poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empowering2011&quot;&gt;Empowering women and men to end their own hunger.

Seeing Sociology: an Introduction. Belmont: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Why is there such a large gap between Zambia and Belgium?  Why are the poor still poor?  Who is to blame for poverty?  Social scientists offer a few theories which help to explain the causes and consequences of global inequality.

===Development and Modernization===
This theory blames tradition for global poverty.  These theorists argue poor societies stay poor because they hold onto traditional attitudes and beliefs, technologies and institutions, such as traditional economic systems and forms of government.  In contrast, in the modern world, the rise of capitalism brought modern attitudes, modern technologies such as machinery and electronics, and modern institutions which helped countries progress and have a higher standard of living.  Given enough time, modernization will occur everywhere in the world.  Eventually global capitalism and its modern corporations will hold these modern ideas, technical innovations, and efficient institutions everywhere.  Modernists believe large economic growth is the key to reducing poverty in poor countries.  

===Dependency===
[[File:Pic 5 ethiopia traditional houses.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 5. Traditional huts near Wondo Genet, Ethiopia.]]
This theory blames colonialism and neocolonialism (continuing economic dependence on former colonial countries) for global poverty.  Countries have developed at an uneven rate because wealthy countries have exploited poor countries in the past and today through foreign debt and transnational corporations (TNCs).  Historically, wealthy nations have taken a great quantity of materials from poor countries such as minerals and metals necessary to make automobiles, weapons, and jewelry in wealthy countries.  In addition, large amounts of agricultural products that can only be grown in the hot climates of the poor countries have been taken and exported and manufactured in the wealthy countries such as coffee, tea, sugar, and cocoa.  Wealthy countries would not be as rich as they are today if they did not have these materials.  Also, wealthy countries increased their own profits by organizing cheap labor through slavery.  King Leopold II, for example, who was King of Belgium from 1865-1909, forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to work as slaves in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The invention of the bicycle tire in the 1890’s and later the automobile tire meant that rubber was in high demand, and wild rubber vines were widespread in the Congo, earning Leopold millions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genocide2011&quot;&gt;Genocide and crimes against humanity. [Online]. Available at: http://www.enotes.com/genocide-encyclopedia/king-leopold-ii-congo [accessed August 30, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Republic of Congo is still suffering today from the plunder of resources and the torture and killing of millions during Leopold’s rule.

Dependency theorists believe large economic growth is not necessarily the key to reducing poverty and developing.  Instead, poor countries are trapped by large debts which prevent them from developing.  For example, between 1970 and 2002, the continent of Africa received $540 billion in loans from wealthy nations and from the World Bank and IMF.  African countries have paid back $550 billion of their debt but they still owe $295 billion.  The difference, of course, is a result of compound interest.  Countries cannot focus on economic or human development when they are constantly paying off debt.  In addition, economic relationships between countries tend to benefit the wealthier countries.  Some of the land in Cape Verde for example, could be planted and harvested to feed people but is planted instead with cash crops for foreign exchange.  Due to indebtedness and foreign dependence, fresh produce is regularly sold or changed to a nonperishable type such as canned tuna for export rather than consumed by the population.  Widespread malnutrition is one of the effects of this foreign dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter2009&quot;/&gt; This is common around the globe.  Brazil is the second largest exporter of agricultural products but 50% of its population is malnourished.  Although Ethiopia has one of the largest populations of cattle in Africa, and much of the population suffers from malnutrition, the government continues to export large numbers of cattle to the Middle East.  Even during the peak of the infamous 1985 famine, the government was sending dried meat to Egypt.  Sen and Grown&lt;ref name=&quot;Sen1987&quot;&gt;Sen, G. &amp; Grown, C., 1987. Development, crises, and alternative visions. New York: Monthly Review.&lt;/ref&gt; call this denationalizing of the Global South.  Foreign trade and business get in the way of the freedom of local governments.
 
===World Systems Theory===
[[File:Pic 6 ethiopia simple house.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Picture 6. A simple house in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.]]
This theory, similar to dependency theory, suggests that wealthy countries benefit from other countries and also exploit their citizens.  This reflects Immanuel Wallerstein’s theory that suggests that how a country is integrated into the capitalist world system is the key feature in determining how economic development takes place in that country.  The world economy is a system divided into a hierarchy of three types of countries: core, semiperipheral, and peripheral.  Core countries (e.g., U.S., Japan, Germany) are dominant capitalist countries characterized by high levels of industrialization and urbanization.  Semiperipheral countries (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa) are less developed than core nations but are more developed than peripheral nations.  Peripheral countries (e.g., most African countries and low income countries in South America) are dependent on core countries for capital, and have very little industrialization and urbanization.  Core countries own most of the world’s capital and technology and have great control over world trade and economic agreements.  Semiperipheral countries generally provide labor and materials to core countries.  Semiperipheral countries exploit peripheral countries, just as core countries exploit both semiperipheral and peripheral countries. Core countries extract raw materials with little cost.  They can also set the prices for the agricultural products that peripheral countries export regardless of market prices, forcing small farmers to abandon their fields because they can’t afford to pay the labor and fertilizer.  The wealthy in peripheral countries benefit from the labor of poor workers and from their own economic relations with core country capitalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benokraitis2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2011&quot;/&gt;

===The New International Division of Labor theory===
Based on the changing nature of the world economy, production is divided into small pieces, each of which can be moved by a Transnational Corporation (TNC) to any country in the world that can provide the best deal on capital and labor.  When moving businesses and factories to cheap labor locations, effort is not made to create better quality of living and development projects in poor countries.  Strict laws protecting the environment and the rights of workers, which must be followed in the U.S. and Europe, do not have to be followed in many poor countries.  This is attractive for a TNC so that bottom line profits can increase.  In many factories, workers are often exploited by low wages, long hours, and poor working conditions.  Wal-Mart factory workers in China report working fourteen hours a day for less than $3 per day in a hot room with only one fan.  One woman described that rent was deducted from her wages, even after she moved out of the dormitory.  During official inspection from outsiders, workers were taught how to lie about working hours and how to present fake pay slips.  Workers also faced the threat of physical harassment from managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraveNewFilms2005&quot;/&gt; There are about 65,000 TNCs across the world today.  TNCs continue to take materials and cheap labor from underdeveloped countries.

| First, you have to understand that I’m terrified of snakes.  Although it might have been a dream, I’m fairly certain one tried to kill me in my crib as a baby, and even if I’m wrong, I would likely need a really good reason to get near a snake.  Second, you have to understand that my curiosity may likely kill me, if not today, one day.  Ever since I can recall I wanted to know, see, read, and do everything at least once.  You have to understand that because otherwise my being where I went makes no sense.  Third, you have to understand that you have not known terror until you find yourself – as a person terrified of snakes – in a small wooden church in south Georgia watching people toss snakes back in forth while speaking in tongues and calling on gods you don’t believe in.

Once you understand all three of these things, you may have an idea of what it felt like for me to sit, then stand, then sit, then stand, over and over again while one person after another held a rattlesnake over this or that offering or Bible.  It may still seem insane to you (my presence at a snake-handling church, as well as the snake handling itself), but one thing you gotta give the seven year old in the faded jeans, the older lady with the pink glasses, and the balding man with a cross around his neck is that they must have really believed in their god if they were willing to swing rattlesnakes by the tail for a couple hours on any given night.  I did survive that night, but I don't remember everything that happened. After the 18th snake-handling believer asked me to hold a snake and I said, no the pastor had apparently had enough so he made a motion to toss a snake to me. I’m not sure if he actually tossed it or not since that’s the last thing I remember before I fainted!

==Introduction== 
[[File:Pagan-Shwezigon-Pagoda-main-Buddhas-Dec-2000-01.JPG|right|400px|thumb|The Shwezigon Pagoda Buddha in Myanmar.]]

Sociologists study religion the same way they study other social institutions, like education or government.  The aim is primarily to understand religions, but included in trying to understand religions is the aim of trying to predict what religions will eventually do (or what will become of religions).  To do this, sociologists employ demographic techniques, survey analysis, ethnography, and various other methodological approaches.  It is important to note at the beginning of this chapter that sociologists study religion not to prove, disprove or normatively evaluate religion.  Sociologists aren't interested in whether a religion is right or wrong.  This requires sociologists to assume a relativistic perspective that basically takes a neutral stance toward issues of right or wrong or true or false.  That said, the social scientific study of religion can be challenging from a faith standpoint as it provides alternative, naturalistic explanations for many elements of religion (e.g., the sources of conversion experiences&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;&gt;Batson, C. Daniel, Schoenrade, Patricia, and Ventis, W. Larry. 1993. Religion and the Individual: A Social-Psychological Perspective. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195062094&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Definitions of Religion==
The starting point for any study of religion should begin with a definition of the concept.  This is particularly important in the study of religion because the definition determines which groups will be included in the analysis.  Three general definitions have been proposed, each of which will be discussed briefly.  Each definition has its merits and detriments, but what one often finds is that the definition of religion employed by a particular researcher or in the investigation of a particular topic depends on the question being asked.  

===Sacred vs. Profane===
Perhaps the most well known definition of religion is that provided by [[w:Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1995. Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Free Press. ISBN 0029079373&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that the definition of religion hinged on the distinction between things that are sacred (set apart from daily life) and things that are profane (everyday, mundane elements of society). The sacred elements of social life are what make up religion. 

For example, the Torah in Judaism is sacred and treated with reverence and respect. The reverential treatment of the Torah would be contrasted with all sorts of more mundane things like cars or toys, which, for most people, are not considered sacred.  Yet, the acute reader will be quick to point out that for some, cars (and even toys) are considered sacred and treated almost as reverentially as the Torah is treated in Judaism.  This introduces one of the most significant criticisms of this definition - the typology can include things that are not traditionally understood to be religious (like cars or toys).  As a result, the definition is extremely broad and can encompass substantial elements of social life.  For instance, while most people in the United States would not consider their nationalism to be religious, they do hold the flag, the nation's capitol, and other national monuments to be sacred.  Under this definition, nationalism would be considered religion.

===Religion as Existential Questioning===
Another  definition of religion among social scientists (particularly social psychologists) views religion as any attempt to answer existential questions (e.g., 'Is there life after death?&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yinger1970&quot;&gt;Yinger, J. 1970. The Scientific Study of Religion. New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;).  This definition casts religion in a functional light as it is seen as serving a specific purpose in society. As is the case with the sacred/profane typology, this definition is also often critiqued for being broad and overly encompassing. For instance, using this definition, someone who attends religious services weekly but makes no attempt to answer existential questions would not be considered religious.  At the other extreme, an atheist who believes that existence ends with physical death, would be considered religious because he/she has attempted to answer a key existential question. (For a critique of this definition, see Dobbelaere&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobbelaere2002&quot;&gt;Dobbelaere, Karel. 2002. Secularization: An Analysis at Three Levels (Gods, Humans, and Religions). New York: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;.)

[[Image:Statue of Zeus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Greek god Zeus.]]

===Religion as Supernature===
The third social scientific definition views religion as the collective beliefs and rituals of a group relating to supernature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tylor1976&quot;&gt;Tylor, Edward Burnett. 1976. Primitive culture: Researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom. Gordon Press. ISBN 087968464X&lt;/ref&gt; This view of religion draws a sometimes ambiguous line between beliefs and rituals relating to empirical, definable phenomena and those relating to undefinable or unobservable phenomena, such as spirits, god(s), and angels.  This definition is not without its problems as well, as some argue it can also include atheists who have a specific position against the existence of a god (or gods). Yet because the beliefs and rituals are understood to be shared by a group, this definition could be argued to exclude atheists. Despite the problems with this last definition, it does most closely adhere to the traditional (and popular) view of what constitutes a religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2000&quot;&gt;Stark, Rodney and Finke, Roger. Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion. California: University of California Press; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church-Sect Typology==
Having defined religion, we now move to one of the most common classification schemes employed in sociology for differentiating between different types of religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1963&quot;&gt;Johnson, Benton. 1963. On Church and Sect. American Sociological Review. 28:539-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troeltsch1931&quot;&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. 1931. The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  This scheme has its origins in the work of Max Weber, but has seen numerous contributions since then.  The basic idea is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of ''sects'' to the equilibrium maintaining ''churches''.  Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.  The reader may notice that many of the labels for the types of religion are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably.  Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.

Before describing these different religions, it is important for the reader to understand that these classifications are a good example of what sociologists refer to as ''ideal types''.  Ideal types are ''pure'' examples of the categories.  Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually adheres to their ''ideal type'' classification will vary.  Even so, the classification scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.

[[image:Church-sect continuum.svg|center|thumb|600px]]

===Church and Ecclesia===
The first type of religion is the ''church''. The ''church'' classification describes religions that are all-embracing of religious expression in a society.  Religions of this type are the guardians of religion for all members of the societies in which they are located and tolerate no religious competition.  They also strive to provide an all-encompassing worldview for their adherents and are typically enmeshed with the political and economic structures of society.  

Johnstone&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnstone1997&quot;&gt;Johnstone, Ronald L. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Fifth Edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. ISBN 0131254367&lt;/ref&gt; provides the following seven characteristics of churches:
#claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate 'citizenship' with 'membership
#exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition
#very closely allied with the state and secular powers - frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement
#extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor
#employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination
#almost by definition gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks
#allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions

The classical example of a ''church'' is the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the past.  Today, the Roman Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of religious pluralism or competition among religions.  This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States.  The change from a ''church'' to a ''denomination'' is still underway in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.

A slight modification of the ''church'' type is that of ''ecclesia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vonWiese1932&quot;&gt;von Wiese, Leopold. 1932. Systematic sociology. Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body.  The state churches of some European countries would fit this type.

===Denominations===
The ''denomination'' lies between the church and the sect on the continuum.  Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society.  A denomination is one religion among many.  When churches and/or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnstone1997&quot;/&gt;
#similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times
#maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of religious pluralism
#rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some even actively pursue evangelization
#accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute
#follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression
#train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification
#accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches
#often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society

Most of the major religious bodies in the U.S. are denominations (e.g., Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans).

===Sects===
''Sects'' are newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a denomination).  Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to ''true'' religion. 

Interestingly, leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not entirely understood.  Most scholars believe that when sect formation does involve social class distinctions they involve an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status. An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).

Another interesting fact about sects is that after their formation, they can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination.  If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve.  If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior.  The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects.  The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an ''institutionalized sect'' can result.  Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development.  They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics.  Examples include: Hutterites and the Amish.

Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of Lutheranism).  Examples include: Methodists, Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists.

===Cults or New Religious Movements===
''Cults'' are, like sects, new religious groups.  But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group (though they often do).  The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to ''pure'' religion but rather the embracement of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scripture or new prophecy).  Cults are also more likely to be led by ''charismatic leaders'' than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.
[[Image:Falungongmay2005-2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Falun Gong practitioners in London; Falun Gong is a new religious movement.]]

Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies from many sources.  Cults emphasize the individual and individual peace.  Cults also tend to attract the socially disenchanted or unattached (though this isn't always the case; see Aho 1990 and Barker 1984).  Cults tend to be located in urban centers where they can draw upon large populations for membership.  Finally, cults tend to be transitory as they often dissolve upon the death or discrediting of their founder and charismatic leader.

Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations.  As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations.  Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics (e.g., Temple Worship among Mormons). But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the ''cult'' type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations.  Some denominations in the U.S. that began as cults include: Christian Science, and The Nation of Islam.

Finally, it should be noted that there is a push in the social scientific study of religion to begin referring to ''cults'' as ''New Religious Movements'' or ''NRMs''.  The reasoning behind this is because ''cult'' has made its way into popular language as a derogatory label rather than as a specific type of religious group.  Most religious people would do well to remember the social scientific meaning of the word ''cult'' and, in most cases, realize that three of the major world religions originated as cults, including: Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism.

==Theories of Religion==
Many of the early sociological theorists&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;&gt;Marx, Karl; McLellan, David. 2000. Karl Marx: Selected Writings. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0198782659.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed theories attempting to explain religion.  In addition to these classical approaches to understanding religion, one modern explanation for the continued high levels of religiosity will be proposed along with a social psychological explanation that will attempt to explain the continued attraction of religion. These theories approach religion from slightly different perspectives, trying to explain: (1) the function of religion in society; (2) the role of religion in the life of the individual; and (3) the nature (and origin) of religion.  

===Structural-Functional===
The ''Structural-Functional'' approach to religion has its roots in Emile Durkheim's work on religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;  Durkheim argued that religion is, in a sense, the celebration and even (self-) worship of human society. Given this approach, Durkheim proposed that religion has three major functions in society:
#social cohesion - religion helps maintain social solidarity through shared rituals and beliefs
#social control - religious based morals and norms help maintain conformity and control in society; religion can also legitimize the political system
#providing meaning and purpose - religion can provide answers to existential questions (see the social-psychological approach below)

The primary criticism of the structural-functional approach to religion is that it overlooks religion's dysfunctions.  For instance, religion can be used to justify terrorism and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juergensmeyer2000&quot;&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. 2000. Terror in the Mind of God. University of California Press. ISBN 0520240111&lt;/ref&gt;  Religion has often been the justification of and motivation for war.  In one sense, this still fits the structural-functional approach as it provides social cohesion among the members of one party in a conflict (e.g., the social cohesion among the members of a terrorist group is high), but in a broader sense, religion is obviously resulting in conflict, not the resolution of such.

===Social-Conflict===
The social-conflict approach is rooted in Marx's analysis of capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt; According to Marx, religion plays a significant role in maintaining the status quo.  Marx argued that religion was actually a tool of the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content.  Marx argued that religion is able to do this by promising rewards in the after-life rather than in this life.  It is in this sense that Marx said, &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the feeling of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless circumstances. It is the opium of the people... The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness&quot; (p. 72).&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt;  What Marx meant is that it would be necessary for the proletariat to throw off religion and its deceit about ''other-worldly'' rewards in order for the proletariat to rise up against the bourgeoisie and gain control over the means of production so they could realize ''this-worldly'' rewards. Thus, the social-conflict approach to religion highlights how it functions to maintain social inequality by providing a worldview that justifies oppression.

It should be reiterated here that Marx's approach to sociology was critical in the sense that it advocated change (in contrast to the ''knowledge for knowledge's sake'' approach). Because criticism of the system in place when he was writing was inherent in Marx's approach, he took a particular stand on the existence of religion, namely, that it should be done away with.

===Social Constructionist===
The ''social constructionist'' approach to religion presents a naturalistic explanation of the origins of religion.  Berger&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L. 1967, 1990 edition. The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory. Doubleday. ASIN B0006BQVHY&lt;/ref&gt; laid a framework for this approach, &quot;Religion is the human enterprise by which a sacred cosmos is established. Put differently, religion is cosmization in a sacred mode. Use of the word sacred in this context refers to a quality of mysterious and awesome power, other than man and yet related to him, which is believed to reside in certain objects of experience&quot; (p. 25).  In other words, for the social constructionist, religion is not created by (or for) supernatural beings but rather is the result of societies delineating certain elements of society as sacred.  In the social constructionist frame of mind, these elements of society are then objectified in society so they seem to take on an existence of their own.  As a result, they can then act back on the individual (e.g., the influence of a religion on the individual).

Another important element of religion discussed by Berger&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt; in his outline of the social constructionist approach is the idea of ''plausibility structures''.  According to Berger, 

:The reality of the Christian world depends upon the presence of social structures within which this reality is taken for granted and within which successive generations of individuals are socialized in such a way that this world will be real to them. When this plausibility structure loses its intactness or continuity, the Christian world begins to totter and its reality ceases to impose itself as self-evident truth. (p. 46)&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt;  

In short, plausibility structures are the societal elements that provide the support for a set of beliefs (not necessarily religious), including people, institutions, and the processes by which the beliefs are spread, e.g. socialization.  Another important element to consider of plausibility structures is mentioned by Berger, &quot;When an entire society serves as the plausibility structure for a religiously legitimated world, all the important social processes within it serve to confirm and reconfirm the reality of this world&quot; (p. 47).&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;/&gt;  In other words, in certain societies, every component of society functions to reinforce the belief system.  A good example of this may be Iran, where everything is structured to reinforce the Islamic faith as ''reality''.

===Religious Pluralism===
Religious pluralism is the belief that one can overcome religious differences between different religions and denominational conflicts within the same religion. For most religious traditions, religious pluralism is essentially based on a non-literal view of one's religious traditions, allowing for respect to be engendered between different traditions on core principles rather than more marginal issues. It is perhaps summarized as an attitude which rejects focus on immaterial differences and instead gives respect to those beliefs held in common.

The existence of religious pluralism depends on the existence of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is when different religions of a particular region possess the same rights of worship and public expression. Freedom of religion is consequently weakened when one religion is given rights or privileges denied to others, as in certain European countries where Roman Catholicism or regional forms of Protestantism have special status. (For example see the Lateran Treaty and Church of England; also, in Saudi Arabia the public practice of religions other than Islam is forbidden.) Religious freedom has not existed at all in some communist countries where the state restricts or prevents the public expression of religious belief and may even actively persecute individual religions (see for example North Korea).

Religious Pluralism has also been argued to be a factor in the continued existence of religion in the U.S.  This theoretical approach&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore1994&quot;&gt;Moore, R. Laurence. 1994. Selling God. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195098382&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that because no religion was guaranteed a monopoly in the U.S., religious pluralism led to the conversion of religions in the U.S. into capitalist organizations.  As a result, religions are now better understood as capitalist corporations peddling their wares in a highly competitive market than they are as monopolistic Churches like Roman Catholicism was prior to [[w:Reformation|The Reformation]] (or, some might argue, still is in Latin America) or as small, fervent, protest-like sects are.  The result of religious pluralism is, like capitalism generally in the U.S., a ''consumer'' attitude: people ''consume'' religion like they do other goods.  Because religions are good at marketing themselves as the providers of social psychological compensators (see below), they have been successful.

===Social-Psychological===
The primary social-psychological reason why religion continues to exist is because it answers existential questions that are difficult, if not impossible, to address scientifically.  For instance, science may not be able to address the question of what happens when someone dies other than to provide a biological explanation (i.e., the body's cells eventually die due to lack of nutrition, the body then decomposes, etc.).  Science is also unable to address the question of a ''higher'' purpose in life other than simply to reproduce or exist.  Finally, science cannot disprove or prove the existence of a higher being. Each of these existential components are discussed below in greater detail.

Studies have found that fear is a factor in religious conversion.  Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1997), in their book ''Amazing Conversions'', note that one of the primary motivations for people to seek religion was fear of the unknown; specifically, fear of the after-life and what it portends.  While fear likely does not motivate all religious people, it certainly is a factor for some.  Religion can provide a ''non-falsifiable'' answer to the question of what happens after people die.  Such answers can provide comfort for individuals who want to know what will happen when they die.

Religion providing a purpose in life was also a motivation found by Altemeyer and Hunsberger (1997) in their analysis of religious converts.  Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; and Spilka, Hunsberger, Gorsuch, and Hood&lt;ref name=&quot;Spilka2003&quot;&gt;Spilka, B.; Hunsberger, B.; Gorsuch, R.; Hood, R.W. Jr. 2003. The Psychology of Religion. The Guilford Press. ISBN 1572309016.&lt;/ref&gt; also point to this factor as an explanation for the continued interest in religiosity.  Interestingly, Diener,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1999&quot;&gt;Diener, E.; Suh, E. M.; Lucas, R. E., and Smith, H. L. 1999. Subjective Well-Being: Three Decades of Progress. Psychological Bulletin. 125(2).&lt;/ref&gt; in his research on subjective well-being (SWB) notes that one of the keys to high SWB (a.k.a. happiness) is a goal or purpose in life.  However, he introduces a caveat that is particularly telling for religious individuals – for the most positive impact on SWB, goals should be difficult but attainable.  ''Difficult but attainable'' is a good description of salvation for religious people. People have to work toward salvation, but they believe it can be achieved.  Thus, religion can provide a goal and purpose in life for people who believe they need one.

Belief in God is attributable to a combination of the above factors (i.e., God's existence alleviates fear of death and provides meaning), but is also informed by a discussion of [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialization]].  The biggest predictor of adult religiosity is parental religiosity; if a person's parents were religious when he was a child, he is likely to be religious when he grows up.  Children are socialized into religion by their parents and their peers and, as a result, they tend to stay in religions.  Alternatively, children raised in secular homes tend not to convert to religion.  This is the underlying premise of Altemeyer and Hunsberger's (1997) main thesis – they found some interesting cases where just the opposite seemed to happen; secular people converted to religion and religious people became secular.  Despite these rare exceptions, the process of socialization is certainly a significant factor in the continued existence of religion.

Combined, these three social-psychological components explain, with the help of religious pluralism, the continued high levels of religiosity in the U.S.  People are afraid of things they do not understand (death), they feel they need a purpose in life to be happy (a.k.a. SWB), and they are socialized into religion and believing in God(s) by parents.

==World Religions and Religious History==
[[Image:Alte Synagoge Essen.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Jewish synagogue.]]

There are five notable ''world'' religions:
*[[w:Christianity|Christianity]]
*[[w:Hinduism|Hinduism]]
*[[w:Islam|Islam]]
*[[w:Buddhism|Buddhism]]
*[[w:Judaism|Judaism]]

Traditionally, these have been considered ''world'' religions due to their size and/or influence on society.  A detailed description of these religions is beyond the scope of this chapter and the interested reader is encouraged to follow the above links for more information.  

One note is, however, in order concerning these religious groups. The classification of these groups as ''world'' religions is, like all classifications, artificial.  Considering the remarkable dissimilarity between these five religious bodies, that they are grouped together at all is remarkable.  Three are ''religions of the book'' and can be practiced somewhat distinctly from one’s primary cultural identity (e.g., being an American and Episcopalian), while two are better understood as synonymous with culture (Buddhism and Hinduism), though this distinction is waning as a result of globalization.  Additionally, the religions of the book have numerous branches, some so dissimilar that there is more contention within the world religions than between them (e.g., Mormons vs. fundamentalist Christians, Catholics vs. Episcopalians).  Finally, while four of these religious groups are very large in size, Judaism is not.  The [[w:Irreligion|nonreligious]] - individuals without a religious affiliation - are actually a larger percentage of the world's population than Hindus, Buddhists, and Jews. There are also numerous other, smaller religious groups, like [[w:Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] or [[w:Ethnic religion|ethnic or tribal religions]], but they tend to be quite small and are either part of a local culture or related to the five world religions noted above. In short, classification as a world religion seems a little arbitrary.  Even so, familiarity with these major religions is a good starting point for learning about religion.

==Religion and Other Social Factors==
===Religion and Gender===
Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; provide a clear summary of the differences in religiosity between men and women (transgender religious experience was not observed in the study):

:There is considerable evidence that women are more likely to be interested and involved in religion than men. Women rate their religious beliefs as important more than do men, and they are more likely to report having had a religious or mystical experience... More women than men report having attended religious services in the past week (46% compared with 33%); more women hold membership in a church or synagogue (74% compared with 63%); and more women report watching religious programs (53% compared with 44%). Women are more likely than men to read the Bible at least monthly (56% compared with 41%) and to report having &quot;a great deal of confidence&quot; in organized religion (62% compared with 52%)... Among Christian denominations, as one moves away from the established, traditional churches (e.g., Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Episcopal) toward newer, less traditional ones (e.g., Assembly of God, Pentecostal) the proportion of women members relative to men increases... In sum, although the differences are not always large, they are remarkably consistent: Women appear to be more religious-than-men. (p. 33)

One explanation for the greater involvement of women in religion is socialization.  Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; discuss the idea that women may be socialized into roles in which religion is more highly emphasized than it is in men's roles.  In fact, since many major denominations (see below for more on these dynamics) emphasize women's submission to god and men, many religious traditions may aid feminine socialization associated with developing submissive, nurturing, and subordinate social roles.  Recognizing these patterns, scholars have argued religion may play a pivotal role in the construction and maintenance of gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush2010&quot;&gt;Bush, Evelyn.  2010.  Explaining Religious Market Failure:  A Gendered Critique of the Religious Economies Model.  Sociological Theory 38(3): 304-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-intuitively (unless gender inequality is one of the primary goals or functions of much religion), even though women are more religious than men, many religions continue to disenfranchise women.  Roughly 50% of the major denominations in the U.S. today do not allow women to be ordained or otherwise serve in ways that are equal to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1999. Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Denominations that do not allow female ordination include: Roman Catholicism, Southern Baptists, and Mormons.  The primary reasons these religions refuse to allow women to be ordained are Biblical literalism (believing the Bible is the literal word of god and not believing that it is a historical work written in a different time) and sacramentalism (the belief that the person performing sacramental rituals must represent Jesus in his &quot;manliness&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  However, Chaves, who delineated these reasons in his book on female ordination, notes that these are more akin to &quot;manifest&quot; reasons and the real or latent reason is because these religions continue to cater to a specific market niche - individuals who oppose modernity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  Fundamentalist religions in general - including fundamentalist Islam and fundamentalist Christianity - aim primarily to retain the power of men and subjugate women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;

Even within the religions that do allow women equal rights and ordination, women experience discrimination.  Women who pursue ordination in these religions find it harder to find a job pastoring a congregation, are more likely to be assistant pastors than are men, and are more likely to find jobs in congregations that are smaller, rural, and/or pay less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1999&quot;/&gt;  As of 2006, women make up about 15% of clergy in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatisticalAbstract2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/labor_force_employment_earnings/employed_persons.html Statistical Abstract 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and Race===
Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; provide a clear summary of differences in religiosity by race (limited presently to Americans of African and European descent).  They include five distinctions in their discussion. If you are an American of African descent, you are more likely to:
#attend religious services
#hold traditional religious beliefs
#feel strongly about your religious beliefs 
#report having had religious experiences 
#consider religion to be important in your life - both when you were growing up and as an adult

Batson et. al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; attributes this to the religious institutions' role in the lives of Americans of African descent.  Religion has been one of the primary resources that African descendants have drawn upon since their arrival in the U.S.  Religion has provided a sense of community and support for African-Americans and was also extremely influential in the Civil Rights Movement&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris1984&quot;&gt;Morris, Aldon D. 1984. The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement. New York: The Free Press. ISBN 0029221307&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, religion has a more prominent role in the day-to-day lives of African-Americans.

Religion is also divided by race.  Only 8% to 10% of congregations in the U.S. today are multi-racial (meaning no one race/ethnicity makes up more than 80% of the congregation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;&gt;Emerson, Michael O., and Christian Smith. 2001. Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; There are complicated historical reasons for this.  During the U.S. period of slavery, blacks and whites worshiped in the same churches, though blacks were relegated to the balcony and primarily taught to be obedient to their masters.  After the American Civil War, former slaves left the white-dominated religions and created their own as they were mistreated in the white-dominated churches.  Today, predominately black churches and predominately white churches remain distinct with very few churches catering to mixed race congregations (though megachurches tend to be more multi-racial).&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt;

Emerson and Smith&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt; convincingly argue that white Evangelical Christians in the U.S., because of their belief in individualism, actually contribute to racial inequality.  This is the result of white Evangelicals refusing to see structural factors that contribute to inequality and their proclivity to blame poor blacks for their poverty. White Evangelical Christians are more likely to attribute black/white inequality it to innate biological inferiority or laziness than are white Mainline Christians and the non-religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;/&gt;  Further, archival research has revealed that opposition to the Civil Rights Movement - and especially the desegregation of schools - was one of the primary reasons (alongside lesbian/gay movements, women's rights movements, and abortion politics) for the rise of Evangelical movements like the Religious Right (in both politics and American society) in the 1970's and 1980's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fetner2008&quot;&gt;Fetner, Tina.  2008.  How the Religious Right Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism (Social Movements, Protest and Contention).  University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, scholars continue to attempt to ascertain what role &quot;race&quot; plays in the social construction of white Evangelical identities, movements, and political operations.

===Religion and Class===
Socioeconomic status (SES) or class tends to be associated more with how religion is practiced rather than degree of religiosity (i.e., very religious vs. not very religious).  Members of lower classes tend to associate with more fundamentalist religions and sect-like groups.  Members of the middle class tend to belong to more formal churches.  &quot;In the United States, Presbyterians and Episcopalians tend to be above average in SES; Methodists and Lutherans about average; and Baptists and members of Protestant fundamentalist sects below average&quot; (pp.38-39).&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt;  These variations in SES by religious groups are illustrated in the figure below.

===Religion and Education===
Like income, educational attainment tends to vary by religious group.  People in more fundamentalist religious groups tend to have lower levels of educational attainment while people in more liberal religious groups tend to have higher levels of educational attainment.  This relationship between education and religion is illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Educational Ranking by Religious Group - 2001.png|thumb|600px|center]]

An important study by Johnson&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson1997&quot;&gt;Johnson, Daniel Carson. Formal Education vs. Religious Belief: Soliciting New Evidence with Multinomial Logit Modeling. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 1997; 36:231-246.&lt;/ref&gt; draws a complex but interesting picture of the relationship between religion and education attainment.  Johnson found a dichotomization of religiosity as a result of college education.  Those who make it through college with their religious beliefs intact tend to be more devout than those who do not attend college to begin with yet remain religious.  On the other side, those who don't make it through college with their religious beliefs intact end up far less orthodox and are more likely to disavow religion altogether.  The relationship between education and religiosity is a dichotomization – college education strengthens both religiosity and irreligiosity, it just depends on where you end up.  Johnson's finding is particularly insightful in light of the social psychological theory of [[w:cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance]], which argues that religious people will (at least initially) reinforce their beliefs in light of disconfirming evidence.

===Religion and Health===
According to Batson et. al.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Batson1993&quot;/&gt; the relationship between religion and mental health is highly nuanced.  In order to understand this nuanced relationship, it is necessary to clarify the different types of religiosity Batson et. al. are studying.  Batson et. al. distinguish between three types of religiosity.  These types or orientations stem from the work of Gordon Allport who distinguished two types of religiosity and provided their corresponding labels: intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity.  Extrinsic religiosity refers to people who use religion as a means to an end (e.g., social contacts).  Intrinsic religiosity refers to people who see religion as the end (e.g., religion is the answer to life's questions).  Batson et. al. add a third – quest religiosity.  Quest religiosity refers to the religious seeker who constantly asks questions and may not believe there are any clear answers to them.

If one does not take into consideration the different types of religiosity (i.e., extrinsic, intrinsic, and quest), religion tends to be associated with poorer mental health (p. 240). Specifically, Batson et. al. find a negative relationship between religion and three components of mental health, &quot;personal competence and control, self-acceptance or self-actualization, and open-mindedness and flexibility&quot; (p. 240). 

However, if one does take into consideration the different types of religiosity, then intrinsic and quest oriented individuals tend to see mental health benefits from their religious involvement.  Extrinsically-oriented individuals, on the other hand, find that their religious involvement results in a negative influence on their mental health (p. 289).

==The Future of Religion==
Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists, religion  continues to play a vital role in the lives of individuals.  In America, for example, church attendance has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years.  In Africa and South America, the emergence of Christianity has occurred at a startling rate.  While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million.  The rise of Islam as a major world religion, especially its newfound influence in the West, is another significant development. In light of these developments, sociologists have been forced to reconsider the early proclamations of the demise of religion.  In addition to discussing secularization and how the theory has been modified due to the continued existence of religion, religious fundamentalism is briefly touched upon as it is playing a significant role in society today.

===Secularization===
'''Secularization''' is a varied term with multiple definitions and levels of meaning.  It should also be noted that in addition to multiple definitions, secularization is both a ''theory'' and a ''process''.  By theory, it is meant that some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx2000&quot;/&gt; (e.g. [[w:Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[w:Max Weber|Weber]]) believed that as society modernized it would also see a decline in levels of [[w:religiosity|religiosity]].  This understanding of classical secularization theory is currently being refined and modified (see discussion below).  The 'process' component of secularization would refer to how the theory is actualized. It is in this sense that secularization has multiple definitions.  The most common meaning is in reference to the decline of levels of religiosity in society, but this is a broad and diffuse meaning that should be clarified by referring to one of the more specific meanings outlined below.

Sommerville&lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerville1998&quot;&gt;Sommerville, C. J. 1998. &quot;Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term 'Secularization'.&quot; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined six (6) uses of the term ''secularization'' in the scientific literature.  The first five are more along the lines of ''definitions'' while the sixth application of the term is more of a 'clarification of use' issue:
#When discussing social structures, secularization can refer to [[w:differentiation|differentiation]].  Differentiation (or specialization) is a reference to the increasing division of labor and occupational specialization in society.  While some might consider this a foray into social ''progress'', few would argue that modern societies are less differentiated than more primitive, tribal societies (following the work of [[w:Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski|Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski]]).
#When discussing institutions, secularization can refer to the transformation of an institution that had once been considered religious in character into something not thought of as religious.  A good example of this type of secularization (and differentiation, for that matter) is the transition of Harvard University from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).
#When discussing activities, secularization refers to the transfer of activities from institutions of a religious nature to others without that character.  While the trend toward government assistance in social welfare seems to be reversing in recent years, for much of the 20th century activities that had been in the religious domain  (e.g. soup kitchens) were slowly moving into the secular (or a-religious) realm, often that of government.
#When discussing mentalities, secularization can refer to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns.  This is the most common understanding and usage of the term at the individual level and refers specifically to personal religious decline or movement toward a [[w:secular|secular]] lifestyle.
#When discussing populations, secularization can refer to a societal decline in levels of religiosity (as opposed to the individual-level secularization of definition four).  It should be noted that this understanding of secularization is distinct from definition one (1) in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.  A clear example of this definition of secularization would be the declining religious affiliations in much of modern Europe.
#When discussing religion generally, secularization can only be used unambiguously when referring to religion in a generic sense.  For example, to argue that Christianity is 'secularizing' is not clear unless one specifies exactly which elements of which version of Christianity are being discussed.  What's more, depending on the venue of the discussion, these elements of Christianity may not be recognized by other 'Christian' groups as elements of their version of Christianity.  Thus, if you are interested in discussing religious decline within a specific denomination or religion, you need to specify which elements of that specific group you believe are declining, as Christianity is too variably defined to allow for generalizations for a specific denomination.

===Current Issues in the Study of Secularization===
At present, secularization (as understood in definition five above) is being debated in the sociology of religion.  Some scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark2002&quot;&gt;Stark, Rodney, Laurence R. Iannaccone, Monica Turci, and Marco Zecchi. 2002. &quot;How Much Has Europe Been Secularized?&quot; Inchiesta 32(136):99-112.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining (though their argument tends to be limited to the U.S., an admitted anomaly in the developed world).  As there appears to be some merit to this position, other scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1994&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1994. &quot;Secularization As Declining Religious Authority.&quot; Social Forces 72(3):749-74.&lt;/ref&gt; have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of individual level religious decline by arguing that secularization can also refer to the decline of religious authority.  In other words, rather than using a-religious apostates as the solitary measure of a population's secularity, neo-secularization theory argues that individuals are increasingly looking outside of religion for authoritative positions on different topics.  Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion is no longer the authority on issues like whether to use birth control and would therefore argue that while religious affiliation may not be declining in the U.S. (a debate still taking place), religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place.

===Religious Fundamentalism===
[[Image:Wtc-2004-memorial.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The destruction of the World Trade Centers in 2001 was inspired by the extreme views of religion.]]

''Fundamentalism'' describes a movement to return to what is considered the defining or founding principles of a religion. It has especially come to refer to any religious enclave that intentionally resists identification with the larger religious group in which it originally arose, on the basis that fundamental principles upon which the larger religious group is supposedly founded have become corrupt or displaced by alternative principles hostile to its identity. A full analysis of what constitutes religious fundamentalism is beyond the scope of this chapter.  However, the interested reader is encouraged to explore this topic further by reading the Wikipedia article on [[w:fundamentalism|fundamentalism]].

Religious fundamentalism is of great importance to sociologists because of its increasingly prominent role in social life, especially politics. Kenneth Wald&lt;ref name=&quot;Wald2003&quot;&gt;Wald, Kenneth D. 2003. Religion and Politics in the United States. Fourth ed. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.. ISBN 0742518418&lt;/ref&gt; points out how religious fundamentalism can be detrimental to politics, specifically a democratic system. The fundamentalist approach to politics can hurt a democratic system because of fundamentalists' unwillingness to compromise. Religious fundamentalists tend to take the view that 'God said it, so it will have to be this way.' Because anything short of God’s will is unacceptable, religious fundamentalists don't allow for a middle ground - which is a vital element of the democratic process. While widely associated with religious fundamentalism, suicide bombers are not exclusively religious; only 43% are identifiably religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;brym2007&quot;&gt;brym, robert j. 2007. “six lessons of suicide bombers.” Contexts 6:40-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most suicide bombings are for strategic, political reasons, and usually involve a dispute over resources.  Religion can serve as a justification and can even help motivate the bombers, but not all terrorism is inspired by religion and religious fundamentalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;brym2007&quot;/&gt;

What the future of religious fundamentalism holds for human society is unknown, but because of the impact of this particular religious approach on society today, religious fundamentalism warrants continued study.

==Discussion Questions==
* If religions are social constructions, does that have implications for their beliefs?
* If you were born and raised in a different culture, would you have a different religion (or no religion)?
* Is religion generally a positive contributor to society or a negative one?
* Why do people often say that you shouldn't talk about religion in polite company?  Why is religion special in this regard?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Systems theory''' or '''general systems theory''' or '''systemics''' is an interdisciplinary field which studies systems as a whole. Systems theory was founded by [[w:Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]] and others between the 1940s and the 1970s on principles from physics, biology and engineering and later grew into numerous fields including philosophy, sociology, organizational theory, management, psychotherapy (within family systems therapy) and economics among others. Cybernetics is a closely related field.  In recent times '''complex systems''' has increasingly been used as a synonym. 

==Overview==

Systems theory focuses on complexity and interdependence.  A system is composed of regularly interacting or interdependent groups of activities/parts that form whole.  

Part of systems theory, ''system dynamics'' is a method for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system -- the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components -- is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are chaos theory and social dynamics.  

Systems theory has also been developed within sociology. The most notable scientist in this area is [[w:Niklas Luhmann|Niklas Luhmann]] (see Luhmann 1994).
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory as organizations are dynamic living entities that are goal-oriented.  The systems approach to organizations relies heavily upon achieving negative entropy through openness and feedback.

In recent years, the field of ''systems thinking'' has been developed to provide techniques for studying systems in holistic ways to supplement more traditional reductionistic methods.  In this more recent tradition, systems theory is considered by some as a humanistic counterpart to the natural sciences.

==History==

Subjects like complexity, self-organization, connectionism and adaptive systems had already been studied in the 1940s and 1950s, in fields like cybernetics through researchers like [[w:Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]], [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] and Heinz Von Foerster.  They only lacked the right tools, and tackled complex systems with mathematics, pencil and paper. John von Neumann discovered cellular automata and self-reproducing systems without computers, with only pencil and paper. [[w:Aleksandr Lyapunov|Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[w:Jules Henri Poincaré|Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of chaos theory without any computer at all.

All of the &quot;C&quot;-Theories below - cybernetics, catastrophe theory, chaos theory,... - have the common goal to explain complex systems which consist of a large number of mutually 
interacting and interwoven parts. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]], and artificial life (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general complex systems.  The best context to compare the different &quot;C&quot;-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when
Edward Lorenz accidentally discovered a strange attractor with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without computers today.

===Timeline===
*1960 cybernetics (W. Ross Ashby, Norbert Wiener) Mathematical theory of the communication and control of systems through regulatory feedback. Closely related: &quot;control theory&quot; and &quot;general systems theory&quot; founded by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and W. Ross Ashby
*1970 catastrophe theory (René Thom, E.C. Zeeman) Branch of mathematics that deals with bifurcations in dynamical systems, classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances.
*1980 chaos theory (David Ruelle, Edward Lorenz, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Steve Smale, James A. Yorke....) Mathematical theory of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes bifurcations, strange attractors, and chaotic motions.
*1990 complex adaptive systems (CAS) (John H. Holland, Murray Gell-Mann, Harold Morowitz, W. Brian Arthur,..)  The &quot;new&quot; science of complexity which describes emergence, adaptation and self-organization was established mainly by researchers of the SFI and is based on agents and computer simulations and includes multi-agent systems (MAS) which have become an important tool to study social and complex  systems. CAS  are still an active field of research.

== References ==
There are four comprehensive world-wide stamp catalogues currently published on an annual or less frequent regular basis.  They are all multi-volume publications.  Nothing suggests that any of them makes any attempt whatsoever to provide information consistent with any of the others.  The information on any one can completely contradict the information on the others, and often does.  All of these catalogues have been produced in many editions, and some degree of consistency is maintained between successive editions.  Users should be aware, however, that correction and updating of information is common.  References to these and frequently re-edited national and regional catalogues will not normally show the edition unless some point needs to be brought to the attention of the reader.  Anyone working with the material should still prefer the most recent editions available.

The four world-wide catalogues are
* '''''[[w:Stanley Gibbons catalogue|Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue]]''''' produced in English by the Stanley Gibbons Company of London, England.  It tends to be the standard reference in most Commonwealth countries except Canada.  A Gibbons catalogue number is referenced with &quot;'''SG'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Michel catalog|Michel Katalog]]''''' produced in German by the Michel Company of Munich.  A Michel catalog number is referenced with &quot;'''Mi'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Scott catalogue|Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalog]]''''' produced in English by the Scott Publishing Co. of Sidney, Ohio, USA.  It tends to be the standard reference in North America.  A Scott catalog number is referenced with &quot;'''Sc'''&quot;.
* '''''[[w:Yvert et Tellier|Yvert et Tellier catalogue de timbres-poste]]''''' produced in French by Éditions Yvert &amp; Tellier of Amiens, France.  An Yvert catalogue number is referenced with &quot;'''YT'''&quot;.

Other world-wide catalogues which are no longer in production, such as those by Minkus and Senf, will be described as needed.  Catalogues and other reference works relevant to only a small number of countries will be described where needed.

== Introduction ==
In descending order of number of species, the orders of insects are:
# Coleoptera (Beetles)
# Lepidoptera (Butterflies and moths)
# Diptera (Flies)
# Hymenoptera (Wasps, bees, and ants)
# Hemiptera (true bugs)
# Orthoptera (Grasshopers, crickets, and mantids)
# Odonata (Dragonflies and damselflies)

== Coleoptera ==

=== ''Coccinella septempunctata'' ===
[[Image:Ladybird.jpg|150px|thumb|left|An adult ''C septempunctata'']]
The seven-spotted ladybird (or ladybug) is a very common beetle found in both North America and Europe, and is an important predator of aphids.
[[Image:Marienkäferlarve (Coccinellidae)  1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Larval stage]]

=== ''Harmonia axyridis'' ===
[[Image:Harmonia axyridis.jpg|150px|thumb|left|An adult Asian lady beetle]]
The  Asian lady beetle (or harlequin ladybird) is a species that is similar to ''C septempunctata''. This species is also an important predator of aphids, however is causes more problems to humans, because they freqently overwinter in homes. The species is originally from East Asia, but was introduced to North America and Europe.
[[Image:HarAxy ontwikkeling.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The life-cycle of ''H axyridis''.]]

== Lepidoptera ==
=== ''Papilio'' ===
The genus Papilio includes many species that are well-known around the world. Such species are charchterised by their &quot;swallowtails&quot; for which they are named.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Swallowtail IMGP6264.jpg| ''Papilio glaucus'', Eastern Tiger Swallowtail
Image:Common Yellow Swallowtail - Papilio machaon I IMG 6962.jpg| ''Papilio machaon'', Old World Swallowtail
Image:Papilio xuthus 070707.jpg| ''Papilio xuthus'', Asian swallowtail
Image:Ppolyc.JPG| ''Papilio polyctor'', Common Peacock
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Danaus plexippus'' ===
[[Image:Monarch Butterfly 17-03-2006 6-44-40 p.m..JPG|150px|thumb|right]]
The Monarch butterfly is common in North America, as well as New Zealand and Australia. It is one of the few milkweed butterflies in North America. As larva, the monarch feeds on milkweed, which is poisonous. This poison persists in the monarch as an adult, which provides it protection from many predators. This is so successful, that ''Limenitis archippus'' (in the same family, but in a different subfamily) mimics the monarch so that it is not eaten by predators.

== Diptera ==
=== ''Musca domestica'' ===
[[Image:Musca.domestica.female.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Female ''Musca domestica'']]
The housefly is very common, and frequently lives with humans. Flies like butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis. In their larval stage they are called ''maggots'', in which they will feed on organic matter. After three instars, they become pupae, then emerge as adults. Like other insects, the purpose of the adult form is for mating— flies live only about one month after maturation.
Flies have sponging mouth-parts. They can only consume liquids, but can also apply digestive fluids to solids, and then ingest them as fluids.

=== Culicidae ===
Mosquitos are known particullarly for spreading disease. Mosquitos, like other flies, undergo compete metamorphosis. Eggs, larvae, and pupae develop in water, but the adult is terrestrial. The larvae also develop in three instars. The pupae then float to the surface of the body of water, so that the adults can emerge into the air.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:CulexNil.jpg| ''Culex quinquefasciatus''
Image:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg| ''Anopheles stephensi''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Hymenoptera ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:European wasp white bg.jpg| ''Vespula germanica''
Image:Honeybee landing on milkthistle02.jpg| ''Apis mellifera''
Image:Meat eater ant feeding on honey02.jpg| ''Iridomyrmex purpureus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Vespula'' ===
Yellowjackets are wasps that can be found in both Europe and North America. There are two particular species: ''Vespula germanica'' and ''Vespula vulgaris''. These are known as the German wasp and the common wasp, respectively. Yellowjackets are social insects— a queen builds a nest, usually of wood, and then lays eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae are carnivorous, and feed on other insects. Adult wasps feed on nectar. Though, often considered pests or harmful to humans, wasps are important predators of many other pests such as flies.

=== ''Apis'' ===
Honeybees are important plant pollinators.

:Resolved, user blocked, and damage fixed. You did the right thing in reverting the pictures. You could have also uploaded a non-offensive image over the top of the offensive one. Thanks for helping to fight vandalism on Wikibooks.
:PS: A better place to report the vandalism would have been the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

:Use the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] page to report damage. Picking a random admin is a good idea only if you are fairly sure that they are currently logged in. People may sleep, go on vacation, get busy at work, study for exams, go to the hospital, lose electrical power... Edits to the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] page will be spotted either via watchlists or via somebody looking over the [[Special:Recentchanges]] page.

== cake category/page merge ==

Hi, I've removed the speedy from the cake page. Any sort of restructuring like this should be discussed on Talk:Cookbook at least to let others know what you're going to do. I tend to think that merging the two '''is''' the correct thing to do, but would like others input first. Also, we're going to be getting the DynamicPageList extension installed which will allow us, for example, to list the pages in Category:Cake on the Cookbook:Cake page, so this might be another resolution. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:23, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
: It just doesn't make any sense to me to have a page with no purpose other than to point to another like that, it may as well be a REDIRECT at that point.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 20:31, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
:: I agree. I've added [[Talk:Cookbook#merging_of_type_and_category_pages]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:34, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

We should start doing this now that it's been posted on [[Talk:Cookbook]] for a while. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:01, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== yams ==

Ha. I mixed up the yam/sweet potato thing in the opposite direction. Thanks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:11, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== units ==

On the [[Cookbook:Cherry Brownies]] page, is that 1.5 square inches or 1.5 inches squared?

* 1.5 inches squared = 2.25 square inches (my guess)
* 1.5 square inches = 1.22 square inches

Since 1 square inch is equal to 1 inch squared, I suggest using that.

Another unconfusing way is to specify both dimensions.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:40, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

: Well, I could just do it as per square, considering.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:54, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

This wikibook has been growing over time in an uncontrolled way. A collaboration on this book would first work out in a discussion how to best organize the book, and then take action. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:00, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

This Wikibook is an explanation on what we all are participating to: Open Culture, It would be interesting to develop this Wikibook because it would explain to other people why we want to contribute to things like Wiki or Open Source. It gives us the possibility of understanding what we are doing. --[[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 08:33, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

This WikiBook is part of a project to provide educational materials in Africa where budgets do not extend to expensive
royalty laden books. The book is very close to being finished and with a concerted effort from a community like the WikiBooks community it could be finished very quickly. It's a first step on the way to providing educational materials to all. Education is the only way to facilitate lasting peace and stability in developing/3rd world countries.

* The three voters [[User:HeikoStamer|HeikoStamer]], [[User:Vanessa|Vanessa]], and [[User:Rianameyer|Rianameyer]] don't show any user contribution ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=HeikoStamer], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Vanessa], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Rianameyer]) other than the vote on this page. Although this is not part of the rules (yet?) I would suggest that these people make a couple of edits on a wikibook while logged in, before their votes can be counted. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 12:00, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* I agree, in principle, with the concerns raised by [[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]]. However, I would like to claim that these are somewhat unusual circumstances in that the voters are members of the FHSST project who have helped write the 375 page FHSST_Physics text that was uploaded to WikiBooks.  Because the book was uploaded in an advanced state its edit history is external to WikiBooks but does exist. Irrespective of what happens with vote counting we are all working towards the same thing which is great and I am very glad that people like [[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] are concerned about what happens on WikiBooks and are on the lookout for problems :) [[User:Marknewlyn|Marknewlyn]] 19:54, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*Agreed.  These may or may not be sockpuppets, but we can't risk it.  Their votes are nullified.  I have not removed them per se, but moved them.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 03:22, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

The [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]] for '''May''' is '''[[World History]]'''.

'''[[World History]]''' spans the breadth of human history, from the earliest evolution to the outlook for the near future.  It is currently run by a dedicated, though small, group of contributors known as the World History Project.  The book is based on the AP World History standard by the College Board, a college entrance examination board in the United States.  All users are asked to help contribute to this project over the course of the month.  For resources, visit the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|information page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rosebushes ==

A small point of contention:
In colloquial speech, is there really an extra syllable on rosebushes? Consider the word 'street.' S, T, and R are slurred together. Is it not similar with the SH and Z sounds in rosebushes? I don't really hear a vowel.

Is there a such thing as a half syllable?

I'm only an amateur linguist--very amateur--so I could certainly be wrong about this. Thoughts?

: I'm British and in my dialect &amp;lt;rosebushes&amp;gt; is certainly 3 syllabled (roughly /ɹoʊzbʊʃɪz/). Perhaps you don't hear a seperate vowel because you pronounce a syllabic /z/. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]]

A syllable is a unit of pronunciation with one vowel sound, and hence, can't be divided. There are, however, short (pull) and long vowels (pool) and monophthongs (bit), dipfthongs (boy) and triphthongs (fire), where the quality of the vowel changes. As I understand it vowels can be longer and shorter, but it just isn't possible to have half a vowel.


== Thanks ==

Thanks to whoever wrote this text! I start a linguistics program next week and have been trying to wrap my brain around many of the concepts addressed. Now I finally understand the difference between deep and surface structure. 

== Technology? ==

&quot;You may think of language as a technology. Depending on how you define the word, this is either a metaphor, or it is literal truth. It is the artificial use of natural phenomena — sounds, gestures, appearances, textures — for the purpose of communication.&quot;

I've removed that paragraph because 1. It's confusing, 2. Language use is instinctual, not &quot;artificial&quot;, 3. &quot;textures&quot; makes no sense here. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 20:46, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== My comments ==



Going through this book as someone who has never studied linguistics and giving some suggestions. Here they are:

I think that two things could be done to improve this introduction. First of all, it is very long, and there was one picture (plus the one of the fork I just added), making it difficult to read. I suggest finding more images to illustrate the text and taking a hatchet to the text and only including what's absolutely necessary and tightening up what still remains after that. To that end, I think the &quot;how do linguists study language&quot; could be removed pretty much entirely, since it basically states what the whole description vs. prescription section says, but less specifically and less eloquently. I also think the case studies could be shortened. Also the whole asterisk thing should be explained all at once.

Second, this page is a bit of a hodgepodge of many things with no clear progression or organization. I think if we sit down and decide what needs to go into an intro of a linguistics text (what is vital that doesn't fit into one of the later chapters). If any of this can be allocated to later chapters, then that should be done, too. So, any thoughts on what should stay and what should go? Personally I think that the idea that linguistics is a descriptive field is vital, although we should take care not to bash prescriptivists ;) . Any other thoughts?

:''Adapted from the public domain USDA article ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/ratites.htm FOCUS ON: Ratites (Emu, Ostrich, and Rhea)]''.''

Red meat is now on the &quot;wing&quot; into innovative restaurants and some meat markets. The latest in meat products is from the &quot;'''ratite'''&quot; family of flightless birds. It's lean and tastes like [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], but contains much less [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. In fact, ratite meat is even lower in calories than [[cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] and [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]].

==What are Ratites?==

Ratites are a family of flightless birds with small wings and flat breastbones. '''Ostrich''', '''emu''' and '''rhea''' are members of this family. Ostrich is native to Africa; emu, to Australia; and rhea, to South America -- particularly the grasslands of Argentina.

When fully grown, ostriches -- the largest birds in the world -- stand about seven to eight-feet tall and can weigh 300 to 400 pounds; emu are about six feet tall and weigh 125 to 140 pounds. Adult rheas are about five feet tall and weigh 60 to 100 pounds. The birds are 95-percent usable as meat, feathers, oil and leather.

==How are Ratites Raised?==

Newly hatched chicks usually weigh about two pounds and are about 10 inches tall. Young ratites must be sheltered in a warm place for their first weeks of life. Adolescent and adult birds are allowed to roam freely in fenced pastures or pens. Ratites need daily exercise to avoid leg and digestive problems.

The closely woven wire fences must be 6 to 8-feet high because ratites can leap over a 5-foot fence. Ratites are fed on grain supplemented by pasture. Ostrich was the first ratite to be raised in the U.S. There are now about 1,000 ostrich growers in the U.S. raising about 100,000 birds. Emu are now raised in at least 43 states by about 10,000 families (3,000 are in Texas). The emu population is about a million. Rheas are the newest U.S. farm-raised ratite, but there are currently over 15,000 rheas in the United States.

==Retail Cuts of Fresh Ratites==

Ratite meat is sold as steaks, fillet, medallions (small coin-shaped pieces of meat), roasts and ground meat. The most tender meat comes from the thigh or &quot;fan&quot;; meat also comes from the drum and forequarter.

;Are Ratites &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;White&quot; Meat?

Although ratites are poultry, the pH of their flesh is similar to beef. Therefore, they are classified as &quot;red&quot; meat. The raw meat is a very dark cherry red. After cooking, the meat looks like beef and the flavor is similar but a little sweeter.

==What Cooking Methods Can Be Used?==

The tenderness and texture of farmed ratite meat lends itself to light [[cookbook:Grilling|grilling]], [[Cookbook:Pan frying|pan frying]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]]. However, because ratite meat is so low in fat, care must be taken not to overcook it. Especially when roasting ratite meat, it is important to provide ample stock and moisten it, because due to its leanness, it will otherwise become very dry and tough. As a rule of thumb, anything that works for lean [[cookbook:venison|venison]] should work for ratite meat too.

Since ratites are classified as red meats, steaks and roasts can be safely cooked to medium rare (145 °F) up to well done (160 °F); ground meat should be cooked to 160 °F.

==What is the Cost Per Pound?==

At this time, emu, ostrich and rhea meat are specialty items available in restaurants and some stores. The meat is more expensive than beef, [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], chicken and turkey. However, the price will become more reasonable as the quantity of this meat becomes more widely available.

It is irrational to ignore the many double-blind government-sponsored studies that show MSG is harmless.

It is irrational to ignore the simple fact that some foods naturally contain up to 2% unbound glutamate,
including 1.2% in the popular parmesan cheese. The maximum useful MSG doze is 0.8%, because anything more
will max out your tase sensation. If added MSG is a problem, parmesan cheese is a worse problem.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page will host information on the mediums and manifestations of visual rhetoric, as seen in printed art, film, television, etc...

== Film ==

For any movie to be effective, the director must establish a connection between the characters and the audience.   This connection can be created through any number of ways.  For example, any junior athlete can feel a connection with the Mighty Ducks because they share common ambitions.  Likewise, any audience member can feel a connection to Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, because either they admire his cunning or they detest his lifestyle, or a combination of the two.  However, for a movie to truly captivate an audience, it must go beyond the acting and the writing.  Each scene must put the audience in a very specific mindset, and this is where the combination of auditory and visual rhetoric comes into play.

It is important to remember that for the most part films are narratives. They depict the story of a character or a set of characters and use our cultural and social norms in order to make us feel a certain way about these characters. These narratives may become arguments such as the case in Oliver Stone’s JFK where the filmmaker argues that the assassination was a conspiracy. However, some film may simply “persuade” the audience to become involved with the characters and be entertained by the film (112). It is important to keep in mind that in most films the objective is to make money, there may not always be a defined argument, but the persuasion to spend money on the film is usually there. 

When breaking down the rhetoric of a film or scene is it important to consider the “visual elements – camera movement, placement in the frame, color, spatial relationships among characters and between the viewer and the visual material, special visual effects, visual editing, and so on.” All of these elements make up the composition of the shot (115). This composition is then used by the viewer to make connections between themselves and the character. 

In David Blakeseley’s essay &quot;Defining Film Rhetoric&quot;, he discusses visual rhetoric in film as “…the study of symbolic inducement,” and using all available methods of sending messages to the audience (113).  This is to say that it examines the connection that is (hopefully) created between the film and the audience.  The connection is commonly referred to as audience identification.

So how does this all relate to identification with the characters and the movie?  One theory is that identification occurs in the subconscious.  This identification is prompted by various stimuli (visual or auditory) that occur in the conscious (117).  This is to say that as we watch a movie we are consciously aware of dialogue between characters, their physical settings, and the music or sounds that accompany the scene.  But then our subconscious takes these stimuli one step further, adding subconscious, emotional reactions to the stimuli.  When we see a red rose, we consciously perceive it as just that, but subconsciously we add to it the connotation of love and romance, to give it deeper meaning.  If romantic music is added to the visual then our emotional reaction to the scene becomes that much stronger.

In his directing, Alfred Hitchcock wanted to create identification between characters in addition to identification between the film and the audience.  The musical elements of a film contribute to this identification as well, as the music sets an overall tone for not just a specific character, but for anyone in the scene.  In Lost In Translation, a strong connection is developed between the two main characters, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) develop a very romantic, but non-sexual relationship during their stay at the same hotel in Tokyo, Japan.  The music that is played during their scenes together is not inherently romantic.  There is no Marvin Gaye or Frank Sinatra on the soundtrack.  Instead, the music is of a genre created just within the past few years.  This music, labeled “Trip-Hop”, uses vocals and lyrics more as a supplement to the music, rather than a foregrounded message.  The music production is deeply layered and mixes many different sounds in a non-intrusive manner.

The use of music as a supplemental rhetorical device to cinematic visual rhetoric is often times under-recognized, but is clearly an integral in late 20th and 21st century cinematography.  Without it, scenes would not be as meaningful to our subconscious, which would decrease our ability to establish a connection with the film and its characters.

== Advertising ==
Advertisements are more than celebrity endorsements, showing off products, interruptions in television programs, and pages in magazines. Advertisements surround us, whether or not we are aware of it and constantly attempt to persuade a target audience. Advertising is the most common manifestation of visual rhetoric and perhaps the most recognizable. Ever since the first advertisement in 1704, brands and companies have attempted to sell their ideas, products, and services to the public through various rhetorical strategies. 

In order for an advertisement to be effective it is important for advertisers to know the needs, motivations, and lifestyles of the target audience prior to the creation of an ad. The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade consumers to buy a particular product or service offered by a brand. When advertisements are well-planned and developed, they are not thought of as advertisements, but yet a form of communication. “At its best, it’s memorable, fresh, entertaining, and epitomizes some of the best visual communication anywhere,” (Ryan and Conover 424). 

The society we live in is very visually-inclined, meaning that individuals are drawn to images more than they are drawn to text. A visual message is more memorable than a verbal message because of its power of impact on an audience. Advertisers are aware of this and use it to their advantage by making the graphic element of advertisements the most predominant. 

Advertisers use various appeals to convey certain messages, create an image that the target audience can identify with, and build a relationship with the desired consumers. One of the more dominant rhetorical devices in advertising is the appeal to gender roles. (See: Gender and Visual Rhetoric) The first example of gender-directed advertising occurred in 1911 with a Woodbury Soap advertisement in the Ladies' Home Journal. Advertising can also appeal to historical context, as was the case in 1942 when the War Advertising Agency was created to help gain public support for America's involvement in World War II. 

In 1958, the National Association of Broadcasters banned the use of subliminal ads, messages which contain hidden messages that the audience would not consciously perceive, but would subconsciously absorb.
A concept is central to an advertisement’s success. The advertised brand requests to the hired agency that a certain message and concept be portrayed through the advertisement to an audience. The advertisers manipulate various components to illustrate the underlying concept. Advertisers create and reinforce a brand’s concept through the theme of a brand, the message, the product, the color choices, layout design, and the graphic elements. 

All advertisements contain the same elements: artwork, a headline, copy, and a logotype. The advertisers work hard to make sure all the components flow together and speak the same voice. Each element should reinforce and complement the others in order to create an effective advertisement that makes sense. The graphic component is often the dominant part of an advertisement because of its ability to persuade, inform, and entertain an audience. Advertisers use photographs to connect the advertisements to reality and to the audience; they also use graphics, artwork, and illustrations. In addition to the obvious visual components, advertisers also manipulate the headlines, logotypes, and copy to be visually appealing. Advertisers use specific typography, styles, and formats so that they are visually attractive and catch the audiences’ attention. Due to the limited time that advertisers have to capture and captivate the audiences’ attention, they make sure that every element is attractive and distinguishable. 

Advertising has become a major part of our culture as we see it in various mediums. Advertisements can be seen on TV and before movies, in magazines and newspapers, outdoors on billboards, posters, and buses, on the internet, and more recently in product placements. A product placement does not follow the standard guidelines for ads because they do not overtly sell a product, however, they promote a product indirectly through making an appearance in media. A product placement can be something as simple as the mentioning of a particular brand or using the actual product and showing the brand’s logo.  

Advertisements exemplify visual rhetoric because they encompass the components that make a text both visual and rhetorical through the design process and the purpose of the final product, to make someone think or act.

== Internet ==

''&quot;To be deeply literate in the digital world means being skilled at deciphering complex images and sounds as well as the syntactical subtleties of words.  Above all, it means being at home in a shifting mix of words, images and sounds.&quot;''

				-Richard Lanham''1''

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet Internet] as a medium of visual rhetoric has some unique characteristics.  On one hand, some rhetoricians believe it is a powerful tool of creation and publication but on the other hand, some rhetoricians are weary of its use and contend that the Internet and technology in general are not unbiased.  

The line between verbal text and image seems to blur sometimes, such as in typography.  Type faces, and graphics can easily manipulate the mood of an audience and ultimately have persuasive effects.  The existence of visual rhetoric on the Internet is more complex than matters of aesthetics.

Theories of visual rhetoric can be seen as ways to filter information and determine credibility on the Internet. Alignment, position, spatial orientation and size are also elements of visual rhetoric.

===Visual Literacy===

The first graphical web browser, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29 Mosaic], was introduced in 1992.  Since then, the Internet has become one of the largest sources of ''multimodal texts'' in existence.  Multimodal “texts,” or documents, are those that incorporate any combination of graphics, verbal text, animation and sound. This medium naturally lends itself to multimodal communication because, unlike printed material, “white space” is free.  Text and image can easily be viewed on a single page.

Most visual rhetoric scholars have come to the conclusion that ''visual literacy'' is a matter of being able to read multimodal texts.  These texts combine image and verbal text into a coherent whole, such as a news report on TV or a web page.''2''

The Internet also links thoughts and ideas through hypertext and hypermedia. Not only does this affect the way that an article might look, it has changed the way that people read. The idea behind hypertext, is that things that have already been written in one place need no be repeated. So a link leading to further information is created. ''9''

===Impact on Academia===
''“Electronic technology has prompted so hostile a response from the humanities establishment because it creates a different literacy from our customary print-based one.  As we have seen, electronic ‘text’ mixes word, sound and image in new ways.  It thus draws on different areas of the brain, and lays down different neural pathways within it.  In so doing, it affects ‘the organization of humanistic knowledge’ at the most fundamental organic level.”''

-Richard Lanham

Richard Lanham, Barbara Stafford and others believe that this criticism of Internet content stems from an ancient source—authority of the printed word over other means of communication. “Computers are forcing the recognition that texts are not ‘higher,’ durable monuments to civilization compared to ‘lower,’ fleeting images,” says Stafford.''3''

Impact on Academia There has been a huge impact of academia due to the Internet. Students often times do all their research on-line. While the Internet can be a very helpful tool, the credibility of a site must be taken into account. For instance, if a student were to use a wiki site such as this on as a source the data may be changed later, and his source would be flawed. There is also no way to make sure these sites are completely correct.

===Visual Conventions===

The reality is that we are presently interacting with more information in our daily lives than ever before.  “Information overload” can predictably be observed when college pages.  In a short amount of time, the page must develop the ethos necessary to obtain more than just surface credibility.  Authors must aim for ''earned credibility'', but in order to do so, one must first obtain ''surface credibility.''''4''

Studies like the [http://captology.stanford.edu/pdf/Stanford-MakovskyWebCredStudy2002-prelim.pdf Stanford Web Credibility Studies], are much more far reaching than just developing aesthetically pleasing sites.  It’s about making sites understandable and reducing the frustration of non-veteran surfers who just want to get some research done.  Making the Internet more professional, useable, and universal can benefit more than just the corporate world.  Right now, non-technical Internet use is blocked by issues such as browser compatibility, ridiculous numbers of plug-ins used to view certain file types, confusing navigation and error messages, just to name a few. Users who have been thwarted by these problems have a legitimate argument against Internet use—in many cases, little technological effort has been made to accommodate different audiences.  In addition to these barriers, every time a hoax site''5'' is made or a misleading graphic is used to direct a person to an unwanted sales pitch, Internet credibility as a whole sustains damage in the public view. These are issues that can be addressed rhetorically, since they greatly effect the audience’s reception.

Simply identifying characteristics of information design is interesting, but not ultimately practical to the study of rhetoric, since this method separates the text from context, and the meaning from the making.''6''   These connections are crucial to a deep understanding of the intentionally persuasive aspects of images.  

Visual conventions seem to be a viable solution to increasing the usability of the Internet.  [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia:  The Free Encyclopedia] is an example of a healthy, thriving visual rhetoric community.  Every entry in the Wikipedia is made by users by inserting information into a template.  The template makes it easy for users and contributors to navigate, with tabs at the top for “Discussion,” “Edit this page” and “History” of the changes made to a particular article.  It also aids navigation by making the search box and home page easily accessible from every article.

The site offers a full tutorial on the conventions of the Wikipedia for new contributors.  This tutorial and other pages about how to edit the encyclopedia establish important rules which contribute to the credibility and usability of the site.  Some examples of their established conventions include the wording of headings within the article, how to cite and link to sources, order of sections within the article, making an index (or the system can automatically make one) and how to include credentials, through use of the “Discussion,” “Edit this page” and “History” tabs.  When a site looks professional, audiences are more likely to be receptive.  

Every page of the Wikipedia is set up in the same way, making it extremely easy to use.  The audience only has to learn one set of visual conventions to navigate any Media Wiki site.''7''   This kind of template has not hindered content diversity at all, since images, text, hypertext, sound clips and film clips can all be accommodated by the Media Wiki code.  These sites also adhere to visual conventions that are already widely accepted such as placing legal and copyright information at the very bottom of the page, login links in the upper right corner, and a vertical bar containing frequently used links on the left side of the page.

One example of how visual conventions can be broken is selling ad space where the navigation bar at the left is expected to be.  Sometimes this integration is done intentionally so that surfers will accidentally leave the site they’re trying to view.  This creates frustration in the audience and causes the site’s credibility to decrease in the minds of these users.  Since ads are the main source of revenue for many sites, leaving them off websites is not an option.  Accepted visual conventions provide an easy solution to this problem.  It is widely accepted for sites to have ads in a vertical column down the right side of the page, making it easy for audiences to anticipate where certain content should be.  This is just one way to maintain the integrity and credibility of Internet content.

===Conclusion===

Some textual elements of a web page can be considered visual rhetoric.  For example, just seeing contact information at the bottom of a page can increase surface credibility, without considering what the text actually says.  Just its presence is a rhetorical element.  According to Chaim Perelman, theories of visual rhetoric and the Internet are reflective of the “turn in rhetoric,” the modern approach encompassing all persuasive texts, not just arguments.  He says,  “New rhetoric, or dialectic, covers the whole range of discourse that aims at persuasion and conviction, whatever the audience addressed and whatever the subject matter.”''8''

== Architecture/Interior Design ==

At the beginning of the Industrial Age, skyscrapers were bold statements of engineering achievement and power.  In the mid-20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright's residential architecture design was a statement of harmony between man and nature.  Just like works of traditional art can be rhetorical statements, so too can architecture.

For the purpose of this introduction, I will focus on the rhetoric used in the design of a casino.  When designing the floor plan of a casino, it is necessary to examine the location of every room, its purpose, and its connection (physical and otherwise) with other rooms or areas.  The location of the gaming rooms, restaurants, restrooms, and other high-traffic areas can serve as a rhetorical device.  For example, a much different outcome will be achieved by having bathrooms near every entrance than by having them located near gaming floors.  This strategic placement of items can itself serve as a rhetorical device.

Surprisingly, the manipulation of natural light can also serve as a very strong rhetorical device.  In casinos, natural light is purposefully blocked from coming into the building.  This serves to allow gamblers to lose their sense of time, which will keep them inside the casino for longer periods of time.

Similar practices in rhetoric are used in exterior and interior design, not only in commercial properties, but also in residential and public buildings as well.  Frank Lloyd Wright is recognized as the greatest American architect, and used rhetorical devices in designing his revolutionary buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

Drawing can be loosely defined as mark-making on a flat surface.  Usually, the mark-making device is a pencil and the flat surface is a sheet of paper, but many other combinations of tools and surfaces are possible.  As such, sometimes it is hard to categorize a work as drawing as opposed to some other kind of art, such as painting, printmaking, digital media, or sculpture, which often incorporate mark making.

Learning to draw is considered fundamental to learning to produce other forms of visual art.  Not only are the skills acquired through drawing useful, but a sketch is frequently the first step in producing new artwork.  Drawing is also popular because the necessary materials are cheap and widely available and because the drawing process is fast, direct, and can be done almost anywhere. Drawing is also very revealing as to an artist's ability - his or her understanding of form, grasp of visual poetry, and artistic vision. Master drawings are exquisite, breathtaking, and tell us more about the mind of the artist than a highly polished, fully rendered painting.

== Drawing tools ==

=== Dry media ===

==== Pencils ====

When most people think about drawing tools, they think of the ordinary &quot;number two&quot; pencil, most likely a yellow, hexagonal one, with a pink eraser on the end.  Pencils come in many different styles, however.

The marking core of the pencil is called the &quot;lead&quot;, although these days it doesn't contain any actual lead.  Most pencils contain graphite -- a silvery-gray form of carbon -- as their pigment, although other pigments such as charcoal or various colors are possible.

Graphite leads are rated in relative hardness.  On one side of the scale is &quot;9H&quot;, which is the hardest grade of pencil.  On the other side of the scale is &quot;9B&quot;, which is the softest (&quot;blackest&quot;) grade of pencil.  In the middle of the scale is the &quot;HB&quot; pencil, which corresponds to the standard &quot;number two&quot; pencil.  The &quot;F&quot; grade of pencil is a bit harder than &quot;HB&quot;.  Hardness is not necessarily consistent between brands of pencils; experiment to find a hardness that you feel comfortable with.

Hard lead qualities:
* Capable of very light strokes.
* Stays sharp longer.
* More likely to tear through paper.
* Brittle -- tends to break under pressure.

Soft lead qualities:
* Gives the darkest strokes.
* Dulls quickly.
* Soft -- tends to crumble under pressure.

Graphite is by nature somewhat brittle; care must be taken not to drop pencils or leads or the lead might break, even within a wood casing.

Pencil leads can be packaged in different ways.  The typical packaging is in a wooden casing, which requires a pencil sharpener or a knife to expose the pencil lead for drawing.  It is also possible to buy solid graphite sticks, usually wrapped in plastic, which can be used to make strong, bold marks on the page.  Mechanical pencils use metal or plastic device instead of a casing, feeding out a thin lead.  Lead holders can be thought of a hybrid between mechanical and traditional pencils, since they replace the wooden casing like mechanical pencils but also hold a lead of a thickness comparable to traditional pencils.

A property of mechanical pencils is that their thin leads produce a very even line, unlike thick-leaded pencils, which produce lines whose width varies slightly with pressure, allowing for more expressive linework.  Another property of thick-leaded pencils is that they can be applied to the paper at a sharp angle to quickly apply graphite in a thick shading stroke.  These properties tend to make mechanical pencils more desirable for precise drafting work and thick-leaded pencils more desirable for expressive drawing.

Colored pencils contain a pigment instead of graphite.  The binding material of colored pencil leads varies among brands, leading to different degrees of waxiness or blendability.  Watercolor pencils, a relatively recent development, use a water-soluble binding material which allows the artist to blend colors by brushing water over the artwork.  A special variety of blue pencil -- &quot;non-repro&quot; blue -- does not photocopy well; comic book artists typically use these pencils to lay out their artwork before tracing over it with regular graphite pencils.

Charcoal and conté pencils are simply pencils that contain a charcoal or conté crayon core instead of a graphite one.  See their respective sections below.

Grease pencils use a soft wax as a binding agent, wrapped in a rolled paper casing that is peeled away to expose the core.  Since they use wax as a binding agent, these pencils are similar to crayons.  They produce a bold, dark line which cannot be erased from paper.  They can also produce a temporary line on smooth surfaces that can be wiped away with a solvent; this makes them useful for marking glass or plastic before cutting, for example.

Pencils with wooden casings can come in a variety of shapes, including round or hexagonal.  Oblong or oval casings are also available, which some people find easier to hold and sketch with.  On one hand, they offer both thick and thin surfaces for mark-making.  On the other hand, they don't work in pencil sharpeners and must thus be sharpened with a knife.

For sharpening wood-cased pencils, a variety of mechanical solutions are available, from small, one-piece metal sharpeners, to hand-cranked sharpeners, to electric sharpeners.  An alternative to mechanical sharpening is to whittle the wood casing away with a pocket knife; although this gives an irregular shape to the lead, it allows you to choose as sharp or wide an angle of lead as you want.  Once the pencil is sharpened, some artists prefer to keep it sharp by shaping the point against a piece of scrap paper or sandpaper.  Some art stores sell little pads of sandpaper for this purpose.

==== Charcoals ====

Charcoal is a popular artist's tool because it produces an inky, matte black and can be easily manipulated with the fingers or other smudge tool.  Charcoal work tends to smear more easily than graphite work and usually requires a fixative (see below).  Charcoal is also harder to erase than graphite

Artist's charcoal comes in a variety of forms.  The most popular charcoal tools are compressed charcoal sticks.  With charcoal sticks, the artist can produce both lines (with the tip) and areas of value (with the side).  Charcoal-leaded pencils can also be purchased.

Vine charcoal is a piece of plant that has been turned to charcoal but has not been pulverized and compressed.  Vine charcoal can be held like a pencil or broken and used like charcoal sticks.  Since it has not been compressed, it tends to produce a lighter mark than compressed charcoal.

Some artists prefer to use charcoal powder applied directly to the art surface and manipulated with fingers or brush.  Charcoal or graphite powder can also be placed in a small fabric bag which is then rubbed against the art surface; this produces a subtle shading effect that can be smoothly varied across the page.

==== Metal: Silverpoint, Copperpoint ====


==== Chalks ====

==== Crayons ====

* Conté
* Cray-pas

==== Pastels ====

==== Erasers ====

* Simple rubber erasers (&quot;Pink Pearl&quot;-style)
* gum (crumbly) erasers
* plastic (white block or stick) erasers
* kneaded (&quot;Silly Putty&quot;-like) erasers.

* A note on using a large, clean brush to wipe away eraser crumbs instead of hands.

==== Smudging tools ====

Smudging tools are used to move pigment around on the drawing surface, blending or smearing it.  The simplest smudging tool is the finger, although care should be used not to damage the artwork with the oils from hands.  Cheap (lotion-free!) toilet paper, facial tissues, and Q-Tips can all be used as smudging tools.

Blending stumps (also known as &quot;tortillons&quot; or &quot;smudge sticks&quot;) are lengths of tightly rolled paper that come to a point at one or both ends.  Stumps are useful because they allow for precise blending, by using either the flat or tip of the point.  After a stump has built up an amount of graphite or charcoal on its point, it can be used as a drawing tool in its own right; the light strokes it produces can be useful when first roughing out a piece.

=== Wet media ===

==== Dip pens ====

Dip pens are pens with no internal ink reservoir; the ink is held in the nib at the tip of the pen, so the pen needs to be dipped in an external ink supply regularly to refresh the ink supply.  Dip pens consist of a nib holder and a nib.  Nibs wear out with time and need to be replaced.  Different nibs produce different sizes and shapes of pen strokes.  The &quot;crow's quill&quot; type of nib is frequently used in illustration, since the width of the line it produces can be varied by altering the pressure applied to the paper during the stroke.

==== Disposable and cartridge pens ====

Disposable pens come with an internal ink reservoir that is non-replaceable, while cartridge pens have a replaceable ink reservoir.  Care must be taken in selecting pens for art-making, since many are intended for writing and do not use archival quality ink -- that is, the marks they produce may fade, change color, or alter the paper over time.  Most technical pens are of archival quality.

[[Image:Lobster.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A lobster]]

'''Lobsters''' are crustaceans related to [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], and krill.

In coastal areas close to where lobsters are caught, this seafood is not prohibitively expensive, and lobsters are often considered a summertime picnic treat. However, shipping costs for the living animals are high, so elsewhere lobsters are considered an elegant, formal, showy, and extravagant seafood. Shrimp may be considered a less expensive and difficult substitute. 

When messy eating is acceptable, lobster is served in the shell. Tools, such as pliers and hammers, should be provided to open the brittle shells. For those who desire the distinctive taste of lobster without the mess, there are recipes for prepared lobster meat, such as Lobster Newberg. 

Purchase an actively moving live lobster. Smaller lobsters are a better deal, but extravagant dining may demand the largest specimen available. Note: make sure to remove the rubber bands before placing the lobster in water. Otherwise, the rubber bands may leave a taste on the lobster. 

How you proceed next depends on your stance regarding the ability of lobsters to feel pain. Many people believe it is more humane to kill the lobster before cooking it, while other people drop the live lobster directly into boiling water. If you fall into the former camp, these are the two usual methods:
* Put the lobster in the freezer one to two hours before cooking. This will not kill the lobster, but will render it unconscious. It will die in the boiling water before it can fully reawaken.
* Freeze the lobster for about fifteen minutes to slow down the lobster's nervous system. Place the lobster upside down on a cutting surface, then take a sharp knife and position it between the hindmost legs. Thrust firmly downward and slice through the body straight up to the head. Boil immediately.[http://trevorcorson.tumblr.com/post/262203493/how-to-cook-a-lobster-humanely]

Otherwise, you can place the lobster head first in a large pot of rapidly boiling (optionally salted) water, and allow the water to return to a boil. Boil for ten minutes for the first pound, and around 3 minutes for each additional pound. The lobster can be considered done when its antennae can be easily pulled from the body.

Most of the meat is in the tail and large claws. Additional meat can be found in the smaller legs and near where the legs join the body. The soft white deposits are coagulated protein.

Lobster is often dipped into melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or cocktail sauce. Lobster also goes well with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

*Side Notes:
**The hissing sound while cooking the lobster is not the lobster screaming, but merely steam escaping the shell.  
**Some debate arises as to whether lobsters can feel any pain.  A CBS news story [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/tech/main673989.shtml] reported on a 2005 Norwegian study which concluded lobster brains are too small to experience pain. On the other hand, Business Insider [http://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-lobsters-can-feel-pain-2013-1] reported on a 2014 study from Queen's University in Belfast that indicates crustaceans such as lobsers and crabs are capable of experiencing pain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tanzania Top Bar Hives are a style of [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], which design is likely to have originated from [[w:Tanzania| Tanzania]]. The Tanzania Top Bar Hive differentiates itself from the other common design of top bar hive, the [[Beekeeping/Kenya Top Bar Hives| Kenya Top Bar Hive]], because it has non-slanted sides.

==Non Sloped Side==
Some beekeepers who use Top Bar Hives, claim they see no real difference in the functionality of the angled side walls of the hive. The only important point is the opening of the top bar hive in relation to the trough is not convex.

'''Squids''' are cephalopods, related to [[Cookbook:Octopus|octopuses]]. The Italian word for squid, ''calamari,'' is often used to refer to squid in a food context. Calamari can be bought at any sea food corner shop or fresh sea food seller.

It is common to sell the mantle (the hollow, conical-shaped swimming organ) alone, fresh or frozen. Squid are typically white, at least by the time of sale. The swimming organ may be stuffed whole or sliced into rings. The tentacles and legs are also edible.

Ways to serve squid include:

*[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep-fat fried]] in beer batter, plain batter or even crumbed (rings and legs)
*Grilled with or without butter/oil
*[[Cookbook:Stir-fry|Stir-fried]] 
*In an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, braised with tomato sauce
*Stuffed with vegetables or spices
*Skewered with wood or bamboo and grilled over flames while brushed with teriyaki sauce

'''Octopuses''' are cephalopods, related to [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]].

It is common to sell octopus whole, frozen into a solid chunk of ice or fresh.
Small octopuses are sometimes served whole or as hand-like halves with about 4 tentacles. Large octopuses may be sliced thin for [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]]. Live octopus is sometimes eaten for the thrill of having the suction cups grab at the eater's mouth.

Ways to serve octopus include:

*Grilled
*[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep-fat fried]] in batter
*[[Cookbook:Stir-fry|Stir-fried]]
*In an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, braised with tomato sauce
*[[Cookbook:Sushi|Sushi]]
*[[Cookbook:Barbecue|Barbecued]] (particularly in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]])

'''Scallops''' are shellfish. Normally only a cylindrical part is sold, with the grain running along the axis. Scallops are available in two sizes. Bay scallops are about 1/4&quot; to 5/8&quot; in diameter, and 1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot; in length. Sea scallops are about 1&quot; to 1.6&quot; in diameter, and 1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot; in length. Scallops are usually sold as they thaw out from a frozen state; frosty ones are likely to be fresher. When cooking scallops, remember: Always cook scallops just below done so they don't end up like rubber bands when you eat them due to carry-over.

Bay scallops are commonly used in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]]. Sea scallops are commonly breaded and [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]]. Both kinds are commonly fried in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], perhaps with some [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]].

Recipes using scallops can be found in [[:Category:Scallop recipes]].

{{meat}}

:''Adapted from the public domain USDA article ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/focusrabbit.htm Focus on Food Safety of Rabbit]''

Fresh or frozen, '''rabbit''' meat is sold all year round. It can be used in most of the ways in which [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] is used.

Rabbits sold for food in the USA are North American cottontails, crosses between New Zealand and Belgian varieties, Chinese rabbits, or Scottish hares. The meat is fine grained and mild flavored. Like other lean meat, poultry, and fish, rabbit meat is a good source of high quality [[Cookbook:Protein|protein]].  Because the meat is so lean, it is possible to develop a syndrome known as &quot;[[w:Rabbit starvation|rabbit starvation]]&quot; if rabbit is used exclusively as a food over time.  In practice, rabbit starvation is highly unlikely to occur in modern society given the amount of dietary fat consumed by the average person.

==Types of Rabbit Commonly Available== 	

* '''Fryer''' or '''young rabbit''' &amp;mdash; the terms &quot;fryer&quot; or &quot;young rabbit&quot; refer to a rabbit weighing not less than 1 ½ pounds and rarely more than 3 ½ pounds, and less than 12 weeks of age. The flesh is tender, fine grained, and a bright pearly pink color. These rabbits may be cooked in much the same way as young poultry.
* '''Roaster''' or '''mature rabbit''' &amp;mdash; the terms &quot;roaster&quot; or &quot;mature rabbit&quot; refer to a mature rabbit of any weight, but usually over 4 pounds and over 8 months of age. The flesh is firm and coarse grained, and the muscle fiber is slightly darker in color and less tender. The fat may be more creamy in color than that of a fryer or young rabbit. The meat of larger rabbits may be tougher so the best methods of cooking are [[Cookbook:Braising|braising]] or [[Cookbook:Stewing|stewing]].
* '''Giblets'''--the liver and heart, see [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|Organ Meat]].
*'''Wild rabbit''' Has a slightly more gamey taste and is therefore cooked using a few different ingredients and techniques from the farmed rabbits. 

==Inspection==	

In the United States, inspection of rabbit is voluntary. Under voluntary inspection, each rabbit and its internal organs are inspected for signs of disease. The &quot;Inspected for Wholesomeness by USDA&quot; mark of inspection ensures the rabbit is wholesome and free from disease. When a rabbit processor does not produce rabbit meat under FSIS voluntary inspection, they would be subject to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Some states, however, permit the sale of rabbit only if it is inspected under their laws.

The FDA has jurisdiction over the shipment of rabbit meat in interstate commerce.

==Grades==

Rabbit in the US may be graded under the voluntary rabbit grading program performed by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. It provides a national grading service based on official U.S. classes, standards, and grades for poultry.

Rabbit may be graded only if it has been inspected and passed by the FSIS, or inspected and passed by any other inspection system which is acceptable to the USDA, such as state inspection.

Consumer grades for rabbits are U.S. Grade A, U.S. Grade B, and U.S. Grade C.

==Food Safety==
===Safe Storage Times===
Take rabbit home immediately from the grocer and refrigerate at or below 40 °F. Use it within 2 days or freeze at 0 ° F. If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely; however, quality will diminish over time. It is safe to freeze rabbit in its original packaging or repackage it for freezing. For best quality, use frozen whole rabbit within a year; pieces within 9 months.

===Safe Thawing===

There are three ways to safely defrost rabbit: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave oven. Never defrost at room temperature.

* Refrigerator: It’s best to plan for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. Bone-in parts or whole rabbits may take a day or longer to thaw. Once thawed, rabbit may be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days before cooking. During this time, if you decide not to use the rabbit, you can safely refreeze it without cooking it.
* Cold Water: To defrost rabbit in cold water, do not remove the packaging. Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leak-proof bag. Submerge the rabbit in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. Small packages may defrost in an hour or less; larger packages may take 2 to 3 hours. Plan to cook the rabbit immediately after thawing by the cold water method.
* Microwave oven: When defrosting rabbit in the microwave oven, plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some of the areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook.

===Safe Cooking===

* When roasting rabbit parts, set the oven temperature no lower than 325 °F. A 2-pound, cut-up rabbit should take approximately 1 hour to cook.
* A whole, 2- to 2 1/2-pound rabbit should take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to roast. Stuffing it will add approximately 1/2 hour to the cooking time.
* Braising rabbit (cooking it in a small amount of liquid in a covered pan on the range or in the oven) also takes about 1 hour. Rabbit can be [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiled]] about 15 minutes on each side.
* For safety, USDA recommends cooking rabbit to an internal temperature of at least 160 °F. The use of a food thermometer is recommended to make sure that your rabbit is safe to eat.
* It is safe to cook frozen rabbit in the oven or on the range or grill without defrosting it first, although the cooking time may be about 50% longer.
* Do not cook frozen rabbit in a slow cooker; thaw first. Cut whole rabbits into smaller pieces so heat can penetrate the meat more quickly.

===Safe Handling of Leftovers===
* Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours after cooking. Use within 3 to 4 days or freeze.
* Use frozen, cooked rabbit within 4 to 6 months for best quality.
* Reheat leftovers to 165 °F.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Elements of Communications Theory ==

Communications theory looks at how information is communicated from one place or person to another. This theory looks at the processes involved in transmitting information and how the methods of the transmission will affect the interpretation of the message.

One model of communication that we have is the transmission model of communications. It really is about passing information from one place to another or from one person to another. In this view, communication is how you get information from one place to another. An example of this model is the 1947 Shannon-Weaver general model of communication. The emphasis is on the transmission and reception of information. It proposes that communication is comprised of the following six elements:

#Sources of a Message
#Encoding of a Message
#Transmission of a Message
#Channels of Communication
#Receiving of a Message
#Decoding of a Message


=== Sources of a Message ===

All communication has a source. The source is responsible for sending messages; it always has a purpose for the message. It may be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization . The thing about senders and receivers are all the complexities of what you think about the message being sent. The characteristics of the message (cultural background, experiential background, and the attitudes and aptitudes of the sender) all help you understand where the message is coming from.


=== Encoding of a Message===

Information must be coded in such a way so it can be received. Encoding is the process of codifying the message to be sent. Most of our messages are put into words. Speaking face-to-face, we use rules of grammar to help us transfer our thoughts to another person or a group of people. However, more and more messages are being put into visuals. We can often represent our ideas without words, e.g. using facial expressions and gestures or by using pictures.

To help understand encoding, consider the way a telephone works. The source, usually a person, speaks into the phone. The phone acts as the encoder, converting the message into electrical signals which can be sent out over the telephone network.


=== Transmission of a Message ===

The message can be transmitted aurally, visually, textually, or by a combination of these mediums. You can decide what method to use, and this will have an impact on the message. The transmitter of a coded message may be speech, printed words, a picture. In the case of the telephone, the trasmitter is the electrical signal sent out by the phone and transmitted to the receiver through a series of electrical connections - a channel for this kind of information.


=== Channels of Communication ===

The channel is the vehicle of message transmission. There can be different types. There is the auditory channel for verbal information; and, a visual channel which uses symbols to convey a message and express ideas. Important issues to consider are how much information someone can handle in single or dual channels, [http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/media/mediarsrch.htm Moore, et. al], an important consideration for multimedia design.


=== Receiving of a Message ===

For communication to occur, there must be somewhere at the end of the channel to receive the message. And the receiver needs to be compatible with the channel and transmission for communication to occur. For example, a televison signal won't work with a telephone receiver. In other words, the receiver is what takes in the message.

=== Decoding of a Message ===

While encoding is all about forming the message, decoding is about figuring out what it says. Of course, all messages are affected by a certain amount of noise. Noise is extraneous and distracting information that inferes with the process of communication. It is any kind of distraction to the receiver that interferes with the transmission of the message such as physical noise, emotions, and visual distractions. It is often thought of as a problem with transmission, e.g., electrical interference with a television signal; or, several people talking at once. However, there may be noise in the message itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

Gendered images have been effective in perpetuating both the positive and negative connotations that we associate with gender.  The history of promotional images, along with the visual rhetoric of advertising sheds light on how the constructs of masculinity and femininity contextualize fabrications of social role, power, status and sexual allure.  Specifically, appeals of glamour and the usage of nature images powerfully contribute to the influx of image-based advertising based on gender identification.  Additionally, childhood gender development contributes enormously to stereotypes regarding masculinity and femininity.

== '''History of Gendered Images''' ==

Historically, the nudes of European oil paintings portray women and men differently, in specific roles and purposes.  Traditionally, women have been seen and judged as sights, while men act as spectators.  In other words, women appear while men act.  John Berger suggests in his work, ''Ways of Seeing,'' that this affects relations between men and women and also the relations of women to themselves.  The renowned painting of Adam and Eve was groundbreaking in introducing the concept of nakedness in regard to women being seen as submissive to men.  “… the woman is blamed and is punished by being made subservient to the man.  In relation to the woman, the man becomes the agent of God” (Berger 48).  As paintings became more worldly and had fewer religious undertones, the common denominator remained women illustrated as being seen by a spectator.  “She is not naked as she is; she is naked as the spectator sees her” (Berger 50).  

The facial expressions of women in images also coincides with the notion that they submit to being surveyed.  Berger suggests that in poses of women, a woman’s gaze and facial expression sells her femininity.  Paintings and photographs often depict this by showing the woman looking over her shoulder at the viewer, rather than at the male shown in the painting or photograph.   

While these attitudes and ideals regarding the portrayal of women are rampant in photographs and paintings, it has also seeped into popular culture, disseminating into various media, including current advertising, journalism and television.  

== '''Identification and Advertising''' ==

Identification fulfills an essential role as it allows advertisers to appeal to each viewer’s individuality. In the article, &quot;Defining Film Rhetoric: The Case of Hitchcock’s Vertigo,&quot; David Blakesley introduces the idea of identification as he describes the notion as longing to find similitude between ones self and a particular idea, picture, object, etc. He explains, “we pursue that identification as one way of expressing…pushed to its extreme, we desire to become the other, to inhabit that psychological and physical space, to take ownership of some kind, to walk in someone else’s shoes for awhile” (Blakesley 117). As a result of such desire for identification, women and men are often characterized in a generalized manner, only to appeal to their own gender-specific identify.

Diane S. Hope suggests, in her chapter &quot;Gendered Environments: Gender and the Natural World in the  Rhetoric of Advertising&quot; from the book, ''Defining Visual Rhetorics,'' that advertising demonstrates and perpetuates gender-specific attributes of men and women in order to identify with their gender-specific audiences. Hope comments, “visual rhetoric depends on strategies of identification; advertising’s rhetoric is dominated by appeals to gender as the primary marker of consumer identity.  Constructs of masculinity or femininity contextualize fantasies of social role, power, status, and security as well as sexual attractiveness” (155).  Within the visual realm of advertising Hope observes how women are often depicted in a way that promotes beauty, fertility and sexuality while men possess more ‘masculine’ attributes.  Contrary to feminine traits, masculine attributes include strength, adventurous nature, and physical prowess.

Although many of these characteristics and behavioral tendencies are thought to be innate, the advertising industry reintroduces and reiterates such gender roles as the norm.  People become conditioned to believe that there are specific and isolated behavioral differences and attributes that define us either as men or women.  Such differences have gone beyond the obvious physiological makeup that separates male from female.

==='''''Glamour'''''===

Societal roles based on one's gender are defined and controlled by culture and have been reiterated through visual means.  See [[Visual Rhetoric/Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric]]. Such gender roles are especially evident within the visual realm of advertising. Advertisers use visual means to communicate to their viewers feminine and masculine ideals.  These gendered ideals are closely linked to the concepts of envy and glamour.  “Publicity persuades us of a transformation by showing us people who have apparently been transformed and are, as a result, enviable.  The state of being envied is what constitutes glamour” (Berger 131).  Predominantly, glamour is a tool used by advertisers and aimed at men and women in an effort to increase consumerism.  The language of publicity harps upon the concept of a spectator-buyer imagining himself or herself transformed by a product, and thus an object of envy by others.  People crave envy, and this advertising tactic is aimed at both men and women to create consumption of various products.  Women are generally persuaded when glamour is presented as enhancing to their lives by making them more beautiful or desirable.  Alternatively, men are influenced by ads that appeal to their desire to be in power and in control.

==='''''Childhood Gender Development'''''===

Advertisers create ‘gendered environments’ in everything from children’s toys to motor vehicles. For example, early on children are exposed to toy commercials that are set out to target a specific gender.  As a result, society is conditioned to believe that dolls and houses are for little girls because they represent the idea that females are to be fertile and nurturing.  Whereas little boys are conditioned to believe that they can only play with toys that will define their masculinity, such as cars and toy weapons.  Hope says, “masculinized environments present a natural world made for conquest and control” (174).  Much like the masculine ideal, toys for little boys often include cars, action figures, and sporting goods, all which fulfill the idea of a conquest. These items and the advertisements redefine the gender role ideal that men are active, strong, and courageous. On the other hand, little girls are raised to believe that their roles is to care for the family.  Typically, little girls toys include baby dolls and play houses.  

Since the idea of identification carries immense weight in the targeting of specific audiences, advertisers begin promoting the concept of gendered environments early on beginning with children's toys.  However, as people grow older the gender roles are only made more evident and are further perpetuated in advertising that is targeted towards adults.  For example, Hope discusses how the advertising of sport utility vehicles is a primary example of the gender role divide. She talks about how an SUV reiterates the idea that men are conquerors of territory and must have a powerful vehicle to traverse through their difficult journeys. She describes the more ‘masculine’ advertisements as a place where man can conquer land and explore the vast wilderness. She states, “the features of these advertisements emphasize a mythic world where men play [as] heroics and a vast environmental wilderness promises control and adventure” (161).
  
==='''''Nature images'''''===

Hope analyzes the characteristics of the specific visual environments that promote the sales of such masculine or feminine products. She concludes that advertisers use certain natural environments within a commercial or print ad in order to appeal to a specific gender. She observes in one advertisement how femininity is characterized using a picture of a waterfall.  Hope explains that the waterfall acts as, “a sign of nature’s unending fertility…images are exotic and lush with icons of fertility and female sexuality” (157). In such advertisements women are one with nature.  Advertisers also use specific natural environments to appeal to males.  However, these images depict a sense of acquisition unseen in feminine advertisements.  Hope suggests that for men &quot;nature is the object of conquest or background for demonstrations of power.&quot; &quot;... there are no environmental problems in this space or in the fertile seas of feminized lands, there is only opportunity to consume&quot; (Hope 162).  She observes in one advertisement how masculinity is distinguished using the image of &quot;Marlboro Country&quot;.  In Marlboro Country, men are free from responsibility and routine. In one particular ad, two cowboys are depicted riding wild horses.  The mystical west is perceived as for &quot;real&quot; men (Hope 160).  &quot; . excepting the occasional cowboy or Indian, the space is there for urban man to play at adventure&quot; (Hope 161).

[[Image:Marlboroman.jpg]]

Ultimately, Hope articulates, “advertising appropriates a rich visual history of nature images as sites of femininity and masculinity in order to sell commodities&quot; (Hope 173).  Through the use of visual rhetoric and the natural world, gender specific behaviors are promoted to appeal either to both genders.  The existence of gender roles and gender identity through images will continue to be present in the future of advertising.

== '''Conclusion''' ==
Gendered images are omnipresent in modern society.  Understanding the history of these images is important in understanding how they are capable of persuading us.  Gendered images are considered rhetorical because they have a persuasive quality.  It is important to remember that since birth, we have been conditioned to make the distinction between men and women, masculinity and femininity, and to recognize both the positive and negative aspects of

''A class in PHP is a group of related functions, also known as an object.'' I have changed this because an object is not a class, its an instance of a class. So I changed it to ''A class in PHP is a group of related functions''.--[[User:Seanor|Seanor]] 16:20, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== PHP 5 vs. PHP 4 ==
I'm a bit too new to all of this (php &amp; wikipedia) to know for sure, but I believe the example is only good for PHP version 5.  There are a lot of servers still running PHP 4.  The difference, as I understand it, is that in PHP 4 you may not distinguish between public, private, and protected data.  Perhaps someone with more knowledge/experience can shed some light on the subject.  more information is available on php.net http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop.php &amp; http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php

      <text xml:space="preserve">While the sphere of visual rhetoric is till being explored, an aspect of it is often neglected.  Much of the field’s focus is on the two dimensional image.  It is still a new area of study that is being analyzed.  See [[../Definitions of Visual Rhetoric|Definitions of Visual Rhetoric]] for more.  Whether it be a painting, a film, or a picture, all three are limited to the dimensions of height and length.  Even though the third dimension is often neglected, it is still very important to understand its functions in visual rhetoric and the differences that arise when compared to two-dimensional objects.  Perspective, modality, and composition or spatiality are three factors that need to be analyzed when discussing the two.  Perspective deals with the angles that the audience can view the work.  Modality is an important issue to discuss when analyzing the two.  Modality relates to the realness of an image of an object and how much truth it portrays.  For example, a picture has high modality when the saturation, depth, brightness, etc., are at a level gives the picture the highest level of realism (Kress and van Leeuwen 160-161).  Composition and spatiality are how the artist uses the frame or space, respectively, to build persuasion. 

As an observer, for the most part, a two-dimensional image is viewed from one perspective, straightforward.  With no depth to the image, seeing it at an angle will not change the perspective of the composition.  What can affect the persuasiveness of the image is the distance at which it is viewed.  A prime example is Monet’s impressionistic paintings.  Up close, the brush strokes seem blotchy; however, at a distance, the paintings appear to be a wonderful image of nature.

[[File:Claude Monet - Twilight, Venice.jpg|250px|left]]

Unlike two-dimensional images, three-dimensional objects can be seen from multiple perspectives.  We can walk around it and interact with its setting.  The angle that we look at an object also has an effect on its persuasiveness.  When something is placed at eye level, we see it with a sense of equality or welcoming.  However when it is placed above eye level and overlooks the audience, there is a sense of dominance and importance.  For example, bronze and iron statues of significant individuals are always elevated to appear almost godlike.  

Modality is another aspect that must be investigated when analyzing the two.  Much praise is bestowed upon an artist when an image has high modality.  Recreating an image that appears almost lifelike takes such skill and technique that few possess.  Artists like Rembrandt are incredible and admired for that reason.  The same goes for photography.  While photography in itself is the replication of nature, it still is a task to make that image appear more vivid.  Adjustments must be made to shutter speed, lenses, and the like. Saturating a picture can overly enhance its colors and make it too vivid.  There is a fine balance to expressing the truth of an image.   

The modality of three-dimensional objects is something that needs to be addressed with concern.  Making an object with depth more vivid is unsettling.  When something takes up space, it has an automatic sense of realness to it.  Sculptures of humans for example, almost need an abstract quality to be seen with comfort.  Wax museums are a great example.  These are recreations of human beings to look as lifelike as possible.  While it is amazing to see something fake look so real, having the facial features be so vivid, the audience gets a sense of being watched and anxiety when being around many of them.  For this reason, they lose part of their persuasiveness of engaging the viewer by the created anxiety (Kress and van Leeuwen 243).  

[[Image:stare2d.jpg|250px|left|Claire's Knee]]

The added dimension of depth separates the two in the sense of composition and spatiality.  Composition is the arrangement of the elements of an image within the frame.  They direct the eye as to where to look and give the image meaning.  More can be read about this in [[Rhetorical Vectors]].  I argue that three dimensional objects do not have composition, as much as they do spatiality.  How an image takes up space directs our eyes and gives it meaning.  A great deal of artist’s ability to persuade the audience with images is how to arrange the frame.  Figure 2.21, (&quot;Claire’s Knee,&quot; left), from ''Reading Images'' is a particular example.  The photographer arranged the three individuals within the composition to give it more fluidity and more meaning.  

[[Image:family3d.jpg|250px|thumb|Figure 8.13: Family Romance]] Figure 8.13  (&quot;Family Romance,&quot; right) from ''Reading Images'' illustrates the concept of spatiality in three-dimensional objects.  It is an example of how an artist can utilize space has an added aspect to give meaning.  The artist is not just arranging the images within a frame, but analyzing how to represent space as well.  The family’s persuasiveness is the manipulation of the audience’s preconceptions of a family.  Having each member be the same size, gives the sculpture more meaning.  

Other examples of spatiality exist in more practical settings.  Much thought is put into the planning of interior design for buildings.  In their article “Placing Visual Rhetoric: Finding Material Comfort in Wild Oats Market,&quot; Greg Dickinson and Casey Malone Maugh discuss the rhetoric in the design of Wild Oats Market organic food stores.  The stores are designed and arrange to make the customers feel more at home and not aware of the feeling of impending globalization that is projected at other big chain groceries.   The spatial arrangement of specific objects gives the store more or a persuasive nature.  With images, the composition is seen all at once.  However, in this sense, one has to interact with the “display” to perceive its persuasiveness.  

There is still much to be explored in the realm of visual rhetoric.  Books are written specifically about two-dimensional images; so the third dimension has much time before it is extensively analyzed.  While some aspects like materials are similar between two-dimensional images and three-dimensional objects, several differences in regards to persuasiveness exist.  The perspective, modality, and composition or spatiality are all used differently among the two.  Images have the capability to be seen at once without having to move to different angles, and are praised for their realism.  Objects need to be interacted with from multiple perspectives and usually create apprehension with the viewer when it appears too real.  The third dimension is something that needs to be explored because it is highly persuasive, and as observed with the Wild Oats Market example, we sometimes are not even aware of such rhetorical displays.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Portfolio Philosophy''' ==

Even beginning investors need to lay out an initial investment plan.  Assume changes or portfolio modifications will follow as one becomes more familiar with investing.  But at least start with some savings plan.  Apply the philosophy, '''''invest as much as you can as early as you can'''''.  As one begins to save, the decision of what to do with the money becomes a challenge.  Since different industries, market sectors, and asset classes perform at different levels during various market cycles, it behooves one to diversify investments over a variety of asset classes.  Establishing an asset allocation plan for a portfolio is an important first step toward successful investing.  Below are some guidelines and helpful hints.


'''1.0    Asset Allocation'''
# Determine an overall plan for a broad portfolio establishing percentage guidelines for each asset class. An example portfolio is available at [http://www.bivio.com/bullrun/files/Asset%20Allocation] Look for the  Sample.xls file. A more complex asset allocation spreadsheet is available on this same site. Look for the file AA-01-15-2005.xls.
# Divide the portfolio into growth and value investments.  Use Morningstar guidelines.  In some cases the investment will fall into what is known as a core investment or somewhere between a value and growth investment.
# Divide the portfolio into large, mid, and small-cap size. Some investors will prefer to use sales as the division points.  Again, use Morningstar guidelines.
# Determine if the portfolio should include asset classes such as REITs, international, emerging markets, precious metals, bonds, etc.

The reasons or logic for developing a portfolio strategy is based on research done by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood and Gilbert L. Beebower in their ground breaking paper, &quot;Determinants of Portfolio Performance.&quot; Brinson, Brian D. Singer and Beebower followed with an update of the original paper in 1991.  John Nuttall provides counter arguments to the Brinson et. al. papers in his article, &quot;The Importance of Asset Allocation.&quot;  To be sure, Brinson is frequently misquoted.

Ronald J. Surz, Dale Stevens, and Mark Wimer in their article, &quot;Investment Policy Explains All&quot; write, &quot;For those who thought that the question of policy importance had been conclusively asked and answered by the authors' (Brinson et. al.) study, we now say it wasn't.  The critics' arguments do contain some truth -- and some errors.  Investment policy is not only the most important contributor to performance -- it is even more important than originally thought.&quot;  

Later in the Surz et. al. article they write, &quot;...this means that investment policy explains 112% of the performance of the average fund in the authors' study, a far greater number than originally suggested.&quot;

Several additional references advocating a well-developed portfolio can be found in the following books.
&quot;Four Pillars of Investing&quot; - William Bernstein
&quot;The Intelligent Asset Allocator&quot; - William Bernstein
&quot;Asset Allocation: Balancing Financial Risk&quot; - Roger C. Gibson

'''2.0    Active Asset Allocation'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''4.0    Maintaining a &quot;Watch List&quot; of Stocks'''

A &quot;Watch List&quot; consists of a group of stocks an investor finds of interest but as yet does not own. It is certainly possible to expand the &quot;Watch List&quot; to include stocks owned so one can compare quality and price between owned and &quot;under-the-microscope&quot; or stocks to watch.

Just what information to include in a &quot;Watch List&quot; is up to the investor.  Some suggestions as to what to include include all the fundamental SSG factors such as expected growth in sales and earnings, direction of management controls found in Section 2 of the SSG, Total Return, Relative Value, and the Upside/Downside ratio.  Information gleaned from Value Line could include Operating Margins, Return on Share Equity, and Price/Book ratio.  Using Value Line one can calculate PEG and the Robertson Quality Rating (RQR) value.

'''Templates''' (or skins) are the '''set of directory and files''' (icons, .html and .css). definition of the way the mambo-interface - that is your site, explained in normal terms - will look. They are highly configurable, and can be used in many different ways.

The templates are acting exactly the same as a ''skins''. The templates are predefined looks (designs), which make mambo look a certain way (color patterns, icons for navigation, etc...). The templates do not control the behavior, though, as in other systems that use templates - it is a look-only definition.

Explained very simply, a template is a HTML/CSS document that has code in it which makes it compatible with mambo. For example, there are code for loading the modules of a certain position, there are code to load the main body (main content) and so on.

''see: [[Mambo Open Source/Create your own template|Create your own template]]''

{{MAMBOTOC}}

The components are supplements and additions to mambo's core functions. Mambo can publish text, upload images, manage users, etc., but components are extra functions that can perform additional tasks. Examples of these are: download managers, forums, commerce, galleries, guestbooks, wikis, newsletters - the list is almost endless.

These components are installed with an installer in mambo, found under '''&quot;components &gt; install/uninstall&quot;''' in the mambo administration panel. This is how most of the components are installed, but it should be noted that some of them will need modification to core files. However, that is very seldom needed, as the components installer is usually sufficient.

==Example==

==Complete list of ''components''==
* see.. [http://mamboforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=328 Components (more than 322 projects)]

===Mambelfish===

The '''MambelFish''' project is a extention hack and ''component'' for the content management system Mambo. It enables Mambo to handle multi lingual sites especially in all dynamic contents which are stored in the database.

;The key features of the fish are
* Possibility for an unlimited amount of languages
* Possibility to MANUAL translate all dynamic content of your Mambo installation in ONE database
* Overview of the changed contents in the Translation list
* Support for all the core components/modules of Mambo's
* Frontend component for language selection

The MambelFish project is maintained and hosted on Mambo's project forge http://mamboforge.net/projects/mambelfish/ by  author Alex Kempkens &lt;MambelFish (at) ThinkNetwork (dot) com&gt; , Copyright (C) 2003-2005 Think Network GmbH. When ever you have questions or new ideas please visit this page and post your comments there.

====Installation====

The basic installation of the MambelFish goes along with the Mambo (version 4.5.2.3) standards.

1. Install the component thru the Administrator -&gt; Components -&gt; Install routine.&lt;BR&gt;
1.a) start in the ''backend'' to install mambelfish:&lt;BR&gt;
1.b) file 'Mambelfish_1.5.zip' with the component installer&lt;BR&gt;
1.c) file 'Mbf_module.zip' with the module installer&lt;BR&gt;
1.d) file 'Mbf_searchbot.zip' with the mambot installer&lt;BR&gt;
2. Now the difference starts: Applying the corresponding patch.&lt;BR&gt;
2.a) BACKUP YOUR ACTUAL MAMBO INSTALLATION DIRECTORY!&lt;BR&gt;
2.b) MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP THE DIRECTORY&lt;BR&gt;
2.c) The patch is a zip file which corresponds with the directory structure of the Mambo sources. Please unzip (''how-with ftp?'') the latest known ''corepatch 4.5.2'' file from [http://mamboforge.net/projects/mambelfish/ mamboforge] to the root of your Mambo installation, overwriting all files.

For a simple test please switch to the peeklime template. Within this template you should see a combobox with the language name &quot;English&quot; in it - next to the search field (upper right part). Also in the Administrator the Version should now say something about the MambelFish.

====Language configuration====
The first step is to upload at least a second language to your Mambo installation. Do this with the help of the Language Manager (Administrator -&gt; Site -&gt; Language Manager).

After you installed the language go to Administrator -&gt; Components -&gt; MambelFish -&gt; Component Configuration

Choose the tab &quot;Languages&quot; and activate the new language. Also define the ISO code and the Name, which is the visible name in the frontend component. Save the new configuration.

This kind of activation must be done for each language added to the system.

====Translation process====

The translation process is based on the translation overview (Component -&gt; MambelFish -&gt; Translation). In this overview you have to select the language you want to translate into and a content element.

The content elements represent the possible dynamic content in your database. This includes normally all your sections, categories, content items but also the information from other components, like the web links, polls and so on.

It is possible to add new content elements just by adding new XML files in the  folder ''/administrator/components/com_mambelfish/contentelements''. These files describe how the table structure is organized and which fields of the table should be translatable and how.

After you selected one language and one content element you will see all the items of this filter. Best start with your new language and the content elements &quot;menues&quot;. Click on one item in the list to translate it.

Now you see the details of the translation - go ahead. Second tab publish the translation of this item and make sure the language is correct - Save.

Now you can go back to the frontend and you should already find your menu translated (of course after a reload or change to your new language ;-)).

====Small hints====
*I found out that it is the best to start creating your site in one language and translate anything to a second, third one. In this way it is most easy for you to build the structure and finally translate it to the other languages. Anyhow if you once have a original content in a second language don't worry, just translate it into your primary language and you are fine.

*The language switcher appears when you add &lt;?php mosLoadComponent( 'mambelfish' );?&gt; 
at the place where you wish in your template.

* You can also just use the module (if you have installed it) and place it at any module position that you like (and that you have published) - but as far as I know the module just uses the Component ;-) 

* about the languages, that don't change... have you checked the URL? at the end there should be the parameter lang=XX ... if you see only 'lang=' and nothing more you just have to type an identification code of the languages in your mambelfish configuration [components-mambelfish-language configuration] 

* checke Your language configuration in the Mambo Backend ''(Components &gt; Mambelfish &gt; Language Configuration)''

Modules are the sideblocks in mambo. 

Mambo has predefined positions for these modules. The most common are the left and right positions. The designer of a template (see below) can place these positions wherever he/she wants, so there is no rule that says the left position will be on the left of the template. But templates are commonly set up so that this corresponds to the actual layout.

There are also more module positions. There are top positions, which are usually over both left and right modules, and also content. This position is good for [[Mambo Open Source/Newsflash|newsflashes]] etc. There are many more positions to choose from, and one can create as many as one likes - you can have 30 different positions if you want to (see picture...[[Mambo Open Source/Modules positions]] ).

==Example==

==Complete list of ''modules''==
Amongst these are:
* main menu module, 
* login, 
* poll, 
* syndicate - all the stuff around the content.</text>

Like many of the earliest virus, it is evident from the code that Brain (brain.dos.x) 
does not utilise any inherent system vulnerabilities to spread. 
Its spreading is purely dependent on well documented function calls(interrupts).

==Source Code==
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

; This is the ashar variant of the classic Pakistani Brain virus. It is large
; by today's standards, although it was one of the first.  It is a floppy only
; boot sector infector.

== Convert templates from 4.5 to 4.5.x ==

A mambo template uses variables and operators in the Mambo core system, and some of these may change during the development of Mambo. Most templates created for version 4.5 of Mambo will work with the newer versions of 4.5.x, but there are some precautions to be aware of.

A 4.5.x compatible template will be 100% compatible with the future release of version 5.0.  4.5.x also has some functions that 4.5 templates doesn't, like the top-menu.

== How to upgrade ==


===Pathway===

In 4.5 the pathway was a reference to a file called &quot;pathway.php&quot;. 4.5.x is different here, and uses a function called &quot;mosPathWay&quot;.

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot; |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot; |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php include_once(&quot;pathway.php&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php mosPathWay(); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}

===Mainbody===


In 4.5 the mainbody was a reference to a file called &quot;mainbody.php&quot;. 4.5.x is different here, and uses a function called &quot;mosMainBody&quot;.

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php include_once(&quot;mainbody.php&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php mosMainBody(); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}

===Global variables===

Some of the core config-variables have changed too, here they are:

{|cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5 
!width=&quot;50%&quot;  |4.5.x

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_live_site&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_absolute_path&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_absolute_path']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_sitename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_sitename']&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$mosConfig_offset&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;nowiki&gt;$GLOBALS['mosConfig_offset']&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|}


===Pathway-separator===

4.5.x has a new feature for the pathway arrow. In the Mambo generated pathway of the &quot;mosPathWay&quot;-function, an arrow image appears between the pathway links. This can be a custom arrow for each template, and it is very simple to use this feature.

Simply create an image that you want for this, save it in .png-format, call it &quot;arrow.png&quot; and place it in the root folder of the template you want it in, the same as the &quot;template_details.xml&quot; and &quot;index.php&quot; files.  If this doesn't work, try putting it in the images sub-folder.  What the heck, put it in both places.

Remember to create a reference to this file in the &quot;template_details.xml&quot; file, so that it is uploaded when installing the template through the Mambo Template Installer.

===The head code===

The head code has also been upgraded from 4.5. 

If you don't use any custom functions and includes in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, use this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
/**
* Here you can writes notes about the template
* It has no technical effect, It is merely for
* information purposes.
*/
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct Access to this location is not allowed.' );
$iso = split( '=', _ISO );
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;'. $iso[1] .'&quot;?' .'&gt;';
?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;?php if ( $my-&gt;id ) initEditor(); ?&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; &lt;?php echo _ISO; ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;?php mosShowHead(); ?&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']; ?&gt;/templates/yourtemplatesname/css/template_css.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

Elk Cloner is the first known computer virus to spread in the wild. It infected Apple II systems and was written by Richard Skrenta in 1982. It spread by infecting Apple II floppy disks. It did not cause any intentional harm to data, and displayed the message on every 50th booting.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
  Elk Cloner:  The program with a personality
 
  It will get on all your disks
    It will infiltrate your chips
      Yes it's Cloner!

  It will stick to you like glue
    It will modify ram too
      Send in the Cloner!
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What are templates? ==

Templates allow you to define the look for your Mambo website. They are highly configurable, and can be used in many different ways. You can have more than one template in use on your site at a time. Additional templates can be completely different or subtle variations of each other, such as disabling Modules within particular areas of your Mambo website. 


=== How do they work? ===

The templates are html and css documents. They are just like any other css or html document, only that instead of content written directly into them, you place variables such as &quot;main content here&quot;, &quot;left modules here&quot;, &quot;banners here&quot; and so on. 

This means that you use Mambo to manage the content, and Mambo places the content the way you have specified within the template. Now you can easily change layout of a site, without having to do anything with the content itself. Mambo will just place the content in the variables you have defined in the new template as if nothing have happened.

On the other hand, this doesn't mean that you only can customize the elements around the content. Mambo fills the content with CSS-IDs and classes, so that you can use these tools to make the template decide which color and fonts and point sizes page elements should have. The behaviour and style of the menus, the margins between content images and text and a variety of other presentation decisions can be controlled by the template.

This is an example layout of a Mambo-template:


{| width=&quot;500&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | SITE NAME 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Pathway/breadcrumb
|- 
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Left modules 
| width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot; | &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More main content  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Right modules 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Footer with copyright info 
|}


This is the layout template, and Mambo fills in the appropriate content where you define it to, as shown in this example.

===Why templates?===

The most noticeable advantage of the template system is the flexibility. If you have a regular static HTML-site and want to change the menu, you'll have to manually change this on every page on your site where your menu is shown. With Mambo (and all other template-systems), you only need to modify your template, and this will apply to every single page on your site - because of that the template only echo the content that Mambo creates. This saves you a lot of work, and is a very big advantage for designers and developers.</text>

== German Mambo-Wikibook ==

We have a German Mambo-Wikibook, too!

Have a look at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:de:Mambo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:''Thanks for letting us know!'' --August 10:54, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== TOC, version issues &amp; categories ==

Hi, I'm thinking about: 
:1) one full TOC for all articles about MOS here, and
:2)''help'' relation to ''versions''. For now it's not clear on what version of MOS (4.5,... 5.0,... ) installing/setting/tweaking articles are?

Should we need some categories system? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 10:45, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

according to rules, at least one category must be assigned :-), but the real reason is to create ''one flat browsable table of content'' ... so maybe 
: - [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] is OK, but where in: [[:Category:Computing]] {{bad link|Category:How-tos}} [[:Category:Information technology|Category:Information Technology]] 
: - another ''trick'' is to use ''piped link'', such as ''Category:MOS|1'' to create and see some kind of workflow in categories page [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] ?
: - is it possible to put &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MOS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; into [[Template:MAMBOTOC]] so, that Category will be assigned to every article ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 11:17, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: hope created not a big mess? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 11:43, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: I added the MOS category into the [[Template:MAMBOTOC_SMALL]] template. Now, the MOS category is automatically set on every article, as that template is mandatory for all articles in this book. --August 15:41, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: congr.nicesolution --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:09, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== A new chapter: configuration ==

What do you guys think of adding another chapter called &quot;configuration&quot;? This could prove useful, as there are many of these types of articles that will be placed under the miscellaneous-chapter. --August 15:37, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Let's make all this book like step_by_step instruction. Also I suggest to emphasise '''steps''' and '''links to the info''' with comments from our practice or forums, because even for two of us wouldn't be ease to put/edit all info in time to new versions...? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:36, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I didn't understand any of that.. Can you explain again? And do you have MSN or skype? Lot easier to contact there. --August 22:19, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: Here will be more ease to explain... For now it's not clear for me ''the purpose and audience'' of this wiki-book. For now Official Mambo Help is not good. Lot of info is spreed in forums. I think it could be good guide through the all steps, needed to be performed while installing and configuring site from zero. --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 22:46, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::: What do you mean with &quot;needed to be perfomed while installing and configuring site from zero&quot;? If you write articles as unclear as you write here, i am getting a little scared.. --August 22:53, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: Please discuss 'subject of matter'. First please answer: ''the purpose and audience'' of this wiki-book? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 10:04, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Well, the purpose is to inform and educate in mambo, the audience is everybody from beginner to pro. --August 10:55, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: :-))) Sorry (for future didactics), but those words means almost nothing (from the point of communication/education theory). I still miss some fundamentals in structure of this ''source of knowledge about MOS''...
::: '''For example 1):''' there are ''objects'' (unfortunately without articles or links to primary source of info: [[Mambo Open Source/Components|Components]], [[Mambo Open Source/Modules|Modules]], [[Mambo Open Source/Templates|Templates]], [[Mambo Open Source/Mambots|Mambots]] ...) and ''functions'' they carry also ''activities'' which could be neccessary to know ''how_to_perform'' ([[Mambo Open Source/Create]], Install, Add, Edit, Config, Settings... Examples of use, Syntax is...) so articles and categories and TOC must help to quickly find things of interest. [[Mambo Open Source/How do i fix that|How do i fix that]] must be only article some kind of TOC redirecting to [[Mambo Open Source/Frontpage|Frontpage]] with the section ''settings'', not talking/explaining ''frontpage settings''.
:::'''For example 2):''' &lt;nowiki&gt;MAMBOTOC and {{MAMBOTOC SMALL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; are ''eyes-popping'', but without explanation ''where_which_to_use'' and not much of use - when we are in article it's not clear ''where we are''. I still suggest to think about one flat TOC, for example as ''Wikipedia Community Portal''... --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 8 July 2005 15:37 (UTC)

:As i have so far been the only major contributor to this book, i have not set up those kind of goals. My only goal have been to write down as clear as i could what i know about mambo. I don't think that the book should exclude content because of some rules set up, but i do agree that the organizing of the content is a key element. I will think about this and try to come to a conclusion of what the best way of organizing stuff is.

:And another thing: the guidelines you mention (objects, functions etc) are things that i am 100% aware of, and i think that i have used that knowledge in my articles so far. Such guidelines would not be of use to me, as i am aware of it, but only useful for people who don't understand mambo that well - and why should those contribute to the book?

:--August 9 July 2005 01:14 (UTC)

==Manually inserted categories==
ok.. as I understood You did book for yourself, then ''some bad boy came... and the hell started'' :-))) , so '''For example 3):''' there are ''Cat..:'' included in ''Templ..:'', but life shows that it's not good - when we are in the [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Category:MOS]] we see ''Pages in category &quot;MOS&quot;'' all of them starting with '''M'''... :-( . We can try to fix like this (manually entering piped link) ''Category:MOS|Frontpage'' as i did in [[Mambo Open Source/Frontpage]] ... but '''Mambo Open Source/...''' remains in the Title :-((( --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 21:34, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

:I am aware of this, but don't think that it is important at all. People should browse the book by the tocs created in the book, and not the category pages.

::Who told that :-))) ? As far as I know&amp;understand Wiki - ''Categories system'' was created to automatically create/maintain lists (let's say ''Indexes'' as in books). TOC's also are automatically generated at the article's page :-))) So - why You like ''manual (hand) work'' ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 18:31, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] ==

Should article titles &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name:Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; must be renamed instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name/Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 00:30, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:That is correct, the names should be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Mambo Open Soure/Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

== Multilanguage ==

Hi, I think [[Mambo Open Source/Multilanguage]] is needed to explain how to setup more than one language, also description of  ''[[Mambo Open Source/Components]]'' (and others) '''Mambelfish''' section (or article?) somewhere must find place. What You think? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 19:17, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:I really think that there are other subjects than multilanguage that is important. I will prioritize the management of content and noob guides --August 22:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::I don;t understand what mean ''to prioritize the management of content'' ? Please specify ''other subjects that is important&quot; ? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 13:38, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

This article is a tutorial on how to create a template from scratch.

[[Mambo Open Source/Templates|Templates]] are located in the directory '''/mambo_dir/templates''' . The following is a 
typical structure for a template directory:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/templates
 /basic_template
  /css
   template_css.css
  /images
  index.php
  template_thumbnail.png
  templateDetails.xml&lt;/pre&gt;

where each file is for:
;index.php : template layout file. 
;template_css.css : css stylesheet for the template. 
;templateDetails.xml : metadata file in XML format. 
;template_thumbnail.png : reduced screenshot of the template (140px wide x 90px high)

To make a template this is the minimum set of files needed. The ''core script'' of MOS expects these files names. Note that while there are no images shown in the /images directory, this is typically where you would place any supporting images for your template, like backgrounds, banners, etc. 

== Create the files ==

Some basic files are needed for a mambo template to function properly.

Begin with creating a folder for your template in your sites templates-directory. Call it something appropriate, e.g. &quot;myfirst&quot; or &quot;corporate_yellow&quot; (anything goes), and open it. This is the root folder of your template.

===templateDetails.xml===

Then create a file called &quot;templateDetails.xml&quot;. This file contains all technical info about your template, and should look something like this for now (it will be expanded later):

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;mosinstall type=&quot;template&quot;&gt;
	&lt;name&gt;Myfirst&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;creationDate&gt;16/04/2005&lt;/creationDate&gt;
	&lt;author&gt;Your name&lt;/author&gt;
	&lt;copyright&gt;GPL&lt;/copyright&gt;
	&lt;authorEmail&gt;mail@something.com&lt;/authorEmail&gt;
	&lt;authorUrl&gt;www.yourhomepage.com&lt;/authorUrl&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;description&gt;A little description.&lt;/description&gt;
	&lt;files&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;index.php&lt;/filename&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;template_thumbnail.png&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/files&gt;
	&lt;images&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;images/image.gif&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/images&gt;
	&lt;css&gt;
		&lt;filename&gt;css/template_css.css&lt;/filename&gt;
	&lt;/css&gt;
&lt;/mosinstall&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This file is the reference for Mambo, and shows the name of the template and the name of all the other files. As you can see, there are references to a php-file, some images and a CSS-file.

Not all fields here are required, but use as many of them as you can.

===Index.php===
Now, you can start with the index.php-file. This is where you shall place all HTML code and this will be the template's main source of output. Create the file called index.php and open it. This is the basic content of the file which is required for Mambo operation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct Access to this location is not allowed.' );
$iso = split( '=', _ISO );
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;'. $iso[1] .'&quot;?' .'&gt;';
?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
&lt;?php if ( $my-&gt;id ) initEditor(); ?&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; &lt;?php echo _ISO; ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;?php mosShowHead(); ?&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS['mosConfig_live_site']; ?&gt;/templates/yourtemplatesname/css/template_css.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As I assume you know basic HTML, you should know that the content and the template itself is to be placed in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags of the template. Here you can use whatever method you like for content organization, e.g., div-tags or tables. I'll use tables in this example.

This is my planned layout:


{| width=&quot;500&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | SITE NAME 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Pathway/breadcrumb
|- 
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Left modules 
| width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot; | &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More main content  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
| width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | Right modules 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Footer with copyright info 
|}

This is the HTML code for this layout to be placed in the body-tags:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;700&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td height=&quot;50&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;SITE NAME &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Pathway/breadcrumb&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;150&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Left modules&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;400&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More main content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;150&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Right modules &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Some footer text. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can see that this layout has some simple static text in it, such as &quot;left modules&quot; and &quot;Some footer text.&quot; Now I will replace this text with dynamic Mambo variables.

====Site name====

Mambo has a variable for the site name, and this variable is mainly used in the page title and when sending e-mails etc with Mambo. This variable can also be echoed in the template, and this is what will be done here. Of course, you can also write the name of the site directly into the template, but it is more appropriate to use this variable, as it makes the template more dynamic.

This is what the variable looks like: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$GLOBALS[mosConfig_sitename]&lt;/source&gt;

Now, when entering php code into a template, you'll need to use the php-tags for this, so that PHP will render the variable into what it is. Then it will look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php echo $GLOBALS[mosConfig_sitename] ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Place this line in the template, instead of the SITE NAME-text that is there now.

====Pathway====

The pathway uses a similar dsg:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php dsf?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====Modules====

In the layout you can see something called left- and right modules. This is a core function of Mambo, and is used to place small &quot;boxes&quot;, or modules, that can be e.g. a main menu, user login, newsflashes, most viewed items and so on. The term left and right is simply different module positions, and they can be chosen in Mambo.

Anyway, here is the codes:

Replace the &quot;Left modules&quot;-text with this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'left' ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The right modules are very similar:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'right' ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====The main content====

I will not explain much here, other than the way to do this is the same as with the above things; 
insert this where you want the main content to appear:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosMainBody(); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

====The footer====</text>

== System Requirements ==


=== Server - Apache ===

Mambo Open Source is designed and developed to support Apache, but it may work on IIS and other server types and clients. Since Apache is the preferred server, this article will only mention Apache.

The operating system Apache is installed on can be anything that the Apache platform supports, but it is Linux, Mac OS X, Windows 2000/XP and BSD that has been tested properly. Unix based systems are recommended, for security and preformance reasons.

[http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache HTTP server]

=== PHP ===

PHP will need to be installed and configured with Apache. Version 4.1.2 or newer is required. The MySQL and zlib modules must also be installed into PHP. There are tons of guides telling you how to do this, hopefully someone will create one here too.

PHP also needs to have a writable session save path. This is configured in the php.ini-file with the line ''session.save_path = /path''. PHP need to have full access to the folder specified here. On a windows system, this path will be something like ''session.save_path = C:\Program Files\Something'', while a unix system has the ''session.save_path = /home/var/www''-system.

Here is a useful link for Windows users: [http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=24136 Thread at Mamboserver.com].

[http://www.php.net/ PHP official site]

=== MySQL ===

The final ingredient is the MySQL database server. Mambo has been tested on MySQL 4.0 and 4.1 and can also run on later 3.0 releases.</text>

This are the rules for all modules in the Mambo Open Source book. '''Follow them without exceptions'''!

== Naming of content items ==

Name content item like this: &lt;tt&gt;Mambo Open Source/Name of item&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Include the chapter list ==

Add {{tlx|MAMBOTOC_SMALL}} to the top of every chapter of the book. This outputs the small table of contents, called chapters, and is needed for proper navigation in the book. This will also place pages in the [[:Category:Mambo Open Source|Mambo Open Source]] category.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==

'''Observational learning''' or '''social learning''' refers to learning that occurs as a function of observing, retaining and replicating behaviour observed in others. It is most associated with the work of psychologist [[Albert Bandura]], who implemented some of the seminal studies in the area and initiated '''social learning theory'''.

Although observational learning can take place at any stage in life, it is thought to be particularly important during [[childhood]], particularly as [[authority]] becomes important. 

Because of this, social learning theory has influenced debates on the effect of [[television]] violence and parental [[role model]]s. Bandura's [[Bobo doll experiment]] is widely cited in psychology as a demonstration of observational learning and demonstrated that children are more likely to engage in violent play with a life size rebounding doll after watching an adult do the same.

Observational learning allows for learning without any change in behaviour and has therefore been used as an argument against strict [[behaviourism]] which argued that behaviour change must occur for new behaviours to be acquired.

===Required conditions===
Bandura called the process of social learning ''modelling'' and gave four conditions required for a person to successfully model the behaviour of someone else:

* Attention to the model
:A person must first pay attention to a person engaging in a certain behaviour (the model).

* Retention of details
:Once attending to the observed behaviour, the observer must be able to effectively remember what the model has done.
He talked a lot about sponge cake

*Motor reproduction
:The observer must be able to replicate the behaviour being observed. For example, juggling cannot be effectively learned by observing a model juggler if the observer does not already have the ability to perform the component actions (throwing and catching a ball).

*Motivation and Opportunity
:The observer must be motivated to carry out the action they have observed and remembered, and must have the opportunity to do so. For example, a suitably skilled person must want to replicate the behaviour of a model juggler, and needs to have an appropriate number of items to juggle to hand.

===Effect on behaviour===
Social learning may effect behaviour in the follow ways:
* Teaches new behaviours
* Increases or decreases the frequency of which previously learnt behaviours are carried out
* Can encourage previously forbidden behaviours
* Can increase or decrease similar behaviours. For example, observing a model excelling in piano playing may encourage an observer to excel in playing the saxophone.

Social Exchange Theory (sub of Reinforcement):
-assumes freedom of choice and situations that require decision making; cost/benefit analysis
-people are hedonistic - they try to maximize rewards and minimize costs
-views social relationships primarily as exchanges of goods and services among persons
-include equity theory here as: predicting the conditions under which people try to change or restructure their relationships; a state of equity exists in a relationship when participants feel that the rewards they receive are proportional to the costs they bear

'''Social exchange theory''' is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] perspective that explains social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between parties. Social exchange theory posits that all human relationships are formed by the use of a subjective [[cost-benefit analysis]] and the ''comparison of alternatives''. For example, when a person perceives the costs of relationship as outweighing the perceived benefits, then the theory predicts that the person will choose to leave the relationship.

The early permuatations of Social Exchange Theory stem from Gouldner's (1960) norm of reciprocity, which simply argues that people aught to return benefits given to them in a relationship.  Later modifications to this theory focus attention on relational development and maintenance rules (see Murstein et al.)  [added by J.P. Boren, 2005]

For social exchange theorists, when the costs and benefits are equal in a relationship, then that relationship is not '''equitable'''. The notion of equity is a core part of social exchange theory.

Social exchange theory is intimately tied to [[rational choice theory]], and features all of its main assumptions.

'''Rational choice theory''' is a way of looking at deliberations between a number of potential courses of action, in which &quot;[[rationality]]&quot; of one form or another is used either to decide which course of action would be the best to take, or to predict which course of action actually will be taken. Such a perspective finds itself in [[model]]s for both [[human behavior]] and [[behavior]] of non-human but nonetheless potentially rational entities, such as [[corporations]].

Obviously, what is taken as &quot;rational&quot; is of chief importance here.  This varies with context:
* The technical meaning in economics is about [[preference]]s: preferences are defined to be rational if they are complete and transitive.  That is, that the decision maker is able to compare all of the alternatives, and that these comparisons are consistent.  See the [[preference]]s page for further explanation.
* If uncertainty is involved, then the [[independence axiom]] is often assumed in addition to rational preferences.
* Rationality can also mean that the decision maker always chooses the most preferred option, as in the [[Utility Maximization Problem]].

Often, to simplify [[calculation]] and ease [[prediction]], some rather unrealistic [[assumption]]s are made about the [[world]]. These can include:

* An individual has precise [[information]] about exactly what will occur under any choice made. (Alternatively, an individual has a reliable [[probability distribution]] describing what will happen under any choice made.)
* An individual has time and ability to weigh every choice against every other choice.
* An individual is fully aware of all possible choices.

Assumptions such as these have sparked criticism from a number of camps. Some people have tried to create models of [[bounded rationality]], which try to be more [[Psychology|psychologically]] plausible without giving up completely on the idea that some kind of [[reason]] underlies decision-making processes.

=== Why rational choice theory? ===

One question that can be asked is why people try to base their models on concepts such as &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;[[preference]]s&quot;, and what is implied by them, [[free will]]. Some potential reasons:

* They see people as &quot;rational&quot; [[being]]s, and thus believe that a model in which they are represented as such should be reasonably accurate
* Assumptions of rationality have useful formal properties

Various researchers has found some limits to this theory, under the name of [[bounded rationality]], an element used for example in [[behavioral economics]].

This article explains basics about the administrator section in mambo, and how to use it.


==What is the administration in mambo?==

The administration part of Mambo (often called Backend) is a key element. What mambo does is managing your content, and it is in the administration you do this. Here you have all the settings, you administer the menu, add and manage content, upload files to the download manager and so on.

The administration section of mambo is often called &quot;the backend&quot; in the mambo community.

=== How to get there ===

You get to the administration panel by entering an address in the address field of the browser (the field where you enter url's). If your sites url is ''www.yoursite.com'', the url to the admin section is '''www.yoursite.com/administrator'''. If the address is ''www.yoursite.com/folder'', the access to admin can be gained through '''www.yoursite.com/folder/administrator'''.

If you just installed mambo, and chose to install it with sample data, you can find a link to the administrator panel in the menu.

=== Log in ===

When you enter the admin-section, you'll first get prompted for a username and password. If you haven't done anything with this after the installation, the username is admin and the password is the one you specified during installation.

Enter the appropriate values here, and it will take you to the administration part of mambo.

=== The admin panel ===

Now you see the admin panel, if everything worked prior to what mentioned above.

On the top of the page, below the logo, is the '''drop-down menu'''. Here are the links to preform all available tasks in mambo. Although, depending on access level which tasks shown may vary from user to user. But with the default admin account, you will have access to everything. See the  [[Mambo_Open_Source/Which_options_available_for_each_usertype|user access article]] for more info about access levels.

In the middle to the left are the '''quickicons'''. These icons can be used to preform the most frequently preformed tasks, as [[Mambo_Open_Source/User_management|user management]], content writing, [[Mambo_Open_Source/Menu_management|menu management]] and [[Mambo_Open_Source/Dealing with images|image uploading]].

This is the basics of administration, see other articles in this book for more details and further progress.</text>

There are a number of different user types in Mambo, and it can be useful to know that privileges and rights each user type has. Sometimes, you may want a user to be able to write content but not publish it - there are user types for this.

=== Guest ===

The guest user is anyone visiting your website that has not logged in yet. Your site visitors can view all content and utilize all feature of the website that are available to all users including guests.

All other user levels have the same privileges as the guest user along with additional capabilities.


== Frontend ==


=== Registered user ===

The registered users will have access to all menu items in the class &quot;public&quot; and &quot;registered&quot;. The user will also have access to edit its own user details such as password and real name

=== Author ===

Access to the &quot;new&quot; buttons that shows under the articles when browsing a content category. Can't publish new articles, and cannot edit existing ones.

=== Editor ===

Can edit already published articles, as well as create new ones. Cannot publish articles.

=== Publisher ===

A publisher can create items, save them and publish them - a publisher can in other words publish articles on the front page without any approval from admininstrators.

== Backend ==

Content can be created or edited from both the frontend of your Mambo website or from the Administration backend. In both cases it is required that you have logged in. For basic explanations of content items, see [[Mambo_Open_Source/Content_basics|content basics-article]]. You can also read the [[Mambo_Open_Source/Administration_basics|administration basics article]]

===From frontend===

Browse to the ''content'' category were you want the article - e.g. &quot;news &gt; latest news&quot;. Here you can see a list of all the content items in the category, or a pagination or something similar. Somewhere on '''this page''' a &quot;new&quot;-icon shows up. Press this, and you enter the &quot;new content item&quot;-section.

Write the content as usual . On the bottom of this page, below the text fields, you can see some tabs and some parameters. Enter the parameters here as usual.

Press the save-button at the top of the page.

===From backend===

At the main page of the backend (the home-link), use the &quot;All content items&quot;-button in the quickicons-section. Here you get a list of all the content items available. Press the &quot;new&quot; button in the toolbar.

This takes you to the standard inputbox-view. Write content, and choose content section and category in the drop-down menus to the right of the items &quot;title&quot; and &quot;alias&quot;-fields.

The parameters box appear on the right of the inputs, and this should be configured the way you want it to.</text>

== Reverting page move vandalism ==

The way to revert page-move vandalism is to ''move the page back to its original name'', not to copy &amp;paste the original page onto the new one.  '''Copy&amp;paste &quot;moves&quot; are bad.  Don't do them.'''  Unfortunately, you've stopped other people from fixing the vandalism properly, and now we have to wait for an administrator to delete the new page so that [[Wikibooks:Ass Pus in Progress]] can be moved back to its original location. Please don't do that again. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 09:26, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:It's not so bad.  The deletion is done, and the page moved. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:47, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity School of Music ==

Please see my comments on the [Wikiversity:School of Music] page. While the content you've created is good, it does not belong within the SOM namespace, it is a textbook you've written, not a Wikiversity section.

== Moving vs Removing ==

Hi, You just removed ''global configuration''. maybe better idea could be to move to better place? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 23:54, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Hi,

:I removed it as it wasnt a part of the installation. I am sorry if that might seemed harsh, i don't want to scare away contributors, so thanks for contacting me! I have added an article for the global configuration under the miscellaneous chapter, and a new configuration-category. *[[Mambo_Open_Source/Global configuration|A link to the article]].

:Please feel free to do more contributions - and i will try to take it to the discussion page before simply deleting stuff.. =)

== book rating. ==

Ok, it's new and not widely used but there is a template to rate the books: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Important - in the dynamic wiki environment - is the date when the rating was issued.

=== Explanation ===

In the beginning the rating of pages was just done by a small icon (you know 0%.png, 25%.png) etc. pp. and most pages are still rated this way.

However it is suggested that any new rating is done with the templates above. This templates also show the date when the rating was done. 

See [[Help:Development_stages]] for more details on how to rate a book.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 05:26, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== What should we do? ===

I am aware of this new system, as I just implented it into the norwegian wikibooks. But i had no idea it was new! Anyway, should I just go ahead and use those templates? And rate it to 50%?

=== Yes ===

Shure, i.E. I changed all ratings for [[Programming:Ada]] - at least when I found them.

=== It's done ===

Fixed the rating of the mambo open source book in the it-bookshelf template. --August 14:26, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Gambling to a Million==
*There are other one-page wikibooks, like [[How to Tie a Tie]]; furthermore, is the [[Jokebook]] really educational? [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 5 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)

::Well, i think that books like ''how to tie a tie'' and ''gambling to a million'' really should go away and be deleted - they are small and un needed, and as you can see, both have now been removed. None of those could have been called a book, ad it was one page only. If you had created a book, and started on a book, that could expand and be contributed to, and not a single page, chances are that no one would have deleted it. But one page only books, that you actually claimed to be 100% complete, has nothing in the wikibooks to do.

::Actually, I urge you to create a book about gambling that is a book, and not one page. If you do that, i will support it. I agree that a book about gambling, and the jokebook are not for educational puspouses, but as long as they are used and contributed to i find them very useful to have at the wikibooks.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called August. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name August~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Some browsers, among those Internet Explorer, doesn't show transparency on transparent png-images. Instead, a grey colour is shown. This fixes the problem, but only for Internet Explorer (Win). NB! This problem doesn't affect Firefox, Opera and Netscape.

==Why png?==

Many people say that one can use gif images - both Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and all major browsers support transparency in gif images. The thing is that transparency is pretty bad and lossy in quality compared to png images. Regular transparency with hard edges are no problem, but shadow and transparent gradients are no good with gif. Png can do this without problems, tough, only that Internet Explorer (Win) doesn't support it (IE for Mac does).

==How to solve the problem==

===Adding code to the relevant page===
There is a simple modification that needs to be done with the template(s) the site is using.

This can be done from mambo, as long as the appropriate files are writable. Log in to the backend. Choose &quot;Site &gt; Template Manager &gt; Site templates&quot;. Choose the template that should be modified (naturally the standard template) and choose &quot;edit&quot; in the toolbar.

On the top of this document, add this line:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
require_once(&quot;includes/ie_png.php&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then upload the &quot;ie_png.php&quot;-file in the &quot;includes&quot; folder of your mambo installation. Here are the file:

[[Media:http://www.mambonordic.com/downloads/ie_png.zip]]

===Fixing the images themselves===

Internet Explorer (Win) can actually render some png-files - those with 256 colors. These images can contain any color in the HEX color scheme, but not more than 256 colors all together within the image. This is more than enough for most cases. Save/render the png images with this attribute, and Internet Explorer will actually render transparency.

There are some problems with transparent gradients, as fading shadows etc.</text>

This article '''explains the concept of server side scripting''', which is a key element in mambo.

==What is server side scripting?==

There are two major forms of scripting in web applications. One of them is client side scripting. This is scripts and code that is downloaded to the clients computer and is executed there. A good example of this is JavaScript and Flash. Here scripts are used to create animations, drop-down menus and other functions on the clients computer.

Server side scripting, on the opposite, keeps all the scripts on the server, and they are executed there. In this case, mambo is the script. Basically, the client sends a request to the server. The server, with mambo installed receives this request, and use the scripts on the server to create the page that the user has requested. Then, a finished version of the results of this program is sent to the user, with no scripts in it (exept from the client side scripts that might follow with a mambo site).</text>

'''Procedural Textures'''

Texturing objects can be broken down into two categories: procedural and image texturing.  Procedural texturing makes use of mathematical formulas to generate textures.  This is nice because it can be used to make relatively nice looking textures without external images which are very temperamental where you put them. Procedural Textures are all stored in the .blend file. These textures are obviously generated within Blender itself.  Image texturing uses images created or captured outside of Blender, either from an image manipulation program such as the Paint.NET, GIMP or Photoshop, or captured on a camera. We have already learned about image texturing, so let's move on to procedural texturing.

'''Current Procedural Textures'''

Blender currently supports many procedural textures, including: Clouds, Marble, Stucci, Wood, Magic, Blend, Noise, Musgrave, Voronoi and DistortedNoise.

==A Simple Wood Texture==
Let's define a simple wood texture:
* Start a new Blender document containing the default cube. 
* Select the cube (and nothing else)
* Go to the Materials tab [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] in the Properties Window, and rename the default &quot;Material&quot; to &quot;Wood Material&quot;. Alternatively, delete the default material using the X to the right of the name field and add a new material.

Let's add some color and texture.  You can see the results at any time by pressing F12 to re-render the scene.  

Start by painting cube a base color using the Wood Material's &quot;diffuse&quot; color:
* In the “Material” tab, 
* Scroll down to the “Diffuse” properties panel and choose a darker brown color e.g. #A57E3F.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV for where brown fits in the color wheel.  

Next, let's add a texture to give the material some highlights.
* Switch to the “Texture” properties tab [[File:Blender259_Texture_Button.png]], and again rename the default &quot;Tex&quot; to &quot;Wood Texture&quot; or create a new texture.  Notice at the very top of the &quot;Texture&quot; tab &quot;Cube &gt; Wood Material &gt; Wood Texture&quot;
* Change the Type of the material to “Wood” using the pop-up menu. 

The texture sample will show parallel alternating black and white bars that don’t look very woody at all.  Never fear!  The black regions will be the material's base &quot;diffuse&quot; color.  The white regions are like &quot;highlights&quot; that will be painted over the base.

Let's make some improvements to the texture:
* While still in the “Textures” tab, 
* Scroll to the “Wood” properties panel that appears, change the waveform from “Sine” to “Saw”. 
* In the next row of buttons down, change the type from the default “Bands” to “Ring Noise”. 
* Increase the Noise Size to 1.0. 
Now the texture sample should show something resembling wavy tree-rings. If you hit F12 to render now, you will see these rings covering your cube, except a) the colour is wrong, and b) normal wood patterns aren't so nearly circular. 

To make the pattern more elongated: 
* Scroll to the “Mapping” properties panel, 
* Change the Size X value to 2.0 and Y to 0.4. This squishes the pattern down along the X-axis, and stretches it out along the Y-axis, giving the elliptical tree-ring shapes you commonly see on wood planks and boards.

Hit F12 to render again, and the shape of the texture should be looking a lot more woody now.  

The final step is to color the highlights in the texture:
* In the “Textures” tab, 
* Scroll to the “Influence” properties panel further down, 
* Click on the color swatch, and choose a nice brown colour.  
For a nicer effect, I chose a very light brown e.g. #DEB887.  

The result should look very woody indeed!

[[Image:Blender259WoodTextureSample.png]]

* Remember that you need to Render to see the wood grain on your object.

== Image Texture Settings ==
[[File:Checkerboard tile.svg|thumb|100px|Simple checkerboard]]
To understand how the texture settings apply to image/movie textures, start with an example texture. A nice simple one is this checkerboard at right—don’t forget to download it in (or convert it to) PNG format, as Blender cannot use an SVG file as a texture.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureTypeMenuImage.png|thumb|upright]]
Start a new Blender document. Note the default cube already has a a default grey material, called “Material”, and this already has a single texture, called “Tex”, of type “None”, which means it has no effect.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Before proceeding, go to the World [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] context and turn on Environment Lighting (you can leave its default energy at 1.0). This will ensure the cube is more evenly lit, for easier visibility of the texture effect.}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureContextImagePanelNone.png|thumb]]
Under the Texture [[File:Blender255TextureContextButton.png]] context of the Properties window, with Material Texture [[File:Blender268TextureIconMaterial.png]] selected, change the texture type to “Image or Movie”. You will immediately see some new panels pop up in the texture context. Look for the Image panel, as at right. This initially contains a popup menu icon for selecting from any previously-loaded images (this will start out empty), a “New” button for using one of Blender’s predefined test textures, and an “Open” button for loading an image from a file.

Click the “Open” button, and select your previously-downloaded or converted PNG version of the example checkerboard texture.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268TextureContextImageSettings.png|thumb|upright]]
Now a whole lot more settings will become visible. From the top, the panels are:
* Preview — gives you a simple display of how the texture looks.
* Colors — lets you make simple adjustments to the image brightness, contrast etc.
* Image — lets you choose from any already-loaded images, and shows you the pathname of the file the image was loaded from. Note the two arrows in a circle to the right of the pathname display: clicking this will tell Blender to reload the image from the file, which is useful if you make changes to it in an external image editor.
* Image Sampling — controls how the image can be interpreted in a different way from straight pixel values.
* Image Mapping — lets you crop the input image, and apply fixed numbers of repetitions to it along each axis, even before it goes through the usual texture-tiling repetition process.
* Mapping, Influence — these are more general panels that apply to all types of textures. They will be discussed in more detail shortly.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Image packing: the icon to the left of the image pathname lets you pack a complete copy of the image into the .blend file, so it no longer keeps reading the original image file. This can be useful if you want your .blend file to be self-contained, particularly if you want to send it to others. On the other hand, if your workflow depends on coordinating with someone else doing the image editing, it may be more convenient to leave it linking to a separate image file.}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender.png|thumb|Projection: flat; axes: X→X, Y→Y, Z→Z]]
If you render {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} now, you should end up with an image like this. Notice in the Projection menu (''Texture'' &amp;rarr; ''Mapping'') the initial selection is “Flat”: this means that the texture X and Y coordinates go straight to object X and Y coordinates. Thus, the texture only appears on the top (and also bottom) of the cube, not on its sides. See also the three little popup menus just below the Projection menu, each containing the items X, Y and Z. These let you rearrange the object coordinates that the texture coordinates map to. If you change the first two, you can get the texture to appear on other pairs of sides of the cube, other than the top and bottom. The third menu (corresponding to the Z axis of the texture) has no effect (yet), because a flat image texture is only two-dimensional.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender2.png|thumb|Texture size increased to 3.]]
Now try changing the three “Size” fields in the Mapping panel: give them all a value of 3. This will uniformly shrink the texture pattern to one-third of its original size. Or alternatively, it will require three times the number of texture repetitions to span the same distance as the original.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender3.png|thumb|Texture projection set to Sphere]]
Now let’s try the other Projection types. Here’s what “Sphere” looks like. Imagine the texture pattern as a flat sheet stretched and curved around, and its edges joined to form a sphere surrounding the actual object; then the sphere is shrinkwrapped down onto the object.

Note the top and bottom edges of the sheet shrink down to single points at the north and south poles; this is why the squares of the checkerboard pattern turn into triangles next to these points.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Z-axis now works: because these projection types other than “Flat” turn the texture into a 3-dimensional object, you can now use all 3 of the axis-rearrangement menus to reorient the texture in interesting, not to say confusing, ways. What happens when you assign the same texture axis to more than one object axis?}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender268SimpleDefaultTextureRender4.png|thumb|Texture projection set to Tube]]
Here’s a Tube mapping. Here the texture pattern sheet is rolled round into a cylinder, with only one pair of edges joined together, the top and bottom left open.

And lastly, here is a Cube mapping. Here 6 copies of the texture pattern are arranged parallel to the faces of a cube, before being shrinkwrapped onto the actual object. Which in this case, happens to be a cube.

Cube mappings are very commonly used in game engines, because they are just about the simplest way to wrap a texture around an entire object.

== Making Your Own Texture ==

Procedural texturing is very powerful; however, sometimes it is difficult or impossible to generate the desired realism with them.  Image texturing is there for you when you need it.  To review, the basic idea is to take an outside image and wrap it around your model.   You can use any texture, or a seamless one if you want it to repeat to get a tiled effect. The following shows how you create a seamless texture, and then how to apply any texture (seamless or otherwise) to an object.

=== The difference between 'tiled' and 'seamless' ===
In many cases a simple material will just not cut it for an object, and you will want to apply a texture to it. However, depending on the object, you may want to apply either a seamless or tileable texture. A seamless texture is an image that will, when applied to an object, spread evenly across the surface of the object without any visible borders or 'seams' even if the object is many times larger than the resolution of the image (also called 'procedural textures' in Blender). These can be useful in many situations; such as when you want a texture for a carpet to seamlessly repeat itself without having a huge resolution.

A tileable texture on the other hand, is an image that will repeat itself across an object, but with noticeable seams. Any image can be used as a tileable texture, but often they will only be used in specific instances such as a vinyl floor with a tiled pattern on it.

See [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Using_Textures|Using Textures]] for more details on applying images as textures, and using them to affect many other surface attributes such as luminosity, reflectivity, translucency, displacement etc.

=== How to make a tileable texture with the GIMP ===
[[File:MakeSeamlessSample.jpeg|thumb]]

It is easy to create a tiling texture image with [http://www.gimp.org the GIMP]. Start with the photo you want to use. Crop out any part you don’t want. Here’s an example random photo of some plants in my garden:

Go to Gimp’s “Filters” menu, and find the “Map” submenu. In here you will find the entry “Make Seamless”. Select it. That’s it:

[[File:MakeSeamlessSampleUsage.jpeg|thumb]]

Just to prove it works, here’s a (scaled-down) use of the result as a tiled fill pattern:

=== Other Image Texture Editors ===
*[http://www.spiralgraphics.biz/ww_overview.htm Wood Workshop] A free utility (Requires Operating System: Windows 2000/XP) that generates surprisingly high quality tiling wood texture images. These textures can be exported as standard image files for use within Blender.
*[http://www.mapzoneeditor.com/ MapZone] A free utility for Windows (works perfectly in [http://winehq.org/ Wine]) that generates node based procedural texture maps.  Mapzone can export diffuse, normal and alpha texture maps as standard image files.  It can also import SVG regions created with Blender's UV mapping tools.

Making objects with image textures is not really hard for simple objects like balls, cubes, and tubes. I'll show you how to do this:
[[File:The-rusty-ball.png|300px|right]]

# Make a new scene in Blender and delete the default cube.
# Add a sphere.  Apply a Subsurf modifier and Smooth as we have learned in previous tutorials.
# Find a file picture that you want to apply to your object.  Check Flickr for something like &quot;rust texture.&quot;  (If you are going to share it, be sure you check the license of the texture you download.)
# IMPORTANT: Sometimes you need a seamless texture.  If you are not sure, use a program such as GIMP.  Use FILTERS &gt; MAP &gt; MAKE SEAMLESS.  Usually this works well but if your texture turns into gorp, try another one.
# ('''Noob Note:''' ''Do [http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient&amp;rlz=1T4GGLR_enUS262US264&amp;q=rust%20texture&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi ''a search for '''Rust Textures''' ''] if you do not have one handy.'')
# In the Properties Panel, which by default is the bottom right panel, select the Material icon [[File:Blender268TextureIconMaterial.png]].
# Select NEW or if you already have a material in use, select the + sign to add a new material.  Give it a good name like rustyball.
# Click on the Texture Icon [[File:Blender268TextureIconBrush.png]].
# Click NEW or if you already have a texture loaded, click on the + to add a new one.  Give it a good name like RUST.
# The default type is CLOUDS.  Pull down the menu and change it to IMAGE OR MOVIE.
# Go to the IMAGE section, choose OPEN.  New options will become available. (Note: JPGs, PNGs or TGAs are recommended for Blender. Bitmaps tend to get all screwy.)
# Under Source: Click the folder icon and navigate to your image.
# Scroll down.  In the Image Mapping area are some options that you may need to try.  If your image is small it may have to be repeated in the X or Y directions.
# In the Mapping section (yes, one section is Image Mapping and the other is just Mapping) after Projection, choose the shape closest to your object.  If you are using a sphere like the example, then choose ... you guessed it ... SPHERE.
* The Preview often looks a bit odd and stripey, but render your project and it should look very nice.
* This method works for all sorts of things.  Try making a brick wall with a wooden gate using Flickr textures or go back to the Jeep tutorial and put a pattern on your jeep.  
* You can also render videos onto objects using this method.  Just select a movie in the &quot;Load image&quot; dialog and enable the option &quot;Movie&quot; at the textures buttons.  &lt;i&gt;NOTE:&lt;/i&gt; Blender ONLY works with Full Resolution video, not video which has been compressed using a codec.  Most video software will allow you to export video as &quot;'''full frames'''&quot; or &quot;'''no compression'''&quot;.  Experiment a bit!

== '''&quot;Every Single Material Known To Man&quot; Project''' ==

Want to share your material settings with the world?  This is the place! This page is going to be turning from a page to a chapter, but to do that we need your support! If you have an idea for a material, even if you don't know how to make it, just put it in the list to help! Someone out there knows how to make it, and if they come across this page with it listed, they might be willing to share.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
=== Etiquette ===
*Explain the basics of every material (such as Color, Spec, and shading, but not neccessarily specifics such as Emit or Trans), even if it is with standard &quot;Add New&quot; properties.
*IF you provide a picture, &lt;u&gt;explain&lt;/u&gt; in the method &lt;u&gt;all details&lt;/u&gt; to get us to make ours look the exact same way, do not omit any detail (including anything done in out tabs, or in other categories like Rendering. Also, say if you use something like RayMir or if you have additional lighting or objects to enhance the look!.)
*Make sure you explain the &quot;Tab&quot; and the &quot;Category&quot; for a material alterations, because not everyone might know what you mean. Be as formal as possible, categorize and organize, and try using the blender-used words instead of your own lingo, if possible.

&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt;
*Bad explanation:''Set the material's texture's normal to 0.4''
*Good explanation:''Under the &quot;Map To&quot; Tab, Select the &quot;Nor&quot; Slider and set it to 0.4''
*Best explanation:
**'''''Map To:'''''
**''Output-&lt;u&gt;Nor&lt;/u&gt;''
**'''''Nor'''Slider-&lt;u&gt;0.4&lt;/u&gt;''

~~Do NOT replace or delete other people's method on your own. If you believe you have a better way, simply label their explanation &quot;Method A&quot; and create another sub-headline with your method as &quot;Method B&quot; (and so on). If you believe a method is incorrect, insufficiently detailed or plagarism, appeal to the original author (if able) or on the Discussion page and get support for a removal. &lt;br&gt;
~~Do NOT say your material is better than anyone elses-- everyone has a right to their own opinion and preferences --you may say your method is more &quot;detailed&quot; or &quot;memory-efficient&quot; or &quot;adaptable&quot;, but &lt;u&gt;DO NOT SLANDER&lt;/u&gt; other people's methods.&lt;br&gt;

The '''mm''', is the symbol for millimetre (millimeter in US spelling), which is an [SI unit of measurement for length. It is equal to 1/1000 [[Cookbook:m|m]]. There are 25.4 mm per [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]]. There are 10 mm per [[Cookbook:cm|cm]].

As many recipes have been crudely converted from one system to another, a similarly crude conversion back may yield the original recipe.

Hope you don't mind me adding stuff. I like Digital Photography. :) [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:02, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

We definitely need to reorganize this page. The size of the page is getting unfriendly.. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 03:18, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)




:::I think let's classify the '''Digital Camera''' sub-section, and the '''Memory/ Batteries''' sub-sections into one separate page called '''Camera Types and Accessories''' -- we can expand to include flashes, filters, etc.

:::'''Taking Pictures''' and everything under it can probably be one separate page by itself.. at the moment, Pre- and Post-processing doesn't seem to have enough content to justify a page by itself, what do you think?

:::So, something like this on the first page:

:::*Introduction to Digital Photography (Short introduction on page)
:::*Taking Digital Photos (Opens New Page)
:::*Pre- and Post- Processing (Currently keep on page)
:::*Digital Camera Types and Accessories (Opens New Page)


[[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:33, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

For now it would be real improvement over keeping everything on one page. I just typed such long list to have an idea what is missing in this book and how to expand it. I'm new to wiki's so can you make your proposals into this book? --[[User:Minda315|Minda315]] 06:17, 2005 Apr 22 (UTC)

: No probs. Just let me do it over the weekend.. I'm at work and I'm actually supposed to '''work''' ^^; [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 06:22, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
----
Ok, the above big stack of changes is somewhat done, but the '''Taking Digital Photos''' part needs to be reworked again (still too big, Wiki complains... :) Take a look through and let me know what you guys think.

Two issues -- the pages are supposed to have a link at the top to point back to the previous page, doesn't seem to be working right now so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

The other thing is the standardization of URI links. I'm currently using '''&lt;nowiki&gt; [[wikipedia:subject|subject]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to link, but I noticed some of us using '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject subject]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to link.  

This does change the way Wiki renders the page. Do we want to standardize this? [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:48, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Yes we need standartisation. I just added link in '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject subject]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' format due to lack of wiki knowledge :( Anyway links to wikipedia, in my opinion, are very useful. 

:'''Taking  digital Photos''' in current stage is written somehow chaotic and needs to be arranged in more systematic way. It is good to view all things in practical aproach, but adding some theory, short terms descriptions (with links to wikipedia for details) won't hurt. I try to work on litle peaces, as I i have free time. One big problem is that I'm not native english speaker, and and learned english not in the scool but on my own, so my english texts are low quality :( --[[User:Minda315|Minda315]] 13:55, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)

:'''On the subject of links''', I would prefer the '''&lt;nowiki&gt; [[wikipedia:subject|subject]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' link because it is an internal link and somehow seems more trustworthy to me.  I am more hesitant to click on an external link because I have done that in the past and they've taken me to hoax sites.  I would say that if we have the ability to use the specialized wikepedia links then we should standardize on that, and use only external links when linking to an external URL. --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 21:20, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: I kind of like '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikipedia:subject|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' :-). --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)


----

Also, can the various contributors please update the Authors section? Would like to know who we are working with. :P [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 03:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Heh, nevermind, I've added [[User:Minda315|Minda315]] and [[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]]. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:47, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I think the outline above is a good start, making it more of a real book format rather than a glorified FAQ.  But I think we will find that once we have the new structure some of the sections need to be rewritten to avoid overly duplicate information.  Not to worry though, that's a bridge we can cross later.

One other suggestion.  I would really like to see more sample photographs that illustrate some of the concepts.  I am willing to start with some myself (over the next few days).  I think this could do wonders to anchor the readers attention around bits of information that this book is trying to communicate.

Meanwhile, I am trying to get the hang out of editing my comments here. --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 18:37, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Hi, will give my inputs whenever I get some free time. ==

Hello, I like digital and film photography too and so i will try to provide inputs for this book whenever i can get some free time. seeya around :o)

You may be interested in using material from [[Transwiki:Digital camera astrophotography]].

== Copying from Wikipedia? ==

Hey there everyone.  I just have taken an interest in this wikibook, and I was wondering if there are any rules to coping from wikipedia?  Check out the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography#Sensor_size_and_angle_of_view Sensor size and angle of view] section of the Digital photography article in Wikipedia.  It seems like we could almost copy/paste that section into a new &quot;Choosing a digital Camera&quot; section, and then edit it to give a more buyers guide type feel for the different types of digital cameras (DSLR vs point and shoot vs cell phone)  Looking further into that article, about half of it would fit into a &quot;Choosing...&quot; section.   Any ideas?

:Wikipedia is open source, so there would be no problem copying it. However, I would make one point&amp;mdash;if we want to copy the content at this moment and then let it evolve independently (which is probably appropriate here), then copy'n'paste. Updates here will contextualize the information in this source and remain independent of updates to the wikipedia page...in other words, there should be no attempt to keep them in sync. On the other hand, if we do desire to keep a solid reference to the wikipedia page, then I would recommend we link and/or reference the wikipedia entry here, perhaps providing a brief summary of the relevant content of that entry.

:I don't know if this is a standard practice on Wikibooks, but I see no reason why it shouldn't be. (If your question is primarily concerned about copyright, no need&amp;mdash;all content created for both this site and Wikipedia are completely open source and license-free.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Did you have a hard time reading, understanding, digesting, or remembering Stephen Covey's bestselling book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People? Then this study guide may help you. 

'''If you read the book already:''' The guide will refresh and reinforce what you read, whether you understood it the first time or not.

'''If you plan to read the book:''' The guide will prepare your mind so you can understand the book with less effort.

'''If you have not read the book, and do not plan to read it:''' The guide will help you become familiar with what the book says, and reap some or many of its benefits, in less time and with less effort. We might say, learn 80% with 20% of the effort.

Let's face it, the book has a lot of great content, even though it is wordy and reading it can give you a headache.

* Be confident, having the freedom to choose'' (to act with responsibility)
* Personal Leadership, It is your choice'' (With focus you plan, prioritize and visualize your actions)
* Self Management, action This is now organizing and executing around your priorities
* Relationships, aka ''respect'' Always listen while seeking solutions that support yourself and the other person, listen actively before you talk, open yourself to communicate effectively with others

= Private victory, the path to independence =
== Habit 1: Be proactive ==
'''Take action''' and '''take responsibility'''. This is the basis of all further habits and a cornerstone of success. You will influence your life more than anyone else. You have the opportunity to use your free will and hard work to change yourself and your circumstances. You are only a victim if you allow yourself to be; if you are reactive rather than proactive. The emphasis of this habit is to do whatever is in your power to improve your situation. You are the creator, the actor and the doer in your life; get started and &quot;just do it&quot;. Since, in a situation, the thing that you can influence and change the most is your response to it - choose your response to any situation and you will find yourself in control. No one can &quot;make&quot; you angry if you decide you don't want to get angry. Don't let life set you up to be in a bad situation. Have confidence in yourself and believe that you can succeed at anything in life.

In your internal dialogue, replace language such as &quot;I must do X&quot; with &quot;I choose to do X&quot;, &quot;I have to&quot; with &quot;I want to&quot;, &quot;If only...&quot; with &quot;Let's see about...&quot; etc.
* I choose to not be angry in my work environment
* I choose to spend only planned expenses in my personal budget
* I want to be more present and involved in my family's happiness

== Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind ==
'''Visualize where you want to go'''. Before you start something sit down and '''plan it out'''. A little planning will usually save you a lot of actual work later. Use your creative forces to create images and plans in your head first, then carry out your plan. The plan is called the first creation; the second creation is formed when you carry out the plan, and its success depends on a well thought out first creation.

{{cquote|It's extremely easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the business of life, the thick of thin things.}} 

* I want to be family physician
* I want to have a full registration with HPSCA
* I want to become a useful consultant
* I want to be a good husband, to be a good father
* I want to be respected

== Habit 3: Put first things first ==
'''Set priorities'''. Decide which of your roles and goals are most important, then determine what steps will best achieve those goals. Basically it means doing life with your values in hand. It means defining your idea of success in life from the image you would like to leave in the roles that you assume like (spouse, grandparent, voter, activist, student, employee, manager). The idea is to have these clearly defined and on a piece of paper.

We need to schedule our priorities. We can use the time management matrix to determine where to spend our time. 

''' There are four quadrants where we spend our time: '''
# Important and Urgent
# Important but not Urgent
# Urgent but not Important
# Not Urgent or Important
To be effective we need to take care of everything in quadrant 1 and then spend as much of our remaining time as possible in quadrant 2. We need to live in quadrants 1 and 2.

Quadrant 1 activities are the things that are important and urgent: emergencies, deadline-driven projects, crises, some meetings, some phone calls. These are the things we cannot and should not ignore. They demand our immediate attention.

Quadrant 2 activities include: all work in each of the 7 habits, maintenance, recreation, self-care, learning, reading, and relationship building. These are the things we don't do because they're never urgent. They're important, but once we finish dealing with the Urgent and Important crises, we often don't want to work in quadrant 2. We get distracted by Urgent things that are not important—quadrant 3 activities—such as phone calls, text messages or interruptions from others. We might want to retreat to the gratifying but wasteful activities of quadrant 4 because we feel like we deserve a break.  We don't realize that we are setting ourselves up for more crises in quadrant 1 by ignoring the important activities of quadrant 2.

= Public victory, the path to interdependence =
== Habit 4: Think win-win ==
Many people grow up with a competitive mindset (&quot;I win, you lose&quot;), a beaten-down mindset (&quot;I give up, do what you want to me&quot;), or a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for your most valuable family and business interactions, the most mature and effective goal is usually to seek situations which benefit everyone involved.

When you negotiate you should seek to make deals that help everyone.&lt;!-- Redundant, but keeps the following sentence from sticking out awkwardly. (Elembis, 2005-06-17) --&gt; In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal (&quot;win-win or no-deal&quot;).&lt;!-- Does this mean a competitive mindset is the next-best choice? If so, it could be clearer. (Elembis, 2005-06-17) --&gt;

== Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood ==
To influence and help others, you must first actively listen to them and understand their situation and concerns. For example, imagine a doctor who gives a prescription over the telephone without knowing all the necessary information about the patient and their condition. This could be a serious or even fatal error if the patient takes the wrong medicine. In the same way, when giving someone advice we should be quite careful to understand their circumstances well. Even excellent advice can be useless and wasted if it does not apply to the situation of the person receiving it.

It is most effective to listen actively with empathy, consciously trying to understand and to see the world from the other person's perspective. It is also beneficial to listen without judging. Avoid &quot;hearing&quot; through a filter formed by your own worldview, and do not impose your preconceived ideas on what you hear, because doing so will inhibit your efforts to put yourself in the other person's shoes.&lt;!-- I haven't read the book, so I'm merely guessing on the &quot;judging limits empathy&quot; explanation. It make sense, but it'd be best to find and summarize Covey's actual rationale. Remove this comment if my guess is correct. (Elembis, 2005-06-21) --&gt;

Once you have clearly understood the point of view of another person, it is equally important to be understood by them. You need to build the courage to respond to what you've heard and present your own view that takes what the other person has said into account.

== Habit 6: Synergize ==
This habit deals with '''teamwork''' and opening yourself emotionally to work with other people. Optimistic, emotionally-charged individuals who are living out the previous habits can work together in amazing ways and see new paths none of them would have found alone. To synergize means to value differences or disagreements within a group.  Instead of looking at the difference negatively, one can view this as beneficial and seek to understand why the difference exists.  In coming to understand the difference or disagreement, and thinking with a win/win attitude, a &quot;third alternative&quot; may appear.  A &quot;third alternative&quot; is one which neither party could have come up with alone but instead is generated out of understanding differences and seeking to reach a win/win solution.  This synergy is a bit chaotic but is also fun and stimulating. When you use synergy you are also improving your spiritual, emotional and social side of your life.

= The Seventh Habit - Renewal =
== Habit 7: Sharpen the saw ==
Take time to '''rejuvenate yourself''' and help prepare yourself to work better in the future. This often means relaxing, enjoying nature, meditating and praying (Steven Covey was a devout Mormon, as he explains in the book's introduction), reading Scripture or great literature, listening to classical music, and spending time with high-quality relationships.

The purpose of this habit is to regularly exercise the four components which many believe make up the human being: body, mind, heart and spirit.

* '''Body''': Exercise for a sense of well-being.
* '''Mind''': Exercise to sharpen the intellectual abilities.
* '''Spirit''': Exercise with meditations and inner reflections.
* '''Heart''': Exercise care for important relationships.

The fourth category is not an exercise like the others, but rather a commitment to use habits 4, 5 and 6 in everyday life.

Keep positive enthusiasm.

Hi Dreyfus, and welcome. I have responded to your questions about typing Hebrew at [[Wikibooks_talk:The_Open_Mishnah_Project#Hebrew_help.3F]].[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 07:47, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dreyfus. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dreyfus~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Old discussion from the talk page at Wikisource==

===Initial comments===
I think that this material is an interesting development which, if carried to completion, would bring credit to Wikisource.  My concern at this point is with copyright.  That the original Hebrew is in the public domain seems obvious, but it would be helpful if you would comment on the copyright status of the English portion of these articles.  [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 01:46, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Though we may disagree on some other things, on this I think you are 100% correct.  The funny thing is that the problem is the opposite of what you might expect: It is not the English portion that may raise copyright issues, but the Hebrew portion.

:The English portion is not so problematic because the Mishnah is, to put it simply, not considered a very &quot;hard&quot; text.  Lots of laymen study it in the &quot;Daily Mishnah&quot; program.  For a person with just a modicum of experience in Mishnah study, to produce a reasonable translation of just one mishnah takes no more than 5-10 minutes.  So we need not worry so much about copyright here, unless new participants start quoting verbatum from published translations.  That has not happened yet, and we will have to put up a clear notice to make sure that it doesn't in the future.

:The Hebrew portion is a bit more problematic.  Obviously, the old Hebrew texts are not copyrighted.  But the digital editions of them are.  For the Hebrew, I have either typed from the old editions manually and edited according to my own standards, which poses no problems and is clearly not based on anything else.  In only one case (Maimonides' version of the Mishnah) did I use someone else's electronic edition, but only after getting written permission from the source (Mechon Mamre - see their website).  The vowelized Hebrew versions of the Mishnah may raise problems if they are not done manually.

:I hope this project can be an example of a multilingual community effort towards the joint study, translation, and editing of classical texts.  It need not be limited to Mishnah - the same thing could be done for the writings of Aristotle if enough people are interested!  (I am, though I don't know Greek!) [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 05:56, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Making an electronic version of old public domain material usually does not create a new copyright.  There must be something creative to make the material copyrightable.  I presume that the vowelization that were added follows established rules and traditions, so that too is not copyrightable.  I am, of course, not familiar with the Hebrew site that you used.  That a site adds a copyright notice to its material does not mean that everything there suddenly has a new copyright.  Their copyrights would still be limited to new material such as introductions that they added themselves, and the general layout of their page.

::For the English, if the translations are your own that is perfectly fine, but that should be mentioned on the headpage.  If the introduction and explanations, are taken from Maimonides the proper credit should be given, and information about when the underlying English text was '''first''' published should be given.  If all the explanations are from the same source, it should be enough to mention it on the headpage for your project.  Getting this right from the beginning could save us from future problems.  [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 06:50, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC) 

:::Maybe I am worrying too much about copyright?  See below for more on English translations.  There is a slight misunderstanding here about Maimonides: He was a great medieval scholar whose very own handwritten manuscript of the Mishnah with his commentary is still extant (in Oxford and Jerusalem).  He indicated that he edited the text carefully from even older manuscripts that he consulted. So this is an important text consulted in critical editions. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===New Participant(s)===

To the new participant(s) in this project who have created the index to Berakhot and some wonderful work on several mishnayot:

'''Welcome''' and thank you so much for the material you added!

If you don't mind, please introduce yourselves by selecting a username (also so that you can be contacted on the site).

What you wrote so far is fantastic in my opinion, please keep it up.

A question on one detail: What is the source of the vowelized Hebrew mishnah?  (Remember that the commercial databases are coyrighted.)  In the Hebrew I only did two examples of this, which I produced half-manually through an old program called &quot;auto-nikkud&quot;.  This is very time-consuming, which is why I didn't do any more than those two examples.

Keep up the good work!

[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===Vowelized Mishnah===
PS - On the vowelized mishnah: Perhaps the best thing possible regarding this, since it is so tedious to do manually, would be if we actually could use an extant digital text by writing to the owner, explaining who we are, and asking for written permission.  It seems to me it can't hurt to try.  What do people think? [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:26, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:I agree that asking wouldn't hurt, but as I said before, I suspect that that part of the material may not be covered by copyright at all.  In the alternative, would there not be Hebrew OCR software that could handle this? [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 23:41, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

===English Translations===
The following are the published English translations and/or commentaries for the entire Mishnah: Danby, Blackman, Artscroll, and the English Kehati.  (Whoops!  I almost forgot Neusner.)  Danby and Neusner are not meant for popular audiences, so I doubt anyone will use them.  Blackman is an old, but still good popular translation, which I own a personal copy of but rarely use it any more.  So I can check to make sure no texts are &quot;lifted&quot; from there.  Artscroll and Kehati are popular today, but I don't use them, and the other person doesn't follow their style at all in the examples he submitted.  So there is no problem here.  The translations are our own, and as more people work on them will eventually become collective creations of the community. The explanations so far are eclectic compilations from the traditional commentaries (though they could include modern scholarship as well). [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:16, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:From searching around I did determine that Blackman was first published in 1951, and thus still covered by copyright.  I presume that the others are all more recent.  I would say go ahead and add the text of Maimonides' commentary, but I don't know when it was first published in English.  Despite the large amount that he wrote only his ''Guide to the Perplexed'' seems to be easily available on the net.  If the contributors understand that they are publishing under GFDL we should be okay with copyright.  Some may argue that this whole venture belongs in Wikibooks, but I think you're fine where you are.  New commentary was forseen in the early days of Wikibooks, but that has never really gotten off the ground. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 00:59, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Maimonides' Arabic-language commentary on the Mishnah has never been translated into English (and I certainly don't envision doing that here myself, though someone else who is extraordinarily ambitious may certainly try).  I am not talking about the Arabic commentary anyway, but his Hebrew text of the Mishnah itself.  The ''Guide'' is readily available on the net for the simple reason that a century-old English translation (public domain) exists.  WikiBooks is for new open source course-texts (like &quot;Chemistry 001&quot; or at best an annotated Shakespeare), not primary texts. The latter are why we are here at WikiSource. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 06:43, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I have no objection at all to the project being here.  The Chemistry 001 would certainly be out of place, but an annotated Shakespeare with two side-by-side edit boxes for text and annotations would be nice.  Translations too in side-by-side boxes could be interesting. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 07:41, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==

Hi! I noticed your book is in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace. This namespace is reserved for pages dealing with Wikibooks in general or are about Wikibooks (like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] or [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. I therefore suggest you to move your book to the main namespace, that is:
 [[The Open Mishnah Project]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Advertisement]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Permissions]]
 [[The Open Mishnah Project/Mishnah Tractate]]
and so on. Look at the ongoing discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. If you have any questions about this just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:26, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:I thought I was supposed to do that since this is the project page. But it really doesn't matter; in fact, it actually makes things much simpler to drop the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; prefix from the page names.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 20:57, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:: Hi, Sorry, I noticed later that this was a project page to another book. I don't really know where this page would best fit to. I had the impression that &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; was reserved for general pages, concerning more or less all Wikibooks (not just one specific one). Usually, the project page would be on the discussion page of the book (just &quot;Talk:Mishnah&quot;). But it seems, you have some Project page content also on the main page &quot;Mishnah&quot; (&quot;How to contribute&quot;, etc.), so the distinction is not very clear to me. What about putting it all into one book? Then the Project page would be a subpage of Mishnah, like &quot;Mishnah/Project&quot;, &quot;Mishnah/Project/How to contribute&quot;, &quot;Mishnah/Project/Advertisement&quot;, and so on. (at a later stage, you may want to think about gradually moving to subpage delimiters &quot;Mishnah/Berakhot/1:1&quot; instead of blank space &quot;Mishnah Berakhot 1:1&quot; also for the other pages of the Mishnah book, but that is not urgent..) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:02, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

OK, I guess there needs to be some sort of convention as to whether the project page for a book goes under &quot;Wikibooks&quot; or not. When there is a decision, it will be fine to move it (or not). Also: I agree with you that the current &quot;Mishnah&quot; page looks too much like the project page. I will try to fix that when I get a chance. The plan is, when there is more material, the &quot;Mishnah&quot; page will be a clear index to the contents of the entire book (to see what I mean, glance at the Hebrew version of the page, which catalogues over 100 individual pages).

As far as subpages: When I started this whole thing a while ago (on Hebrew Wikisource and later at Hebrew Wikibooks) I played around with a number of organizational possibilities, including subpages. In the end I came to the conclusion that the simple, official title of the single unit of text, without any other syntax, was easiest, as long as it was complemented by a useful system of links at the top of the page (a kind of navigation bar: next unit, previous unit, tractate index, Mishnah index) and categories at the bottom. (All of these pages and indexes, by the way, are also much simpler to link ''between languages'' than subpages.) It might be hard for you to navigate the many Hebrew pages that actually implement this, but if you are able to succeed despite the language barrier you will see that the hierarchy of texts is at once extremely clear and extremely easy to navigate in any direction, but in a way that would be much more difficult to do with subpages.

Because there are much fewer texts, demonstrating this is currently far less awesome in English than in Hebrew. But try clicking the links from [[Mishnah Berakhot 1:2]] to get some sort of any idea of how this might function. [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 13:54, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

PS Andreas - thank you for referring me to [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. Now I can learn from people's past experience and proposals, and see where what I've tried to do fits into past experience. Actually, it seems that what I've done here, and especially in the Hebrew parallel, is [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy_naming_scheme#No_delimiter.2C_no_book_title_on_subpages|&quot;No delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot;]]. However, neither of the disadvantages mentioned there apply at all in the system used here.

Actually, the discussion there of the advantages and disadvantages in the various systems doesn't take into account linking between parallel texts in different languages, which would be far more cumbersome with subpages. May I suggest that the outcome be more than one possible model?[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 14:32, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Dovi, if you think [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] is missing advantages or disadvantages, feel free to add them there (it is still discussion in progress). I highly welcome your input, since this is a point I was not aware of. I looked at your Hebrew pages and felt like Alice through the looking-glass (in a mirror world) :-) I just wonder, why would it be more difficult to link to a page in another language using subpages than using &quot; &quot; space? I don't see any conceptual difference. In the Hebrew version, would you organize the URL address line in the browser from left to right, or right to left? That is, &quot;Book/Chapter/Section&quot; or &quot;Section/Chapter/Book&quot;? Is this the difficulty you are referring to?
::In Hebrew it is written backwards, but in the same order, so it doesn't cause a problem (how strange... :-)
: Other than that, you are free to add your navigation line at the top and bottom as you did, regardless whether you use subpages or namespace or whatever. So there should not be any difference. 
: The idea of unifying the delimiter on the long run is to prepare wikibooks for further enhancement changes in the future (like all-pages-in-one print version, or automatic page-to-page navigation) which would only work, if all books have the same organizational structure, for example, subpages..). But of course, if you don't want to change your book, don't change it, and I also won't do so. As long as there is no clear outcome of the discussion and the software has not changed yet, there is no point yet in doing it. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:20, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Hmmm again... What you are saying is that there is really no difference in terms of ease of use between &quot;Mishnah Berakhot 1:2&quot; versus Mishnah/Berakhot/1:2&quot; or &quot;Mishnah/Berakhot/1/2&quot;. At first glance I do think it is more pleasant to the eye (and a better recognized reference) without all the slashes, but on the other hand is it really so significant at all? I'm going to have to think about this... Also do realize that there is yet a fifth level in the Hebrew that hasn't been applied in English. Without slashes it can be ignored or added at will on a navigation bar.

Anyways, there is a lot to think about here. Thanks for all the thoughtful advice. Let's keep working on this, not only for this book but because a useful (and perhaps flexible) system is important for all of them.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 22:14, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the western world, ancient history is generally thought to encompass the period of time when writing and historical records first appear. This is roughly 7,500 years ago (5,500 BC). For some, the discovery of agriculture, roughly 6,000 BC is the beginning of ancient history. The most common date for an end of ancient history in Europe is 476 AD (the fall of the Western Roman Empire), however the exact date is still disputed among various historians. In Europe ancient history was followed by Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000-5,500 years, with cuneiform possibly being the oldest form of writing. Genetic evidence, however, points to the first appearance of human beings about 150,000 years ago. There is also a growing body of evidence that Homo sapiens first left Africa about 60,000 years ago.


The 1st millennium BC encompasses the Iron Age and sees the rise of successive empires. The Neo-Assyrian Empire, followed by the Achaemenids. In Greece, Classical Antiquity begins with the colonization of Magna Graecia and peaks with the rise of Hellenism. The close of the millennium sees the rise of the Roman Empire. In South Asia, the Vedic civilization blends into the Maurya Empire. The early Celts dominate Central Europe while Northern Europe is in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The Scythians dominate Central Asia. In China, Spring and Autumn Period sees the rise of Confucianism. Towards the close of the millennium, the Han Dynasty extends Chinese power towards Central Asia, where it borders on Indo-Greek and Iranian states. The Maya civilization rises in Central America, while in Africa, Ancient Egypt begins its decline and Ethiopian civilization its rise. The religions of Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism (Vedic religion and Vedanta), Jainism and Buddhism develop. Graeco-Roman Europe, India and China see the rise of literature. World population triples in the course of the millennium, reaching some 170 million people at its close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Western philosophy is a line of related philosophical thinking, beginning in Ancient Greece, and including the predominant philosophical thinking of Europe and its former colonies up to the present day. The concept of philosophy itself originated in the West, derived from the ancient Greek word philosophia (φιλοσοφια); literally, &quot;the love of wisdom&quot; (philein = &quot;to love&quot; + sophia = wisdom, in the sense of theoretical or cosmic insight). However, many non-Western religions have adopted the term philosophy in reference to cosmic intellectual discourse analogous to Western philosophy. 

Western philosophy has had a tremendous influence on, and has been greatly influenced by, Western religion, science, and politics. Indeed, the central concepts of these fields can be thought of as elements or branches of Western philosophy. To the Ancient Greeks, these fields were often one and the same. Thus, in the West, philosophy is an expansive and ambiguous concept. Today, however, what generally distinguishes philosophy from other Western disciplines is the notion that philosophy is a &quot;deeper&quot; and more rational, fundamental, and universal form of thought than other disciplines.

''Reason'' was the key word for Ancient Greek philosophers.  Through the use of rationalism, Greeks laid the foundations for both western science and humanities.  For example, Democritus, an early Greek philosopher, through the use of reason, not technology, designed the concept of ''atomos,'' or the atom.  He believed his small particle to be the building block of nature, and today, through the use of microscopes and other technology, we have verified his claims.  

Agriculture led to several major changes. It allowed far larger population densities, which organized themselves into states. There are several definitions used for the term &quot;state.&quot; Max Weber and Norbert Elias defined the state as an organization of people that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in a particular geographic area.

Borders delineate states - a prominent example is the Great Wall of China, which stretches over 6700 km, and was first erected in the 3rd century BC to protect the north from nomadic invaders. It has been rebuilt and augmented several times since.

The first states appeared in Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley in the late 4th and early 3rd millennia BC. In Mesopotamia, there were several city-states. Ancient Egypt began as a state without cities, but cities soon arose. A state needs an army to impose the legitimate use of force. An army needs a bureaucracy to maintain it. The only exception to this appears to be the Indus Valley civilization due to a lack of evidence of military force.

States appeared in China in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC. Major wars broke out between states in the Middle East. The treaty of Kadesh, one of the first peace treaties, was concluded between the Hittites and ancient Egypt ca.1275 BC. Major empires came into being with conquered areas ruled by central tribes, such as Persia (6th century BC), the Mauryan Empire (4th century BC), China (3rd century BC), and the Roman Empire (1st century BC).

Clashes among major empires took place in the 8th century AD, when the Islamic Caliphate of Arabia (ruling from Spain to Iran) and the Tang dynasty of China (ruling from Xinjiang to Korea) fought for decades for control of Central Asia. The largest contiguous land empire was the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century. By then, most humans in Europe, Asia and North Africa belonged to states. There were states as well in Mexico and western South America. States continued to control more and more of the world's territory and population; the last 'empty' territories were divided among states in the Treaty of Berlin (1878 AD).

===City and Trade===

Vasco da Gama sailed to India to bring back spices in the late 15th century AD and early 16th century AD.

Agriculture also created, and allowed for the storage of, food surpluses that could support people not directly involved in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first cities. These were centers of trade, manufacturing and political power with nearly no agricultural production of their own. The cities were parasites of a sort, absorbing agricultural products from the surrounding countryside, but providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military protection.

The development of cities led to what has been called civilization: first Sumerian civilization in lower Mesopotamia (3500 BC), followed by Egyptian civilization along the Nile (3300 BC) and Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley (3300 BC). There is evidence of elaborate cities with high levels of social and economic complexity. However, these civilizations were so different from each other that they almost certainly originated independently. It was at this time that writing and extensive trade were introduced.

In China, proto-urban societies may have developed from 2500 BC, but the first dynasty to be identified by archeology is that of the Shang Dynasty. The 2nd millennium BC saw the emergence of civilization in Crete, mainland Greece and central Turkey. In the Americas, civilizations such as the Maya, the Moche and Nazca emerged in Mesoamerica and Peru at the end of the 1st millennium BC. Coinage was introduced in Lydia.

Long-range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BC, when Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. Trade routes also appeared in the eastern Mediterranean in the 4th millennium BC. The Silk Road between China and Syria began in the 2nd millennium BC. Cities in Central Asia and Persia were major crossroads of these trade routes. Phoenician and Greek civilizations founded empires in the Mediterranean basin in the 1st century BC, based on trade. The large scale transportation of commodities before the modern age was unique to the ancient Greek civilization. Arabs dominated the trade routes in the Indian Ocean, East Asia, and the Sahara in the late 1st millennium AD and early second millennium AD. Arabs and Jews also dominated trade in the Mediterranean in the late 1st millennium. Italians took over this role in the early 2nd millennium AD. Flemish and German cities were at the center of trade routes in Northern Europe in the early 2nd millennium AD. In all areas, major cities developed at crossroads along the trade routes.

===Religion and Philosophy===

Main articles: History of philosophy and Development of religion
New philosophies and religions arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with Hinduism and Buddhism in India, Zoroastrianism in Persia being some of the earliest major faiths. The Abrahamic religions also trace their origin to this time[citation needed]. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were Taoism, Legalism, and Confucianism. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of Plato and Aristotle, was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of Alexander of Macedon in the 4th century BC.

===Major Civilizations and Regions===

By the last centuries BC, the Mediterranean, the Ganges and the Yellow River became the seats of empires which future rulers would strive to imitate. In India, the Mauryan Empire ruled over much of the Indian subcontinent, while the Pandyas ruled the south of India. In China, the Qin and Han dynasties extended the rule of imperial government through political unity, improved communications and also notably the establishment of state monopolies by Emperor Wu.
In the west, the Ancient Greeks established a civilization that is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of modern western civilization. Some centuries later the Romans began expanding their territory through conquest and colonization from the 3rd century BC. By the reign of Emperor Augustus in the late 1st century, Rome controlled all the lands surrounding the Mediterranean.

The great empires rested on the ability to exploit the process of military annexation and the formation of defended human settlements to become agricultural centers. The relative peace they brought encouraged international trade, most notably were the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean sea that were developed by the time of Hellenistic age, with were unparalleled in volume of trade until modern times and the growth of the Silk Road. They also faced common problems, such as those associated with maintaining huge armies and the support of a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the peasantry, whilst land-owning magnates were increasingly able to evade centralized control and its costs. The pressure of barbarians on the frontiers hastened the process of internal dissolution. The Han empire fell into civil war in 220 AD, whilst its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided around the same time.

Throughout the temperate zones of Eurasia, America, and North Africa, large empires continued to rise and fall.

The gradual breakup of the Roman Empire, which spanned several centuries following the 2nd century AD, coincided with the spread of Christianity westward from the Middle East. The western part of the Roman Empire fell under the domination of various Germanic tribes in the 5th century, and these polities gradually developed into a number of warring states, all associated, in one way or another, with the Roman Catholic Church. The remaining part of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean was henceforth known as the Byzantine Empire. Centuries later, a limited unity was restored to western Europe through the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, comprising a number of states in what is now Germany and Italy.
In China, dynasties would similarly rise and fall. Nomads from the north began to invade in the 4th century AD, eventually conquering nearly all of northern China and setting up many small kingdoms. The Sui Dynasty reunified China in 581, and under the Tang Dynasty (618-907) China entered into a second golden age. However, the Tang Dynasty also splintered and, after about half a century of turmoil, the Northern Song Dynasty reunified China in 982. Yet, pressure from nomadic empires to the north became increasingly urgent. All of North China was lost to the Jurchen in 1141 and the Mongol Empire conquered all of China in 1279, as well as almost all of Eurasia's landmass, missing only western and central Europe and Japan.
Northern India was ruled by the Guptas in these times. In southern India, three prominent Dravidan kingdoms emerged: Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. The ensuing stability contributed to herald the golden age of Hindu culture in the 4th and 5th centuries AD.

Vast societies also began to be built up in Central America at this time, with the Maya and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica being the most notable. As the mother culture of the Olmecs gradually declined, the great Mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout Yucatán and surrounding areas. The later empire of the Aztec was built on neighboring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples, such as the Toltec.

South America saw the rise of the Inca in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Inca Empire of Tawantinsuyu spanned the entire range of the Andes and held its capital at Cusco. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent road system and unrivaled masonry.

Islam, which began in Arabia in the 7th century, was also one of the most remarkable forces in World history, growing from only a few followers to become the basis of a series of large empires in India, the Middle East, and North Africa.

In North East Africa, Nubia and Ethiopia, which both had long been linked to the Mediterranean world, remained Christian enclaves as the rest of Africa north of the equator converted to Islam. With Islam, came new technologies that, for the first time, allowed substantial trade to cross the Sahara. Taxes on this trade led to prosperity in North Africa and the rise of a series of kingdoms in the Sahel.

This period was marked by slow but steady technological improvements, with developments of influential importance such as the stirrup and the mouldboard plough arriving every few centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.

The coastal periphery was the first to be home to civilization, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.

The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The earliest known such central expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans who spread their languages into the Middle East, India, and in the Tocharians to the borders of China. The northern part of the continent, covering much of Siberia was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the tundra. These areas were very sparsely populated.

The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and desserts. The Caucuses, Himalayas, Karakum Desert, Gobi Desert formed barriers that the steppe horse men could only cross with difficulty. While technologically and culturally the urban city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend themselves against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force. Thus the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scalars and vectors==
===Scalars===
Scalars are simple values. They describe something like height, length, mass, number of chairs with a real number. e.g. 10 chairs, 5Kg, 2m: 10, 5 and 2 are scalars.

===Vectors===
Vectors have a magnitude and a direction. e.g. the velocity of a ball has both a speed and a direction in which it is moving.

===Basis Vectors===
All cartesian coordinate systems have a number of basis vectors equal to their dimension; for most applications in Theoretical Mechanics the vector space is E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, whose basis vectors are '''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

You may also see 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{\imath}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''', 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''', 
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; for '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

Every vector is then a linear combination of these basis vectors.  Often, vectors are written as tuples, so that the vector a'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + c'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' is equivalent to the tuple (a, b, c).

The unity vector of any vector can be found by dividing all of its components by the length:
V = 3e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + 4e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
length: |V| = sqrt (3² + 4²) = sqrt (9 + 16) = sqrt 25 = 5 &lt;BR&gt;
Unity vector e&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = (3/5)e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + (4/5)e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

3/5 equals to the cosinus of the angle of this vector with the X-axis, 4/5 is the cosinus of the angle of this vector with the Y-axis:&lt;BR&gt;
argcos(3/5) = about 53°&lt;BR&gt;
argcos(4/5) = about 37°&lt;BR&gt;
Notice that both angles add up to 90°. This means this vector lays in the XY-plane. If it adds up to a larger number, it lays inside a 3D volume, not a plane.

====Equality====
Two vectors are equal if and only if both their magnitude and their direction are the same.&lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 5'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;ne; 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 3'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
10'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 10'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;
4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 8'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' - 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;BR&gt;

====Vector multiplied with scalar====
Multiply the magnitude of the vector with the scalar.&lt;BR&gt;
'''4'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + '''3'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; '''* 2''' = '''8'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + '''6'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
3e&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; * 5 = 15e&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

====Angle between 2 vectors====
This is the smallest angle between both vectors.

====Adding Two Vectors====

Two vectors are added component by component, like this:

(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') + (b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') = 
(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 
(a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' +
(a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''

So, for example:

(2'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 3'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') + ('''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 1'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''') = 
(3'''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 2'''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' + 4'''e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''')

====Subtracting Two Vectors====

Subtracting a vector '''A''' from a vector '''B''' is no different than adding '''A''' and -1 * '''B''' together.

====Dot product====
a*b*cos &amp;theta;&lt;BR&gt;
With: a, b magnitude of the vectors; &amp;theta; angle between the vectors.

A.B = a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;

with A,B 2 vectors; a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; X-component of vector A, ...

Properties of the dot product:
Is a scalar.
When equal to zero: The angle between the vectors is 90°. or one of the vectors is zero.
Maximum: angle between the vectors is 0°

====Cross product====
U = A x B &lt;BR&gt;
U = a * b * sin &amp;theta; &lt;BR&gt;
U = (A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
+ (A&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
+ (A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; * b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) e&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

Properties of the cross product:
Is a vector orthogonal to both A and B

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plant cells are immobile, encased in a rigid cell wall. Unlike animal cells, migration and programmed cell death play little role in the patterning of plant cell fates, nor can they move when their environment changes. If the supply of food is low or if there is a predator, animals can move, fight or fly. But plants cannot. They have to adapt constantly to their environment and their development is highly plastic. Animal development is mainly embryonic: the body shape is defined during embryogenesis and the adult derive from the enlargement of the embryo. In contrast, in plants, most of the development occurs post embryonically and never ceases. In fact, because plants can't escape from their physical locations, they adapt and &quot;escape&quot; through development. When there is a lack of nutrients or energy, the plant develops its root system to explore the ground or its aerial system to get some light. Under attack from a pathogen or herbivore, the plant is able to synthesise  signalling molecules to change its development and defend itself. 

Despite their sessile lifestyle, plant development is highly plastic, due to the important role of information exchange between neighbouring plant cells. It appears that cell are more dependent on their positional information rather than lineage origine as in animals. Almost every plant cell containing nucleus has been shown to be able to re-enter the cell cycle and divide. This occurs for example after wounding, neighbouring cells are able to divide and differentiate to replace dead cells.

In normal plant development, post embryonic growth comes from meristems. Meristem is a type of embryonic tissue in plants consisting of unspecialised, youthful cells called meristematic cells and found in areas of the plant where growth is or will take place - the roots and shoots. Meristematic cells are small isodiametric cells, the nuclei occupy most of the cell. The cytoplasm contains undifferentiated plastids and posses a small vacuole.

Pool of cells are kept meristematic and divide, cells exiting the meristematic zone, start elongating and then differentiating.

We’ll look at some of these unusual features of plant development using examples from the model plant, [[/Arabidopsis thaliana/]].

===''[[/Arabidopsis thaliana/]]'', a model plant for plant sciences===

''Arabidopsis thaliana'' grows quickly, produces prolific seed, and is [[/Plant Transformation|easy to transform]]. Its genome is completely sequenced and a large variety of experimental tools and genetic resources are available. This made the plant  become one of the favourite tool of plant scientists.

===The Arabidopsis Book===

Description: Edited by Chris Somerville and Elliot Meyerowitz. Co-edited by Jeff Dangl and Mark Stitt. An Open Access electronic book, The Arabidopsis Book (TAB), is an attempt at a new mode of communication between researchers and a new model for scientific publishing. TAB in its initial stage is a compilation of over 100 invited chapters, each reviewing in detail an important and interesting aspect of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with reference to what is known in other plants and in other kingdoms. Each set of authors has agreed that their chapter can be kept up-to-date either by the original authors or by others. TAB will therefore be a dynamic information resource that will evolve with the state of knowledge. We envision evolution of the format as well as the contents - initially by taking advantage of the Web-based possibilities of hyperlinks, which will be added to cross-reference gene names and references to other chapters, and which will eventually lead from each gene and sequence reference to sequence databases, and from each paper cited to its abstract. The Arabidopsis Book is therefore envisioned as a complementary resource to the many databases that contain specific information about Arabidopsis, including The Arabidopsis Information Resource. It is our hope that this book will be broadly useful and, more generally, that it will facilitate the development of new web-based tools for dissemination of knowledge. TAB will be available only via the Internet and will be available free of charge. The American Society of Plant Biologists will provide funds for the mounting and maintenance of the book on the Internet as a public service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Portfolio Management is one of the most important aspects of investing, particularly for the investor with a maturing portfolio.  Think of the portfolio needing attention on three levels.  1) Pay attention to individual stocks held in the portfolio.  2) Pay attention to the asset allocation in order to maintain diversity and balance within the portfolio.  3) Pay attention to what is happening to the broad market and to the sectors within the broad market.

== Monitor Individual Stocks ==

Let's take the first assignment, that of paying attention to the individual stocks held in a portfolio.  One very useful tool that aids in this monitoring process is Toolkit 5.  Built into this software is a portfolio management section.  To put this portfolio management section of Toolkit to use one must first complete a Stock Selection Guide (SSG) analysis on each stock held in the portfolio.  Once one is familiar with the product it does not take long to complete this assignment.

Toolkit 5 has the option to build a library of stocks.  Set up a library to include all stocks held in the portfolio with the correct number of shares.  Once this is accomplished Toolkit 5 provides an Overview of the portfolio.  This shows the user the portfolio Total Return, U/D ratio, Relative Value etc.  Once one sees the Overview it is time to check the Alerts. If the Alert screen comes up blank, you are doing something good in the selection of stocks.  Pay particular attention to those stocks yielding a Defensive alert.  Go in and look at the PERT sheet to see what is going on with the stock.  Find out if Sales and or Earnings are in decline.  Determine what is causing the Defensive alert signal as it may be time to purge the stock from the portfolio.

== Monitor Asset Allocation==

== Active Asset Allocation ==
'''1.0  Portfolio Tilt'''

Harold R. Evensky in his book, &quot;'''''Wealth Management: The Financial Advisor's Guide to Investing and Managing Client Assets'''''&quot; does a fine job in defining Portfolio Tilt.  He writes, &quot;This is a strategy designed to add value by overweighting an investment class or style in order to take advantage of a perceived market anomaly.  An example would be the overweighting of small-cap stocks in January to take advantage of the January effect.  A more general example would be the permanent overweighting of the portfolio with low price/book stock.&quot;  This latter strategy is one where the investor would skew an asset allocation to the value side of the investment equation.  This is a strategy preferred by many asset allocators as historically, value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks.

Evensky continues to write, &quot;One quasi strategy that straddles market timing and portfolio tilt is sector rotation, i.e., the technique of tilting the portfolio in favor of market sectors that are expected to benefit most from the next economic wave.&quot;  More on this later when we look at Exponental Moving Averages (EMA) and Point &amp; Figure (PnF) charts.

'''2.0  Dynamic Asset Allocation'''

Dynamic Asset Allocation (DAA) is a mechanical method of rebalancing a portfolio due to market movements.  When an asset class moves out of its target ranges, the investor responds by bring &quot;out-of-line&quot; asset classes back into balance.  The sample asset allocation spreadsheet is a great aid in helping the investor accomplish these portfolio rebalancing activities.  There are some studies done by William Bernstein that show one should not rebalance a portfolio more than once every year.  While the asset allocation spreadsheet permits one to track what is going on daily, I highly recommend no rebalancing occur more than once a quarter. 

'''3.0  Tactical Asset Allocation'''

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) is similar to DAA in that it requires periodic rebalancing of the portfolio.  Instead of a mechanical rebalancing activity due to the asset classes moving out of their target ranges, TAA requires the investor to know something about what is happening to sectors and asset classes of the market.  When is it time to shift assets to the value or growth sides of the portfolio equation?  When is it time to be in small-cap vs. large-cap stocks?  Is there a time to invest more heavily in REITs or international investments?  TAA relies on the assumption that different asset classes will revert to the mean.  If an asset class is a hot performer one year it is highly unlikely it will return the same performance a second or third year.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Kheer''' or '''payasam''' is a thick rice pudding.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:L|L]] (4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*250 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) long grain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*125 mL (½ cup) white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*65 mL (¼ cup) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultanas]] (raisins)
*6 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
*65 mL (¼ cup) slivered blanched [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
*15 mL (1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]]) [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

==Procedure==
# Bring the milk to a boil.
# Add rice and cook slowly until thick (about 20 minutes).
# Stir in the sugar, sultanas (raisins), and the ground seeds from the cardamom pods (cook a further 5 minutes).
# Stir in the almonds and rosewater, and cover until ready to serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Stir the milk while bringing it to the boil.
*You may also want to leave the kheer boiling for much longer (several hours), until it has been significantly reduced; this provides a stronger flavour and a light-pink colour.
*You can use rice flour or vermicelli instead of plain rice.
*For kheer that is not too thick when cold, use 170 mL (⅔ cup) of rice instead.
*If to be eaten cold, it's nicer to use double the quantities of sugar, sultanas, and almonds.

==Warnings==
*The main difficulty in this dish is preventing the kheer from sticking to the bottom of the pan, that requires care.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cookbook vs. Wikipedia==
For anything kitchen-related, it is best to avoid linking to Wikipedia. In general, Wikipedia is not focused on cooking and does not provide links back into the cookbook. (there are rare exceptions) We need a [[Cookbook:Blender]] article. If you change blender links to go toward Wikipedia, then it is less likely that someone will write the [[Cookbook:Blender]] article. Since links to Wikipedia do not go to missing pages in en.wikibooks.org, the [[Special:Wantedpages]] page won't find them.

==Links Fixed==
I've changed all of my links to Wikipedia to link to Cookbook instead.
[[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 22:32, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== see if you can tell the difference ==

* [[w:Double_boiler]]
* [[w:Bain-marie]]

To me, it's looking like the main distinction is that a bain-marie goes in the '''oven'''. This suggests that the cookbook's &quot;bain-marie&quot; picture is actually a double-boiler, and that we don't have a bain-marie picture. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:13, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, that's what I thought. The picture of the bain-marie really does look like a double boiler. As the two are so similar, they could easily coexist on the same page. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 13:02, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== really obscure names ==

According to Google, &quot;cookie sheet&quot; is 38.7 times as popular as &quot;baking tray&quot;. Now, come on. It is quite unreasonable to use a name that most people around the world are unfamiliar with. I just asked my wife what a baking tray was, and it took her half a minute to guess.

I'm sometimes OK with the non-USA terms if the US audience would surely know the term, the US term is ambiguous, and the US term is obscure. I'm OK with &quot;Waffle Maker&quot; (ugh), if you insist.

I know it must suck to kind-of sort-of share a language, but be trained in a minority dialect. Try not to blame me for all the pain and suffering this must cause.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:22, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Leaving duplicate names in a list is very annoying to someone who wants to read about each item in turn. They'll go to pages more than once. Putting the alternate name in parentheses is reasonable. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

As far as naming standards go, I have been giving the matter some thought. I find that consistent use of titlecase (&quot;Fish and Chips&quot;) is extremely helpful when linking ingredients and recipes. I know the name I need for creating the link. So that's an argument for consistency. Then, what of the ''best'' choice? Well, link target names serve only one use outside of editing. They form the page '''title'''. This is a strong indication that titlecase is correct. I can also see an argument for pure lowercase, based on readability and allowing the occasional uppercase letter to indicate a proper noun. Switching the whole cookbook to pure lowercase would be a tremendous task, so I think this is not a good option unless there is some huge benefit which I am currently unaware of. Thus I have come to prefer titlecase. It's all over already; the equipment section is one of two main violators, the other being stuff like &quot;East Asian cuisines&quot; (where &quot;cuisine&quot; or cuisines&quot; is always lowercase in spite of everything else being uppercase). Switching to titlecase happens to be the least effort if consistency is desired, which is I'm fairly sure true. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

'''Baking sheet''' greatly bothers the ears, but at least it is understandable. '''Oven tray''' means nothing to me.

The problems for you are different from the problems for a US citizen. Because of the way the USA exports culture through movies and TV, you are likely to find US terminology understandable. It may annoy you greatly, but you can at least understand it. New Zealand might have wonderful culture, but it isn't being exported to the USA. A wee bit of British makes it over to the US, but not much. This means that cookbook readers in the USA will be left completely clueless by New Zealand terms.

Google constitutes a majority unless you can demonstrate that the search terms are picking up unrelated junk. In the case of &quot;oven tray&quot;, I'm pretty sure ''you'' are getting this advantage. Over here, &quot;oven tray&quot; might refer to the storage drawer commonly found under an oven. It might refer to something used with industrial ovens, including ones used for drying timber (dead trees) or curing paint.

I suppose that I do dislike linking to your page titles, but that isn't one of the significant issues. I tend to create a new duplicate page when the expected page is missing. This has been done many times. I dislike seeing your page titles at the top of the page, which is a very different problem that is unfixable by adding redirects. Also, adding all these redirects gets tiresome.

There are some [[Cookbook:Grunt_Work|definite written guidelines]] actually.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:23, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Do notice the date on those definite written guidelines; they are (just barely) old enough to prove that I didn't create them just to argue with you. :-) Also, they have been edited by someone who is British.

2/3 of the world's English speakers use American English. India may use English for government and upper-class business, but the rest of the country speaks hundreds of other languages.

&quot;cookie tray&quot; is not used much. I doubt such an item would be for cooking at all; it sounds like something for serving cookies at a party. If you really don't like &quot;cookie sheet&quot;, then please use &quot;baking sheet&quot;. Both &quot;oven&quot; and &quot;tray&quot; are uncommon in the names of such objects. It's a sheet, either &quot;cookie sheet&quot; or &quot;baking sheet&quot;.

It might help you to know that I got a rather bad impression of the community too when I showed up several months ago. Admins seemed to regularly delete pages without discussion. When a page did go to a vote for deletion, an admin would often be the prosecutor (placed the item up for deletion), judge (counting the votes, throwing away many as being suspect), and executioner (performing the deletion, without waiting for objections). An admin accused me of being a &quot;sock puppet&quot; (ask if you aren't familiar with the term) and also accused me of using sock puppets.

Perhaps a &quot;truly international&quot; wiki is more trouble than it is worth. Very very few American cooks can deal with a British recipe. The big problem is that kitchen scales and balances do not exist in US households. Then there are the unavailable ingredients, etc. This wiki is a cold and hostile place for Americans, but you probably can't see that.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:40, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Sugar formatting ==

What was the problem with '''&amp;lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&amp;gt;''' ? With browsers that don't support it (should be rare), it shouldn't do anything. This bit of code is used all over the place to ensure that pictures don't wind up in the wrong section. I know of no other way to properly (independant of font size and window size) prevent pictures from ending up adjacent to the wrong text.

Also note that the order is very wrong now. The brown sugar picture was next to the brown sugar. Now, brown sugar is white and white sugar is brown. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:57, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

So, it worked fine. I use Firefox too, and I see the vertical gaps too. The '''&amp;lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&amp;gt;''' code ensured that everything above and everything below will be separate, thus keeping an image from one section from slopping over into another section. It's like having an invisible line across the page. This is required to align the brown sugar image with the brown sugars, and the white sugar image with the white sugars. I did put those two images there specifically to be adjacent to the text, not to give a general impression. Shrinking the images should be enough to eliminate the gaps, but I'll put the white sugar up top. Having white after brown in the text did kind of bother me anyway, but the image perspective didn't bother me at all. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:02, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== firm vs. hard ==

Quinces and unripe tomatoes are more than just &quot;firm&quot;. I think you could drive nails with a quince! Typical low-cost commercial tomatoes are firm when they get to the store, but they are quite hard when picked. They're like apples. Some kinds of tofu are considered to be firm. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 08:10, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that firm is not a great word to describe green tomatoes, but neither is hard. I would call the shell of a nut hard, but not a green tomato. Quinces are more like a firm pear when totally ripe (though a slightly sour one). I took a bite out of the one pictured, and I could probable get used to it (it wasn't all that sour). Anyway, I don't totally disagree with the use of hard, but firm works too. What we really need is another word that means something in between, I simply used firm as it was the first thing that popped into my head when I was editing the page. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::So now the quince has a toothy grin and you need dentures? Get about 5 next time, and try the [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|quince crisp]] recipe. It ought to be pretty good; most apple varieties turn to mush but the quinces should hold up even better than Granny Smith apples. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:47, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:::My grandparents gave me four off their tree, that's why they were ripe. They are slowly being reintroduced to supermarkets, but those ones are pretty green and hard (as most supermarket fruit is). Yeah, quinces don't disintegrate like apples when cooked. I stewed mine.

== titlecase ==

When I showed up, it already looked like titlecase was the standard. There were of course deviations, but many recipes were already in titlecase. I figured that the others were mistakes carried over from Wikipedia. Apparently lots of people prefer titlecase, Wikipedia be damned.

If we actually ''think'' about this though, we should be using default (natural: &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;April&quot;) case in Wikipedia. By forcing the first letter to uppercase, we can't tell the Polish (people) from polish (stuff for shining shoes). It would be good for users to see that August is capatalized for a reason, and pH is not capitalized.

Wikipedia is very different from Wikibooks. Link renaming is nearly universal on Wikibooks. Wikipedia relys on a software hack to make the wiki appear to be case-insensitive to the casual observer, but this hack doesn't work for Wikibooks. (the software uppercases the first letter automatically)

So a technical hack (kludge, really) on Wikipedia leads to Wikipedia policy, but that hack doesn't apply on Wikibooks.

I just noticed your revert war with 217.33.207.195 on the main page. Y'know, if you could support my admin request in spite of our differences you wouldn't have to repeatedly revert stuff so often. It's not as if I'd be abusing admin powers to get my way in our numerous disputes; I think I've shown elsewhere that I can be trusted with such things. BTW, 217.33.207.195 is probably also &quot;Mann Ltd&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:19, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah, it was pretty pointless. After a while, I decided the best thing to do was to walk away. I doubt that 217.33.207.195 is going to reform any time soon. I thought that you were asleep at the time. Some vandals seem to wait until a time of day when the bulk of the admins are inactive.

Hey Donovan: Could I persuade you to reconsider your vote for Albert? I think both of you would be great admins, so it's kind of troubling to see the two of you blocking each other like this. (If not an outright support, how about an abstain?) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:I understand where you are coming from. But, strategically, it would have been better for Albert to appeal to my better nature, and to support my adminship, I would most likely have supported him then. As it is, his negative vote appears to have held thing up needlessly. Even without his support, I was seriously considering supporting his next bid for adminship (the current one was never going to succeed). But, since then, he has been virtually inactive. Before support his next bid for adminship, I would really like to see at least a month of moderately active and helpful editing over the whole of Wikibooks (mainly in fighting vandalism). BTW, I was under the understanding that to gain adminship, I only needed four votes of support, with no more than one in opposition, where abstains counted as neutral votes. I'm currently at seven to one, eight if you count my nominator.

== my Adminship ==

Thankyou for votting support for me, i'd like to note that the reason for my minimal edits is because of many of my edits are to revert spam, because wikipedia is rather large ans extensive and i really can't find anything i can contribute to, other than fighting vandalism, and then on wikinews, i am not the best writer although i want to contribute more article, mainly ones with original reporting if possible, and wikibooks, well even though my spelling isn't the best i love the idea behind Wikibooks and think i could contribute more to actual books and wikiversiry but also in fighting vandalism wich admins powers really help make it less stressful i've noticed, since its much easier with the rollback button and i'd have the ability to block vandals myself without having to find an admin, especially on wikinews this was a problem, cause some vandals would come out when no admins were online, i was though, and that really was a pain since i couldn't block them and no admins were around to do it.  Again thankyou for your support.--[[User:Ryan524|Ryan524]] 15:58, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Of Mice and Men rv ==
Geocachernemesis, just to let you know, not all of 195.144.131.4's edit on [[Of Mice and Men]] were misedits; some actually did make sense (if I remembered the book correctly). The contributor just got bored halfway I think. I was scratching my head on what to do with that mass/ mess.

No biggie, I'll go back to fix it later. Thanks for the rv. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 09:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't feel so bad about it, because many of 195.144.131.4's previous edits have been pretty inane (basically vandalism). I wasn't about to spend an hour sifting through extracting out the good information. It's been a while since I read the book, so it would be difficult to decide what to keep and what to leave out. If 195.144.131.4 wants to do it, then that's fine with me. I left an introductory note on their talk page pointing them to the sandbox, so we'll see what effect that has.

:Having me revert the whole lot does make it easier to pick out what was actually added, because you can just look at my diff. But, at the time 195.144.131.4 was stuffing around adding and removing vandalism with each edit, making it difficult to see what was really going on. Maybe I'll use that strategy again in future.

:: Aye, it worked out well. Alternatively, I can just look at the last good edit (in this case I cleaned up this article the last time, so I simply looked for my own edit there). Either way, just diff'ing the last good edit and 195.144.131.4's last edit save me from wandering through the whole load -- I can ignore the strange stuff (s)he had in between.

== GTA:SA Removal of redundant pages ==

We've been restructuring the San Andreas guide recently. We're keeping a track of all the pages in a [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas/Meta/Information|metadata]] page.

Can you delete all the pages under the section entitled [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas/Meta/Information#Orphaned Redirects|Orphaned Redirects]]? Obviously I mean the redirects themselves, not the pages they redirect to. :-)

If you could also update that section to indicate when this has been done, that would be nice too.

Thanks...

:I'm not an admin yet, and I'm pretty busy at the moment. But, you can easily mark those pages for deletion yourself. I've done the first one to show you how. First add the delete tag to the page with an explanation, see [[Template:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Header]]. Next, you must add a note to the end of the Speedy deletion candidates section of the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page, otherwise it won't be deleted. That's it, an administrator should come and deleted them within a week (not very speedy, I know).

== You're welcome! ==

I just happened to be the person who noticed the live vandalism had moved over to wikibooks, so I got delegated to clean it up. Since the twits doing it took the opportunity to say hello to me in IRC, I figured I'd better watch for a while and while I was RC patroling I took the time to clean out the speedy deletions. (I was going to also do the VfD, but I got a little lost in the policy and couldn't find if it was simple majority or some form of super-majority.)

By the way, there is an excellent tool which monitors changes on the Wikibooks in real-time, irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks This is an IRC chat room with a bot who is connected to the database and announces all the database changes. There are a couple of software written to use this stream of changes to help people monitoring the recent changes to wikimedia sites as well.

You may want to take a look at the many new pages being created by 80.56.38.110, who seems to be creating a medical dictionary or something?

&lt;grin&gt; Must go, will build a user page and then request to be de-admined. - [[User:Amgine|Amgine]] 16:13, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Medicine pages==
Hi, I'm the one who edited the Medicine section. I'm going to write more there. I added the links to create at least something. Before seriously writing, I'm placing some external links to begin with.
I'm in no way related to the Merck company. The Merck Manual is the world's most used medical reference book and is highly respect, written by several hundred mostly American top physicians. While the pages are lacking any actual content, this is a temporary beginning from which, hopefully, books will come forth. Also check the [[Medicine]] page, which I redirected to Medicine_Bookshelf, and see the discussion page there. If you're interested in participating, we could talk further there. In the meantime, please note that I just started working on this section of Wikibooks yesterday morning, and I'm not quite finished yet. In fact, the whole section on Medicine currently consists of only one single book ([[Radiation Oncology]]), and the book on [[Emergency Medicine]] is under construction. I edited the front page of Medicine yesterday, and made a beginning on the Neurology, Cardiology and Pediatrics sections. Anyway, let's keep the topic-related discussions to the Medicine discussion page, if you're interested?

:Oh good, carry on then.;) I just had to check with you to ensure that you were aware of how it looked. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. It should be an interesting book when it fills out a bit more.

: No worries. It's not just vandalism, but general stupidity. Obviously the newbies can't help it, and when they create new subpages for existing books, they're not always following naming conventions, and creating their new pages in the global namespace without indicating that they're part of an existing title. Other users are then just adding them to VfD, when it would be far better to convert them to the correct naming convention, and make sure the user in question is aware. To be fair, the site policies are much too difficult to locate for new users (it took me a few weeks to find them all), and incomplete in places, so I'm gonna have a go at improving that. Anyways. Glad you're back. The Wikibooks community needs more users who are prepared to '''be bold'''. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 15:59, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] ==

Can you please refrain from adding speedy deletions to this page. I've changed the rules to try to keep the page short and managable. Providing you've added the 'delete' template, the admins can see the speedies in the page [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. An admin will move it to the VfD page if they believe it requires a vote. Please re-read the VfD page up to the TOC, and the page [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion]] for details. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:28, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

:It is quite a major change to the way things had been done, and not particularly well advertised. But, if that's how it's done now, then so be it. My only concern is that it makes it far easier for pages to be listed for speedy deletion, and that could be abused easily. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 23:29, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

I did put in quite a bit of thought before making this change. The deletion policy states that speedies are optional to add in. I guess I should change that to say they should never be added. If you're not certain, use a VfD instead. Just seems like reducing the amount of house-keeping required to keep this site running means more problems can be addressed more quickly. All you have to do now is add the template include, and move on to the next one. And to be fair, speedies could always be easily abused. There's no guarantee that users will add speedies to the VfD page anyway. Besides, so many of the pages I add as speedies are just newbie experiments. There's really no need for a vote on them. You're right in that it's not well advertised. I should've made it more obvious. I'll see what I can do. I just figured taking a more pro-active approach would be good, since Wikipedians seem to want to discuss everything for ages. If I find my stuff getting reverted, then I'll know there's a problem. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 00:48, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

:The old procedure was pretty ambiguous, but the way I read it was that it was expected that speedies would be listed on the VfD page too, although some contributors didn't do it. I don't have a problem with your change, but you have to be cautious with changes to policy (yes, I know it's frustrating ;). That is, you should be bolder in your edits of individual books than with Wikibooks policy pages. My own disagreement over the correct naming of the ingredients pages in the Cookbook with [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] caused unneeded friction, and rather than getting into a move war, I just walked away (but, you may not be so fortunate).

Well. It was slightly ambiguous. This is one of the problems I'm trying to address, but there's a lot of content here, and it's gonna take time to sort out. It's obvious that Wikibooks != Wikipedia, and the policies copied from Wikipedia to Wikibooks aren't gonna work here (particularly with naming conventions). If you wanna see what's going on in my head, take a look at [[User:Aya/Wikibooks]]. As for the page [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], the section entitled [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Procedure for deletion|Procedure for deletion]] states:

:::Pages (and images) to be deleted should be listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] for a week before deletion takes place. That way, other [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] can have a chance to argue for and against the removal of the page. There are a few, limited, exceptions to this rule:

:::1. No meaningful content or history (eg &quot;sdhgdf&quot;).
:::2. Test pages (eg &quot;Can I really create a page here?&quot;).
:::3. Pure vandalism (see [[Wikibooks:dealing with vandalism|dealing with vandalism]]).
:::4. Very short pages with no definition or context (eg &quot;This guy is great!&quot;) or that only have an external link.
:::5. Reposting previously deleted content, where the page was not listed on [[Wikibooks:votes for undeletion|votes for undeletion]].
:::6. A user's own user page or his/her own user subpages.

I intepret this to mean that any pages meeting the numbered criteria should NOT be added to the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], but should instead be either deleted immediately (if you have the privs), or added as a speedy candidate if you don't. So this is the way I have re-worded the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], merely to keep it consistent with policy. I may re-word the policy page to make it clearer, but I felt I'd just try changing the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] to match policy before changing it, just to see what reaction I got from other users. To be honest, I don't think many other users care that much at all, and there's only a very small hardcore of 'power users' such as yourself and Lynx7225 who even read these pages at all.

By the way: check whatever template it is you use to sign your name. I had to change &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to prevent subscriping of all following text. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 15:52, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks, I've fixed the typo in my signature, I think. Yes, Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, but it's still a Wikimedia project. It is desirable for all Wikimedia projects have the same policies wherever possible, because that makes it easier for users to move between projects. If we make our policy different, just because we can, then we will forever be confusing these new users, and we will have to clean up their mess. [[m:Main Page|Metawiki]] is there for deciding policy that affect all Wikimedia projects, and it's only a matter of time before we will be asked to conform. Some policy that will always differ from Wikipedia and other projects is that to do with what Wikibooks is not, we must clearly define what belongs here (and enforce it). If we don't, then it makes the job of administration far more difficult.

I'm hoping that someone watches that. If not then I may just give up completely. It just seems a shame that there are many trustworthy and attentive users such as yourself who have the best intentions to help out in an administrative capacity, but the system only serves to ensure that it can never happen.

:::I just gotta add something here.  According to Jimbo, it wasn't supposed to be all that hard to become an admin.  The main issues were that a user had to show that he/she had a firm grasp of Wikimedia Foundation policies, and in particular becoming an admin of a particular project had to show that you tended to help out more than you hurt (hopefully much more so).  That you should be involved actively in a particular project (like Wikibooks, not just a particular book) to some degree with a substantial number of edits (no specific number required) to show that you understand basic editing policies on the project.
:::IMHO the process of becoming an admin has been glorified way too much.  At this point '''I''' don't care if I become an admin, but I don't think it should be a major undertaking.  If the real purpose of the voting page to become an admin was a popularity contest, it is a failure anyway.  It is more like you have to be an agressive user who has done a good job searching all of the pages here at Wikibooks just to find the darn thing, and even then I for one hardly even take a look at it.
:::My previous experience with similar social structures involved the Open Directory Project, where the &quot;admins&quot; (or in that case they were called &quot;metas&quot;) took their power way overboard and have all but killed the entire concept.  Old editors are fleeing and new editors are getting squashed.  I tried to get some enthusiastic new volunteers &quot;promoted&quot;, but my words fell on deaf ears.  The one nice thing I like about the Wikimedia Foundation board is that they are very approachable dispite the huge number of volunteers in all of the projects, and if a particular admin is being particularly harsh (like seems to be happening at Wikinews), they do accept appeals to step in and at least add a couple of more admins if necessary.
:::I don't have any real beef against the current group of admins on Wikibooks, and indeed they are doing a fair job, but I would like to see a couple more people gain admin status. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:16, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:: Yeah, voting for adminship does appear to have become more a popularity contest than simply choosing people who are willing to help out with Wikibooks as a whole, and that don't bite other users excessively. It's a bit like VfD in a way, whereby books are being kept simply because the voters liked it, and without consideration for Wikibook's policy. I think that we do need more admins, to bring up the number that are active at any given time (on the lookout for vandalism and to vote on VfD). I don't have any complaints about our existing admins, and you can't force them to be more active, they are volunteers after all.

: You're both correct, and I intend to spend less time talking about the problems, and more time taking on the responsibility of solving them. As a consequence I'm going to attempt to get myself bureaucrat status on this wiki (I think I've even found someone on Meta who can actually get this done), and get some more admins in place ASAP (I believe you'd both make fine candidates). I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting fed up with having to continually revert these automated linkspam attacks, when I (or others) could just block them. Especially now our beloved 'ass pus' perpetrator seems to have returned again. See [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Aya]] for the gory details.

As an interested user, it might interest you that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]] over the biography debacle).

:Thanks. On second thoughts, maybe the newest editor chopped out too much information. Maybe, I'll leave it protected for a little while before unprotecting it.

== Template protection request ==

Since it would be easy to get an admin to unprotect this... and because they are use so much and in so many place throughout Wikibooks, I am requesting that the following templates be placed under protection:

*[[Template:Stage]]
*[[Template:Stage short]]

This was an avenue for vandalism in the last attack that can be prevented, and I don't see a legitimate reason to change these templates without a wiki-wide discussion first anyway that would also involve an admin.

Thanks in advance for considering this. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:16, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:Done. I don't know if I'm supposed to do it without consulting the others, but it's easily undone. As a rule, however, protecting pages is really supposed to be our last resort. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::I'm pointing out that how pervasive these template is used throughout Wikibooks (I bet this snipped of text is accessed more than just about any other piece here) and the fact that I can't see any realistic reason to even change the format of this template without a major discussion, they do need protection.  In the last Ass Pus attack, some well-meaning but uninformed new user went through and deleted this template from Wikijunior Solar System (quite a bit of work BTW as it was used about 30 times there), and I bet that happened in some other areas of Wikibooks as well... which is one of my motivations.  I would suggest that the images of 00%.png, 25%.png, 50%.png, 75%.png, and 100%.png should also be protected, but that is more likely to be updated in some expaned guesstimation of the status of a Wikibook.  I'll go ahead and take the heat on this one if somebody complains, but I highly doubt that will be a problem.  Besides, the protection is also in the logs, and as you've said it can be undone very easy. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:41, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

== Rollback ==

I can't figure this out. How is it you manage to auto-rollback more than one revision in a page's history? For example, your recent rollback to [[The Final Fantasy Legend]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:41, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


: It doesn't work 100% of the time for some reason. But, you simply go to the history and then check beside the revision that you want to revert to, and then find the diff (handy to see if any damage has actually been done, newbies will often make several edits, and then fix them all). You should have the rollback link on the top right of the screen, and the revision you want to revert to on the top left (if not, then it won't work this time), simply click on the link, and that's it. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:49, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


Weird. I tested that on the sandbox, to revert all the way back to Pieman's last edit, but it didn't work. I think it may only work when the last few edits were all made by the same user. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:54, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


Confirmed. All edits must have been made from the same user. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:57, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


: That would make sense. I've also found that when reviewing a user's contributions, hitting the rollback link beside their final edit to the page will revert all of their (contiguous) edits to that page. I've just tested it on myself, and it works. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:10, 16 August 2005 (UTC)


I also suspect that regardless of which revision you diff against amongst the previous user's contiguous edits, it will ''always'' rollback them all. Note that I can't find any documentation about this on Meta at all. Typical. :-)

Perhaps we should use this thread to start the beginnings of an &quot;administrators guide&quot;, especially considering the number of new admins that have been added recently, and those still in the pipeline. It also ought to point out when blocking users is okay. I was slightly annoyed when I noticed [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] [[Special:Log/block|blocked]] a [[Special:Contributions/151.204.136.74|newbie]] for 3 days for [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook&amp;diff=212955&amp;oldid=207619 this edit] to the [[Cookbook]]. In his defence, he may have foolishly believed the reverter's incorrect assertion that this user was a 'vandal', but admins really ought to check these sorts of things. Luckily I was watching it all on the IRC system, so I could unblock the user within 5 minutes of the block. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:34, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: A set of guidelines for administrators would be a good idea. I'm carrying on the way I did before I became an administrator, and it may not be entirely correct. It is understandable that Albert over did it a bit, because he has been out of the loop for a while. I think that we need to reiterate that suspected vandals should be dealt with carefully, just revert their edits without comment, only warn them on them talk page if they persist, and only block them if they ignore a warning. In practice, I silently rollback everything but the most persistant vandalism. We don't wan't to frighten off casual experimeners, and we don't want to encorage attention seeking vandals by overreacting either. Our goal should be to fix vandalism as quickly as possible, so that others can see that the behaviour will not be accepted, and that their efforts are in vain. PS: I see that you are using the Wikibooks indentation scheme. I though that it was being largly ignored. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:12, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm thinking something like this for the casual vandal:

# For a first offence, just silently revert. If it looks more like a newbie experiment than a vandal, then stick the &quot;test&quot; template on their user talk page. We don't want to encourage attention-seeking vandals by putting messages on their talk page.
# If they should continue, warn that subsequent transgressions will result in a block.
# If they still don't listen, block for a small amount of time (24h?)
# After this, increase length of block, but I'm not certain an infinite block is a good idea for the casual vandal.

Exceptions to this are scripted linkspam attempts - zero tolerance to this, so infinite block. Ditto with this AP vandal.

Although there's still the issue of how to tell the difference between a newbie experiment and a vandal.

I prefer the other indentation scheme, but I use this scheme when the depth of nesting hits about 6 or 7. I think this scheme can get a little confusing when there's more than two users in the conversation. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:06, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: That sounds sensible. It's hard to tell a vandal from an experimenter, but we should err on the side of caution. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for the offer, but I would rather stick with Geocachernemesis, because that is what I am known as on many other Wikimedia projects (also, Geo is already taken on Wikipedia).

Assistive Technology is a generic term including assistive, adaptive and enabling and rehabilitative devices and the process used in selecting, locating and using them. Assistive technologies include: 
mechanical, electronic, and microprocessor based equipment: This includes microcomputers, electronic communication devices and other sophisticated devices. Non-mechanical and non-electronic aids: For example, a ramp to replace steps would fit in this category. Specialized instructional materials, services and strategies: Large print for persons with visual impairments is one example of specialized instructional material. Augmentative communication system - Any system that aids individuals who are not independent verbal communicators. The system can include speech, gestures, sign language, symbols, synthesized speech, dedicated communication aids or microcomputers. 


There are many companies that specialize in assistive technology the links below are just a few.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Abnormal psychology is the study of abnormal behavior in order to describe, predict, explain, and change abnormal patterns of functioning. Abnormal psychology studies the nature of psychopathology and its causes, and this knowledge is applied in clinical psychology to treating patients with psychological disorders.

 The names and classifications of these disorders are listed in the ''''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM)''. The ''DSM'' is intended to be applicable in a wide array of contexts and used by clinicians and researchers of many different orientations (e.g., biological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems). The DSM is currently in its ''Fifth Edition (DSM-5)'' and has been designed for use across clinical settings (inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinic, private practice, and primary care), with community populations.

== Conclusion ==

One disorder that has attracted a great deal of attention is Autism or the Autism Spectrum of Disorders. 

Autism spectrum disorders include five specific diagnostic categories: Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, Rhett’s syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. These disorders have different criteria as found in the DSM IV, however, they fall under a spectrum of disorders that are developmental, usually presenting symptoms by the age of 3, with impairment in the following areas: 1) communication, 2) social functioning, and 3) restricted or repetitive interests, activities or stereotyped behavior.

Autism occurs in as many as 1 in 500 people with boys affected about 4 times as often as girls. It is the fastest growing category within special education. The causes are unknown, but it appears that there is a biological disorder in the form of abnormal brain development, structure and/or neurochemistry.

Most supported by research as effective are the use of early identification and interventions, specialized and individualized education, interventions with behavioral or applied behavior analysis approaches and other methods supported by well designed and peer reviewed research. Medications can be helpful for some symptom management, as well. Avoid basing your beliefs on celebrities with T.V. exposure, gurus and pundits with claims of miraculous cures or unconventional points of view who bypass the research peer review process or who fail to withstand it.

Some programs using behavioral approaches: *ABA, TEACCH, LEAP

== Noun ==

'''&quot;A Naming word.&quot;'''

A noun, or noun substantive, is a word or phrase that refers to a person, place, thing, event, substance or quality. Nouns are parts of speech and can be classified in different ways such as proper nouns (e.g. &quot;Janet&quot;) versus common nouns (e.g. &quot;girl&quot;), or collective nouns (e.g. &quot;bunch&quot;, &quot;herd&quot;). Nouns can be substituted by pronouns (e.g. &quot;she&quot; and &quot;which&quot;). The word noun derives from Latin nomen meaning &quot;name&quot; (as a noun can be considered an object, person, or concept's name).

Further classifications include the distinction between concrete nouns and abstract nouns. Concrete nouns refer to definite objects (e.g. chair, apple, Janet) and abstract nouns refer to ideas or concepts (e.g. justice, liberty). While sometimes useful, the boundaries between these two are not always clear.

In sentences, nouns occur in several different ways, the most common being as subjects (performers of action), or objects (recipients of action). In the sentence &quot;John wrote me a letter&quot;, &quot;John&quot; is a subject; &quot;me&quot; and &quot;letter&quot; are objects (of which &quot;letter&quot; is a noun and &quot;me&quot; a pronoun).</text>

{{cooknav}}

These are a few things to consider when reading a recipe you intend to try to cook.

==Read The Recipe==

Yes that would be the first step, wouldn't it? Read it - ''all of it'', carefully. Make sure that you have all the ingredients in the ingredients list. Make sure that there aren't any ingredients required by the text of the recipe that aren't mentioned in the ingredients list (a ''major'' faux pas, but it happens to the best of us).

Look at how the different ingredients need to be prepared. Do the onions need to be chopped, diced, irradiated with alpha particles, soaked in 12 year old Australian wine for six days and nights, or what? The difference between halved tomatoes and diced tomatoes can make or break a dish. How you prepare your ingredients is half the battle.

Next, does the recipe call for tools? How specifically? Generally if a good recipe mentions a tool very specifically there is a reason. If it's a really good recipe that reason will be spelled out. By the same token, if the tool is only mentioned vaguely or not directly mentioned at all then you should be safe using whatever you like.

Next comes timing. How long will it take to prepare the various ingredients? How long will it take to prepare the whole recipe? This can be important. You don't want to put the biscuits into the oven at the same time as the turkey - one of these items will be finished a long time before the other and both are best served warm.

==Prepare Your Ingredients==

All right. You have all the tools and ingredients you need, you have the recipe handy, and you're ready to cook. First things first, you must prepare your ingredients. If you need half an onion diced, a bell pepper in strips, and two potatoes cubed, you don't want to be doing that while trying to cook. It will only distract you and create an unnecessary opportunity for you to make a mistake. Prepare all your ingredients before you begin cooking. It will make you happier in the long run and the happier you are the healthier you are. If the recipe calls for a preheated oven, this is probably the time for that as well (see note).

Now that you have all your ingredients prepared, glance at the recipe once more. The term &quot;divided&quot; may be used, which means that the item will be used more than once during preparation, so this is an important reason for CAREFULLY re-reading the recipe. Make sure you haven't forgotten anything. Now you can continue to cook in accordance with your recipe.

==Look Beyond The Recipe==

Yes, recipes are a good and necessary thing. They allow us to accrue knowledge about cooking. However, as a Mr. Einstein once put it, &quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge.&quot; Even if you know nothing at all about cooking, stop and think about what you are doing. A little bit of creative thought can make a dish made from any recipe an original masterpiece.

==Notes==

On pre-heating ovens: If you are cooking in an oven it is nearly always necessary to preheat that oven. The problem here is twofold:
:#Many cooks do not preheat their ovens properly, or don't preheat them at all.
:#Many cooks think they are preheating properly when they are not.

When the pre-heat light on an oven turns off all that means is that the air temperature near the probe in the oven has reached the desired temperature. When you open the oven door a large part of that heat energy comes billowing out and, because the oven walls are still relatively cool, the oven takes between five and ten minutes to recover to its original temperature. The solution is to allow your oven to sit (unopened) for fifteen to twenty minutes after the preheating light turns off to allow the oven walls to absorb heat, thus reducing recovery time.

Consider how old the recipe is. A recipe from 1928 is likely to be different than a 1998 recipe. You may need a dictionary to determine what the ingredients are and if you can still get them. Note that many old recipes assume that you already know how to prepare them, listing only the ingredients. Some trial and error (as well as substitutions) may be needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 5.0  Index Investments ==

Is there a place for index investments in a portfolio?  Yes there is.  Individuals still working and saving in 401 or 403 plans can definitely make use of index investments vehicles.  Since index investments outperform the majority of actively managed mutual funds, it makes a lot of sense to reduce costs and go the index route.  Even for investors saving money outside of a tax-deferred account would do well to consider adding index investments to their portfolio options.

If one goes back and reviews the original portfolio plan there are many different asset classes to populate.  We have large-cap value and growth, mid-cap value and growth, small-cap value and growth, international including emerging markets, REITs, bonds, precious metals, cash etc.  It is nearly impossible for one investor to be expert in all these different asset classes.  Furthermore, if one is using NAIC methods for screening, selecting, and analyzing stocks, it is very difficult to find sufficient stocks to populate the value asset classes.  This is where index investments such as iShares play an important role in portfolio construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
It should be noted in the introduction to this book that it is a perspective and approach to social phenomena and not an actual theory.  The social psychological approach to studying social phenomena has generated a number of theories, which should be discussed in the text, but the perspective is not a theory. --[[User:Exmoron|Exmoron]] 22:10, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Notes from Abrams, D. in Group Processes==

p. 425 &quot;William James (1890) distinguished between the &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;Me.&quot; The &quot;I&quot; is the self as experienced, the active thinking processor. The &quot;Me&quot; is the stock of empirical information about oneself, which has material, social, and spiritual components. The self is a central concept in social psychology (Ashmore &amp; Jussim, 1997; Baumeister, 1999; Dweck, 1999), reflecting in part the importance of the individual in modern society as a target for social influence and a unit of economic activity. However, much of the research activity only considers the self as an individual, and this misses an important part of James's analysis. James argued that, in principle, one has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize one. In practice, these selves are determined by the groups of people about whose opinion one cares. James argued that people can change their persona to reflect the social audience. These transformations involve shifts of identity in different contexts, not merely forms of strategic self-presentation.&quot;

p. 447 &quot;Our view is that society and the individual are mutually instantiated (Abrams, 1992a; Abrams et al., 2000; Hogg &amp; Williams, 2000). Theologians and poets have understood this point for centuries and some sociologically inclined psychologists reached similar conclusions half a century ago (e.g., Newcomb, 1950; Sherif, 1936). We believe that this conclusion is gradually being reflected not just in a corner of the discipline, but as change in the meta-theoretical framework (Doise, 1986; Operario &amp; Fiske, 1999). The combination of a social identity perspective with models of social cognitive, interpersonal, and intergroup processes offers hope for achieving a better understanding of the truly social nature of the self.&quot;
Mead said this 70+ years ago.  Why repeat what is known?

== The Table of Contents ==

The headings are convoluted.  Let's give simpler headings for the major subjects.  i.e. &quot;The Individual&quot; instead of &quot;Social Elements of the Individual.&quot;  Seems redundant- people know this is going to be a book about social psychology.  What say ye????

Just capitalized all the section titles on the table of contents.  If someone wanted them lower case for a reason, feel free to revert.</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In Ada the subprograms are classified into two categories: [[#Procedures|procedures]] and [[#Functions|functions]]. A procedures call is a statement and does not return any value, whereas a function returns a value and must therefore be a part of an expression.

Subprogram parameters may have three modes.

; {{Ada/kw|in}}: The actual parameter value goes into the call and is not changed there. The formal parameter is a constant and allows only reading. This is the default when no mode is given. The actual parameter is an expression.
; {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}}: The actual parameter goes into the call and may be redefined. The formal parameter is a variable and can be read and written.
; {{Ada/kw|out}}: The actual parameter's value before the call is irrelevant, it will get a value in the call. The formal parameter can be read and written. (In Ada 83 {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters were write-only.)

A parameter of any mode may also be explicitly {{Ada/kw|aliased}}.

; {{Ada/kw|access}}: The formal parameter is an access (a pointer) to some variable. (This is not a parameter mode from the reference manual point of view.)

Note that parameter modes do not specify the parameter passing method. Their purpose is to document the data flow.

The parameter passing method depends on the type of the parameter. A rule of thumb is that parameters fitting into a register are passed by copy, others are passed by reference. For certain types, there are special rules, for others the parameter passing mode is left to the compiler (which you can assume to do what is most sensible). Tagged types are always passed by reference.

Explicitly {{Ada/kw|aliased}} parameters and {{Ada/kw|access}} parameters specify pass by reference.

Unlike in the C class of programming languages, Ada subprogram calls cannot have empty parameters parentheses &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/dl|(}} {{Ada/dl|)}}&lt;/code&gt; when there are no parameters.

== Procedures ==

A procedure call in Ada constitutes a statement by itself.

For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} A_Test {{Ada/dl|(}}A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer; C: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    C := A + B;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} A_Test;

When the procedure is called with the statement
 A_Test (5 + P, 48, Q);
the expressions 5 + P and 48 are evaluated (expressions are only allowed for in parameters), and then assigned to the formal parameters A and B, which behave like constants. Then, the value A + B is assigned to formal variable C, whose value will be assigned to the actual parameter Q when the procedure finishes.

C, being an {{Ada/kw|out}} parameter, is an uninitialized variable before the first assignment. (Therefore in Ada 83, there existed the restriction that {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters are write-only. If you wanted to read the value written, you had to declare a local variable, do all calculations with it, and finally assign it to C before return. This was awkward and error prone so the restriction was removed in Ada 95.)

Within a procedure, the return statement can be used without arguments to exit the procedure and return the control to the caller.

For example, to solve an equation of the kind &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Elementary_Functions}};
 {{Ada/kw|use}}  {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Elementary_Functions}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Quadratic_Equation
    {{Ada/dl|(}}A, B, C :     Float;   {{Ada/--|By default it is &quot;in&quot;.}}
     R1, R2  : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
     Valid   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean{{Ada/dl|)}}
 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Z : Float;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Z := B**2 - 4.0 * A * C;
    {{Ada/kw|if}} Z &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|or}} A = 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
       Valid := False;  {{Ada/--|Being out parameter, it should be modified at least once.}}
       R1    := 0.0;
       R2    := 0.0;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       Valid := True;
       R1    := (-B + Sqrt (Z)) / (2.0 * A);
       R2    := (-B - Sqrt (Z)) / (2.0 * A);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Quadratic_Equation;

The function SQRT calculates the square root of non-negative values.  If the roots are real, they are given back in R1 and R2, but if they are complex or the equation degenerates (A = 0), the execution of the procedure finishes after assigning to the Valid variable the False value, so that it is controlled after the call to the procedure.  Notice that the {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters should be modified at least once, and that if a mode is not specified, it is implied {{Ada/kw|in}}.

== Functions ==

A function is a subprogram that can be invoked as part of an expression. Until Ada 2005, functions can only take {{Ada/kw|in}} (the default) or {{Ada/kw|access}} parameters; the latter can be used as a work-around for the restriction that functions may not have {{Ada/kw|out}} parameters. Ada 2012 has removed this restriction.

Here is an example of a function body:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} A;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} B;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

Or in Ada2012:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|return}} ({{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}} A {{Ada/kw|else}} B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

or even shorter as an ''expression function''

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B: Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} ({{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}} A {{Ada/kw|else}} B);

The formal parameters with mode {{Ada/kw|in}} behave as local constants whose values are provided by the corresponding actual parameters.  The statement {{Ada/kw|return}} is used to indicate the value returned by the function call and to give back the control to the expression that called the function.  The expression of the {{Ada/kw|return}} statement may be of arbitrary complexity and must be of the same type declared in the specification.  If an incompatible type is used, the compiler gives an error.  If the restrictions of a subtype are not fulfilled, e.g. a range, it raises a Constraint_Error exception.

The body of the function can contain several {{Ada/kw|return}} statements and the execution of any of them will finish the function, returning control to the caller.  If the flow of control within the function branches in several ways, it is necessary to make sure that each one of them is finished with a {{Ada/kw|return}}
statement.  If at run time the end of a function is reached without encountering a {{Ada/kw|return}} statement, the exception Program_Error is raised.  Therefore, the body of a function must have at least one such {{Ada/kw|return}}
statement.

Every call to a function produces a new copy of any object declared within it.  When the function finalizes, its objects disappear.  Therefore, it is possible to call the function recursively.  For example, consider this implementation of the factorial function:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Factorial (N : Positive) {{Ada/kw|return}} Positive {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} N = 1 {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} 1;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} (N * Factorial (N - 1));
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Factorial;

When evaluating the expression &lt;code&gt;Factorial (4);&lt;/code&gt; the function
will be called with parameter 4 and within the function it will
try to evaluate the expression &lt;code&gt;Factorial (3)&lt;/code&gt;, calling itself as a function, but in this case parameter N would be 3 (each call copies the parameters) and so on until N = 1 is evaluated which will finalize the recursion and then the expression will begin to be completed in the reverse order.

A formal parameter of a function can be of any type, including vectors or
records.  Nevertheless, it cannot be an anonymous type, that is, its
type must be declared before, for example:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Float_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Float;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Add_Components (V: Float_Vector) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Result : Float := 0.0;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       Result := Result + V(I);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
    {{Ada/kw|return}} Result;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Add_Components;

In this example, the function can be used on a vector of arbitrary dimension.
Therefore, there are no static bounds in the parameters passed to the
functions. For example, it is possible to be used in the following
way:

 V4  : Float_Vector (1 .. 4) := (1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8);
 Sum : Float;
 
 Sum := Add_Components (V4);

In the same way, a function can also return a type whose bounds are not known a priori. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Invert_Components (V : Float_Vector) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Result : Float_Vector(V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}});   {{Ada/--|Fix the bounds of the vector to be returned.}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} V'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       Result(I) := V (V'{{Ada/attribute|First}} + V'{{Ada/attribute|Last}} - I);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
    {{Ada/kw|return}} Result;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Invert_Components; 

The variable Result has the same bounds as V, so the returned vector will always have the same dimension as the one passed as parameter.

A value returned by a function can be used without assigning it to a variable, it can be referenced as an expression.  For example, &lt;code&gt;Invert_Components (V4) (1)&lt;/code&gt;, where the first element of the vector returned by the function would be obtained (in this case, the last element of V4, i.e. 7.8).

== Named parameters ==

In subprogram calls, named parameter notation (i.e. the name of the formal
parameter followed of the symbol {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}} and then the actual parameter) allows the rearrangement of the parameters in the call. For example:

 Quadratic_Equation (Valid =&gt; OK, A =&gt; 1.0, B =&gt; 2.0, C =&gt; 3.0, R1 =&gt; P, R2 =&gt; Q);
 F := Factorial (N =&gt; (3 + I));

This is especially useful to make clear which parameter is which.

 Phi := Arctan (A, B);
 Phi := Arctan (Y =&gt; A, X =&gt; B);

The first call (from Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions) is not very clear. One might easily confuse the parameters. The second call makes the meaning clear without any ambiguity.

Another use is for calls with numeric literals:

 Ada.Float_Text_IO.Put_Line (X, 3, 2, 0);  -- ?
 Ada.Float_Text_IO.Put_Line (X, Fore =&gt; 3, Aft =&gt; 2, Exp =&gt; 0);  -- OK

== Default parameters ==

On the other hand, formal parameters may have default values. They can, therefore, be omitted in the subprogram call. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} By_Default_Example (A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer := 0);

can be called in these ways:

 By_Default_Example (5, 7);      {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 5, B = 7&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (5);         {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 5, B = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example;             {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 0, B = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (B =&gt; 3);    {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 0, B = 3&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 By_Default_Example (1, B =&gt; 2); {{Ada/--|&lt;nowiki&gt;A = 1, B = 2&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

In the first statement, a &quot;regular call&quot; is used (with positional association); the second also uses positional association but omits the second parameter to use the default; in the third statement, all parameters are by default; the fourth statement uses named association to omit the first parameter; finally, the fifth statement uses mixed association, here the positional parameters have to precede the named ones.

Note that the default expression is evaluated once for each formal parameter that has no actual parameter. Thus, if in the above example a function would be used as defaults for A and B, the function would be evaluated once in case 2 and 4; twice in case 3, so A and B could have different values; in the others cases, it would not be evaluated.

== Renaming ==

Subprograms may be renamed. The parameter and result profile for a renaming-as-declaration must be mode conformant.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Solve
   (A, B, C: {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
    R1, R2 : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
    Valid  : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean) {{Ada/kw|renames}} Quadratic_Equation;

This may be especially comfortable for tagged types.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Some_Package {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Message_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print (Message: {{Ada/kw|in}} Message_Type);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Some_Package; 

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Some_Package;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Message: Some_Package.Message_Type;
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Print {{Ada/kw|renames}} Message.Print;  {{Ada/--|this has convention intrinsic, see RM 6.3.1(10.1/2)}}
   &lt;s&gt;Method_Ref: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} := Print'{{Ada/kw|Access}};&lt;/s&gt;  {{Ada/--|thus taking 'Access should be illegal; GNAT GPL 2012 allows this}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}  {{Ada/--|All these calls are equivalent:}}
   Some_Package.Print (Message);  {{Ada/--|traditional call without use clause}}
   Message.Print;                 {{Ada/--|Ada 2005 method.object call - note: no use clause necessary}}
   Print;                         {{Ada/--|Message.Print is a parameterless procedure and can be renamed as such}}
   &lt;s&gt;Method_Ref.{{Ada/kw|all}};&lt;/s&gt;                {{Ada/--|GNAT GPL 2012 allows illegal call via an access to the renamed procedure Print}}
                                  {{Ada/--|This has been corrected in the current version (as of Nov 22, 2012)}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

But note that &lt;code&gt;Message.Print'{{Ada/kw|Access}};&lt;/code&gt; is illegal, you have to use a renaming declaration as above.

Since only mode conformance is required (and not full conformance as between specification and body), parameter names and default values may be changed with renamings:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure }}P (X: {{Ada/kw|in }}Integer :=  0);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure }}R (A: {{Ada/kw|in }}Integer := -1) {{Ada/kw|renames }}P;

This book is an open work designed for people interested in learning to program for the '''Super Nintendo Entertainment System''' and assumes some basic knowledge on how to program in assembly language, use a command prompt and emulator. 

This book will cover how to write programs for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. As the CPU of the SNES has a 65c816 core, programming for the SNES is done with 65c816 assembly language.

*'''Core'''
*CPU: Nintendo custom '5A22', believed to be produced by Ricoh; based around a 16-bit CMD/GTE 65c816 (a clone of the Western Design Center 65816). [Edit note: 65c816 was made by Western Design Center by William D. Mensch. CMD/GTE was a licensee] The CPU runs the 65c816-alike core with a variable-speed bus, with bus access times determined by addresses accessed, with a maximum theoretical effective clock rate around 3.58 MHz.  The SNES/SFC provided the CPU with 128 KB of Work RAM.

*The CPU also contains other support hardware, including:
** for interfacing with controller ports;
** for generating NMI interrupts on Vertical blanking interval;
** for generating IRQ interrupts on screen positions;
** Direct memory access unit, supporting two primary modes, general DMA (for block transfers, at a rate of 2.68MB/second) and Horizontal blanking interval DMA (for transferring small data sets at the end of each scanline, outside of the active display period);
** multiplication and division registers.

*Cartridge Size Specifications: 2 - 32 Megabits(Mb) which ran at two speeds ('SlowROM' and 'FastROM'). Custom address decoders allow larger sizes, eg. 48 Mb for ''Star Ocean'' and ''Tales of Phantasia''

*'''Sound'''
**Sound Controller Chip: 8-bit Sony SPC700 CPU for controlling the Digital signal processor running at an effective clock rate around 1.024 MHz.
**Main Sound Chip: 8-channel Sony S-DSP with hardware ADPCM decompression, pitch modulation, echo effect with feedback (for reverberation) with 8-tap FIR filter, and ADSR and 'GAIN' (discretely controlled) volume envelopes.
**Memory Cycle Time: 279 ms
**Sound RAM: 512 kilobit(Kb) shared between SPC700 and S-DSP.
**Pulse Code Modulator: 16-Bit ADPCM (using 4-bit compressed ADPCM samples, expanded to 15-bit resolution, processed with an additional 4-point Gaussian sound interpolation).
** Note - while not directly related to SNES hardware, the standard extension for SNES audio subsystem state files saved by emulators is SPC_sound_format(.spc), a format used by SPC players.

*'''Video'''
**Picture Processor Unit: 15-Bit
**Video RAM: 64 KB of VRAM for screen maps (for 'background' layers) and tile sets (for backgrounds and objects); 512 + 32 bytes of 'OAM' (Object Attribute Memory) for objects; 512 bytes of 'CGRAM' for palette data.
**Palette: 256 entries; 15-Bit color (BGR555) for a total of 32,768 colors.
**Maximum colors per layer per scanline: 256.
**Maximum colors on-screen: 32,768 (using color arithmetic for transparency effects).
**Resolution: between 256x224 and 512x448. Most games used 256x224 pixels since higher resolutions caused slowdown, flicker, and/or had increased limitations on layers and colors (due to memory bandwidth constraints); the higher resolutions were used for less processor-intensive games, in-game menus, text, and high resolution images.
**Maximum onscreen objects (sprites): 128 (32 per line, up to 34 8x8 tiles per line).
**Maximum number of sprite pixels on one scanline: 256. The renderer was designed such that it would drop the ''frontmost'' sprites instead of the rearmost sprites if a scanline exceeded the limit, allowing for creative clipping effects.
**Most common display modes: Pixel-to-pixel text mode 1 (16 colors per tile; 3 scrolling layers) and affine mapped text mode 7 (256 colors per tile; one rotating/scaling layer).

A '''blender''' is a kitchen appliance used to blend ingredients or [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] food. The term typically refers to a stationary, upright electrical device, which is to be distinguished from a hand-powered or electric mixer that may be used for similar purposes.

A typical blender will be built around a vessel for the ingredients to be blended. At the top of the vessel will be a cap to prevent ingredients from escaping when the blender is switched on. At the bottom will be a blade assembly, typically removable for cleaning purposes. The bottom seal will most likely be watertight. The vessel will rest upon a base containing a motor (for turning the blade assembly) with controls on its surface. Most modern blenders will offer a number of possible speeds.

A '''wand blender''' (also known as a hand or stick blender) differs from a standard blender. It does not have a bowl, and its blade is situated at one end of a long stick, this allows it to be used to purée foods in their own containers (e.g., in [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepans]] while still on the stove top).

[[Cookbook:Nachos|Nachos]] made into a meal.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Ingredients==

* 4 medium [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillos]], husked and rinsed (or used canned if unavailable)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], stemmed 
* 1/2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled and quartered 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] clove, peeled 
* 1 handful fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, coarsely chopped 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], juiced 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasted]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [60ml] (1/2 stick) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 1/4 cup all-purpose [60ml] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (480ml) [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]], at room temperature 
* 4 cups shredded (950ml) [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]] 
* 1 (1-[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]]) (450g) bag salted corn tortilla chips 
* 1 (3-pound) whole (1350g) [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] chicken, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] finely shredded, skin and bones discarded

'''Quick [[Cookbook:Salsa|Salsa]]:'''

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (570ml) cherry [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], halved 
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], white and green parts, chopped 
* 1 jalapeño, chopped 
* 2 handfuls fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, hand shredded 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes, juiced]] 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] 

* [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]] and [[Cookbook:Guacamole|guacamole]], for serving

==Preparation==
#Bring a pot of water to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]]; add the tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and garlic. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tomatillos are soft. 
##Drain and cool slightly, then put them in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. 
##Add the cilantro, lime juice, and cumin. [[Cookbook:Pureeing|Puree]] for a few seconds to blend, and then pour in about a 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; taste and season with a generous pinch of salt. You should have about 2 cups of this green salsa (''salsa verde''). 
#Make a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] by melting the butter over medium-low heat in a thick-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. 
##Just as the foam subsides, sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] to prevent lumps. 
##Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to remove the starchy taste from the flour; don't allow it to [[Cookbook:Browning|brown]].
##Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and simmer for 8 minutes to thicken.
##Once you have a good base, fold in 2 cups of the shredded Jack cheese; mix until completely melted into a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. 
#Stir in the prepared salsa verde until incorporated; remove the green chili cheese sauce from the heat. 
#Make a quick salsa by combining the cherry tomatoes, onions, jalapeño, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl; season with salt and pepper, tossing to combine. 

*To build these awesome nachos: 
#Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350 degrees F]] (180c).
#Get a very large [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]-proof platter and cover it with a few handfuls of tortilla chips, follow with a portion of the shredded chicken, a coating of the cheese sauce, and a nice sprinkle of the remaining shredded jack.
#Make 3 or 4 layers of the nachos, depending on the size of the platter. 
#Bake the nachos until they are all hot and gooey, about 5 to 10 minutes. 

*Spoon the tomato salsa over the top of the nachos and serve with the sour cream on the side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* [http://www.zsnes.com/ ZSNES] is a fast open-source emulator originally developed for DOS, but later ported to Windows, Linux, *BSD, BeOS, and Mac OS X (Intel).  Being written primarily in x86 assembly, it is one of the fastest emulators available.  It will run fine on a 200 MHz machine. Today, ZSNES is considered to have the most wide support for special-chip hardware and possesses some of the highest game compatibility around.

* [http://www.snes9x.com/ Snes9x] is a portable freeware emulator. In some form or another, Snes9x has been ported to Linux, PowerPC, PSP, Xbox, GP2X, and others. The source code for Snes9x is publicly accessible.

* [http://byuu.org/emulation/higan/ Higan (formerly bsnes)] is an open-source emulator for Windows and Linux. Its primary focus is accuracy and as such it might be the most accurate SNES emulator currently around. The system requirements for achieving full speed are however quite high (somewhere in the area of 2GHz). For those who want their games to run on the actual SNES console, bsnes should be considered.

* [http://www.emuunlim.com/sneese/ SNEeSe]'s primary goal is that of accuracy. It was originally developed for DOS, but is now primarily for MS Windows.  SNEeSe uses the Allegro library, and has unmaintained ports to Linux and BeOS. In the future SNEeSe may serve as a testbed for advanced ideas having to do with accurate synchronization.

* [http://geigercount.net/crypt/ Geiger's snes9x debugger], is a closed-source path tracing emulator, available only for windows.

* [http://snes-station.gamebase.ca/ SNES Station] is an emulator for the PlayStation 2.

It will discuss a Professional Development Model for Technology Integration


== INTRODUCTION ==
Staff development models that usually focus on school improvement often deal with specific problems. For example, 
[http://michigan.gov/mde MEAP] scores are down, how do we improve? Teachers are often required to gain skills or knowledge in a certain area. The main objective in implementing professional development through a model would be to develop and implement a comprehensive model for technological professional development that facilitates technology integration into the curriculum. The model theory that I researched is  based on the simple fact that adults learn when they have a need to know or to help solve a real-life problem. (Knowles, 1980) Adults have a need to be self-directing. Adults bring a wealth of experience that should be used in a learning situation. Adults’ readiness to learn is based on a need to solve a problem. Adults want to make immediate application of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;
Advances in technology require that educators prepare students not only academically but also to meet the challenges of 21st century demands.  Recent studies have shown that teachers are fully aware of the need for their students to be prepared for the rapid growth of the Information Society, and that it is their reponsibility to provide chidren with the opportunity to learn technology.(Loveless, 2004) We have to create personal learning experiences to encourage teachers to embrace this technology.  Pressures from high stakes testing has increased the demand for teachers to integrate technology in the classroom.Journals and research have suggested that integrating technology will promote better standardized test scores and motivate students to achieve in all areas of content. Many districts depend on state testing scores for funding and accreditation.  Schools are mandated by state and national levels to meet adequate yearly progress.  Educational software vendors proclaim that using their software will accommodate these issues regarding state and national requirements. In implementing technology and purchasing software, many decisions are focused on if the program be worth the money and would it help with high stakes testing?  Will our teachers be able to successfully implement this learning tool effectively and efficiently?     

== PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL ==
The Professional Development Plan was based on the principles of [[w:Instructional design|Instructional System Design.]]  The model expects that the four phases are done in order with a final assessment.

*'''Performance Analysis'''   
*'''Needs Assessment'''   
*'''Development and Implementation (professional development plan)'''    
*'''Assessment (impact of the professional development plan)'''

==Performance Analysis==

In my elementary environment teachers have to have meaning behind change. The teachers were not adequately prepared to use the new technology tools in instructions.
Often teachers don't fully use the technology that is available for productivity or integration.  Computers are left unused and computer labs are mainly used for drill and practice. Completing a performance analysis to determine how the current work environment is being utilized and making sure that monies spent on technology is being used effectively helps to determine the next step, which is the needs assessment.  

==Needs Assessment==
Surveys need to be prepared to determine the interests, values, and perspectives of the stakeholders. (stakeholders in this model included teachers, assistant teachers, students and parents)
Veteran teachers need to be surveyed on staff development preferences. New teachers would need to be surveyed to identify baseline skills.

==Development==
After a detailed analysis of the surveys to determine the needs and interest of the school staff. The goal is  to develop a long range plan which included professional development for the entire year. The yearly plan can contain detailed implementation for each objective.   Each objective should list indicators of success, measurement tools, plan of activities, responsible parties and completion dates.

==Assessment==
Pre-test should be at the being of the school semester.  Post- test should be completed in the spring. Both tests result data should remain confidential. The analysis should give a percentile score for example a beginner, intermediate, or advanced skill level for each teacher as well as an average for the entire staff. 

==Seels and Glasgow ISD Model II: For Practitioners==
Instructional systems design (ISD) is based on the premise that learning should not occur in a haphazard manner, but should be developed in accordance with orderly processes and have outcomes that can be measured. Basically, ISD requires defining what is to be learned, planning an intervention that will allow learning to occur, measuring learning to determine if objectives were met, and refining the intervention until objectives are met.

The Seels and Glasgow Model II: For Practitioners is a design model for practitioners that includes many of the components identified in this article.  Click the link to view the model [[Instructional Technology/Seels and Glasgow Model II|Seels and Glasgow Model II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In ship building and even other places, we need to decide on what load a particular structure will be able to bear. The objective of this course is to find out how to do this with reference to a ship in mind. The load can either be a static load as the dead weight or a dynamic load which causes vibrations. Both are detrimental to the structure and as such must be studied. 

To do so in an orderly manner, we will first consider only static load, and then move on to the study of vibrations in general.

Do not assume that everything is safe! Most will have some sort of safety advice on the page but the absence of written precautions does not mean that you can just go and play ahead. If you are an adult, you should use your own judgement and common sense. If you are a minor (child), it is highly recommended that you should ask for more advice and help from your teachers and parents.

'''Tempeh''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian]] food made from soybeans. It is a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] food, utilising a special type of mould that forms a cake. When fresh, tempeh has a nice mushroom-like smell and flavour.

==Ingredients==

* 400 grams (14 ounces) [[Cookbook:Soy|dried soybeans]]
* water for soaking the soybeans
* water for cooking the soybeans
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon tempeh starter (or ''ragi tempe'')

==Equipment==

* [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooker|Pressure cooker]] or [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], at least 3 litres (3 quarts)
* Large tray (or trays) for spreading cooked beans on to dry
* Banana leaves, zip-lock bags or shallow dishes for incubating the fermenting tempeh
* Somewhere warm to incubate the tempeh at about 30-35°C / 86-95°F (e.g. your oven, with the light on!)
* Thermometer (optional) for keeping a watch on the temperature of the incubator

==Procedure==
[[Image:Tempeh fava ready.jpg|thumb|right|Cooked fava beans, inoculated with starter and ready to ferment.]]

# Cover soybeans with water, and soak overnight or at least 12 hours.
# Remove the hulls (i.e. skins) from the beans by rubbing between both hands (see notes).
# Skim off most of the hulls either by washing them away or by using a [[Cookbook:Skimmer|skimmer]] or strainer. Some hulls may be left behind without affecting tempeh quality.
# Cook beans until just tender, not mushy; undercooked is best for tempeh (see notes).
# Drain beans, and spread to dry somewhere with airflow (see notes).
# Collect beans into a bowl, and mix in the cider vinegar. This acidifies the beans slightly, inhibiting unwanted spoilage organisms during fermentation.
# Sprinkle the tempeh starter over the beans and mix in well (see notes).
# Pack the beans loosely into banana leaves, zip-lock bags, or shallow dishes for incubating. Zip-lock bags must be punctured at roughly 1cm / &amp;frac12; inch intervals to keep oxygen up to the fermenting beans.

==Fermentation==

# Load the soon-to-be tempeh into your incubator, preferably on racks that will allow air circulation. An electric oven with a light on makes a pretty good incubator, because the light provides just enough heat to keep the beans warm while the fermentation starts happening.
# Incubate for 12 hours or so at around 30-35°C / 86-95°F with a heat source (unless it's already that hot where you are)
# After 12 hours, remove or turn off the heat source - the fermenting beans will be making their own heat, and may overheat if you keep them too warm
# Monitor periodically from then on, and remove when the beans are totally consumed by fluffy white tempeh with no gaps.
# After fermentation is complete, serve straight away in your favourite tempeh recipe, refrigerate for two to three days, or freeze for up to two months.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Tempeh tempe.jpg|thumb|right|Fresh tempeh at market, Jakarta, Indonesia]]
* Tempeh can be made from almost any legume (beans, chickpeas, split peas), most grains, and some nuts. Soybeans are probably one of the cheapest beans to use, but more flavoursome beans make more flavoursome tempeh!
* Tempeh can also be made from [[Cookbook:Okara|okara]], the presscake left over from making [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]. In Indonesia, this is called ''tempe gembus''.
* There are many ways to remove the hulls or skins from the beans, including:
** cracking dried beans in a grain mill and winnowing to remove hulls
** grinding soaked beans in hands
** rubbing soaked beans between both hands
** rubbing cooked beans between both hands (but don't get burnt!)
** buy them pre-hulled - e.g. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chana dal]], [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|split fava beans]], [[Cookbook:Pea|split peas]]
* Soybeans can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker at 15psi for 10 minutes with slow-release method, or on a [[Cookbook:Rolling Boil|rolling boil]] for 30 minutes in a saucepan. Soft, ready-to-eat soybeans are not the target here, so don't cook too long.
* It can be difficult to distribute the teaspoonful of tempeh starter through the beans evenly. To make the job a little easier, mix the tempeh starter into a couple of tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] first, then sprinkle and stir this mixture into the beans a little at a time.

===Equipment Required (to Make 60 Cell Holders)===

*60 pieces of [[w:wood|wood]] at least 120mm x 36mm and 20mm thick
*'D' cell plastic holder (available from most Design &amp; Technology suppliers)
*4mm terminals, 60 black and 60 red (available from most electrical component retailers)
*small [[w:screw|screw]]s to fit through the base of the cell holders
*Extra flexible lead [[w:wire|wire]], black and red
*[[w:Solder|Solder]] + [[w:soldering iron|soldering iron]]
*Pliers
*Screwdriver

[[Image:cellholderfin.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 2''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Cell Holder Complete with Cell''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

====Method for making the cell holders====

#Get the wood cut the wood to the correct size and sanded if need be.
#Drill 2 x 7.5mm holes at either end as show in ''fig 1''.&lt;br&gt;
#Drill 2 x 5 mm holes near those.
#Countersink the larger holes to about half way, so that you can attach the nut of the 4mm terminals.
#Insert the 4mm terminals in the larger holes, one of each colour in either end, and secure with nut.
#Attach the plastic cell holder with the 2 screws (diagonally opposite), first drilling holes, and making sure that the end with the spring goes near the black terminal.
#Cut a 5cm piece of each wire, strip the ends and solder onto the tags on the plastic cell holder, making sure you do not take to long or the tags will melt off. Ensure you have got red wire to the red terminal and black wire going to the black terminal. Then push the wire through the 5mm hole and out the other side so you can then solder it onto the 4mm terminal.
#It should look something like '''fig 2'''. these are usually very durable and can be used in conjuction with bulb holders etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article explains '''how to demonstrate the principles of hydraulics'''.

&lt;div style=&quot;float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Hydraulics_demo1.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Hydraulics_demo2.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

A good way of demonstrating the basic principles of [[w:hydraulic|hydraulic]]s is to join two syringes together with rubber tubing to make an watertight seal [see figure 1]. The syringes can be filled with water, oil, or just air. Pushing plunger A causes plunger B to move out and pushing plunger B in causes plunger A to move out. This works even if the syringes are not in the same plane. i.e. if the tubing is bent by 90&amp;deg; as long as there is no kink in the tube that prevents the free flow of fluid.

With syringes of different sizes it is possible to demonstrate how to multiply [[w:force|force]] [see figure 2]. A small mass on a small syringe can lift a much larger mass if it is resting on a bigger syringe. This is because the [[w:pressure|pressure]] in the two syringes is equal, but the surface areas of the two pistons are different, and force = pressure &amp;times; area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A graticule slide is a [[w:microscope|microscope]] slide that contains a mm grid of lines. They allow the size of objects seen under magnification to be measured. A simple version of a graticule slide can be made by anyone with access to a drawing program. Something as simple as the drawing tools that come with [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]] will do (''see instructions below'').

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[File:Graticule.png]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 1''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''[[w:vector graphics|vector]] [[w:Raster graphics|rasterized]]'' &lt;br /&gt; ''[[w:grid|grid]] (low quality)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Once there is a suitable grid on the computer [you ''could'' download the one to the side; see figure 1], a test print should be produced. The size of the printed square should be measured and the grid should be resized until a cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; grid is printed. This grid can now be printed on photocopiable OHP sheets.

The OHP sheets can be glued to a glass slide with clear nail varnish.

==Instructions to create a grid==
'''Use of Word drawing tools (in ''italics''''')

#In Word, go to view, toolbars. and make sure that 'Drawing' is ticked. Then select a line from the drawing tool pallet. [it is a picture of a line next to 'AutoShapes']
#Draw a single straight, vertical line. Copy and paste the line 9 times.
#Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to line up the lines so that you have 10 evenly spaced lines.
#Select all ten lines at once by holding down the shift key and left clicking on each line in turn.
#Go to Draw then Group, to group all ten lines into a single object.
#Copy then paste the lines then go to 'Draw' then 'Rotate or flip' and rotate by 90&amp;deg;
#Line up the vertical and horizontal lines and by using the corner tabs resize them until there is a perfect grid without any overhangs. Then select both sets of lines and group them together into one object.You should now have a square grid.

The opening paragraphs are simply wrong. Although Visking is a partially permeable membrane the molecular weight cut-off of Visking tubing is generally rated at 12-14kD. Sucrose or most other sugars would easily pass through this membrane which is why it is used as a model of the gut. That is starch is broken down by enzymes in the tube and sugars are allowed to pass through the membrane wall.

The osmosis experiment relates to something slightly different. It is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low one, aiming ultimately to equilibrium. Should there be a higher concentration of sugar solution inside of the membrane then the tendency would be for the water molecules to come into the membrane and a rise in the level of liquid in the capillary tube, in plant cells this would result in turgidity. Although the osmotic potential (into the membrane rather than out) may stop the sugars escaping they are small enough to come out and the dyes may well be seen in the outside bath. Similarly if the tubing contains a smaller concentration of sugars on the inside than the outside one would expect water to come out of the membrane leading to flaccidity but the concentration on the outside needs to be substantially higher and the sugars may still go through.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This '''apparatus for [[w:Osmosis demonstration|demonstrating osmosis]]''' through [[w:visking tubing|visking tubing]] (otherwise known as '''dialysis tubing''') and is widely used in [[w:school|school]]. Visking tubing is a [[w:semipermeable|semipermeable]] membrane that allows small [[w:molecule|molecule]]s like [[w:water|water]] to pass through but does not allow larger molecules like [[w:sugar|sugar]]. If [[w:solution|solution]]s of different [[w:concentration|concentration]] are on either side of the visking membrane, water molecules will pass through and tend to dilute the more concentrated solution.

The assembled equipment is inserted into [[w:hypotonic|hypotonic]], [[w:hypertonic|hypertonic]], and [[w:isotonic|isotonic]] solutions and the level on the capillary rises, falls, or stays level accordingly.  This apparatus is easy for school children to use, but is fiddly to set up. It can be set up by a [[w:school science technician|technician]] in advance.

== Apparatus ==
*0.5[[w:Metre|m]] length of [[w:capillary tube|capillary tube]] 
*10[[w:cm|cm]] of medium width visking tubing
*[[w:Bung|Bung]] with hole. The bung and visking tubing should be selected so that the tubing just fits over the bung.
*Rubber tubing (small and large [[w:bore|bore]])
*0.5[[w:Molar solution|M]] [[w:sucrose|sucrose]] solution
*Food [[w:dye|dye]] e.g. [[w:cochineal|cochineal]].
*[[w:Pipette|Pipette]]

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;[[File:Visking tubing osmosis app.svg]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Apparatus for &lt;br&gt; demonstrating osmosis''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(assembled)''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Notes:'''&lt;br&gt;
a) capillary tube&lt;br&gt;
b) rubber band&lt;br&gt;
c) bung&lt;br&gt;
d) rubber band&lt;br&gt;
e) sucrose solution with food dye&lt;br&gt;
f) knotted visking tubing&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Setting up the Apparatus ==
# The visking tubing is softened under a running tap until it opens up. A knot should be tied at one end to make a bag.
#A bung that is just small enough to fit snugly inside the visking tubing is inserted into the unknotted end. Then a ring of a suitable bore rubber tubing is cut to make a band.This band is then slipped over the visking tubing so that it grips the tubing to the bung.
#The reason that food dye is added to the sucrose solution is to make the level in the capillary tube easy to see.
#The ''bag'' is filled completely to the brim with the coloured sucrose solution by squirting a pipette full at a time through the hole in the rubber bung. No [[w:air|air]] bubbles can remain. At this stage the knot and the attachment to the bung is checked for leaks. 
#The capillary tubing is then carefully inserted into the bung. The fit needs to be tight and the sucrose should come up about half way (see diagram). If the level is too high the visking bag can be '''gently''' squeezed to force a little solution out of the top of the capillary. If the level is too low, a [[w:dialysis clip|dialysis clip]] is attached just above the knot to reduce the volume of the bag.
#A ring from some narrow bore rubber tubing is cut and slippedover the capillary tube to act as a marker for the level.

==Method of Use==
'''A)''' Clamp the apparatus in a [[w:retort stand|retort stand]], then place into a large beaker of 0.5M sucrose (isotonic). Make sure the visking bag is hanging freely in the solution. I.e. not touching the sides or bottom. This stops it from being squashed and distorting the results.

'''B)''' Slide the rubber band to the top of the capillary level in order to mark the start position.Put the apparatus into 2.0M sucrose solution (hypertonic). The level in the capillary tube will fall as the water inside passes through the visking tubing in order to dilute the stronger solution outside.

'''C)''' Put the apparatus into [[w:distilled water|distilled water]] (hypotonic). The level in the capillary tube will rise as the water passes into the visking bag to dilute the stronger solution inside.

==Storage of the Apparatus==

The apparatus cannot be stored for more than a few days with the [[w:sugar|sugar]] solution inside, because it will go mouldy. The capillary tube should be removed and thoroughly rinsed as any sugar left inside will harden and block the tube. The visking bags can be left attached to the bungs but should be rinsed and stored in water or a mixture of water and [[w:ethanol|ethanol]] to keep the bag soft. If the visking dries out it may become brittle and crack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles' law tubes''' allow the demonstration of [[w:Charles' law|Charles' law]] in a school lab.

Heat the tube in boiling water, drying oven or with a hot air gun and
place open end in clean [[w:mercury (element)|mercury]]. Allow tube and the air in it to cool, drawing a thread of mercury about 5mm long up into the tube. Allow all to
cool to room temperature. To move the thread of mercury further down the tube, to ensure it is not expelled when the tube is heated to 100&amp;deg;C during the
experiment, pass a short length of [[w:nylon|nylon]] fishing line (approx 0.5mm diameter)
down the tube and through the mercury. This allows the air below the
mercury to leak out around the line and when the mercury has fallen to the
required position, remove the nylon line. This should ONLY be done if one has proper safety training regarding the hazards of mercury and the school is equipped with proper mercury spill kits for containing and cleaning any potential spills.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
Subroutines and functions are ways to break up your code into a reusable form. They allow the programmer to do a large set of operations just by calling the appropriate procedure or function. For example, lets say you need to PRINT a lot of lines, such as instructions. One way to do this is to just enter all your PRINT commands directly into where you need them. At some point, you may want to move the PRINT commands, or you may use the exact set of PRINTs elsewhere in the program. To move or change all of the PRINT commands would be quite a hassle. A simpler way would be to create a procedure and enter all of the PRINT commands there; then, when you need to execute the commands, you may simply call your procedure and it will execute each line in its body.

==Procedure vs. Function==
A procedure DOES something and does not return anything for the programmer. For example, a procedure might be used to set the screen mode and palette.

A function does something and RETURNS a value. For example, if you need to find the average of two values, you might write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the average. 

== GOTO and GOSUB ==

The GOTO and GOSUB statements were the original methods by which functions were created.  They were the most common on older basic implementations and are kept around for compatibility reasons; however, their use is not recommended in other programming languages or in large scale projects.

These two commands depend on labels, which come in one of two forms.  The first and older form involves writing line numbers at the beginning of each line (usually in increments of 10).  The newer method looks similar to other programming languages, which is a single word followed by a colon.

The GOTO statement is simple; it moves the execution point to a given label:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The GOSUB statement transfers control to a given label, and is paired with a corresponding RETURN statement.  

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== ON ERROR ==

The ON ERROR allows you to define an error handler for your program; when an error occurs, it immediately jumps to the given label.  The control returns once the program reaches a RESUME statement, which can either return control to the same point, the next statement, or any other desired label. 

Within Qbasic, the error handler cannot be located within any subroutines.  As such, any error checking or flags will have to be handled through the use of variables that are shared with the main module.

{{NOTE|While the QBasic documentation states ON ERROR RESUME NEXT is a valid statement, this is incorrect.}}

NOTE: If your error handling routine does not have a &quot;resume&quot; statement in it (IOW you try to do it all with gotos) error handling will only work once - the next &quot;on error&quot; will be ignored and the program ends as if you had no &quot;on error&quot; statement at all. This problem does not seem to be mentioned in any of the documentation. It took me three hours to figure out why two nearly identical program portions acted so differently.

== Declaring a subroutine ==
A superior method of declaring a subroutine is using the SUB statement block.  Under the QBasic IDE, doing so moves the SUB block to it's own section in the window to prevent accidental deletion of the module, and allows the easier organization of the program code.

Calling a function is as simple as writing the name of the function (passing any required parameters.)   If you want, you can use the CALL statement to indicate to other programmers that it is a subroutine. 

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
SUB name (params)
{SHARED variables 'if any}
'{code to execute}
'  ...
'  ...
{STATIC variables 'if any, to be saved for use next time}
END SUB
&lt;/source&gt;

Parameters passed into subroutines are passed by 'reference' i.e. whilst they may take on a new name within the SUB any changes that are made to the values are 'reflected back' into the originals. All other variables used within the SUB are discarded when the END SUB is reached (or an EXIT SUB is executed), except as below :-

To 'preserve' the values of variables used within the SUB for re-use on the next CALL, use the STATIC keyword at the end. 

If you need access to a variable (that has not been passed as a parameter), use the SHARED keyword to define each at the start of the subroutine (a SHARED variable retains it's name).

== Declaring a function ==

A function is a form of subroutine that returns a value.  Everything that applies in defining a subroutine also applies to a function.  Within the function, the return value is created by using the function name as a variable - the return value is then passed to the calling expression. 

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
FUNCTION name (params) 
  ' Shared variable declarations
  name = result
  ' ...
END FUNCTION
&lt;/source&gt;

Functions are declared in the same way as variables - it returns the variable type it's defined to return, in the same way variables are defined to contain their specified type.  By default, it is a number, but appending a dollar sign indicates that it is returning a string.

Functions can only be called within an expression; unlike subroutines, they are not a standalone statement.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">--ADDIE is an instructional model for teaching the Instructional Design process.  The acronym corresponds with the five stages of instructional development: [[Instructional Technology/Analysis|analysis]], [[Instructional Technology/Design|design]], [[Instructional Technology/Development|development]], implementation, and evaluation. Each step of the model has an outcome that feeds information to the following steps.&lt;br&gt; 

*Assessment should occur at the beginning of a project.  During this stage, the instructional designer should consider optimals and actuals.  According to Allison Rossett, an expert on training needs assessment, actuals are what the current performance is and optimals are what should be happening, the desired performance. Once these are determined, it should be determined whether or not instruction is needed to fill the gap.  If instruction is needed, the instructional designer should continue the process.  If instruction is not needed, a Human Performance Technologist should be consulted.  &lt;br&gt; 

*Design happens after the assessment phase.  This is where the objectives, assessment approach, exercises and content is specified.[http://www.e-learningguru.com/articles/art2_1.htm]&lt;br&gt;

*Development is the phase in which the work takes place. User manuals/materials are created as well as instructor materials. The actual course is developed, whether it is an instructor led course, web-based course, or computer based training.&lt;br&gt;

*Implementation is the actual rollout of what was designed and developed. Providing the actual instruction/course to the learners.&lt;br&gt;

*Evaluation should be conducted throughout the phases in the form of formative evaluation. As formative evaluation is conducted, revisions are made to the instruction/design. Summative evaluation occurs at the end. Summative evaluation looks at the actual outcomes of the instruction, did the learners learn what they needed to know.&lt;br&gt;


== Advantages of Using ADDIE ==
Cost effective &lt;br&gt;
Saves time &lt;br&gt;
Promotes effective learning &lt;br&gt;
Consistent &lt;br&gt;
Effective in training &lt;br&gt;

== Criticisms of ADDIE ==

There are drawbacks to any large system or model and ADDIE is not different.  ADDIE has been criticized for being:&lt;br&gt;
Too systematic&lt;br&gt;
Too dogmatic&lt;br&gt;
Too linear&lt;br&gt;
Too constraining&lt;br&gt;
Too time-consuming to implement&lt;br&gt;--Nackj

== Introducing a Rapid Prototyping Phase in ADDIE ==
 
For best results, the development process for CD-ROM or Web-based training programs should use a modified ADDIE model, which borrows from the most valuable aspects of the systemic approach. Specifically, a rapid prototype phase is inserted after, or as an extension of, the design phase. A rapid prototype is simply a quickly assembled module that can be tested with the student audience early in the ISD process. The evaluation typically looks at things like how well the learners responded to the creative metaphor, how effective the learning activities are, and how well the program performs on the chosen technology platform. Based on the feedback, the design can be revised and another prototype developed. This iterative process continues until there is agreement and confidence in the prototype.

In this process, only after the prototype is completed is additional development work done. However, this work often moves more quickly after a rapid prototype than in the traditional ADDIE model. Instructional designers and writers are able to proceed more efficiently since they know exactly what the program will look like and what it will be capable of doing. Additionally, with all of the major technical issues resolved, final programming becomes a simple matter of assembly of media components.

:Other than being a bit salty, fish sauce is good for you. Fish contain omega-3 fatty acids. This isn't like eating a blackened hot dog.
::Other animal products are also good for you. The question, I think, still stands.
:::Mix vegetable broth with a touch of soy sauce. A vegetable broth/sake reduction would be good too.

: [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce (Vegan)]]. You could probably exchange it for soy sauce or some other savory sauce like that as well... wouldn't be the same, but it's a start. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:43, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

== What is a System ==

{{SideBox|Key words: &lt;br&gt;'''entities'''&lt;br&gt; '''connection'''}}

A system, S, is viewed as a whole made up of many parts or subsystems which are interconnected. To be considered as a system, S MUST have one or more objectives. In turn, each subsystem may itself be viewed as a system, leading to a hierarchy of systems (or subsystems).
The system's parts are working together as a whole to accomplish the system's objective(s) by performing certain tasks. Ex. a computer. A system can also be defined as separate bodies coming together to form a system.

Keywords: system, subsystem, interconnection, objective

== Systems Approach ==

The systems approach developed out of the 1950s and 1960s focus on language laboratories, teaching machines, programmed instruction, multimedia presentations and the use of the computer in instruction. Most systems approaches are similar to computer flow charts with steps that the designer moves through during the development of instruction. Rooted in the military and business world, the systems approach involved setting goals and objectives, analyzing resources, devising a plan of action and continuous evaluation/modification of the program. (Saettler, 1990)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this catalogue the term &quot;stamp&quot; should be interpreted broadly to include, among other things,  any label designed and issued for use in payment of postal, revenue or related charges. 

Several present day postal administrations have sold their stamp issuing activities to agencies who have abused their right to design, print and distribute stamps.  It is not our role to pass judgement on these activities, but we need to make note of those judgements that have been made by others when we deal with these issues.

Other stamps were issued by governments in exile, pressure groups, political parties and organizations.  These stamps are often, but not always, propaganda labels that were never actually used to pay for postal charges.  It is important to document these and the numerous forgeries that have been produced over the years so that a collector who encounters this material will know exactly what he has.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Notating chess games is important to any chess student, since it allows them to review their strategy and that of their opponent, to read of classic chess encounters, and follow how the game developed. Further, chess puzzles are often set in magazines, newspapers and online, and their solutions are notated; for an example, see [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/chess/ The Times Chess].

== Algebraic notation ==

A very common nomenclature for chess games is [[Chess/Algebraic notation|algebraic notation]]. There are several older systems of notation, but these are less common. 

In algebraic notation, we use 
*'''R''' for a rook;
*'''N''' for a knight;
*'''B''' for a bishop;
*'''K''' for a king;
*'''Q''' for a queen;
*'''no letter''' for a pawn.

Sometimes a pictorial language-independent notation is used, in which a picture of a horse might represent a knight, and so on.

Each square on a chess board is given by a coordinate, much like a map or a planar graph. The ''ranks'' (rows) are indexed with Arabic numerals 1 through 8, and the ''files'' (columns) are indexed with Latin letters “a” through “h.” A square’s coordinate is denoted as its file index followed by its rank index. For example, in the board below, black’s king is on the square '''d5'''.

If black moves his king to, say, '''d6''', the move is notated as '''Kd6''', i.e. the '''k'''ing has moved to square '''d6'''.

If more than one piece of the same type could have moved to the square to which the piece was moved, then the file of the piece prior to its move should come in between the piece's symbol and the coordinates of its destination (i.e., '''Qee7'''.)  If necessary, the rank it was on may also be added, (i.e., '''Qe6e4'''.)

{{Chess diagram|=

    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| The board's co-ordinates
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

Moves in which a piece is captured, a king put in check, or checkmate have special notations. 

*If a piece is captured, a cross ('''x''') is inserted just before the destination square.  Thus, if the capture is done by a pawn, the cross is preceded by the column the pawn occupied prior to the capture.
*If the king is put in check, the move's notation is followed by a plus sign ('''+''').
*If the king is put in checkmate, the move's notation is followed by a hash or double plus signs ('''#''&quot;,'''++''',) or the word &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;checkmate.&quot;

===Annotation shorthand===

Annotation shorthand is not a notation system. Rather, it is a system of symbols for the author to add his descriptions or comments. An author notating a game might wish to highlight an excellent move, question a bad one, or indicate which player he thinks has the advantage. 

*If a move is followed by an exclamation mark ('''!'''), the author is surprised by the move's quality. 
*If a move is followed by a question mark ('''?'''), the author suspects the move may have been poor.
*If a move is followed by an exclamation mark and then a question mark ('''!?'''), the move interests the author, though it may be sub-optimal.
*If a move is followed by a question mark and then an exclamation mark ('''?!'''), the author fears that the move may be conclusive. 

Repeating a symbol (e.g. '''!!''' or '''??''') adds emphasis. 

Results are written as white's score followed by black's score. For example, '''1&amp;ndash;0''' indicates that white won, and '''0&amp;ndash;1''' indicates that black won. In the case of a draw, the result is '''½&amp;ndash;½'''.

There are some additional symbols for the author to note his thoughts on the game in general, rather than on any particular move.
 
*An equals sign ('''=''') indicates positional equality between the players.
*A plus-minus sign ('''+/–''') indicates that white is considered to have the advantage. 
*A minus-plus sign ('''–/+''') indicates that black is considered to have the advantage.

== Ambiguity ==

Sometimes algebraic notation can be ambiguous&amp;mdash;that is, two pieces of the same designation can move to one square. For example, a player might be able to move either of his rooks to the same square. In these cases, it is essential to specify which piece was moved.

The precise move is specified by designating the file (column) that the piece moved from, before the move's final co-ordinate. For example, '''Nd2''' indicates that a knight moved to '''d2''', but '''Nbd2''' indicates that the knight that was in column '''b''' moved to '''d2'''. If a piece's file is not enough to precisely specify the move, then its rank is used instead.  If neither is enough on its own, both are used.

=== Special moves ===

Some special moves are tricky to write in algebraic notation, and must have their own notation. 

*Castling king-side is written '''0-0'''.
*Castling queen-side is written '''0-0-0'''.
*En passant capture is written as if the captured pawn only moved one square. The notation may be followed with ''e.p.'' or ''ep'' to clarify that the capture was done en passant.
*If a pawn is promoted, the pawn's initial move is written, followed by an equal sign and then the shorthand for the new piece; for instance, e8=Q. Any additional nomenclature or annotation is written after the shorthand for the new piece (such as c8=Q+ if a pawn promoted to a queen on c8 and placed the opposing king in check.)

== Sample game in algebraic notation ==

If you have familiarized yourself with algebraic notation, consider this short sequence of moves. Try to follow the game by looking at the moves in algebraic notation, and the boards. 

The game has begun, and is nearing the end. White is to move.

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
| 
|= 
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=

 4 |  |  |  |  |  |qd|  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;


White decides to move his bishop from  '''d3''' to '''c4''', to check black's king. This is white's thirtieth move. So in algebraic notation, we write

*'''30. Bc4+'''

Since only one bishop could move to '''c4''',  the bishop's initial position was not specified. The '''+''' indicates the check. 

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
| 
|= 
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 4 |  |  |bl|  |  |qd|  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

White's bishop is now, unfortunately, in the queen's line of fire. Black decides to capture it. So for black's 30th move we write

*'''30... Qxc4'''

The ''x'' signifies that a piece has been captured. When black's move is written separately from white's, an ellipsis ('''...''') is placed between the number and the move. The ellipsis indicates that white's move has been omitted. 

The board now looks like this:

{{Chess diagram|=
| tleft
| 
|= 
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 4 |  |  |qd|  |  |  |  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
| Sample Game
}} &lt;br clear=all&gt;

White is in trouble now, and decides to flee to '''f2'''. His move is

*'''31. Kf2'''

If black checks white's king, by moving his queen to '''c2''', his move is

*'''31... Qc2+'''

== Descriptive Notation ==

An older form of notation you will run into quite frequently is ''descriptive notation''.  It is useful to know because older books use it.  

In this form, instead of the files being a, b, c etc., they are Queen rook (QR), Queen Knight (QN), Queen Bishop (QB), Queen (Q), King (K), King Bishop (KB), King Knight (KN) and King Rook (KR).
The ranks are labelled from your point of view so that the square e4 (in algebraic) is White's K4 and Black's K5.

To record the moving of a piece, you write the piece, and to where it moves.  1. P-K4 means move a pawn to the 4th rank in the King's file.  N-QB3 means move your Knight to the third rank in the Queen's Bishop file.  For a capture, you specify the piece taking, and the piece to be taken.  QRPxN means pawn in the Queen Rook file takes Knight.  Excessive notation is left out so that if there is only one way a pawn could legally take a Knight, the move is recorded as PxN.  Note that if a piece is specified to be on the King's or Queen's side of the board, that is the side it is on now, not the side it started out on.

In order to compare the two systems, we could look at the same game in both algebraic and descriptive notation.

{|
! Algebraic !! Descriptive
|-

# e4 e6                   
# d4 d5

|}

:1.{{Note|1}}Note here that since only one bishop can move to QN5, it is unnecessary to specify which bishop moved to that square.
:2.{{Note|2}}Check is indicated by &quot;ch&quot;.

== Coordinate Notation ==
A different type of notation uses only the squares that the pieces were on to denote movements. For example, to denote the earlier 7 moves, the following notes are shown:
#e2-e4 e7-e6
#d2-d4 d7-d5
#b1-c3 f8-b4
#f1-b5+ c8-d7
#b5xd7+ d8xd7
#g1-e2 d5xe4
#0-0

== ICCF numerical notation ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
{{ICCF chess|=
 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 7 |  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |=
 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 4 |  |  |  |  |  |qd|  |  |=
 3 |  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |  |=
 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
 1 |  |  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |=
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
| desc = Sample Game
}}
&lt;/div&gt;

A move is denoted by the file (1 to 8) and rank (1 to 8) of its starting square followed by its destination square (from 11 at the White queen’s rook square to 88 at the Black king’s rook square). &quot;1. e4&quot; is denoted as &quot;1. 5254&quot; in ICCF notation. Unlike other notations, ICCF notation does not make apparent when castling, check, checkmate, and capture took place (castling king side is 5171 for white and 5878 for black). Pawn promotion necessitates a fifth number specifying the new piece (1=queen, 2=rook, 3=bishop, 4=knight). This notation is considered to be international in that there is no dependency on piece names or specific alphabets. However this notation still depends on Arabic numerals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Guarding ==
When one of your pieces is placed so that it attacks a square occupied by another of your pieces, the former is said to be guarding the latter.
When your opponent captures the guarded piece, you can recapture with the guarding piece. Note that if you have a piece that is pinned to your king by an opposing piece (see below for a description of pins), it can only guard other pieces against capturing by the enemy king, but not from other enemy pieces, since it is unable to move or capture.

== Batteries ==

}}
Batteries are formed when two or more pieces work together. The most common kind of battery is the doubling of rooks on a file. Other batteries can be formed by rook-queen or bishop-queen.

A triple battery can be constructed with the queen and both rooks. This is known as [[Wikipedia:Alekhine's gun|Alekhine's gun]] (diagram at right) and can be extremely dangerous. It is often advantageous to place the queen behind one or both rooks as it is a more valuable piece.

== The Exchange ==
In almost any game, a player will have the opportunity to take one of his opponent's pieces in exchange for one of his own pieces.  This should however NOT be done for its own sake!  Initiate an exchange only when it benefits you.  Benefits can include, but are not limited to:

* Material advantage - Queen for a minor piece, queen for rook, rook for a minor piece, a piece for a pawn or two, etc.
* Doubling pawns - Take when taking back means the doubling (or tripling) of your opponent's pawns on the same file.
* Opening up the king's defenses - Take when taking back means moving a pawn that exposes the king.
* Removing a defender - Take when the piece being taken is providing an essential service for the opponent.
* Blunting an attack - When you are being attacked, often a well timed exchange will leave your opponent with too few pieces to keep up the attack.
* Gaining space - In a cramped position, having more pieces can actually be a disadvantage because the pieces get in the way of each other.  If your opponent has a space advantage, exchanging pieces can lessen the advantage and make the resultant position less confining.
* Improving a material advantage - if you are ahead material, exchanging pieces will usually benefit you (note - pieces, NOT pawns).  Similarly, if you have an extra pawn, trade pieces that may otherwise be used as a sacrifice to prevent pawn promotion.

| The Royal Fork
}}
Sometimes a piece can be in position to attack two enemy pieces at once. This is called a fork or a double attack. All pieces can fork, even pawns, but knights have a reputation for making especially vicious forks because they can jump over other pieces (and can attack another piece from a square that the enemy piece cannot attack, unless the enemy piece is another knight.)

=== Forking with check ===
A knight fork that attacks the king from an unguarded square is very powerful. The opponent must then move his king to safety and the other piece in the fork has no chance of escape.

==== The Royal Fork ====
A ''royal'' fork is one involving both your opponent's king and queen.  In the example shown here, white's knight on f7 has engaged black in a royal fork.  Black will be down the exchange of a queen for a knight.

}}

=== Forks do not always win material ===
If every time you saw a fork you played it, you would be making a mistake.  You have to examine the different possibilities to escape the fork.  In the queen fork on the right white has just played 1.Qd4+ forking the black king and rook.  However black can play 1. ...Rg7 blocking the check and moving the rook to safety (although white could play 2.Qxg7, taking the rook, black could then play 2. ...Kxg7, taking the queen; white will then have lost the Exchange and will be unable to destroy Black's pawn majority, resulting in a forced win for Black, a queened pawn, and a king-queen checkmate.)

However 1.Qd4 is by no means a bad move.  Perhaps White played 1.Qd4 in order to force black to play 1. ...Rg7 in which White can now play 2.Qd8+ (fork on king and pawn) Rg8 (forced) followed by 3.Qxa5 in which case White can push his a-pawn.  Here White forked Black's king and rook not to win the rook but to later win a pawn by a fork, and pave the way for his a-pawn to become promoted to a queen.  He might have also intended to play 3.Qf6+ Rg7 (forced) 4.Qxc6, eliminating Black's passed pawn.

A pinned piece is a piece that cannot move because it would expose an attack on an important piece by one of the opposing pieces, such that the capture of the important piece would result in material gain by the opponent.  A very useful device is to pin the opponent's pieces to his king; this is known as an ''absolute pin''.  For example, imagine white's king on '''e1''', a white knight on '''c3''', and '''d2''' empty.  Black now moves his dark-squared bishop to '''b4'''.  The white knight is now pinned and cannot move, because moving the knight would put himself in check, which is not allowed, of course.  White's only way to stop the pin is to move his king.  A pawn on '''e4''' is no longer guarded by the knight, which could not capture a black piece taking this pawn.

}}
In contrast to the absolute pin, a ''relative pin'' occurs when one player's piece is pinned to one of lesser value than the king, such as a queen or rook. If the benefit of moving the pinned piece outweighs the loss of material occasioned by the capture of the exposed piece (for example, if a forced mate may be achieved), then the pin can be disregarded and the pinned piece moved.

The position diagrammed to the right shows the theme of attacking the pinned piece.  In this position it is white to move.  The white player can look at this position and immediately take the rook and win an exchange.  However if he did this he would not be playing the best move.  If White did this then the material would be dead even; however, white has more pawn islands and it would be a very close game.  White can instead play Ng5!  The rook cannot move, and Black has no way of effectively defending the rook a second time in the next move, therefore in the end Black will lose a rook.  So, if you have pinned a piece, take a look to see if you can attack the piece again, and if a piece of yours is pinned, take a look to see if your opponent can attack it again. And above all else, if you see a good move, stop and look around for the best move.

== Skewers ==

A skewer is similar to a pin, but it is in a sense more powerful. The difference between a pin and skewer is the location of the more important piece.  In a pin the lesser piece blocks the attack on the more important one, in a skewer the more important piece is attacked first and when it moves it exposes the lesser piece behind it to be hit.  Black has, in a blunderous moment, placed his king on '''d7''' in front of his queen on '''d8'''. White may now triumphantly slide either rook to '''d1''', skewering Black's king and queen. Since Black cannot block the check, the king has to move, exposing the black queen to the attack of the white rook.

== Discoveries ==
A discovery is an attack on an enemy piece which is unveiled by moving one of your pieces. The power of discoveries is that two targets can be attacked simultaneously. If combined with a check they can be lethal.

Note that White's 1.Nd7+ was a ''double check'', a type of discovered check where the piece moving also gives check. Such checks are very powerful, since the king is forced to move (both checks cannot be blocked at the same time). They are also often lethal, as in the above game.

== Removing the defender ==
By first capturing, threatening, or pinning a piece that guards another, you might be able to capture the other piece for free. You can also remove the defender of a position. By using tactics you might be able to force a checkmate!

== Sacrifices ==
A sacrifice is an exchange of a piece for a non material advantage:

In the first diagram, White just moved '''1. Kh1''' to get out of check.

Black sacrifices his queen with '''1...Qg1+''' for a winning positional advantage - White is in check and can not take with his king because the knight guards the queen.

'''2. Rxg1''' - forced - this smothers the king - he cannot move because his own pieces are on every square he could go to - any check on an unguarded square now is mate.

'''2...Nf2#''' Checkmate. This queen's sacrifice was an example of a [[Wikipedia:Smothered mate|smothered mate]] (in which a knight delivers a checkmate that is caused by the king's inability to move anywhere).  In fact, this is a special kind of smothered mate, called ''Philidor's Legacy.''

A ''[[wikipedia:Zwischenzug|Zwischenzug]]'' (pronounced &quot;TSVISH-en-tsoog&quot;,) or &quot;in-between move,&quot; is one that is made unexpectedly in the midst of a sequence of moves. But not just any series of moves, one in which the player falling for the Zwischenzug feels the sequence is forced, while his opponent demonstrates to him that it certainly isn't! Most commonly these fall in between trades where a recapture seems to be the only proper means of play.

Such in-between moves often have a surprising and pleasing effect of increasing the potency of a combination beyond the opponent's expectations.

Borisenkov-Mezenev (diagram, Black to play), went '''1... f2''', threatening to queen, which White countered with '''2. Rg8''', intending '''3. Rf8+''', and '''4. Rxf1'''. But White resigned after the Zwischenzug '''2... Bb1!''' which allows Black to queen ('''3. Kxb1 f1=Q+''' or '''3. Rf8+ Bf5''').{{-}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategy Basics ==
You may choose different strategies depending on what type of opponent you are playing, and what kind of player you are.   Strategy starts with the opening, and continues through the middlegame, and on to the endgame.

Games are considered open if the exchange of pieces have opened up files or diagonals, and closed if they have not. These games are called open or closed because there is more mobility for one’s pieces in open games, and usually determine the complexity of the game.  Specifically, recognition of open versus closed games is important because closed games are more conducive to Knights, whereas open games see more involvement with longer range pieces such as Bishops, Queens, and Rooks. 

Strategic Openings:
If you choose to play a long-range, theoretical sort of game, you may want to choose a complex opening such as the Queen’s Gambit, the Ruy Lopez, or the English.  In these types of games, especially when you are playing the closed variations, you are likely to venture into close positions where positional maneuvering predominates over tactical shots.  From there, you can focus on strategic elements like controlling files, pawn structure, and other long range development considerations.

Tactical Openings:
If you are more interested in sharpening your tactical play and focusing on combinations, you may choose a more tactical opening.  Some of these openings include the Sicilian Defence (especially the Dragon and the old main line of the Najdorf), the Grünfeld Defence, and the older variations of the Two Knights' Defence.

By initiating exchanges you can always simplify the game, and it will become more computational.  If you don’t want that to happen, you have to be very guarded and conservative.

You should always be thinking about how many squares a piece controls (i.e. can attack), and which squares are controlled.  In the beginning you should aim to control the center of the board.  As the game progresses you may want to attack one flank, especially if the King has castled onto that side.

== Material advantage ==
Having more valuable pieces on the board than your opponent means you have a material advantage.  If your position otherwise is equal, you will be more likely to win.  Since not all pieces are equal, many people use the following point system to estimate which player has a greater material advantage:

*Pawn = 1
*Knight = 3
*Bishop = 3
*Rook = 5
*Queen = 9
*King = infinite (3.5 as an attack/defense strength during end game)

However, a slightly more accurate system is as follows:

*Pawn = 1
*Knight = 3½
*Bishop = 3½
*Rook = 5
*Queen = 9
*King = infinite

These values can only be used as guidelines for the relative value of the pieces; a piece's value in a particular chess position must be treated on a case-by-case basis.

===Queenside vs Kingside===

When calculating the value of a position, dividing the board in Queenside and Kingside, it will be seen that it matters that the king is considered to be worth 3.5 points. The calculation of forces on either side will determine the stronger side. This side, usually can become the attacking one, all other things considered.{{ref|Yasser|1}}

=== The pieces' relative value changes over time ===

The value of the pieces changes as the game progresses, because there is less material on the board to get in the way of some pieces.  Rooks usually become more powerful because there are fewer pawns in the way, and a rook has the opportunity to control more squares.  Bishops can travel great distances if unobstructed, while knights have a more local presence. So, knights shine when the board is cluttered in a closed game because they can &quot;jump&quot; over pieces whereas bishops are generally stronger in open games where they have the run of the board.

=== The value of the King ===

Assigning a point value to the King for the sake of deciding to trade the King for other pieces doesn’t make sense, since capturing the King is the object of the entire game! Therefore it is customary to either exclude the King from the point value scale, or assign it an infinite value. However, keep in mind that the King has an attacking and defense capability as any other piece.

The King attack and defense value changes dramatically as the game progresses. During the opening and middle game the King is a piece that needs to be protected against checkmate at all cost. Its usefulness as an attacking or defending piece is thus limited. However its strength as an attacking piece becomes greater in the endgame. In this phase of the game it is generally reckoned to be stronger than a knight or bishop but weaker than a rook. Therefore giving the King an attack or defense point value of 3.5 during the endgame makes sense.

=== Knight vs Bishop ===

Based on the point value scale above the value of the knight and bishop appears to be the same. Alternative scales have tried to assign the knight and the bishop slightly different values, usually preferring the bishop over the knight. But since the relative value of the knight and bishop is strongly related to the position, such minor differentiation provide little overall guidance. 

Knights are more powerful if they have a safe outpost in enemy territory - a knight on the 6th rank that cannot be attacked by opposing pawns can be as powerful as a rook in the right circumstances.  This type of  knight, if guarded by a pawn, is called “a home away from home”.

A bishop never leaves its own color, so if one of the bishops is captured, half the board is now out of reach of a bishop.  So trading one bishop for a knight tends to favor the person losing the knight, who is left with two bishops. However, trading the second bishop isn't quite so hurtful. So trading a bishop for a bishop where one side has only 1 bishop to begin with helps the side with fewer bishops.

Knights cannot cover both sides of the board at the same time, while a bishop can, so in an endgame where there are pawns on both sides of the board, the bishop is stronger.

Bishops cannot attack pawns that are on the opposite color, while a knight can.  Furthermore, in a game where there is a short pawn chain, a knight can stand at the head of the chain and attack the pawn supporting it, so a knight is often more effective attacking pawns as long as they are limited to one side of the board.

Finally, it is possible to force checkmate with two bishops and king against a lone king, but not with two knights and king versus lone king.

It is important to keep in mind what sorts of positions will benefit the pieces that you have.  For example if you have 2 knights and no bishops and your opponent has 2 bishops and no knights then it would be good for you to keep the center cluttered with pawns by avoiding pawn exchanges.  If you do this then your opponent's bishops will have hampered mobility whereas your knights can hop over the pawns.  Also if you have the bishops and your opponent has knights then you should play to keep the center clear so your bishops can have more mobility.  Also, this idea can help you decide on whether or not to trade a bishop for a knight or vice versa.

=== More pieces are usually better ===

Usually having more pieces are more valuable when the point value is roughly equal for both players -- two bishops beats a rook, two rooks beat a queen -- but this is conditioned on proper co-ordination between the pieces. It may be worthwhile to sacrifice two pieces for a rook if this results in long-term damage to the enemy's piece co-ordination. Usually this means tying down the extra pieces to the defense of weak pawns, so that they cannot cooperate in attacking friendly pawns.

== Compensation ==

Material values only matter in the context of position. Compensation is a term used in chess to describe the trade off between material and positional advantage. A strong position can make up for a material deficiency. For example if your opponent has all their pawns on white squares, a black bishop is worth more than a white bishop.

Typically having compensation for a piece means that an attack against the enemy's king or strong points cannot be repelled or may only be repelled by the enemy returning the material he is up.  Often compensation can refer to having the initiative or in trapping the opponent's king in a vulnerable position.  A pawn majority on one wing or a passed pawn can also sometimes be considered compensation for a minor piece.  Generally the player who is down on material has to act quickly and avoid exchanging pieces to prevent the enemy from making his material advantage count.

== Pawn Strategy and Pawn Chains ==

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Pawn structure}}

In the end game, pawns gain strength as they advance because they pose the threat of promotion, so a pawn on the 6th or 7th rank is worth significantly more than a pawn on the second rank - often as much as a piece.  However, in the opening and middlegame, an advanced pawn is less likely to queen and more likely to be in need of being defended.  It is also unable to defend the center and often leaves &quot;holes&quot; in your territory that can serve as outposts for your opponent's pieces.  An overadvanced pawn is then often a liability.

In the opening and middle game, pawns in the center of the board block paths and support outposts. So they tend to be more valuable than end pawns.  However, in the end game, a wing pawn is usually the hardest to get to and block or capture and is therefore more likely to queen.  So in the endgame, the edge pawns are often more valuable than the middle pawns (Note: this is not necessarily true in some basic pawn and king endings, where a pawn on the edge leads to only drawing options).

A passed pawn has only pieces stopping it from queening, so it is considered more valuable - especially if it is protected with other pawns.

== Tempo ==
Tempo is the effective number of moves required to reach the position on the board.  Moving a piece twice to reach a position it could have reached in one results in a net loss of one tempo - moving a piece back to its starting place usually results in a loss of all its tempo - unless other pieces moved that could not have moved otherwise.  Also the capture of a piece means all of the tempo it gained is lost as well.

Essentially, tempo is one way of showing how many effective moves you have made.  So the gain of a tempo is basically like getting a move for free.  Three tempi is usually considered equivalent to a pawn in terms of advantage.

&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
In the position above there have been 2 tempi played on each side, play continues with:

'''3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 Nf6'''

&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
Now white still has 2 Tempi (one for d4 and 1 for e4) while black only has 1.  The captured pieces lost the tempo they had gained in moving and the knight lost the tempo it had when it captured.

For argument's sake, lets assume play went as follows:

'''5. e5 Nd5 6. Bc4 Nb6 7. Qd3 Na4 8. Nc3 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 e6'''

{{Chess diagram|=

 7 |pd|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|=

    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
|
}}
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
Now black still has only 1 tempo (e6) while white has 6 (2 queen moves, 3 pawn moves and a bishop move).  This has let white develop 2 pieces, control the center and give black a cramped position.  Also, while both sides can castle kingside in the same number of moves, White can connect his rooks (position them so there is nothing between them on the back rank) 2 moves sooner than black.  Chances are, white will complete development and launch an attack before black is able to.  This means white will have an advantage when the middlegame is reached.

== Quality ==


=== Active and passive pieces ===
An active piece is one that has the potential to make a threat.  A passive one is usually relegated to defending a piece (or worse - a pawn).

{{Chess diagram|=
|tleft
|
|= 
 8 |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|  |  |rd|=
 7 |pd|pd|pd|  |bd|pd|pd|pd|=
 6 |  |  |  |  |pd|nd|  |  |=
 5 |  |  |  |pd|  |  |bl|  |=
 4 |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  |=
 3 |  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  |=
 2 |pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|pl|=
 1 |rl|  |  |ql|kl|bl|nl|rl|=
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  
|
}}
&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot; /&gt;
In this example, white's bishop on g5 is considered active, while black's bishop on e7 is considered passive.

Piece activity depends on whether it can move and attack.  A piece can be rendered passive if it is stuck protecting another piece or if it is restricted from being able to get into play by its own pawns. 

=== Good vs. Bad Bishops ===

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Minor pieces#Good bishops vs. bad bishops}}

As noted above, a bishop can only travel on squares of one color.  This leads to a situation wherein one bishop may be effectively blocked out of the game by the pawn structure.  In general it is better to have your pawns on the opposite colored squares to your bishop.  
For example, if you as black have pawns on e6 and d5, your queen's bishop is likely to be a &quot;bad bishop.&quot;  It is bad because it is hard to do anything constructive with it; developing it to g4 is impossible and &quot;[[w: fianchetto|fianchetto]]ing&quot; it via b7 is ineffective since your pawn on d5 blocks any influence it may have over the centre. 
 
When one has a bad bishop there are two methods to improve the game: exchanging the offender and freeing up the game.  
In general it is profitable to try to exchange your bad bishop for an opponent's bishop or knight, as your bad bishop has little value. However, it is important to bear in mind that in the end game having two bishops is considerably stronger than have two knights or a bishop and a knight.  Therefore you should always be wary of exchanging bishop for knight in situations where an endgame is likely.
The other method to rid yourself of this weakness is by freeing up the game through making pawn moves.

=== Overloaded pieces ===
Overloaded pieces are pieces which defend too many other pieces and therefore cannot be considered to defend all of them at once. For example, a rook can defend up to 4 pieces, but if one is taken, and the rook takes the offending piece, 2 of the other pieces are undefended.

== Initiative ==

{{main|Elements of chess strategy/Development}}
{{main|Elements of chess strategy/The positions of the kings}}
The player with the initiative is the player who is making the threats to which the other person must respond.  Having the initiative is advantageous because it forces your opponent to place his pieces in essentially defensive formations.  A piece that is defending a square generally has less mobility (freedom of movement) than a piece attacking the same square.  

Having the first move, it is generally white who has the initiative in the early part of the game.  Therefore trying to maintain the initiative would be prudent strategy.



== Zugzwang ==
A [[w:Zugzwang|Zugzwang]] situation occurs when any move a player makes will weaken his/her position, but he/she is compelled to move in accordance with the rules. An example of zugzwang is as follows:

'''2. ... Ke6''' : Black can make other legal moves with the black king, but they will yield the same result. Even if Black must move the king, this is not an example of zugzwang. Keeping the king at e7 would not yield a better result for Black, since the d8 promotion square is protected by the white king.

'''3. d8Q''' : White gains a queen and wins the game easily.

Alternatively, white can force a win by moving the king first: 1. Kd6 a4 2. Kc6(Ke6) Ke7(Kc7) 3. Kc7(Ke7) with 4. d8Q to follow


''Exercise:'' From the same initial position but with black to move first, show that Black can force a draw by using zugzwang.

''Solution:''
1. ... a4 
2. Kb5 Kxd7 (White's move is Zugzwang.)
3. Kxa4 Kc7 
4. Kb5 Kb7 
5. a4 Ka7 
6. a5 Ka8 
7. Kb6 Kb8 
8. a6 Ka8 
9. a7 	(Draw by stalemate.)

== Combining attack with defense ==

A winning strategy in Chess often involves balancing several considerations against each other. Moves that maximize immediate material gain might expose a vulnerability or yield a difficult position as the game progresses. Similarly, material sacrifices for position may be disadvantageous if they cannot be parlayed into an effective attack. Thus, a key consideration should be balancing attack with defense. A profitable move would be one that both furthers your attack and solidifies your defense.

The following is an overview of the aims of an opening and some standard openings that you can try in your games.  All of them are playable and should lead to reasonable games with best play.

== Aims of an opening ==

Before looking at some of the more common openings played today it is important to consider what you are trying to achieve in the opening of a chess game.  

In some cases, one player will sacrifice a pawn, or in some cases even more, to accomplish the goals listed below.  Such an opening is called a '''gambit'''.

'''Development'''

You should attempt to move your pieces away from their starting positions to squares in which they can participate more fully in the game.  Obviously a Knight at c3 is more effective both defensively and aggressively than a knight on b1.  Avoid moving pieces more than once in the opening as this allows your opponent time to develop another piece while you are wasting time.  Also avoid moving your queen in the opening, it can too easily be chased around the board by other pieces which aids your opponents development while wasting moves for you.

'''Control the Centre'''

The squares in the centre of the board are critical for two reasons. The first is that pieces in the centre are able to move to more squares than pieces on the edges.  (Note a knight on a3 can move to only 4 squares, whereas a knight on c3 can move to 8.)  Secondly, if you control the centre it is easier to move pieces from Kingside to Queenside quickly.  

One of the great truths in chess is that attacks along one wing are destined to fail if the centre is not sufficiently controlled.  This is because the defender with a strong centre will generally be able to muster enough defence on that side and at the same time mount a counterattack in the centre and/or on the other wing.  So if you plan on mounting an attack make sure you control the centre.

Traditionally it was thought that the ideal situation is one where you have a pawn majority in the centre, especially with pawns on d4 and e4 (for white).  However it has been shown that an equally valid strategy is to control the centre with pieces and make minimal pawn moves.  The thinking is that central pawn moves often lead to permanent positions and can block attacks.  &quot;Fianchettoing&quot; a bishop by moving it to b2 or g2 after b3 or g3 allows the bishop to keep a watchful eye on the centre without fixing a pawn in the centre.

'''Castle'''

A King in the centre of the board is open to attack.  It is generally a good idea to castle your king so as to be able to defend it more easily.  Some players will sacrifice material in order to prevent the enemy king from castling and to attack it ferociously due to its vulnerability.  Castling also has the added benefit of bringing the rooks together on the first rank so that they are able to combine in defence and attack.  Once your pieces are developed, king is safely castled, and your rooks are combined, the opening is over.

'''Protect the King'''

It is not always necessary although highly advisable to protect the king through castling. That being said, there are other ways to go about protecting the king than castling although they are less efficient and will often result in pins.

== '''King's Pawn Openings''' (open and semi-open games) ==

=== Ruy Lopez (aka Spanish Opening) ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5''' the main line continues '''3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0'''

The move '''3...a6''' works because if white plays '''4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5''', Black can regain the pawn with '''5...Qd4''' forking the e4 pawn and the knight.

There are two key replies: 3...Bc5, known as the Giuoco Piano (Italian for Quiet Game), and 3...Nf6 headed to a much more involved opening called the Two Knights Defence. 

School children in local clubs often drift into weaker variants of the Giuoco Piano, mostly out of insufficient knowledge. A few scholastic trainers have even suggested avoiding the opening, as there are fewer crisp strategic concepts compared to many other openings.

The Petrov Defence may look like a counter-attack, and very early on this was supposed to be the idea. However, it soon became apparent that the symmetrical nature of the opening produced defensive positions. If White takes the pawn, Black should avoid taking it back because of 4. Qe2 Nd6?? 5.Nc6+ which wins the black queen. The main line goes 3. Nxe5 d6  4. Nf3 Nxe4. It is considered quite solid, and is a key defensive opening against the dangerous first move 1. e4. There are a few gambits which White can try to shift the style of the opening. The Cochrane gambit is perhaps the most dangerous. It involves a Knight sacrifice on f7. Currently not considered objectively sound, its use is psychological: White dares the opponent to spend twenty moves defending against an attack, and this pressure may cause the Black player to finally fall victim to a tactical shot.

=== Philidor Defence ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6'''
{{Chess diagram small|=

If Black wants to defend the threatened pawn with a pawn, this is the way to do it (playing 2...f6? is plain bad, as 3. Nxe5 fxe5 4. Qh5+ is winning for White). It gives Black a solid but somewhat cramped position. The f8 bishop is hemmed in and will be relegated to a defensive role. The Black knight retains the option of going to d7 leaving the c-pawn mobile, but it is not without reason that 2...Nc6 is much more common than 2...d6.

=== Danish Gambit ===
'''1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2'''

This gambit gives White quick development and control of the center at the cost of two pawns initially. However, current opinion reports that to properly fend off the attacking waves, at least one and sometimes both pawns must be returned. This involves the liberating pawn push ...d5 by Black. Even so, inventive attacking players can still use the resulting open lines to play a complex game.

Play can continue

'''2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4''' (2...d6 and 2...e6 are also common, and usually also met by 3.d4)

The Sicilian is the most common and best-scoring response to 1.e4, as it balances the white advantage with flank play. It discourages White from occupying the centre with 2.d4. After 2...cxd4 White must either take the pawn back with the queen (and move it again after 3.Qxd4 Nc6) or sacrifice the pawn, usually with 3.c3.

One problem with the Sicilian is that there is a vast amount of theory written on it, and in a sharp opening like this, you can wind up in trouble if you don't know it.

=== French Defence ===
'''1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5'''

White has three essential continuations: 
3.Nc3 &quot;Winawer Variation&quot;
3.Nd2 &quot;Tarrasch Variation&quot;
3.e5  &quot;Advance Variation&quot;. 

A fourth alternative, the &quot;Exchange Variation&quot; is 3. exd5, but this actually frees Black's game from all of the traditional cramping problems of the French Defence. It is mainly used by White players who forgo all attempts at a theoretical battle, hoping to play on &quot;general principles&quot;.

The French Defence is considered one of the strongest black responses to the White opening move 1.e4. Among world class grandmasters, it currently trails the Sicilian 1. e4 c5 and the symmetrical 1.e4 e5 in popularity.

This opening bears considerable similarities to another one called the King's Indian, which begins 1.(e4 d6) d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7. However, subtle but long range strategic differences exist between the two. In the Pirc, White's c-file pawn is still at home, and not committed to the c4 square. This means that overall, White has better control of the d4 square. The pawn move c2-c4 has been replaced by a developing piece move N-c3, and this &quot;faster&quot; development tends to encourage White towards central or kingside attacks compared with the queenside play classically associated with the King's Indian defence.

This move order is often used to &quot;back into&quot; a Pirc defence, while avoiding specific move order issues. However, an entirely different range of strategy is possible based upon ...c6 and ...d5.

This looks like a rather alarming opening for Black to play. Black lets White chase the knight around the board and use that time to build up the pawn centre. Black's plan is to show that White has expanded too quickly, and will find the pawn centre vulnerable. The disadvantage to this opening is that if White succeeds in maintaining it, White will have a serious and suffocating advantage in space.

Playing d7-d5 is the main idea behind most of the semi-open games for black.  Here it is played immediately for the price of an extra move with the queen after 3.Nc3.

Long disparaged as the epitome of weak play &quot;because moving the queen early wastes time&quot;, it was resurrected in the 1990s with a pawn move c7-c6, allowing the queen to retreat from a5 to c7 when necessary. Now it is considered an attempt to reduce White's central pressure, and is popular among club players because White suddenly has to demonstrate some sophistication.

This is a general continuation of the Scandinavian Defense. White developing its pieces towards the center by 4.d4 and 5.Nf3 placing the Knight on the natural f3 square. Meantime black develops also in a simple way 4...Nf6 and 5...Bg4 creating a pin for the white Knight. There is another pin for c3 Knight - created by the d4 pawn push. Now white has to eliminate the pins - in order to make the Knights free to move. White can do it by 6.h3 move or 6.Be2 - simple relieve for the Bishop pin. After 6.h3 black Bishop can retreat by 6...Bh5 - maintaining the pin or can capture the white Knight 6... Bxf3.

Black has gained a pawn but Black cannot keep it. If White wants it back White can play e2-e3 at some point, threatening the pawn with the bishop and if Black tries to defend it with ...b5 Black will find the queenside severely weakened (and the pawn should fall anyway). Nonetheless, this is playable for Black as well, instead of trying to keep the pawn, it is best to develop quickly and strike back at the White centre.

Popularised after World War II, the King's Indian Defence involves opposite sides strategies in a race between Black's mating attack vs. White's methodical attempts to unravel Black's Queenside. 

At World Class level, there is some concern that Black's concept is very committal, leading Former Champion Garry Kasparov to discontinue his use of the opening shortly before he retired from the game.  At any level below that, it is still very popular due to the deep developmental work by Fischer and Kasparov.

Looks a bit like a cross between the Queen's Gambit and the King's Indian Defence, but this opening is played differently from both of them. Black gives White an early opportunity to grab control of the centre with 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4. Black will need to launch a counterattack against that centre, perhaps with ...c5 to stop White from getting the upper hand. If Black succeeds, the White centre may indeed be very vulnerable, if Blacks fails, the centre will be very dominating.

After 3.Nc3, White threatens to take control over the centre by playing 4.e4. The Nimzo-Indian, named after the hypermodern player Aron Nimzowitch, is one of the two main ways of preventing this (the other way is the direct 3...d5 which leads to the Queen's Gambit Declined). Black puts a bishop where it pins the White knight, and often intends to trade it off, surrendering the bishop pair but inflicting White with doubled pawns if needed to recapture with the b-pawn. White can avoid these doubled pawns by playing the queen to c2, but this costs time. On the other hand, Black has not staked out a big claim of the centre yet, and White can get a real space advantage if Black is careless.

Strategically, this opening is similar to the Nimzo-Indian. White has played 3.Nf3 rather than 3.Nc3 so he is not threatening to grab the center with 4.e4 just yet. Playing the Nimzo-like 3...Bb4+ anyway is possible (and called the Bogo-Indian) and tends to lead to rather quiet play. More usual is 3...b6 which opens up for the bishop to go to b7 where it will continue the clamp-down on the e4-square, or to a6 where it will put pressure on White's pawn on c4.

This opening threatens to fianchetto the bishop on f1 to g2, threatening a rook capture, or h3, threatening a bishop exchange, either of which would also threaten a Black pawn center.  However, this opening is rather passive and is relatively easy to parry.

It can be continued as the Fool's Mate: '''2.g4?? Qh4#'''.  Fortunately for White, the fool's mate is extremely rare, even among novices, because the Barnes Opening is passive and has no advantage over 1.f4, and because it is very easy for even a novice to see that the continuation of the Barnes Opening gives Black an immediate mate opportunity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Endgame is the last stage of chess, and arguably the most important. Even if you succeed in the opening and middle stages of the game, not knowing the skills to turn the resulting endgame into a checkmate can cost you many wins, turning many otherwise easily won positions into draws or even losses. For this reason, we recommend devoting a good portion of your study to endgames.

If you're still beginning your chess studies, the Basic Checkmates section should be enough to cover the simplest scenarios appropriate for your level. More complex situations are covered in the second part of this manual, suitable for those who already have a decent grasp of the easy checkmates.

==== Basic Checkmates ====
These include positions that have no pawns. When one side is ahead in material and has pawns, the easiest winning plan is typically to queen one or more pawns and use them to checkmate.

The situations where one has a king and queen, king and two rooks, or king and rook versus a lone king occur very often and it is essential to know how checkmate is achieved in such cases. The other cases, with minor pieces (bishops and knights) are more rare and more difficult to perform, but nonetheless are covered here for completeness.

When people think of hobbies, certain things come to mind, like stamp collecting, painting, or knitting. Few people, however, think of beekeeping. After all, who wants to be responsible for literally thousand of creepy, crawly, flying insects that are known to have the ability to sting? Well if you are reading this [[Main Page| Wiki book]], chances are you do.

Keeping bees, when properly done, can be a unique and highly rewarding pastime. Not only can beekeeping be entertaining and educational, when done on the correct scale it is also often a profitable hobby. Not only will your bees create honey and other products for you to harvest, but if you garden your fruit and vegetable harvest will also flourish.

'''Beekeeping, despite the many misconceptions, is a safe and easy hobby to start. It is a good hobby to start with family or friends.''' 

==Benefits of Beekeeping==
===Honey===
Man has been motivated to keep bees because of the reward of honey. Honey was the primary sweetener before store bought sugar was available to the masses, and honey is likely the main draw for many beekeepers. Large quantities of honey is produced by certain types of bees, called the honey bees; certain other types of bees such as the stingless bees (i.e. Melipona beecheii) produce moderate amounts of honey. Other types of bees such as bumblebees, and solitary bees do not produce honey.

As any beekeeper that has had at least one good harvest can tell you, there is no other honey that can even compare with that which comes from your own hive. Also, depending on the plants that are used by the bees, the honey you make can have its own distinct flavour. Since you are able to grow your own plants in the vicinity, or even move the hive to another location that has other plants, you can produce honey with different types of flavour.

Depending on location, weather and the experience of the individual beekeeper, it is not unheard of to harvest an excess of 100 pounds of pure honey. This means, for the more entrepreneurial-minded beekeeper, that there would be plenty of honey to sell. Depending on the market available per region this could mean a great deal of profit. In example, in the Midwestern United States honey sells for approximately four dollars a pound in bulk; this could mean as much as $400 gross revenue from a single healthy hive.

===Pollination===
Any gardener worth their weight in top soil knows the benefits of pollinating insects; having a large number in a central location is just that much more beneficial. A majority of plant survival is dependent on pollination, and bees do nearly eighty percent of all pollination, of which most of this occurs by solitary bees (not honey bees). Both honey bees and solitary bees can be kept by beekeepers, although most still focus primarily on keeping honey bees.
However, even in the event that honey bees are used, pollination is still aided and any increased pollination means larger harvests, and larger harvestable fruits and vegetables. By simply having bees one can expect their well-maintained garden to produce leaps and bounds over what it did before with poor or even barely adequate pollination.

===Improving Health===
Although no specific studies can be cited, many beekeepers claim that tending to their bees relieves stress. Some beekeepers even take a few afternoons during a good season to simply sit and watch the actions of their hives. Watching bees coming and going, with all their hustle and bustle, is quite the relaxing experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Chess, unlike many other games, does not involve direct chance such as the roll of a dice or which card is drawn. The outcome completely depends on the decisions of the players. However, because of its vast complexity, the far-reaching consequences of some decisions are practically unforeseeable.

One player (&quot;White&quot;) has the white pieces while the other (&quot;Black&quot;) has the black pieces. Sometimes the colors are not black and white (for instance, light and dark, or yellow and blue), but they generally contrast each other. In friendly games the choice of colors can be made by any method, such as flipping a coin. If there is no coin at hand, another typical way of deciding would be to conceal a black piece in one hand and a white piece in the other and ask one's opponent to select a hand. The colored piece selected will be the opponent's color. In competitive games the players are assigned their colors.

=== Order of play ===
Once all the pieces have been arranged, White (or the lighter color) makes the first move. White ''always'' makes the first move; this is important for notation, and any chess player will insist upon it. After White has made the move, Black will then make a move. The gameplay will continue in alternating fashion, White making a move, followed by Black.

===General movement rules===
*A move consists of moving a single piece, in accordance with its rules of movement, to a square that is unoccupied or occupied by an enemy piece. A player may never move a piece onto a square already occupied by another of his or her own pieces.
**''Exception'': There is a special move called &quot;castling&quot; where two pieces, a rook and the king, are moved; see below.
*If a piece is moved onto a square occupied by an enemy piece, the latter piece is removed from play and the first piece replaces it. The removed piece is said to have been ''captured'' or ''taken''. 
**''Exception'': In ''en passant'' capture, a pawn moves to an unoccupied square but still captures another pawn &quot;in passing&quot;; see below.
*Most pieces move and capture opponent pieces in the same way.
**''Exception'': The pawn has separate rules for moving and capturing opponent pieces.
*Most pieces may only make a move to a non-adjacent square if all the intervening squares are vacant (pieces may not 'jump over' other pieces).
**''Exception'': The knight can move to any suitable final square regardless of occupants of other squares.
**''Exception'': In castling, a king and a rook jump over each other.
*No player may make a move that leaves their king &quot;in check&quot; (see below).
*The player must ''always'' make a move when it is his or her turn. In other words, he or she cannot choose not to make a move. If no legal move is possible the game ends in a draw (see below), except when the king is in check - this is called ''checkmate'', and is usually how the opposing player wins.

Also, when a pawn moves to a square at the opposite end of the board, it becomes a different piece (pawn promotion); all of these exceptions are covered below in more detail.

==The board==
Traditionally, the game is played on a board of 64 alternating black and white squares turned with a white square to each player's near right-hand corner. &quot;White on right&quot; is a helpful saying to remember this convention. The light and dark squares on the chessboard and the light and dark chess pieces are traditionally referred to as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; respectively, although in modern chess sets almost any colors may be used (as long as they are not the ''same'' colors.) 

The horizontal rows of squares are called '''ranks''' and are numbered 1-8; the vertical columns of squares are called '''files''' and given the letters a-h. This way any single square can be easily identified by its rank and file, making it possible to record games by writing down the starting and ending position of the piece that moves every turn.

A chess diagram is always printed from the White player's perspective.

The movement of the individual pieces is described below. In all the board diagrams shown, the squares to which the piece in question can move are indicated with x's.



===Pawn===
[[Image:Chess_pll44.png|left]]
Pawns can move one square straight forward, or optionally and on their first move only, two squares straight forward. The pawn is the only piece that can't move backwards.

==== Capturing Pieces ====

The pawn can move one square diagonally forward to capture a piece, but cannot capture a piece by moving straight forward. For this reason, two opposing pawns on a file may become blocked by each other. In the first diagram below, legal capture moves for the white pawn is indicated with black circles.

In the second diagram below the White pawn is prevented from moving forwards by the Black pawn immediately in front of it (in the d-file) which it cannot capture, but it can capture the adjacent Black pawn by moving diagonally forward as seen in the last diagram.

The pawn is the only piece that moves and captures differently.

===Knight===
[[Image:Chess_nll44.png|left]]
The knight has a unique L-shaped move; two squares in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square in another direction perpendicular to the first. The knight moves directly to the destination square, and may jump over any pieces blocking its way. The knight is the only piece that may always jump over or &quot;move between&quot; other pieces (another exception is the castling move). It is also the only piece that can't stop at the squares it moves over.

{{-}}

The Knight is the chess piece with the most complex movement to understand. Thus there are many ways to look at and remember the Knight's movement:
* The knight moves in a L-pattern; two squares in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square in another direction perpendicular to the first.
* The knight moves in a L-pattern; one square in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and two squares in another direction perpendicular to the first.
* The knight moves in a Y-pattern; one square in one direction either horizontally or vertically, and one square diagonally in the same direction as the first move.
* The knight moves to the opposite corner of a 2x3 square rectangle one corner of which the knight is already on.
* The knight moves to the closest square to it not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.

===Bishop===
[[Image:Chess_bll44.png|left]]
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. The bishop may not jump over any piece of either color. 

The bishop is restricted to the color of squares on which it began the game. Each player starts out with one light-square bishop that moves on the light colored squares, and one dark-square bishop that moves on the dark colored squares. In the diagram below, the bishop stands on a light square and can only move to other light squares.

==== Capturing Pieces ====
The bishop captures any opponent's piece that it encounters during the movement described above, and then occupies the captured piece's square. In the diagram above the bishop may take any of the black queens. Notice that bishop may not move (jump) to squares behind or capture pieces hiding behind the queens.

===Rook===
[[Image:Chess_rll44.png|left]]
The rook can be moved any number of squares horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Like the bishop, the rook cannot jump over any pieces, except for &quot;castling&quot;.

==== Capturing Pieces ====
The king may capture any opponent's piece adjacent to it, as long as doing so does not place himself in check (see below). In the diagrams above the king may take any of the black knights.

==== Check ====

The king is the most important piece belonging to each player, though not the most powerful. If a player moves a piece such that he threatens to capture his opponent's king in the next move, that king is said to be in ''check''. 

If a player's king is in check, he must immediately remove the check by moving the king, blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the checking piece. 

In the diagram below black's rook has checked the white king. White may avoid the check by moving the king one step sideways, blocking the check by putting the rook between the attacking black rook and the white king, or capture the black rook using the white bishop. Other normally legal moves, like moving one of the pawns, are illegal in this position since they will not remove the check.   

In a friendly game a check is usually announced by saying ''check'' after the move is completed.

==== Checkmate ====

If the king is placed in check and can not escape, it is said to have been ''checkmated'' (or &quot;''mated''&quot; for short). The first player to checkmate the opponent's king wins the game. Note that the king is never actually captured, since it is obliged to move out of check whenever possible (and the game ends when it is impossible). In the diagram below white has no options to escape the check from black's rook, he is therefore checkmated.

{{-}}

====Special Restrictions — Avoiding &quot;Self-check&quot; ====

Players may not make any move which allows their king to be captured in the next move, i.e. places their own king in check. Thus two kings may never occupy adjacent squares, since they would have put themselves in check by moving there.  This is called the &quot;opposition&quot; and is indispensable when, for instance, you are using a queen or rook to checkmate a king.

The White king in the following diagram cannot move upwards or to the left since it would be in check from the bishop, or diagonally downwards which would leave it adjacent to the Black king. Also, as no piece is threatening it if it fails to move, the king is not currently in check. Similarly, the Black king cannot move diagonally upwards as that would put it next to the White king.

The diagram below shows a position where the white bishop's movement is restricted by the same rule; the bishop can not be moved since the move would let black capture the white king in his next move. The white king on the other hand may move to any of the adjacent squares.

==Special Moves==
====Pawn Promotion====
If a pawn makes it to one of the eight squares along the far edge of the board from their initial position, the pawn is &quot;promoted&quot;. Upon reaching the far rank the player exchanges the pawn with either a queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight. The player's move ends when the new piece occupies the promoted square.  

The new piece need not be a previously captured piece. Thus a player can have more than one queen, and more than two rooks, bishops or knights on the board. The player may never have more than one king, since the pawn can not be promoted to a king. In theory it is possible to get up to nine queens, or ten rooks, bishops or knights since there are eight pawns to promote. In practice however the pawn is usually promoted to a queen, since it is the most powerful piece, and it is rare for a player to have more than two queens on the board. If an extra queen is not at hand, a upside-down rook is usually used as a substitute.

====Castling====

[[Image:SCD_castle_kingside.png|frame|right|Kingside castling: O-O]]
[[Image:SCD_castle_queenside.png|frame|right|Queenside castling: O-O-O]]

Castling is a move involving the king and either of the rooks. Castling performed with the king's rook is called kingside castling, performed with the queen's rook is called queenside castling. A castling is typically done to move the king to a protective 'castle' surrounded by three pawns and a rook. 

Subject to restrictions detailed below, a player may move his king two squares towards the rook, and subsequently, ''on the same turn'', move the rook adjacent to but on the opposite side of the king, (onto the square over which the king has just passed).

The restrictions specific to castling are:

#Neither the king nor the participating rook may have moved previously in the game
#The king must not be in check at the start of the move, though it may have been in check previously in the game.
#The square over which the king passes must not be under attack ('in check') from an enemy piece.  (This would expose the king to a &quot;check&quot; in passing.)  The rook(s) may be under attack, or the queens' rooks may pass through an attacked queens' knight square.
#The king must not be in check at the end of the move. (Also applies to all normal moves.)
#The squares between the king and rook must be vacant.

The diagrams below shows example of positions where castling is not legal.

Note that the king must be the first piece moved and it must be moved two squares before it is released. If the rook is touched or moved first, then the king must stay where it is. This rule mainly applies in &quot;strict rules of chess&quot; where if a piece is touched, it must be moved. Touching the rook first indicates a rook only move, while releasing the king after one square indicates a king only move. Moving the king two squares is not a legal move by itself, and indicates a castling move.

{{-}}

====''En passant'' capture====
''En passant'' is French for &quot;in passing&quot;; you capture an enemy pawn as it is passing you.

When a pawn on its first move advances two squares onto the same rank as an opposing pawn on an adjacent file, this opposing pawn may, on that player's next move only, capture the advancing pawn as though it had only moved one square (provided the move is otherwise legal).  The pawn's ability to move two squares on their first move was a relatively late addition to the game of chess.  En Passant was introduced to prevent abuses of the new rule.

In the following example, the Black pawn advances two squares, and is captured by the White pawn which moves diagonally forwards and to the right (as if the Black pawn had moved only one square forward and been there). This move is only allowed on the turn in which the option is presented.

|Initial position}}

In the initial position each side has eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen and a king arranged as shown in the diagram below. Note that the only pieces on either side which can initially move are the pawns and knights.

Beginners often set up the board incorrectly; it is a complex position to remember. The following mnemonics may help you remember where the pieces go.

*'''White on the Right''' It is important that the bottom-right-hand square is light-colored.
*'''Knights live in castles''' One knight is placed next to each rook (rooks look like the towers of a castle, and are sometimes [incorrectly] even ''called'' castles.)
*'''Queens on their color''' OR '''The dress matches the shoes''' The White Queen goes on a White Square, Black Queen goes on a Black Square
*'''Bishops are advisers to the Royalty''' Bishops surround the King and Queen.
*'''White King on the Right''' From the White Player's perspective, both Kings are on the right, and from the Black Player's perspective, the Kings are on the left.

If the ranks and files are printed on the board, the following rules may be helpful:
* White's pieces should be placed on the 1st and 2nd rank, and Black's pieces should be placed on the 7th and 8th rank. 
* The Queens should be positioned on the d-file (''D for Dame''). 
{{-}}

==Conclusion of the game==
Play continues to alternate between White and Black until one of the following outcomes is reached:

===Winning and losing===
*One player's king is checkmated. The game is lost by that player.
*In a competitive game, one player runs out of time. The game is lost by that player (with two important exceptions, see draws below).
*One player resigns, which is equivalent to quitting the game. A player may resign on either his or his opponent's turn. Resignation is often symbolized by the resigning player tipping over his king.

===Draws===
*The player whose turn it is has been ''stalemated'', meaning that he has no legal move and is not in check.
*The players agree to draw the game. Either player may offer a draw to his opponent upon completion of his move. If the offer is accepted, the game is drawn. Draw offers cannot be rescinded.  However, they can be rejected, in which case the game must go on.
*A player successfully claims that the game is a draw under one of the following criteria:
**If the exact same position occurs or will occur three times with the same player to move, the player on move may claim a draw by threefold repetition. Note that the same set of moves must be available for each player (including castling and ''en passant'').
**50 moves have been played by each player, no pawn has moved, and no piece was captured.
**His opponent does not have sufficient material to checkmate him by any legal sequence of moves.
**Both players have run out of time in a competitive game.
**One player has run out of time in a competitive game, but his opponent does not have sufficient pieces to checkmate him by any legal sequence of moves.

{{-}}

The diagrams above shows example of some of the draw rules:
* Stalemate: Black is stalemated since he can not move his pawn or his king without placing himself in self-check.
* Same position three times: Black has checked white, and can continue to check white forever by moving the rook back and forth between f2 and f1. The same position will thus occur again and again. 
* 50 move rule: White has material advantage and enough material to mate, but if black plays correctly black will use his bishop to avoid being mated forever (and at least for 50 moves by each player).  
* Not sufficient material to mate: White has material advantage, but not sufficient material to mate.

==Chess Etiquette==
Generally, chess games at tournaments are conducted under the following rules:
*'''Touch move''' - If a player touches his own piece, he must move it, and if a player touches an opponents piece, he must capture it (unless the capture is not possible).  If he releases a piece on a square, the move is completed and can't be taken back. If you need to center a piece on its square, it is traditional to say ''j'adoube'' (I adjust).
*'''Be silent when your opponent is on the move''' - You can only adjust pieces, offer a draw, or claim a draw when it is your turn to move.

A friendly game may be played in any way that is mutually agreeable.  Generally it is considerate to avoid distracting your opponent.

==Glossary==
&lt;!--It's just a coincidence that these are in alphabetical order. If you would like to add terms, please put them in such an order so that it would make sense only by reading straight down with more basic series of terms at the top. Terms for which it is unnecessary to read other definitions, please place them at the bottom in alphabetical order.--&gt;
*'''Capture''' - To move one's piece into the same square as one of one's opponent's pieces.  The opponent's piece is removed from the board.
*'''Check''' - The king is 'in check' when it is being attacked by an enemy piece.
*'''Checkmate''' - The player whose turn it is can make no legal move to get his king out of check.
*'''Stalemate''' - The player whose turn it is can make no legal move, but the king is not in check.

Keep it and the language you use SIMPLE, as this meant to a beginner's book to learn Finnish. So avoid any linguistic terminology such as agglutinated form, because it could easily confuse the reader. If you need to give reader terminology, explain it. Also keep any Finnish in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; so that the reader can see that is Finnish. [[User:159753|159753]] 20:26, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Merger Proposal Rejected==

The reason is that the other two books, Suomen Kieli Ulkomaaliasille and Suomen Kieli Käyttöön are translations from the Finnish Wikibooks of the same names (the translations being at present in in English and Russian, although some pages are being developed first in English or Russian and will be moved into Finnish later. Because this is rather a complex process, the names of the pages and the books have been kept the same in the two versions making it easy to switch between the various language versions by changing the URL from fi.wikibooks... to en.wikibooks.. and ru.wikibooks.  It is therefore impractical to merge the books whilst this process is in development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep bees wherever one lives. Because of this, if bees are still desired, solitary bees are an option. There exist solitary bees that are native to most regions of the world.
In this classification of bees, there is no [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]], and therefore every female is fertile. There are no [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker]] bees for these species, as essentially laying females act as both a worker and queen in and of her self. Solitary bees typically don’t produce honey or beeswax on a harvestable scale.

Solitary bees are especially important as pollinators as many feral social bees are in danger, due to dwindling numbers and parasites.

==Bee Types==
===Mason Bees===
The term &quot;mason bee&quot; describes a solitary bee that lays their egg within a hole and separates that egg with mud, resin, leaf bits, pebbles, or chewed up vegetation/mud.  These solitary bees typically have life spans of about 6 weeks and are active only a part of the season.  The bees emerge from cocoons when the weather reaches a specific temperature keyed to that bee's instinctual requirements.

Mason bees will complete their life-cycle entirely on their own. However, most species of mason bees will nest close together, to increase breeding diversity and lower predation rates. This gregarious behavior of the bees makes it possible to keep mason bees in some capacity.

===Blue Orchard Bees===
&lt;small&gt;(Osmia)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The blue orchard bee, a spring mason bee, is opportunistic when it comes to its home and nesting site. Blue orchard bees lay their eggs in holes which they do not bore themselves. Rather they depend on preexisting holes to lay eggs. When preparing a nest site, the female bee will place a dab of mud at the end of the nest. The bee then begins to place up to twenty-thirty loads of nectar and pollen at the end of the tube. Once sufficient food has been collected, an egg is laid and she then seals that segment of the nest with a thin mud plug. This process is repeated for the length of the hole until she places an extra thick mud plug at the end to prevent pests from entering her nesting eggs.

Blue orchard bees are fantastic pollinators of early spring plants and fruit trees.  Blue orchard bees are high-speed flyers, and will pollinate many flowers in a short period of time. The bee’s high rate of activity, even during poorer weather, makes it an attractive pollinator for early crops. Much like honey bees, blue orchard bees will gather nectar in their honey sack as they forage. Any collected nectar is eaten directly by the foraging bee or saved as provisions for its nest. However, unlike honey bees, blue orchard bees do not have modified hind legs to store and carry pollen, rather pollen is collected within rows of stiff hairs that are located beneath the abdomen.  The pollen tends to fall off on every flower they touch.  As a result, they can pollinate about 2,000 flowers a day in comparison to the honey bee's 15 flowers a day.

The blue orchard bee may appear black in appearance, but is actually a dark metallic greenish blue color. Because these bees look strikingly similar to common flies, be sure to identify them before dismissing them. The female is about half an inch in length, the smaller male is more slender and of a stouter&lt;ref&gt;The word 'Stouter' refers more to width than length.  A better wording is needed here.&lt;/ref&gt; length. Males can be distinguished from females because of their long antennae and the existence of a light colored hair on the front of their head. 

There are two subspecies, ''Osmia lignaria propinqua'' (west of the Rockies) and ''Osmia lignaria lignaria'' (east of the Rockies).

===Hornfaced Bee===
''Osmia cornifrons''

Introduced to the US in 1984 as a gift from Japan.  Dr. Batra sent the cocoons of the Hornfaced Bee throughout the US.  This was before there were US restrictions on introducing invasive species.  As a result, the hornfaced bee, or the Japanese Orchard Bee (JOB's) are now a naturalized insect in the US.

There are many orchards using this pollinator, predominantly in the Wisconsin and NE states of the US.

It is extremely similar in characteristics to the Blue Orchard Bee, or BOB.

===Leaf Cutter Bees===
===Carpenter Bees===

==Attracting Solitary Bees==
===Plants===
Typically, most plants which are considered [[Beekeeping/Good Bee Plants| good]] for honeybees is considered proper for solitary bees. Most of these will be to late in the lifespan for masonbees, as they live only about one month as active pollinators. That is especially during early blooming fruit. Different species of mason bees will pollinate plants.  For example, the blue orchard bee exists only in the spring and pollinates fruit trees or virtually anything blooming at that period.  Other mason bees, like the leaf cutter bee which flies at 85 degrees pollinates plants later in the season like alfalfa.  Solitary bees often tend to start forage earlier in the morning (and earlier in the spring !!!), and thereby may pollinate some plants better. Some plants may be visited more often or more efficiently by differing types of bees, therefore a bee variety means better pollination.

===Building Solitary Bee Houses===
[[Image:Solitary bee house.jpg|thumb|right| Solitary Bee House]]
A solitary bee house for blue orchard or hornfaced bees can easily be built from scraps of non-treated wood (not cedar) by drilling a number of holes so as they don’t come though the other side. Bee houses for masonry bees can be made by drilling holes in bricks or can also be made by filling a wooden box (opened at the front) with paper straws.&lt;ref&gt;HDRA encyclopedia of organic gardening by Pauline Spears&lt;/ref&gt; A same design of house can also be made by using stems of certain plants (like Dipsacus spp, Phragmites ) but seem to attract only carpenter bees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativeplantwildlifegarden.com/how-to-build-simple-nest-boxes-with-native-plants-for-cavity-nesting-bees/ Phragmites and Dipsacus used for carpenter bee houses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the holes is what the solitary bees will make their nests in. Each individual hole is a separate nest for each individual female bee.

*Blue orchard bees seem to prefer &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; in (8mm) in diameter holes. Holes should be drilled between 3 to 10 inches (7—25cm) deep for best results. The deeper the holes, the more females may be created.
*'''Caution''': these drilled holes are easy to build, but actually are bad for the solitary bee.  Pests (pollen mites, chalkbrood, etc.) also increase which results in the entire hole not opening up after a second season of use.  The uninformed gardener sees a mudded-over entrance and assumes their solitary bees are fine.  In reality, these holes over 2-3 years tend to not open up and are instead, mason bee cemeteries.  Using paper straws, reeds, or wood trays are already better for producing more solitary bees.  Placing straw inserts into the drilled holes is an option, but at times the pollen within the hole is so wet, it cements the insert to the wood... again making the hole useless.  Using plastic straws traps the moisture within the straw resulting in moldy cocoons. Basically one must know that any kind of artificial nesting device must be really weathered before bees are going to accept it. Whatever the material is, factory smells and tastes must be gone before using.
*Other non-specific holes may attract solitary wasps.  Smaller 1/8&quot; holes attrack aphid wasps which help the gardener reduce aphids without using chemicals or pesticides.
*Put houses facing south to southeast to allow morning light to warm the houses and encourage foraging.  Placing the house under an overhang helps the holes stay dry.  A height of 5-7 feet (2m) above ground is preferred so that the gardener can watch the activity.  Any height is fine, but on the ground increases the likelihood of rodent interference.

In Belgium, modular ceramic and rubber breeding systems are developed by the founder of these, Leo Aerts. Easy to maintain and very sustainable. Also suggested to use with BEE-O-Smell (Olfactorius) for starting populations. The properties of ceramic and rubber makes it possible to focus even on ground-nesting bees as Andrena and some Colletes, which are both also excellent pollinators. Especially usefull in hillside cultures of any fruit or veggies. Modules can easy withstand being half digged in. Experiments are running.

===Buying Bees===
Some solitary bees (Blue Orchard and Japanese Hornfaced) may be purchased locally at some garden centers or nurseries. If they can’t be found locally, they can also be found from online retailers and mail order catalogs. When purchasing mason bees through the mail they may arrive as cocoons within a cardboard tube.  If purchased in February or later, ensure they are transported with cooling packs as you don't want your bees emerging mid-transit.  The cocoons should be kept in your crisper drawer in the refrigerator until the outside weather is about 55 degrees F (12 degrees Celsius) and pollen is available.

[[Image:Habanero.jpg|thumb|right|Habanero]]
A '''habanero''' (not habañero) is an unbelievably hot [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], often rated between 200,000 to 300,000 Scoville heat units. Although not eaten by most, there is a niche for habaneros from some of those who like hot food. Merely touching them can cause a strong burning sensation. Brushing contaminated hands on any other body part, particularly the face and genitals, can lead to excruciating pain. Particular caution should be made when dropping habaneros in to hot oil, as the steam that rises will cause irritation if it hits the eyes or other membranes.  

Habaneros, besides their intense heat, are known for their delicate almost citrus like flavor. Many connoisseurs of hot foods prefer to select smaller, more wrinkled habaneros, as those are the ones with the most intense heat and best flavor. People who are less bold, but still enjoy spicy foods, can carefully remove the ribs and seeds of the pepper and eat the remaining flesh.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I removed the statement that “almost nobody eats habaneros” Where as it may be more so rare than other foods, it is available in many super markets especially in New Mexico, Texas and Colorado. It is defiantly available for those who want it, and I’m sure availability would not be so pronounced id nobody ate them.&lt;br&gt;-[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 04:30, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

:Availability is partly because habaneros keep well. They can sit in the store for a long time. They don't take up much space. They command a fairly high price. A bit of litigation could put a stop to this. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:It needs to be made ''really'' clear that this is not like a jalapeño. Most people find the jalapeño to be intolerably hot. The bit about &quot;delicate almost citrus like flavor&quot; is pretty funny. I can't imagine that anyone would be able to notice. Peppers are used in hot-weather cuisines (Central America, SE Asia, Africa, India...) to hide the taste of spoiled food. Aside from the hotness, any flavor from yeast-like to banana-like would not be distinguishable. After eating the habanero, corn tastes like beef tastes like mint tastes like french fries... [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:20, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Admittedly they can be quite hot, and I would not recommend anyone eat them unless they have some extreme intestinal fortitude, or have a good deal of experience with spicy food. I personally did not start eating them until about 2 or so years ago, and now I can’t imagine going on without them. They however do not seem to keep well at all, I’m lucky to find one in good shape at the grocery store, and even then I often can’t keep them from getting moldy or breaking down for more than a few days. This year I’ve decided to actually plant a few in the garden, I’ll be able to see how they properly last, and I’ll be sure to notify everyone around here about my findings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bell jar lungs.png|right|thumb|Bell jar model lung]]

This simple '''Bell jar model lung''' can be used to demonstrate the basic principles of [[w:breathing|breathing]]. The model should be assembled as in the diagram. A swimming cap makes a suitable [[w:diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The cap can be attached to the bottom of the bell jar, and the [[w:balloon|balloon]]s can be attached to the Y shaped tube, with [[w:elastic band|elastic band]]s or plastic coated wire.

===How the Model Works===

The cavity inside the bell jar is airtight
*As the diaphragm is pulled down, the [[w:volume|volume]] of the cavity increases. This causes the [[w:pressure|pressure]] to fall. [[w:Air|Air]] rushes in to equalise the pressure causing the balloons to inflate.
*As the diaphragm is pushed up, the volume of the cavity decreases, the pressure rises, and the air rushes out of the balloons causing them to deflate.
*This is a great project for classes studying health or for those students learning fluids in science.
The bell jar model helps children from all ages

===More Advanced Models===

To more accurately render the anatomical and physiological properties of the lung, where the intrapleural space is filled with aqueous fluid you might want to replace the air in the bell jar with water. By filling the intrapleural space with water the model becomes a little bit more responsive, because of the incompressibility of water in contrast to air. Additionally preloading the balloons by removing water also better assures their automatic return to the exhaled position. A good introduction and overview is given by an article by T. Sherman in Advances in Physiological Education. &lt;ref&gt;'''Sherman, T. F.''' A Simple Analogue of Lung Mechanics. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Adv. Phyaiol. Educ. 10): S32-S34, 1993.  http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/265/6/S32?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Sherman%2C+T&amp;fulltext=bell+jar+lung&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bienenkoenigin.JPG|thumb|right|A marked queen bee]]
Queen bees begin the same as any other fertilized bee egg. The main difference is their rich diet of [[Beekeeping/Royal Jelly| royal jelly]] and an extended sized cell. In each colony, there normally only exists a single mated adult queen, however it is not unheard of to have a mother and daughter queen function in the same hive at the same time. There have even been recorded examples of grandmother, mother and daughter queens working in the same hive, however it is not possible to have sister queen working at the same time. In most cases, because she is the only mated bee in a [[Beekeeping/Queen Right|queenright]] hive, the queen is either the mother or sister of all bees within a hive.

==Appearance==
The queen is the largest bee within a colony. She is considered by some to have an almost wasp like form, but obviously closely resembles the form of a bee. The queen will have a longer body than any other bee within the colony, it will seem almost as if her wings are simply too short. If you are lucky the queen will be [[Beekeeping/Marking The Queen| marked]] and will easily stand out as compared to the rest of the bees. Depending on [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race]] the queen may be lighter or darker than the other bees.

==Behavior==
===The Queen's Court===
The queen bee is wholly unable to care for herself, because of this she is often surrounded by a ring of attendant bees that follow her, feed her, groom her and carry away her waste.

===Aggressiveness===
The queen bee does have a stinger, and unlike that of a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bee]] it is not barbed, and may thereby be extracted after a sting without killing her. This means that a queen is capable of stinging multiple times, however it is extremely rare for a queen to sting a beekeeper, even if being treated roughly. The queen's sting is most often reserved for dispatching other queens within the hive.

==From Egg to Bee==
Queens develops more fully than their sexually immature hive mate [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| workers]] because of her vitamin and mineral rich [[Beekeeping/Royal Jelly| royal jelly]] diet. The queen [[Beekeeping/Brood| Brood]] must also be raised in a larger specially constructed queen cell. 
===Queen Cell===
[[Image:Queencell_0017.JPG|thumb|right|Queen cells]]
Queen cells, unlike normal brood cells, are built vertically instead of horizontally. This special queen cell is often referred to as a peanut or peanut cell. There exist three main distinctions regarding queen cells and their specific purposes. 
;Swarm cells :Swarm cells are created near the bottom of the comb during a time when a [[Beekeeping/Swarm| swarm]] is likely. The new queen often stays behind with the old queen leaving with the swarm.
;Supersedure cell :Supersedure cells are created mid-level on the comb, there is likely always a few in existence. Any queen that hatches from a supersedure cell will likely replace the active queen.
;Replacement cell :Replacement cells are built in case of emergency to replace a missing queen.
===Larva===
Once the queen to be has hatched from her egg, workers cap the cell enclosing her. In some case where the queen is lost, even after the larva within has hatched, a normal cell may be converted into a queen cell and the larva can be coaxed into becoming a queen.

===Emergence===
As young queens begin to emerge from their cell, they often begin to emit a high-pitched perching sound called a pipe. This signal is thought to be a notification of hatching to challenge other emerging or existing queens. Emerged un-mated queens in most cases will quickly find and kill their developing queen sisters. 

==Duties==
===Mating===
Within a week or two after hatching, on a clear warm day, a new queen will take part in a nuptial flight in order to mate with several [[Beekeeping/Drone Bee| drones]]. This virgin queen will only have a short window where successful mating may take place. If unable to mate due to bad weather, or other consequences, the queen will become what is considered a drone layer. In nature a queen that solely lays drones means certain death for the colony, as there will exist no fertilized eggs from which a replacement queen may be raised.  Because the queen is able to store the sperm from the drones she mated with, the queen should be able to lay fertilized eggs for her 2-3 year life span. After mating, the queen will not leave the hive, with the possible exception of joining a [[Beekeeping/Swarm| swarm]].

===Egg Laying===
Once mated it is the queen’s primary function to act as sole extender of her line of genetics. In essence the queens bee’s purpose is to constantly lay eggs. A healthy queen which was well cared for and a proper mating, may lay up to 1,500 eggs per day during peak times of the spring build-up, as quick as a new egg in a thirty second interval. During a time of prosperity the queen may lay several times her own weight in eggs every day.

===Queen Substance===
The queen is also responsible for producing a pheromone commonly referred to as the queen substance. This pheromone alerts the entire hive to the queen’s well being, if absent, even if just for a few hours, the entire colony is notified and work is begun creating a new queen.

==Life Cycle==
;Day 0 :A fertilized egg is laid by the reigning queen.
;Day 3 :The fertilized egg hatches.
;Day 9 :The queen’s cell is capped.
;Day 16  :The new queen emerges from her cell.
;Days 19-21 :The queen’s orientation Flight takes place.
;Days 23-26 :The queen takes her nuptial Flights
;Days 26-30 :The queen begins to lay eggs.
*It is possible for a queen to live for up to 5 years, however she is often replaced within 2.

==Quick Facts==
*The queen bee, though always considered a monarch, was once considered to be a king bee.
*Despite her royal title, the queen bee has little to no say to what goes on within a hive. This task is up to the [[Beekeeping: Worker Bee| workers]].

Hi Karl

You best speak to [[User:Marknewlyn|Mark Newlyn]] about this, FHSST is his project, see: [http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/index.html]
I was contracted to upload the physics textbook up to wikibooks once it was deemed to be ready. Two other textbooks are on their way, one for Chemistry and one for Mathematics. 

As you can see from the [[FHSST_Physics|FHSST Physics]], not everything is there yet, and I am sure there are many formatting issues that can be improved :) Any help with that would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks, --[[User:Riaan|Riaan]] 09:01, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Thank you and 1 suggestion ==

THank you for your contributions to this physics education guide. May I suggest that in addition to the images that you add to the wiki you also add their respective sources especially if they (as I hope) happen to be made with a free software. This would allow other people like me to reuse some of the images, for example to translate them to French. Regards, Nicolas ( npettiaux on fr.wikipedia.org)

==Releasing a first PDF edition of Physics? ==

I have recently proposed that some Wikibooks are ready for a first PDF edition. Physics is a likely candidate.  The first edition would contain a prominent link saying &quot;If you wish to edit, correct or contribute to this book please click here&quot;. The idea is to use some of the better and more complete books as an example. What do you think? See:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Breeding [[w:Siamese Fighting Fish|Siamese Fighting Fish]]

The system of betta fish is based upon aggression &amp;  territoriality. There can be serious consequences with fighting between fish, especially if the defeated contender cannot get out of the reach of the victor of the battle. They have been bred to be more aggressive to one another, literally down to the teeth. Even if the loser can escape the victor, both fish have inflicted wounds upon one another that can lead the way for potentially fatal infection.
== Simple Method == 

===Method Notes===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is 
 the most efficient way as you gain more experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Breeding Notes===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all males build a nest before trying to mate. Some do it as they are mating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A majority of females do not care for the above types of males.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out the female after they have finished spawning, or when the male is constantly chasing the female and she appears very tired (Some chasing is common before breeding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Breeding Requirements===
[[Image:IMG_5515.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fish Tanks]]


The basic equipment list needed includes:

#5-10 gallon aquarium without sand or gravel
#Soft fish net to fish out your breeder bettas when the time comes
#[[w:Styrofoam|Styrofoam]] cup cut in half to contain the bubble nest 
#Thermometer - to monitor your tank's temperature
#2 floating plastic plants or other hiding places- to provide protective hiding place for unready female and fry
#Either Plexiglass, Glass, hood or light - must cover the entire tank...those that do not should be covered with [[w:saran wrap|saran wrap]]. This traps in moist humid air which helps fry's labyrinth develop correctly. 
#Aquarium Heater - should be fully submersible including cord. 25W would be adequate. 
#1 oz of brine shrimp eggs so you can hatch then and feed your fry as they grow
#Microworm culture - from breeder
#1 Siphon hose to clean your fry tank and vacuum uneaten foods before they rot and cause bacterial outbreaks, which might kill fry. Note: when using siphon hose, use care not to vacuum out fry.
#Water conditioner 
Methylene Blue (to protect torn fins from getting infected) [[w:spawning|spawning]]
Maroxy (to prevent fungus from attacking eggs)
Aquarium Salt (to prevent velvet disease)
Treat with medicine to cure, not prevent. Bettas internal organs can be damaged by harsh medicine.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Tank Dimensions:''' Height 14cm. Width 13cm. Length 22cm.&lt;br&gt;
Smaller tanks technically could work but, you run the risk of disturbing the nest(empty or otherwise) when adding or removing the female. You may damage the nest either by touching it, causing ripples on the water, or by the wind caused by the movement of your hands(less likely but possible).

A bigger tank also means a bigger nest.  It should be noted however that the bigger tank has more fry inside.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Foilage:''' Plants with lots of leaves or branches.&lt;br&gt;
This is so that the female can run and hide from the male. When she is ready she will not run and hide so no worries there. This will also allow the growth of foods that are small enough for the betta fries to consume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Food:''' Microscopic '''

''' food for babies and high protein foods for breeding parents.&lt;br&gt;
 For the adults, foods like bloodworms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp (frozen, dried, live). You should feed the parents rich foods 1-2 weeks before breeding (Part of conditioning). For fry infusoria, microworms and baby brine shrimp.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Aeration:''' A small corner or sponge filter,barely bubbling.
These bettas need calm waters else the nest will break. Later on though, the fry will need to have VERY LIGHT aeration in their tank. This is to help in breaking the surface of the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Temperature:''' Tropical water temperatures. 78-84F
People in non tropical climates may need a heater. People who live in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand probably won't need a heater. If you're not living in South-East Asia, you may also want to put a tight fitting cover on top of the tank to maintain the humidity and warmth that the betta fry need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Water:''' Treated tap water,add aquarium salt,and the correct dose of Maroxy. 
&lt;/ul&gt;

'''''Summary:''''' Bare tank + plants + warm temperature + water + (later on)microfoods
&lt;p&gt;

===Conditioning===
For a start, you will get better results by getting the pair into a condition good for breeding. You can feed the adult pair high protein foods like Bloodworms, Tubifex worms, small insects, (Adult)Brine Shrimp (Frozen/Dried/Live), etc...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

===Tank Setup=== 
Put plants in the tank in such a way that the fish can swim around it and chase each other without catching each other too easily. These plants will also later serve as a food source for the baby bettas who will eat microscopic organisms off of it. The growth of these organisms can be stimulated also by dropping a few drops of LiquiFry No. 1 in to the tank. The LiquiFry itself also consists of tiny food particles that the fry can eat. Baby brine shrimp(BBS) are also good.

===Breeding===
You know the female is ready for breeding when you can see just behind the ventral fin, a white egg tube sticking out. That is an ovipositor, through which she will release eggs. This does not mean that she is ready for mating with THAT male though. It just means she's ready for breeding.

The male is almost always ready for breeding. You may see him flaring and chasing after the female. This is normal. He most probably may have also already built his nest. If you are the cautious type and are waiting for the nest to be ready before you introduce the female, do so now.

The female, may occasionally destroy the male's nest if she feels it is unsatisfactory. If she does this, remove her and let the male rebuild the nest again. Reintroduce her after he has finished building his nest. If after reintroducing her again, she still destroys his nest, you may wish to get another female, or another male.
&lt;/p&gt;

===Mating===
When the female has chosen a male she will maneuver her body so that her head is facing downwards. Depending on her colors you may also see vertical stripes on her body. The female will also occasionally chase the male.

After some more chasing the male will eventually capture the female and wrap his body around hers and fertilize her eggs.

He will recover quickly and catch the eggs and put them in his nest. The female will stay motionless for a while longer. She occasionally will help by putting the eggs in the nest. DO NOT be fooled -- at times she may be eating them instead.

Note: Sometimes the male may be inexperienced and will not embrace the female properly. She will drop out of his grasp and leave him floating in a trance-like state. Do not bother them though. If mating has not occurred after 2 days you should remove the female to let her rest. 
&lt;br&gt;

===Feeding Fry===
Fry need very small, live foods. Infusoria is the best and is good for the first week of the frys life, to prepare a culture put some lettuce in a bottle of treated water, add a couple of drops of LiquiFry #1. Leave it in bright light. Within 3 weeks millions of infusorians will be ready to feed. Feed only a few drops often to keep the tank clean.
Hatching Brine Shrimp, you will need 1 bottle, airline tubing, rock salt, and brine shrimp eggs. Fill the bottle with treated tap water, a rock salt and brine shrimp eggs.Put in your airline tubing, and make your air flow very powerful. After 20 minutes stop the airflow. When your eggs hatch the shrimp will go to the bottom. Suck them out with a turkey baster.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

===Keeping the fry clean===
Fry need to be kept in clean water or you may end up looking for [http://bettafishcare.us/sick-betta-fish sick betta fish help], so daily water changes are a must. A 50% water change daily is fine as long as the water being replaced is the same temperature as the original and the pH is the same.Make sure your not getting any fry.

===Growout Tanks===
At 3 weeks of age the fry are ready to be moved to a larger tank. The larger tank should be 20+ gallons. When moving the fry be sure to make the temperature the same and the pH the same. Do weekly water changes in the larger tank.This is not needed with a smaller spawn.

===Jars===
At around 8 weeks the males will show finnage and become increasingly aggressive. You should remove them and place them in individual jars. Keep the jars clean and feed the young bettas frozen foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NES Programming Tutorial 1: Welcome to the machine ==

The recommended language for programming the NES is assembler, because the slow 8-bit processor demands it. The processor is similar to the early Intel chips, but lacks certain functions.

The 6502 processor can address up to 64 kilobytes of memory. Think of this as a continous space that has 65536 &quot;cells&quot;. Each &quot;cell&quot;, or byte, can store a number from 0 to 255. The first 256 bytes of this space is known as the zero page, which the 6502 can access about 2 times faster. The next 256 bytes are the [[:w:Stack (computing)|stack]]. The 6502 contains 3 general-purpose registers:

'''A'''ccumulator - all data movement, mathematical, and logical operations go through here.

'''X''' index register - used for general counting and pre-index memory offsetting.

'''Y''' index register - used for general counting and post-index memory offsetting.

All of these general-purpose registers can be used for any reason, but the reasons above are what they are ''usually'' used for.

These are special-feature registers.

'''S'''tack pointer - keeps track of the stack.

'''P'''rocessor status - keeps the result of previous instructions.

'''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter - keeps track of where the program is executing.


There are several ways to access memory:


*Immediate

Here, the exact value of the 8-bit number is written in the instruction. No memory accessing occurs. To denote an immediate, place a # before the number, for example

&lt;tt&gt;LDA #15 ; load the number 15 into the accumulator.&lt;/tt&gt;


*Absolute Addressing

The 16-bit address is stored in the instruction. Whatever at the specified memory address will be the number. For example,

&lt;tt&gt;LDA #196 ; load the number 196 into the accumulator.&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;STA 2001 ; store the accumulator at memory location 2001.&lt;/tt&gt; 


*Zero Page Addressing

Similar to absolute addressing, this method accesses an absolute address. However, this method saves a byte by only writing the low byte in the instruction. The high byte is assumed to be zero. Therefore, this method can only be used for the zero page. The following example shows the same instruction using absolute and zero page addressing.

&lt;tt&gt;LDA $00F8 ; Absolute, works but wastes space&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;LDA $F8 ; Zero Page, saves a byte&lt;/tt&gt;


There are more addressing modes, but for now stick with these. In case you were wondering about the LDAs and STAs, those are just names of instructions. On to the instructions!


The instructions are certain commands that tell the processor to do something. This may be move something into memory, add some numbers, jump to a different location, etc. There are 56 total instructions. The instructions that are used the most will be described following.


The first instruction you will learn is LDA. It stands for LoaD into A, which copies data into register A. The data can be a number, an address, or indexed address (more on this addressing mode next tutorial). See if you figure out this one: LDX. If you guessed LoaD into X, you're right. I don't think I need to explain what's LDY.


STA, the second most common instruction, stands for STore A, which stores the value of A into memory.  STA $2000 would store the current value of A into memory address $2000.  Its counterparts include STY and STX.

'''On enhancers'''

Some work will have to be done to make this contribution more sensible and clearer. I will do the work. I will help in improving grammar and at the same time help in making an expansion on the point you have raised. Enhancers are sequence elements that activate transcriptions from many, may be, thousands of base pairs up or down the stream. They, in fact, are classically known to exert preferential stimulation of the closest bitendem promoters.

All of the literature I've seen uses different terminology or spellings. &quot;prokariotes&quot; is instead &quot;procaryotes&quot; or &quot;prokaryotes&quot;.
Similarly, things such as &quot;RNA messenger (RNAm)&quot; are called &quot;messenger RNA (mRNA)&quot;. Is the spelling/terminology used in this article based on language from a country other than the USA?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Catalogue ==

Stamps are collectibles and are exchanged and traded extensively in many countries around the world.

Most postage stamps are very common either in condition used or mint (not used) condition. Fine used and mint unhinged are the two conditions most likely to be collected.

It may be hard to comprehend, but stamp catalogs exist that identify nearly every postage stamp ever created in the entire world. A collector with an interest in just one country or region may prefer a stamp catalog that describes only the stamps in the specific collecting area. For beginner collectors, a pocket catalog that identifies each stamp and lists them in chronological order may be all that is needed.


Yet it is very difficult to devine a valuation scheme in one or several currencies which reflect the true market value of any particular collectible. Therefore the following scheme is based on scarcity (and therefore value) and a basic coding is used in this catalogue:

{|
!Code:||        Number of stamps issued or believed to exist:
|-
|A||                 10s
|-
|B||                 100s
|-
|C||                 1,000s
|-
|D||                 10,000s
|-
|E||                 100,000s
|-
|F||                  1,000,000s
|}

== Inacuracies! ==

I am sorry, however, this page is very inacurate. For example, the &quot;white thing&quot; on a female betta is not eggs, but an ovipositor! As for keeping both sexes in the same tank is a bad idea. There should only be one male and on female! Multiple females will attack one male. Multiple males would need several thousand or so gallons, and the fights between them are not only a matter of tank size, but also that they have been bred to be more aggressive and dangerous, LITERALY down to the teeth! This article, as stated before, is very inacurate.[[User:Jourdy288|Jourdy288]] ([[User talk:Jourdy288|talk]]) 22:15, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

== Accurate now!! ==

I did a major edit. I'm a breeder myself and fixed it  :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphing functions can be a very tedious part of math curriculum, so the use of graphing calculators as a tool for instruction and discovery can be very beneficial.  Graphing calculators allow students to see these visual representations without having to construct a graph by hand.  This allows students more time to analyze and interpret their graphs.


The large screen that is part of a graphing calculator is also very beneficial because it allows the student to have multiple calculations on the screen to compare and contrast information.  The graphing calculator can be used to generate lists of information and most have a randomization feature that help in this creation of lists.


The following websites contain resources for using graphing calculators

Make it look like the picture on the right my foot. How am I supposed to do that? That section needs a lot more detail.

=KDE problem=

'''(CTRL+TAB) switches desktops in Linux KDE.  Need detailed instructions on how to switch between modes without using that key combination.'''

: I run KDE at home and do not recall having this problem.  I will look into it.  You can switch modes by following the instructions on this page:  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Detailing_Your_Simple_Person_2

: --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:24, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)


=Purpose of Extruding the front edges in ''Final Touches''=
I don't understand the purpose of extruding the 4 front edges of the hat.  What is being accomplished?  Does it have anything to do with the split seams from the doubled vertices?

Bturnip

: You're creating a brim for the hat.  A brim?  A rim?  What's it called?  Anyways, whatever you call the thing on the hat that's supposed to keep the sun out of your eyes.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 22:01, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: According to my dictionary it is called a 'peak'. --[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 22:17, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

== Smoothing the hat ==

If I set the smooth to the hat it looks awful, with 12 dark lines following the edges. Does anybody know why is this?
How can I get it right?--[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 22:20, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I got it. It happened that the 'spin' had the normals turned with each slice. Flipped them manually, and that's nice.
Can this be avoided when spinning the hat?
--[[User:Pinzo|Pinzo]] 23:17, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

: Next time you have that problem, in Edit Mode, select all vertices and press CTRL+NKEY.  It will prompt you if want to flip normals outside.  Choose yes.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC)


== Adding new vertices ==


I do not understand the needs of adding new vertices in section Creating the hat profile. After deleting three edges from the circle, it remains 9 edges, and from the image shown there are also 9 edges to build the hat.  


Did I miss something or '''GKEY''' combined with '''RMB''' and '''AKEY''' are sufficient to do the job?

--[[User:Miga|Miga]] 10:25, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Your not adding new vertices, more like rearranging the vertices.  I really want to know whats with this... -make sure you're in Object Mode (TAB) to add the hat as a separate object. (Note: It will cause problems if you do not switch into Object Mode)-.   In Object Mode my circle is made on the Z axis when it should be made on the x or y axis so I can spin the profile vertices on the z axis.  I stayed in Edit Mode and had better luck with this whole hat making ordeal.  And yes I'm using version 2.48

== Final touches ==

Can this sentence be made clearer? I con't understand the last part. 

''You need to be in top view during extrusion so that the cap bill comes forward and not down,if it was made from the top view''

= Keyboard Shortcut Mismatches result =
While editting the hat, it says &quot;Switch to Edge select mode (CTRL+TAB)&quot;.  At this point, CNTL+TAB is toggling between object mode and weight painting mode, a mode I had never touched before.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.7 with Blender 2.4.2(a?).

When in object mode, CTRL+TAB switches from object mode to weight painting mode. If you are in edit mode, it allows you to choose between edge, vertex or face select mode. So the problem i you were in object mode instead of edit mode.
== HELP! ==

I can't find the screw option in mesh tools!
:It's to the right of Spin and Spin Dup.  For this tutorial, though, you will want Spin, not Screw.—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 20:46, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== Invisible mesh ==

When I go to add a circle mesh, it goes into edit mode but I can't see anything. If I try to select something with a right click it flares up yellow and then goes again, leaving me with still no edges or vertices visible. So I can't make my hat! What have I done wrong?

--[[User:81.159.183.85|81.159.183.85]] 14:13, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== Oh Noes! ==

Sombody previously wrote here:
  ''I can't find mesh tools at all!''


I had this same problem, and found this page this when I went searching for a solution (so I am now updating the solution, since I couldn't find it explicitly answered anywhere else...had to hunt around to find it on the Manual/Meshes page).  The tutorials just says to hit f9 to get into edit mode, but it turns out that it may put you in either edit mode or in object mode when you hit f9.  If you then hit the TAB key, it will toggle between these modes.  In the object mode, you get the &quot;Mesh&quot; panel, and in the edit mode you get the &quot;Mesh Tools&quot; panel, which just makes you think you actually got into edit mode.   Hope this helps

== hat is flat ==

this feels like sending a message in a bottle, but here goes:

i've gone through this lesson twice now, and i still have the same problem:  the hat when finished is flat as a pancake.  i've looked at it from every angle, and yes it's flat.  so really, it's not a hat at all -- just a flat round thing.  i've paid very close attention to every detail in the instructions, and i'm sure i've done everything as instructed, but the hat has no height (or depth, of course).  please help.  i'm using blender 2.48.

== Flat hat ==

Your hat is flat because you spin the curve around the wrong axis. If you choose top view it spins around th z-axis and create a pancake.Don't push NUM7 when done with the selection, push NUM1.


thank you.  that works.  but shouldn't someone change the instructions -- or did i misread them?


You didn't misread them... I've gone through the tutorial with the same results.  I've made the necessary changes in the tutorial to include the proper views and axis information.  I am not sure if the original author rotated the original circle before editing, or if it was just one of those unavoidable situations where each version of Blender does things differently.  My update proceeds from the assumption that the face of the initial circle is visible in the view that the original author specified, that the other two views show only the edge, and that the original rotational orientation of the circular mesh was unchanged.  It's a kludge but it will work for now, until someone with a different version of blender can address whatever differences there are.

- Update:  I ran through this section of the tutorial step by step and made changes in all the references that were inconsistent, and added some more context to the troubleshooting section to take out most of the guesswork and ambiguity.

- Retraction of previous Update:  After making the changes to allow the tutorial to work with Blender 2.48a, I realized it was now broken for version 2.43 and older.  I reverted everything back and found a true fix for the situation, and updated the tutorial accordingly.

== == BIG UPDATE: == ==
After much work with many tutorials, I have found that nearly every difficulty such as these can be resolved by simply setting the '''&lt;big&gt;(i):&lt;/big&gt; USER PREFERENCES''' menu in the right way.  Newer versions of Blender (such as version 2.48) can be made compatible with older tutorials by changing some important settings:

 1) Find the &quot;User preferences&quot; window 
 2) Select the '''[EDIT METHODS]''' tab
 3) Under the header '''&quot;Add new objects&quot;''', click the '''&quot;Aligned to View&quot;''' button.
 4) ''Optional:'' For some tutorials it may also be helpful to click on the '''&quot;Switch to Edit Mode&quot;''' button.

Making these simple changes will &quot;unbreak&quot; tutorials written under Blender version 2.43, because when these older tutorials were written, new objects would automatically be oriented to whatever viewscreen orientation is being used.  Version 2.48 is set to use the global axis orientations by default, which is why object orientations are so often not aligned right when following older tutorials literally... there was no way of knowing a future version of Blender would be set up to ignore when you changed from top to front to side view.  Any time object rotations end up completely out of step with the older tutorials, these steps are your first best workaround.


== Spins in a curvy way in 2D (wrong axis) ==

When I clicked Spin after following the page's instructions exactly, I got [http://picpanda.com/viewer.php?file=2j0xf271byad2o0n54t.png this].  Why?—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 02:33, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== Hat has a weird look... ==

Once I extruded the hat's front and followed the instructions exactly, I got [http://picpanda.com/viewer.php?file=3rvxaq32ix04jcv2dgbv.bmp this].  I extruded it just as far as the picture for that showed.  And it also has these weird...things outside the pink area.—[[Special:Contributions/97.95.42.33|97.95.42.33]] ([[User talk:97.95.42.33|talk]]) 20:42, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== There is no circle! ==

I did Space-&gt;Add-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Circle and gave the properties according to the tutorial and hit Ok, but no circle appears anywhere. I see the name of the Circle at the bottom-right corner of the view. What gives?

== Questioning use of the word &quot;genatrix&quot;  ==

In the sentence, &quot;You could use any sort of mesh object here because you're about to reshape it into a custom 2D mesh (called a genatrix) that describes ...&quot; the word &quot;genatrix&quot; does not conform to the spelling of apparently the same word elsewhere in the section. Is it &quot;genatrix&quot; or &quot;generatrix?&quot; Or does &quot;genatrix&quot; mean something different?[[User:Mtjlt|Mtjlt]] ([[User talk:Mtjlt|talk]]) 11:57, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:According to my Random House dictionary, the word is &quot;generatrix&quot;.  Sorry for the confusion. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 01:01, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

== Practical Joke? ==

I believe this section of the book contains what is either an error or a practical joke. 

Unless I have misread something several times, the instructions for creating a hat on this page begin by telling you to create a circle, select all the vertices in the circle and then erase them. If you do this, it means that you have created an editable object and then erased it completely leaving you with a blank page. It makes no sense.

== unexpected spinning result ==

Hi

So after completing the hat tutorial i found a difficulty once you have &quot;spun&quot; the hat. 

I would like some clarification. Does the hat spin around the 3d cursor? So basically the center of the hat will be where the 3d cursor is.

If so you should stipulate it in the tutorial as i got a hat that look more like a vase :P


== Blender 2.61: Ctrl+LMB doesn't create vertices. ==

I haven't messed with the hotkey settings, and under User preferences, Add new Vertex is, in fact, defined to be ctrl+LMB - but doing so in vertex edit mode doesn't add a vertex.

Is there some weird setting that's messed up? {{unsigned|76.240.225.166}}

== Create a mesh circle at the cursor, why? ==

After creating the mesh circle the instructions go on to the following:

    The newly-created mesh should be selected. If it isn't, select it by clicking  RMB  on it.
    Press  Tab  to edit the mesh.
    Activate Vertex select mode.
    Press  A  until all vertices are selected.
    Press  X  to erase all vertices.

The adding and removal of the circle mesh seems to be an unnecessary step, which seems to
have no purpose. Is the circle mesh needed ?, if not why is it added and then removed ?.
This part of the tutorial is confusing and unclear.
[[User:Collectionneur|Collectionneur]] ([[User talk:Collectionneur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Collectionneur|contribs]]) 02:30, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

:That confused me too. Maybe the steps are out of order, and you're supposed to delete the circle after creating the generatrix? I'll check the history to see if I can make sense of this...

UPDATE: I get it! You have to create a mesh in order to go into edit mode! I'll put that on the page to clear things up... [[User:Serpinium|Serpinium]] ([[User talk:Serpinium|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Serpinium|contribs]]) 10:50, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will discuss some of the important elements to selecting an LMS Vendor.  Many organizations spend millions of dollars in trying to find the right company to customize a learning management solution.

There are several different sources online that tell you how to select an LMS Vendor. Throughout the search with my employer I found various resources that were helpful.  These resources provide information on defining a Learning Management System and selecting a vendor.  This section will deal primarily with selecting an LMS vendor.

==10 Steps to Successful Vendor Selection==
1. Determine and document your business requirements&lt;br&gt;
2. Research Vendors&lt;br&gt;
3. Conduct Vendor Demonstrations&lt;br&gt;
4. Narrow Down your Potential Vendors&lt;br&gt;
5. Conduct a LMS Needs Assessment&lt;br&gt;
6. Develop and Distribute the Purchase Requisition&lt;br&gt;
7. Prepare for Any Cultural Changes&lt;br&gt;
8. Narrow Your List and Evaluate Proposals&lt;br&gt;
9. Conduct Final Presentations&lt;br&gt;
10. Negotiate the Contract&lt;br&gt;

===Determining Business Requirements===
Determining your business requirements is the most crucial step in selecting a LMS vendor. If you don't know your requirements you won't be able to effectively communicate them to vendors. Here's a few important points about your business requirements:

*Document them - don't try to go from memory on what you think you need.
*First began by documenting your current state - how you conduct business today.
*Next record your future state - where you would like to be.

Consider how an LMS will help bridge the gap and enable you to meet your goals.

===Researching Vendors===
It is very easy to research vendors with the wealth of information that is online.  However, just because you find a vendor online, how will you know that vendor will meet the needs of your company. Inside of blindly searching for a vendor, the best method is to leverage industry standards or other companies with similar goals and objectives.

===Conducting Vendor Demonstrations===
One of the most time consuming aspects of working with vendors is the demonstrations and presentations. Below you can find some helpful information on making this process more efficient for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nails==

As a rule of thumb, nails should enter the second member by twice the thickness of the material you are nailing through. Example: attaching 2 pieces for 2.54cm (1 inch) hard wood together, the nail should be 5.08cm (2 inches) long. Nails come in many different types, there are CC (concrete coated), bright (these have no coating), galvanized (exactly as the name implies), sinkers, screw, and that's about it. The nail used in a project needs to be the right type i.e.; if they are to be painted over the CC will tend to bleed through so brights should be used. If the entire project is to be of treated wood, as in a deck, then screw type galv. would be a proper nail. Headless or finish  nails are for inside jobs and are designed to be set (driven below surface), and the hole filled and painted over. Nails are a metal pin used with forced to drive into a material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=System Overview=

The SPC700 is the coprocessor that coordinates SNES audio.  Once it is initialized with data and code sent from the SNES CPU, it manipulates the state of its accompanying digital signal processor (DSP), which produces the output audio.

== SPC700 Overview ==

The SPC700 has 64KB of memory for code and data.  Within this memory are memory-mapped registers, used for communicating with the SNES CPU, the DSP, and three available timers.

The SPC700 has 6 registers:

* A - An 8-bit accumulator
* X &amp; Y - 8-bit index registers
* SP - 8-bit stack pointer
* PC - 16-bit program counter
* PSW - 8-bit &quot;Program Status Word&quot;, which stores the status flags

The Y and A registers can be paired together for some operations to form a 16-bit register with Y as the upper byte.

== DSP Overview ==

The DSP has eight channels, each of which can play a 16-bit sound.  Each of the eight channels has separate left and right stereo volume, can be played at different pitches, and can have an Attack-Delay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) envelope applied to it.  A white noise source can be set to replace the sampled data on any of the eight channels.  Additionally, the DSP can apply an echo to the audio.  The 16-bit audio samples are read from the SPC700's 64KB memory space, where they are stored in a packed 4-bit lossily-compressed format.

== SPC700 memory map ==

* 0x0000 - 0x00FF - direct page 0
* 0x00F0 - 0x00FF - memory-mapped hardware registers
* 0x0100 - 0x01FF - direct page 1
* 0x0100 - 0x01FF - potential stack memory
* 0xFFC0 - 0xFFFF - IPL ROM

=== Direct-page addressing ===

Many instructions offer an addressing mode that accesses 1-byte memory addresses in the &quot;direct page&quot;.  This addressing mode yields shorter bytecode which presumably executes faster.  The direct page's upper byte is either 0x00 or 0x01, corresponding to the P bit in the PSW register.

=== The stack ===

The lower byte of the stack pointer is specified by the SP register; the upper byte is always 0x01.  The stack pointer is set to 0x01EF on restart by the IPL ROM and grows downward.

=== IPL ROM ===

On restart, the 64-byte chunk of memory at the end of the 64KB of RAM is initialized to the contents of the IPL ROM, which is where execution starts.  The code in the IPL ROM sets the stack pointer to 0x01EF, zeroes the memory from 0x0000 to 0x00EF, and then waits for data from the SNES via the input ports..

Anomie has done some tests with this register. A document on romhacking.net describes it.

|-

|}

* PC32 - Writing 1 in this bit will zero input for ports 2 and 3
* PC10 - Writing 1 in this bit will zero input for ports 1 and 0
* ST0-2 - These are for starting the timers.

  Warning: Writing to this register will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; restart/stop all of the timers.

=== 00F2h/00F3h DSP Registers ===
Writing to 00F2h sets the address of the DSP register to access. Writing to 00F3h changes the value of the register pointed to. Reading from 00F3h will return the value of the register pointed at. Writing a word to 00F2h is allowed and it can be used to simultaneously set the address and write a value to the register.

=== 00F4h-00F7h Ports ===
Reading from these ports will give you the values that the SNES set at $2140-$2143. Values written to these registers will be viewable by the SNES using the same $2140-$2143. The input of these ports can be cleared using the Control register.

=== 00FAh-00FFh Timer Settings ===
Registers 00FAh-00FCh are used to set the timer rate. Timers 0 &amp; 1 have a resolution of 125 microseconds. Timer 2 has a finer resolution of ~15.6 microseconds. 00FDh-00FFh are 4-bit registers containing the timer overflow count. Here is how the timers operate.&lt;br/&gt;

Each timer has an internal counter which is incremented at each clock input. If it equals the number in $FA-$FC (depending on which timer you're using) the corresponding counter register is incremented and the internal counter is reset. The counter registers ($FD-$FF) are 4-bit registers and can be read only. Reading from them will cause them to reset back to zero. If you don't read the counters in the limited time frame then they will overflow and be cleared to zero as well. The timer must be stopped before setting the 00FAh-00FCh registers. To start a timer write to bits 0-2 of the Control register. To stop a timer, reset the bits. Take note that writing to the control register will restart the existing timers.

== DSP Compression Format ==

The DSP plays a special ADPCM encoded sound format. The sample is made up of a series of 9 byte compression blocks. Each block holds 16 4-bit samples and a 1 byte header. 16-bit samples will get a 9/32 compression ratio, but 8-bit samples must be inflated to 16-bit before compression (giving them only 9/16 compression ratio). The first byte of each block contains the header.

=== Header ===
{| border=1
!width=&quot;40&quot;| 7 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 6 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 5 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 4 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 3 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 2 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 1 ||width=&quot;40&quot;| 0
|-
|colspan=4 align=&quot;center&quot;| Range ||colspan=2 align=&quot;center&quot;| Filter || align=&quot;center&quot;| Loop || align=&quot;center&quot;| End
|}

* Range - This is the shift value for the data. It can be 0-12.
* Filter - This selects the filter coefficients used in the decoding process. (see table below)
* Loop -This bit marks the block as one that will be within a loop. The exact function of this bit is unknown, but some commercial spc samples that I have examined have this bit set for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; blocks in the sample.
* End - This bit marks the block as the last block in the sample. The DSP channel will terminate or jump to the loop point if it reaches this block.

=== Data ===
Each block contains 8 bytes of sample data (16 signed 4-bit samples). The higher nibble in each byte contains the sample that is to be decoded &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the one in the lower nibble.

=== Decoding Process ===
Here is an equation to estimate the 16-bit output of the DSP. Let y and z be the last two previously decoded samples. 'a' and 'b' are the filter coefficients selected by bits 2-3 of the header byte.

  sample = S + ay + bz
  S is the shifted data:
  S = (4-bit sample) &lt;&lt; Range

The DSP performs this procedure using minimal basic shifting operations; output accuracy won't be perfect. It also applies Gaussian interpolation to the output.

=== Filter Coefficients ===

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hebrew is a root based language. Every verb is based on a 3 or 4 consonant root (שורש, shoresh). These letters form a skeleton around which vowels are placed to form a complete word.

== Binyanim ==

The patterns that dictate which vowels are placed and where are called binyanim (בנין), or constructions. There are 7 binyanim:

#Pa'al פעל. Active, Mild
#*Example: he ate
#Pi'el פיעל. Active, Intense
#*Example: he consumed
#Hif'il הפעיל. Active, Causative
#*Example: he fed (to cause to eat)
#Hitpa'el התפעל. Reflexive (subject acts on itself)
#*Example: he fed himself
#Nif'al נפעל. Passive, Mild (sometimes reflexive)
#*Example: he was eaten
#Pu'al פועל. Passive, Intense
#*Example: he was consumed
#Huf'al הפעל. Passive, Causative
#*Example: he was fed 

Not all roots are meaningful in all 7 binyanim. In addition, some do not have the expected meaning. Therefore, it is advisable to learn each root-binyan combination as its own verb.

== Root type ==

The roots themselves are divided into 3 types: Strong, Weak and Hollow.

Strong roots have roots in which all letters appear in all conjugations.

Weak roots have letters that disappear in some conjugations. These letters are called weak letters. The weak letters are: א alef, ע ayin, ה heh, ח chet, י yod, ו vav, and נ nun.

Hollow verbs are verbs in which the 2nd root letter is a ו vav or a י yod.  These disappear in conjugation.

Weak and hollow root types can be abbreviated using a 2 letter abbreviation. To denote the position of the weak letter, פ (first letter), ע (second letter), or ל (third letter) is written in the first position. Then the weak letter is written in the 2nd position. For example, roots with a ה in the third position are abbreviated ל&quot;ה, while hollow roots are abbreviated ע&quot;ו or ע&quot;י.

In addition to the lessons that are organized by topic, some vocabulary is organized by [[Hebrew/Roots|roots]].

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This section covers the Java platform classes used for '''basic input and output'''. But before we begin we need to have a concrete understanding of what input and output means in programming. To grasp this concept, think of the Java platform as a ''system''.

==Understanding input and output==
The Java platform is an isolated entity, a space on your OS in a way, where everything outside this system is its ''environment''. The interaction between the system and its environment is a two-way dialog of sorts. Either the system receives messages from its environment, or it conveys its messages to the same. When a message is received by the system, it is called an ''[[w:Input|input]]'', its opposite is an ''[[w:Output|output]]''. On a whole, this communication is termed ''[[w:Input/output|input/output]]'' abbreviated as ''I/O''.

The following chapters are designed to introduce basic input and output in Java, including reading text input from the keyboard, outputting text to the monitor, and reading/writing files from the file system.  More advanced user interaction using Graphics and [[w:Graphical User Interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) programs is taken up in the later section on [[Java Programming/Swing|Swing]].

===Simple Java Output: Writing to the Screen===
Writing to the screen is very easy, and can be accomplished using one of two methods:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;
|{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: Print &quot;Hello world&quot; without advancing to a new line'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
System.out.print(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|
{{XCode|1='''Output on the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}
|-
|{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: Print &quot;Hello world&quot; and advance to a new line'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|
{{XCode|1='''Output on the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Hello world

&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}
|}

===Simple Java Input: Inputting from the keyboard===
As of version 1.5.0, Java provides a class in the &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; package called &lt;code&gt;Scanner&lt;/code&gt; that simplifies keyboard input.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.3: Inputting with &lt;code&gt;Scanner&lt;/code&gt;'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
Scanner kbdIn = new Scanner(System.in); // Instantiating a new Scanner object
System.out.print(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;); // Printing out the prompt
String name = kbdIn.nextLine(); // Reading a line of input (until the user hits enter) from the keyboard
// and putting it in a String variable called name
System.out.println(&quot;Welcome, &quot; + name); // Printing out welcome, followed by the user's name
&lt;/source&gt;}}

{{XCode|1='''On the screen'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Enter your name: John Doe
Welcome, John Doe
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

Alternatively, one could write a method to handle keyboard input:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.4: Line reader'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public String readLine() {
  // Creates a new BufferedReader object
  BufferedReader x = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

  // Reads a line of input and returns it directly
  return x.readLine();
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
Note that the code above shouldn't be used in most applications, as it creates new Objects every time the method is run.
A better alternative would be to create a separate class file to handle keyboard input.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Jazz? ==
Jazz is a label that encompasses many aspects of an internationally loved art form and the culture that surrounds it. Its rich history ties it originally to the songs and rhythms of ancient African societies, which are associated with sacred traditions that in turn made way, if one looks closely enough, for the innovations of modern computing. As European colonials brought slaves to the Americas, the music of Africa came with them, leading to contributions like gospel, ragtime, and, perhaps most importantly, the blues. Jazz music can be &quot;legit:&quot; official and classically regimented, like the Gershwin brothers and Scott Joplin; it can also be &quot;free:&quot; chaotic, improvised, and experimental, like Ornette Coleman and the later work of Miles Davis. Jazz is also found in dance, art, and poetry, and no form of rock or hip-hop would have ever happened without it.

== Early Jazz ==
Jazz music has its earliest roots in Africa. Throughout the 1700s Africans were taken by the millions to the North American colonies for the purpose of slavery.  There, on plantations,  slaves would sing work songs with each other in a ''call and response'' manner. These songs still exist in the form of Spirituals today.

With the ending of the Civil War in 1865 came freedoms these men and women, most of whom had been born in America, had never known before. Also around this time, a new music started popping up around the Louisiana delta, in and around New Orleans.  Marching bands were formed, with odd instrumentations consisting mostly of brass instruments, playing music almost entirely by ear.

In the early 1900s, a new style of music called Ragtime started gaining popularity. Ragtime is characterized by the ''stride'' left-hand part (&quot;boom chick&quot; type of bass line) and syncopated rhythms in the right hand part on the piano. Famous names of this genre include Scott Joplin and &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; Morton.

Also out of New Orleans, along with Ragtime, was the Dixieland Jazz style, characterized by the distinct style of counterpoint and stride bass line.

Then, just a couple decades later, came a new style called Swing. The man most responsible for the growth of Swing in the mainstream was Louis Armstrong. Armstrong was known for playing using the &quot;swing eighths&quot;, which is characterized by playing the two eighth notes of a subdivided quarter in a non-symmetrical fashion. Below is an example of how ''straight eighths'' (normal eighths) music might be notated:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:Straight8ths.png|Straight 8ths]]

&lt;br&gt;
In the swing style, however, 8th notes are often played as though one subdivides the quarter note as an eighth note triplet and plays a quarter note-eighth note combination. This is a rather technical way to describe it, and indeed people originally thought that it was music solely of feeling that could not be written down. The first person to write down jazz successfully was Jelly Roll Morton. Swing rhythm might be notated as below:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:TripletSwing.png|Triplet Swing]]

&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes, swing rhythms are played as a dotted quaver followed by a semiquaver. This is sometimes called ''heavy swing'', and is most common in the ''Dixie Land'' style. This would be notated:

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:DottedSwing.png|Dotted Swing]]

&lt;br&gt;
Playing music with a ''swing'' is characteristic of nearly all forms of jazz, and should not be confused with the Swing music sub-genre.

== Bebop ==
In the 1940s, after the Great Depression and two World Wars, a new style of music was emerging out of New York city. Bebop sprouted out of the artists' need for self-expression. Some artists at the time were tired of playing Swing for white audiences. As a result of this, a new music style emerged in the clubs and bars of New York.

Bebop is characterized by fast tempos and improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody.

== Jazz Evolution ==
Jazz quickly evolved throughout the 20th Century. A sub-genre was Swing, which featured high energy and infectious melodies. Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller are notable leaders.

After Swing, Cool Jazz became popular, growing from its West Coast roots. One of the most popular musicians of the genre is Dave Brubeck, who with his album ''Time Out'' first challenged the notion that jazz could only be in 4/4 or waltz-style 3/4 time. It ignited a firestorm of controversy, but was immensely popular thanks to the single &quot;Take Five.&quot;

An era of experimentation followed Cool Jazz with Miles Davis leading the way. Fusion, the attempt to blend jazz and rock and roll, also came about during this time. Notable fusion artists include Jaco Pastorius and the band Weather Report. Latin jazz also exploded during this time, led by people such as Chick Corea. Free Jazz also developed during this era, lead by Ornette Coleman. Free Jazz is played without a definite rhythmic structure and while there is some element of randomness, there is still a cohesive bond between the players. Some dispute whether Free Jazz is real jazz, or even real music.

Recently, jazz has splintered into a large grouping of subgenres without one truly leading the way. Smooth jazz has gained some popularity thanks to artists like Kenny G, but it is reviled by many as &quot;not really jazz&quot; because no improv happens and usually 'smooth' songs are just vamped on one chord. Other artists are trying to blend jazz with other forms of music, such as the band Béla Fleck and the Flecktones who combine jazz with bluegrass, funk, latin, reggae, and Asian music. Fleck himself plays banjo, an indication of the iconoclastic nature of the group. 

(this should get you all off to a nice start)

== Shading ==
The shading part of this tutorial needs to be updated.  :(


== resize button-groops windows XP only? ==

In windows XP I can resize the buttongroops (actually the font-size) by scrolling the mouseweel while holding down controlbutton. I don't know if this is also possible in other OS.

== continuety problems ==

um, it says &quot;you have modeled a person&quot; but we haven't even gotten to making cubes yet!
:It says &quot;suppose.&quot; It's asking you to imagine that you've already done it.

== Resizing buttons ==

I can also resize the button panes by CTRL + SCROLL (using GNOME) --[[User:Adrigen|Aids]] 06:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

on my mac it works by holding down ctrl+cmd plus using the scroll wheel. This feature should definitely be documented. By mistake I had them magnified like crazy and I did not find how to make the buttons smaller again.

:I added zooming to the manipulations section.--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:53, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

==Images needed==
What's needed now, I think, are screenshots and VTT's for the Shading, Object, Editing, and Scene contexts.  Some of this material will eventually get moved to a later tutorial.--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:53, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

I'm new to Blender and am going through this guide with 2.57, which is apparently much different in its organization of the Buttons Windows. On some previous pages (like the one describing windows generally), there were screen shots of 2.5--which was useful. This would indeed be useful with this page, but for me the more difficult matter is that it seems that there has been significant changes to what menus appear (Render, Scene, World, Object, Object Constraints, Modifiers, Object Data) their submenus/windows. The things referenced here don't match up with 2.5 very well.

Thanks for putting this guide together, though--it's generally quite hopeful.

== Information for those using Blender 2.57 ==

As stolen from a Google result...

Buttons window = Properties window now. (Right side of screen by default)
Modifiers = see the spanner icon in this window
Link and Materials = see the round (sort of red) material icon in this window
Multires = under Add Modifier (Generate --&gt; Multiresolution)
Shapes = see the Object Data (triangle icon) in this window

The moar you know :) [[Special:Contributions/207.210.29.71|207.210.29.71]] ([[User talk:207.210.29.71|discuss]]) 04:50, 19 May 2011 (UTC)


== Change URL ==

Hi guys,

I just updated this page and noticed that the URL didn't change. This might be a little problematic on the Noob to Pro homepage where the page titles are listed according to their URL. Anyone know how to change it? --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 09:26, 25 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

I have to wonder if these are related...

#[[Beekeeping|you keep boxes full of thousands of stinging insects]]
#[[Talk:Cookbook:Habanero|you eat plants that taste like riot control spray and bear repellant]]

Any other hobbies that cause agonizing pain? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:02, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:Now that gave me a good hardy chuckle. I figure variety is the spice of life. Either way after a few habaneros, bee stings don’t seem to bother as much. As for other hobbies, I also SCUBA dive, and if not done properly I could imagine that could get rather painful. I’m afraid though that I don’t do anything like sword swallowing or juggling flaming torches, but hey there is always next year. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 15:34, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__
=Memory Mapping=
There are two  main types of SNES cartridges, the SNES community refers to them as LoROM and HiROM cartridges. Both have different memory mapping. Before explaining LoROM and HiROM though, we should define some keywords here:

$ or 0x prefix: the following number is hexadecimal. Addresses are often shown as hexadecimal values.

Bank: 64 Kilobyte (65536 or $10000 bytes), basically the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_significant_bit most significant byte] of the 3 byte address the CPU understands.
The bank of the address $AABBCC is $AA (170). With three bytes of address space the SNES can address up to 16 Megabytes (2^24 or 1&lt;&lt;24 or 16777216 Bytes == 16384 Kilobytes == 16 Megabytes).
Beware that just because the SNES can address 16 Megabytes does not mean it also HAS 16 MB of RAM (here so-called WRAM) - it will be explained in detail later. Just keep in mind that
therefore the SNES has $100 or 256 Banks (start at $00, end at $FF).

Page: 4 Kilobyte (4096 or $1000 bytes). Pages are used whenever the machine has to perform mapping tasks (for example, ensuring that address $AABBCC and address $DDBBCC point to the exactly same data,
if that's how the machine is supposed to work). Pages are also used for normal PCs (x86/X86-64 architectures) and are hence not exclusive for the SNES. A page is the '''smallest mappable unit''' of a
machine; it is not possible to map only 2 Kilobytes to the same data - you either map 4 Kilobytes, or you map nothing. You will notice that in the tables below there is no entry in which a certain memory
range does '''not''' end with $FFF - this is because $FFF is the last address of a page, and after this byte a new page begins. The only exception from this rule are the hardware registers in the lower half
of banks $00-$3F. 
The SNES relies heavily on mapping - for example, without mapping it wouldn't be possible to give all banks of $00 - $3F two pages of WRAM directly at the beginning of the bank.
One bank holds 16 ($10) pages, so the SNES has $100 (banks) * $10 (pages) == $1000 (4096) pages available.

Both LoROM and HiROM are capable of storing up to 4 Megabytes (32 Megabits) of ROM data. ExLoROM and ExHiROM are said to be able to store up to 8 Megabytes (64 Megabits).

==How do I recognize the ROM type?==

In byte $15 in the SNES header (see below for more details), the ROM makeup byte is stored.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Value  !!  Bitmask  !!   Definition    !! Example ROM        !! Example ROM size
|-
|  $20   || 0010 0000 ||      LoROM      || Final Fantasy 4    || 1048576 bytes / 1 MB
|-
|  $21   || 0010 0001 ||      HiROM      || Final Fantasy 5    || 2097152 bytes / 2 MB
|-
|  $30   || 0011 0000 || LoROM + FastROM || Ultima VII         || 1572864 bytes / 1.5 MB
|-
|  $31   || 0011 0001 || HiROM + FastROM || Final Fantasy 6    || 3145728 bytes / 3 MB
|-
|  $32   || 0011 0010 ||     ExLoROM     || Star Ocean         || 6291456 bytes / 6 MB
|-
|  $35   || 0011 0101 ||     ExHiROM     || Tales Of Phantasia || 6291456 bytes / 6 MB
|}

The bitmask to use is 001A0BCD, the basic value is $20:

- A == 0 means SlowROM (+ $0), A == 1 means FastROM (+ $10).&lt;BR/&gt;
- B == 1 means ExHiROM (+ $4)&lt;BR/&gt;
- C == 1 means ExLoROM (+ $2)&lt;BR/&gt;
- D == 0 means LoROM (+ $0), D == 1 means HiROM (+ $1), is used with B and C in case of extended ROMs.&lt;BR/&gt;

Keep in mind that some people sometimes use &quot;Mode 20&quot; to refer to the LoROM mapping model, and &quot;Mode 21&quot; to refer to HiROM, although it's technically wrong. As the table shows, there are two LoROM and two HiROM mappings which have a different markup byte than the name suggests.

==LoROM==

This is the LoROM memory map:

In LoROM mode, the ROM is always mapped in the upper half of each bank, thus 32 Kilobytes per chunk. The banks $00 - $7D (address: $8000 - $FFFF) hold continuous data, as well as banks $80 - $FF.
SRAM on the cartridge is mapped continuously and repeatedly - 8 Kilobyte of SRAM are mapped at $0000 - $1FFF, $2000 - $3FFF, $4000 - $5FFF and so on.
Because the WRAM of the SNES is mapped at bank $7E - $7F, these banks do not map to the last SRAM/ROM chunks. This memory has to be accessed via the banks $80 - $FF. '''There is no other way of accessing this memory both in LoROM and HiROM mode.'''

LoROM was established to make sure that the system banks ($00 - $3F) higher pages (&gt;7) are actually used. This is done by loading the entire ROM only in higher pages and in 32 Kilobyte chunks. 32 KB * $80 banks == 4 Megabyte.

==HiROM==

This is the HiROM memory map:

HiROM is a bit more complex to understand. Unlike LoROM, it does not use $80 (128) banks to map the ROM into the address space of the SNES, but only $40 (64) banks. Also unlike LoROM, these banks are used to their full extend, that is, 64 KB per chunk. 64 KB * $40 banks == 4 Megabytes.
The banks $40 - $7D (address: $0000 - $FFFF) hold continuous data, as well as banks $C0 - $FF.
Beware that HiROM also creates mappings for banks $00 - $3F and $80 - $BF. As those are system banks, their lower pages (&lt;8) are already mapped - but the higher pages are free, so that many portions of the ROM are mirrored four times into the address space of the SNES.
SRAM on the cartridge is mapped into the banks $20 - $3F, in 8 Kilobyte chunks. As there are only 32 banks reserved for this, the possible SRAM amount accessible in HiROM is theoretically lower than in LoROM (256 KB vs. 512 KB).
Because the WRAM of the SNES is mapped at bank $7E - $7F, these banks do not map to the last ROM chunks. This memory has to be accessed via the $80 - $FF banks

Banks $80 - $FF can also be used for faster memory access. Many portions of memory &lt;$80 are accessed at 2.68 MHz (200 ns). Accessing memory &gt;$80 is done at 3.58 MHz (120 ns) if the value at address $420d (hardware register) is set to 1.

LoROM basically means that the address line A15 is ignored by the cartridge, so the cartridge doesn't distinguish between $0000-$7FFF and $8000-$FFFF in any bank. Smaller ROMs use this model to prevent wasted space in banks $00-$3F.

==ExLoROM, ExHiROM==

LoROM and HiROM were designed to store 4 MB in a ROM and map it into the 24 bit address space of the SNES (which can, in case you have forgotten it, address up to 16 Megabytes). Usually that is enough for many games, especially if one considers the fact that in the beginning the SNES was not supposed to render a lot of later games. This is also the reason why the SNES reserved some address space for the usage of SuperFX chips that would enable games to spare the CPU - it was not intended to have the SNES play games like &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, or &quot;Final Fantasy 6&quot;, or &quot;Star Fox&quot;.

Apart from the hardware problems that the SNES was designed with, the programmers also have/had huge space limitations. &quot;Final Fantasy 6&quot;'s english script - a early draft, to be precise - was cut down to 75% because it would have otherwise exhausted the 24 Megabit (3 Megabyte) cartridge that was used for the japanese version. Expanding the ROM from 24 MBits to 32 MBits does not cause really big issues, but everything bigger than 4 Megabytes goes beyond the boundaries of LoROM/HiROM.

A huge advantage of the SNES is that it does not define how certain address blocks are mapped into the cartridge's ROM. The cartridge does take care that the addresses it needs to use are mapped properly to its ROM. For people who would like to program an emulator this behaviour imposes certain problems, as they have to program and emulate the SNES hardware AND the cartridge as well. Keep in mind that the cartridge, as the SNES, contains its own processors and microchips, which may perform differently from chip to chip. Take for instance a common problem: the usage of MAD-1 address decoding chips within the cartridge, which maps the content of the $40-7D:8000-FFFF ROM areas to the lower halves of the banks as well (so that there is no difference between $400005 and $408005 - see the LoROM table for the exact addresses). The real SNES does not have to care for this, emulators do.

Thus, using a format which allows the usage of up to 6 Megabytes of ROM space imposed no definite hardware problems, as the address decoding chips on the cartridge would need to take care of that. Two new formats were introduced: ExLoROM (the prefix &quot;Ex&quot; stands for &quot;extended&quot;, in case you wondered), and ExHiROM. To the authors knowledge, only two games which actually never officially got released in NA use these formats, &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, but ROM hacks which contain new game content usually expand the original ROM size, and might use one of these two formats. In fact, both the retranslations of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; by &quot;DoctorL&quot; and &quot;KajarLab&quot; expand the game from 4 to 6 Megabytes.

There are many either misleading or not understandable explanations and examples of the memory layout of ExLoROM and ExHiROM, for two valid reasons:

* hackers often do not encounter these formats.
* incapability to see why someone would need so much memory at their hands. *

Let's first cover the memory map of ExLoROM - we will not go into detail for the mapping of the system banks lower halves, as these were already covered before and do not change for the extended ROM formats:

Note: These informations are wrong, as I had to realize. A ROM which starts at offset $200000 makes no sense at all. Also, since it is still a LoROM format, the first ROM bank HAS TO be loaded to $00:8000-FFFF. Yet, the template will be corrected soon, and deleting it all serves no purpose.

(Explaination and ExHiROM table coming soon).

(*The second reason is in fact a protection mechanism. In case that a hacker encounters someone who wants to enlarge a ROM beyond the 32 Megabit limit, the hacker automatically assumes that this person is a newbie who has not much idea what he is talking about, and in an awful lot of occasions he is right. This, however, does not justify the mere lack of documentation regarding these topics.)

=The SNES header=
At the end of bank 0 (the very first bank of the cartridge), 64 ($40) bytes of cartridge information are stored. These informations are crucial to the execution of the ROM saved on the cartridge, as it includes the internal name of the ROM, the interrupt vectors (addresses to machine code within the ROM in 16 bit format), version, etc. This portion of the ROM is also known as the SNES header (not to confuse with the SMC header, which we will touch very soon).

The end of the very first bank of the ROM depends on with memory map it uses. In case of LoROM, the end of the first page is at $7FFF, for HiROM the first page ends at $FFFF. So you basically have to check on both positions of the ROM if the informations fit the normal header format, that is, if they are plausible enough.

Some cartridges are delivered with a so-called SMC header. A SMC header is usually written by a copier device at the very beginning of the ROM, and occupies $200 (512) bytes of additional space. Often patches depend on your ROM being &quot;headered&quot; or being &quot;headerless&quot;, as this changes the offsets within the ROM. A patch which is applied to the wrong type of ROM can easily kill the program code of the cartridge.

Creating a SMC header is &quot;relatively&quot; simple, removing it moreso. Usually the SMC header contains the size of the ROM divided by 8 KB units &amp;$FF (bitwise AND with 255) in byte 0, the size &gt;&gt; 8 (bitwise rightshifting by a whole byte) in byte 1, and the type of cartridge in byte 2. The other bytes (509) left are set to zero. For creating a header, you simply have to add a block of 512 bytes at the beginning of the ROM which contains these informations. For removing a header, you simply have to save the ROM on your HDD/SSD while &quot;forgetting&quot; the first 512 bytes.

The reason why we poke into SMC header when we should actually deal with SNES header is simple - actually, there's two of them:

1. The existence of a SMC header has to be taken into account when mapping the ROM into memory. The bank in a ROM with header will not begin at offset $0, but at $200 (512, the size of the header), and so the end of the bank shifts accordingly.

2. If there is no SMC header in the ROM, or you simply do not trust these informations when parsing the ROM, your only way of determining the type of cartridge you are trying to load in is by checking for well-formed headers at the already-mentioned positions. But IF you do trust these informations (which you shouldn't), it is a way to determine whether you are dealing with LoROM or HiROM.

Before you try to load in these informations, you have to determine the size of the SMC, may it be there or not. The length of the ROM modulo 1024 (ROM size % $400) gives you the size of the SMC header. If it's 0, there is no header. If it's not 512, the header is malformed.

The following locations in the ROM are that of a headerless ROM. You have to add the size of the SMC header to all addresses in the ROM to properly read it. x is the last page of the current ROM bank ($7 if the cartridge uses the LoROM mapping, $F if it uses HiROM).

===Interrupt vectors===
After these informations the interrupt vector tables begin. An interrupt is a signal that is cast by the hardware directly to the CPU that needs to be dealt with, if the interrupt was not masked.
An interrupt vector is a address within the ROM where the code is to deal with the current type of interrupt. These vectors are all 16 bits in size and are supposed to lie withing the first bank of the ROM. This is because the DBR (Data Bank Register) and PBR (Program Bank Register) are set to 0 every time the emulation mode is changed or an interrupt is executed.

The CPU of the SNES powers up in 8 bit emulation mode, although the SNES is mostly a 16 bit console. The reason for this is that the SNES was supposed to execute older NES games as well, so they shipped a processor that was capable of running in both 8 bit and 16 bit mode. Later, the idea of playing older NES games on the SNES was dropped, but they kept the CPU (which is together with the slow memory the weak spot of the SNES).
The idea was that games that were supposed to run in 16 bit mode would change the intern emulation flag of the 65816, and other games would run just normally.

Vectors are all 2 bytes in size and are stored in little-endian format (in case the reader did not know it - the CPU is a little endian one, which means that the MSBs are stored in higher positions. Big endian means that the MSBs are stored in lower positions). Program execution begins in emulation mode at the reset vector ($xFFC-D). Vectors which have the value $FFFF are invalid and therefore not executed.

===Some small examples===

The current section covers the initial parsing methods for both LoROM and HiROM. The games that this text is about to analyze are Final Fantasy 4 (LoROM) and Final Fantasy 6 (HiROM), both headerless.

====Final Fantasy 4====

We first look at the address $7FC0 in the ROM - the last byte of the LoROM bank is $7FFF, and the header takes up to 64/$40 bytes. The first byte of the header, IF it is LoROM (which we officially don't know yet, mind you) is therefore located at $7FC0.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
00007fc0  46 49 4e 41 4c 20 46 41  4e 54 41 53 59 20 49 49  |FINAL FANTASY II|
00007fd0  20 20 20 20 20 20 02 0a  03 01 c3 00 0f 7a f0 85  |      .......z..|
00007fe0  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff 00 02 ff ff 04 02  |................|
00007ff0  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff 00 80 ff ff  |................|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

That looks good. In the very first two lines the name of the ROM is written (since Final Fantasy 4 was released as Final Fantasy II in NA, this actually makes sense). The first 21 bytes are just ASCII characters (and a rare opportunity to see clear text in a ROM, since the dialogues are usually stored in an other format than ASCII).
The next byte after this string can be misinterpreted as just another space character, but in fact the byte at $D5 indicates that it's a LoROM cartridge (now we have two proves that the cartridge is LoROM: first the position of the header, second the byte indicating that the cartridge uses LoROM. By the way, if those two do not happen to match, the ROM is considered corrupted).

One might perform other check there (for example the size of the ROM vs. the size stored in the header, the country and licensee codes, the SRAM size ...), but for now, basically only two other bytes are essential to boot the ROM: the position of the RESET interrupt vector in emulation mode (which is issued the moment the ROM was mapped into the address space of the SNES). This vector is stored at $7FFC-D in little endian format (see above), which means that the vector is calculated this way:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
emulation_reset_vector = rom_content[0x7FFC] | (rom_content[0x7FFD] &lt;&lt; 8);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this example, the vector is $8000 - the start-up code is right at the beginning of the first bank (yes, the first bank. Remember how the first bank gets stored in $8000 - $FFFF, while $0000 - $7FFF contains system informations?).

Let's look a bit at the code there:

Hex:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
00000000  78 18 fb c2 10 e2 20 9c  0d 42 9c 0b 42 9c 0c 42  |x..... ..B..B..B|
00000010  a9 8f 8d 00 21 a9 00 8d  00 42 a9 00 eb a9 00 48  |....!....B.....H|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Disassembled (with a program that I am developing myself, so don't bother asking where I'd got it):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0x00:8000: 78      ;	SEI, disables any other interrupt. This is a crucial point in the execution of the ROM, and the CPU must not be interrupted here.
0x00:8001: 18      ;	CLC, clears the carry flag. This makes sense in the next instruction.
0x00:8002: fb      ;	XCE, switches into 16 bit native mode IF the carry flag is clear.
0x00:8003: c210    ;	REP (value) 0x10, sets the X and Y registers into 16 bit mode.
0x00:8005: e220    ;	SEP (value) 0x20, sets the accumulator (A) register into 8 bit mode. This is all possible with the CPU still being in native mode.
0x00:8007: 9c0d42  ;	STZ (addr) 0x420d, sets the memory access speed at 200 ns when accessing banks &gt;$7F.
0x00:800a: 9c0b42  ;	STZ (addr) 0x420b, disables all DMA processes that might have been started.
0x00:800d: 9c0c42  ;	STZ (addr) 0x420c, disables all HDMA processes that might have been started.
0x00:8010: a98f    ;	LDA (value) 0x8f, bitmask 10001111 ...
0x00:8012: 8d0021  ;	STA (addr) 0x2100, ... activates screen and sets brightness to max.
0x00:8015: a900    ;	LDA (value) 0x00, sets NMI and V/H count to zero and disables the joypad. 
0x00:8017: 8d0042  ;	STA (addr) 0x4200, OK, actually this is done here ...
0x00:801a: a900    ;	LDA (value) 0x00, bullshit that is of no interest here ...
0x00:801c: eb      ;	XBA
0x00:801d: a900    ;	LDA (value) 0x00
0x00:801f: 48      ;	PHA
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You see that this seems plausible enough to be totally valid start-up code.

====Final Fantasy 6====

Again let's poke on $7FC0:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
00007fc0  cd 85 cb c2 20 a5 d0 0a  aa bf 02 e6 cc 85 c9 a5  |.... ...........|
00007fd0  d0 cf 00 e6 cc 90 05 7b  e2 20 e6 cb 7b e2 20 a9  |.......{. ..{. .|
00007fe0  01 8d 68 05 60 9c 67 05  ad b9 1e 29 40 d0 05 ad  |..h.`.g....)@...|
00007ff0  45 07 d0 04 9c 45 07 60  a9 64 8d 67 05 a9 ce 85  |E....E.`.d.g....|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This seems to be a little off. Maybe it uses HiROM?

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0000ffc0  46 49 4e 41 4c 20 46 41  4e 54 41 53 59 20 33 20  |FINAL FANTASY 3 |
0000ffd0  20 20 20 20 20 31 02 0c  03 01 33 00 cd a0 32 5f  |     1....3...2_|
0000ffe0  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff 10 ff ff ff 14 ff  |................|
0000fff0  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff ff ff 00 ff ff ff  |................|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Yes, it does. And the RESET vector is at $FF00. Again in hex:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0000ff00  78 18 fb 5c 19 00 c0 ff  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  |x..\............|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And disassembled:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0x00:ff00: 78      ;	SEI, same start-up code ...
0x00:ff01: 18      ;	CLC, ... as before ...
0x00:ff02: fb      ;	XCE, ... isn't it?
0x00:ff03: 5c1900c0;	JML (long addr) 0xc00019, this is a bit different. The CPU jumps to a different location where the real code is stored.
0x00:ff07: ffffffff;	SBC (long addr) 0xffffff,X, what ...
0x00:ff0b: ffffffff;	SBC (long addr) 0xffffff,X, ... in ...
0x00:ff0f: ff5c0015;	SBC (long addr) 0x15005c,X, ... blazes is that? Well, these bytes are evidence for the programmers being lazy. Because they never imagined that 
                   ; the JML instruction - or the code within it - might return, so they didn't even bother to include sane instructions after that.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In short, this code tells the executing CPU that $C0:0019 is the next instruction to execute. Since this is a HiROM memory mapping, this means that we have to look where the bank $C0 got mapped to. Referring to the former HiROM mapping table, the $C0 - $FD banks are direct mappings of $40 - $7D. And these banks in fact contain all the ROM content continuously - since $C0 &lt;=&gt; $40 and $40 is the beginning, the code to execute is basically at the beginning of the ROM, offset $19:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
00000000  20 79 68 6b 03 00 08 08  4c 76 c1 4c 3f 4a ea ea  | yhk....Lv.L?J..|
00000010  ea ea ea ea ea 20 24 bb  6b 78 18 fb e2 20 c2 10  |..... $.kx... ..|
00000020  a2 ff 15 9a a2 00 00 da  2b 7b 48 ab a9 01 8d 0d  |........+{H.....|
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Disassembled:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0xc0:0019: 78      ;	SEI, same code as before? 
0xc0:001a: 18      ;	CLC, basically it IS the same code. This leads to the conclusion that the programmers wanted to make sure there are no interrupts enabled.
0xc0:001b: fb      ;	XCE, if this was done for mere laziness or because this procedure is called several times in the codepath, I do not know ... yet.
0xc0:001c: e220    ;	SEP (value) 0x20, sets the accumulator (A) register into 8 bit mode.
0xc0:001e: c210    ;	REP (value) 0x10, sets the X and Y registers into 16 bit mode.	
0xc0:0020: a2ff15  ;	LDX (value) 0x15ff, now THIS is interesting. The next instruction resets the stack frame. Normally for compatibility reasons the default stack in emulation mode is set to $100
                   ; and grows downwards ...
0xc0:0023: 9a      ;	TXS, ... and this is not changed with entering native mode. With this instruction the stack enlarges to 5631 bytes. 
0xc0:0024: a20000  ;	LDX (value) 0x00, the next three instructions set the X register to 0, push that value on the new stack, and pull it to the Direct Page register immediately.
0xc0:0027: da      ;	PHX, the reason why they have to do this is unknown to me. Basically they could have just set the A register (it's still in 8 bit mode) and issued a TCD instruction.
0xc0:0028: 2b      ;	PLD
0xc0:0029: 7b      ;	TDC, and now they set A to that value. The last two instructions are a waste IMHO, and since memory accesses are slow, also block the CPU for at least 8 cycles.
0xc0:002a: 48      ;	PHA, now this makes sense. The DBR register can be directly set only via pulling the value from stack ...
0xc0:002b: ab      ;	PLB, ... which is done here. So all relative accesses should be directed to bank $00.
0xc0:002c: a901    ;	LDA (value) 0x01
0xc0:002e: 8d0d42  ;	STA (addr) 0x420d, and again the hardware registers are set ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Emulating games on a Windows OS is actually very easy. There are plenty of programs for emulating everything from GB to the PS2. 

Generally you have the software and either a rom image or a disk (image or otherwise). Emulation on the simpler platforms like the GB, GBC, GBA, SNES or NES will not require additional tweaking beyond simply running the software and selecting the image. 

More complicated systems such as the Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 will require that the emulator be set up with plugins; these specify how different qualities are rendered on your system (Graphics, Sound, Controllers, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In some situations we need a new kind of probability. You are standing in front of three closed doors, and you know that there is a tiger behind one of them.  To your relief, door #1 is opened and there is no tiger.  What is the '''[[w:conditional probability|conditional probability]]''' that the tiger is behind door #2, given that there was no tiger behind door #1? 

==Definition==
The conditional probability of an event A, given the  occurrence  event B, is written as '''''P(A|B)'''''.  What Wikipedia calls [[w:Bayes' theorem|Bayes' theorem]] is,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \, \Leftrightarrow &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)  = P(A|B) P(B) =  P(B|A) P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

provided P(B) &gt; 0. In the case where P(B) = 0, the conditional probability of A given B is meaningless, but for completeness we define P(A|B) = 0 for P(B) = 0.  This formula is equivalent to: {{nowrap begin}}P(A|B) P(B) = P(A and B){{nowrap end}}.  The expression,{{nowrap begin}}P(A and B){{nowrap end}},is often written as {{nowrap begin}}P(A &amp; B){{nowrap end}}

&lt;!--&lt;s&gt;This is known as Bayes' theorem&lt;/s&gt; This is not true, so I marked this as comment--&gt;

'''Independent events'''

Intuitively, we would like two events, A and B, to be independent if P(A|B) = P(A), that is, if A is as likely to occur whether or not B has occurred. In this case, the occurrence of A is independent of the occurrence of B.


However, P(A|B) = P(A) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B)/P(B) = P(A) &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).


Therefore, A is independent from B &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; B is independent from A &lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt; P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).

===Examples===
====Even and prime numbers====
&lt;!--This has an incoming link from Wikiversity.  Please don't change the name of this heading--&gt;
[[File:Conditional probability venn 12345.svg|right|thumb|P(even &amp;#124; prime)=1/3. {{spaces|2}} P(prime &amp;#124; even)=1/2|180px]]
[[File:Conditional probability venn 1-10.svg|right|180px|thumb|Can you find P(even &amp; prime) using three different methods... and get the same anwer?]]

Consider the integers {1,2,3,4,5}. Using the notation shown in the chart below, the set of odd numbers {{nowrap begin}}{ ''1'', ''3'', ''5'' } =  '''''e''''''{{nowrap end}}.  The integer &quot;1&quot; not considered a prime number, while &quot;2&quot; is prime, so {{nowrap begin}}that: '''''p''''' ∪ '''''e''''' = { ''2'' }.{{nowrap end}}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Category      !! elements    !! set           !! compliment
|-
| Prime numbers || 2,3,5      || '''''p''''' denote &quot;prime&quot;  || '''''p'''''' denote &quot;not prime&quot;
|-
| Even  number  || 2,4,6       || '''''e''''' denotes &quot;even&quot;|| '''''e'''''' denotes &quot;not even&quot; 
|}

The set {1,2,3,4,5} contains three prime numbers, but only one of them (&quot;2&quot;) is even.  Therefore, the [[w:conditional probability|conditional probability]] that an element of the set {{nowrap begin}}{1,2,3,4,5}{{nowrap end}} is even, given that it is prime, is {{nowrap begin}}P(even &amp;#124; prime) = 1/3.{{nowrap end}} 

The set {1,2,3,4,5} contains two even numbers, but only one of them is prime.  Therefore, the [[w:conditional probability|conditional probability]] that an element of the set {{nowrap begin}}{1,2,3,4,5}{{nowrap end}}  is prime, given that it is even, is {{nowrap begin}}P(prime &amp;#124; even) = 1/2.{{nowrap end}} 

What is the probability that a randomly selected member of this set is both prime and even?  There are three ways to answer this question.  The first is direct and makes no use of conditional probability.  Since the only number in the set that is both prime and even is &quot;2&quot;, we have:

1) {{spaces|1}} &lt;math&gt;P(\text{even } \&amp; \text{ prime}) = P(2) = \frac 1 5&lt;/math&gt;

The other two methods use P(A &amp; B) = P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B):&lt;ref&gt;Note the mixed notations,  P(A &amp; B) = P(A ∩ B).  The former means the element is in A '''and'' the element is in B, while the latter means the element is in the intersection of sets A and B.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) {{spaces|1}} &lt;math&gt;P(\text{even } \&amp; \text{ prime}) = P(\text{even})\cdot P(\text{prime} | \text{even})=\frac 2 5 \cdot \frac 1 2 =\frac 1 5&lt;/math&gt;

3) {{spaces|1}} &lt;math&gt;P(\text{even } \&amp; \text{ prime}) = P(\text{prime})\cdot P(\text{even} | \text{prime})=\frac 3 5 \cdot \frac 1 3 =\frac 1 5&lt;/math&gt;

Can you use the three different methods to calculate P(even &amp; prime) for elements in the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}?

[[file:Wikiversity-logo.svg|16x16px]] '''[[v:Bell's theorem/Inequality#Statement_of_Bell's_theorem|Venn diagram used to prove Bell's theorem on ''Wikiversity'']]'''

====Dice====
We shall throw two dice: the probability of getting double six is 1/36. We have thrown the dice, but they are still under the cup: the probability of double six still is considered to be 1/36. Now we have someone else look under the cup at the result, and they tell us that at least one of the dice is a 6. What will the probability be of double six? Although we ask for the &quot;probability&quot; of double six, it's not the original probability we're talking about. It's a new kind of probability of the event &quot;double six&quot; under the condition that we know that another event  has occurred, i.e. the event that one of the dice shows six. We call it &quot;conditional probability&quot;. It indicates how likely the event &quot;double six&quot; is amongst all events in which (at least) one of the dice shows six. In 11 of the 36 possibilities at least one of the dice shows six. Thus, the probability of one of the dice showing six is 11/36 and the probability of double six is 1/36. Hence, the conditional probability of double six, given one die shows six is (1/36)/(11/36) = 1/11. We write this conditional probability as:

:P( &quot;double six&quot; | &quot;at least one six&quot; ),

using the same letter P as for the original probability, and separating the event of which the conditional probability is indicated from the event that states the condition by a vertical line (&quot;|&quot;).

====Gender and occupation====
As another example we pick at random an inhabitant of the UK. The probability of the chosen person to be a woman (W) is 1/2, it's nothing else than the fraction women amongst the British.  What if we are informed that the chosen person is working in a hospital (H)? It now comes down to the fraction of women amongst hospital staff, let's say 0.7. So we have:

:P(W) = 0.5
and
:P(W|H) = 0.7.

First, some MUMPS terminology-

*'''Routines'''  - the term for programs, lines of commands in sequence.
**Each routine has a name (RoutineName) which is used to execute it by way of the DO command.
**An up arrow ^ (caret character) is a prefix to the RoutineName distinguishing it as a routine versus a label within the current routine.
**Traditionally a routine is about a page in length as a logical section that is easily visible as a cognitive unit.
*'''Globals''' are the persistent database variables in MUMPS. These are a unique feature.
**Global Names begin with up arrow (caret) also.
**Global names have a comma-separated list in parentheses of subscripts as a multi-dimensional array.
**Subscripts create a heirarchical database, which may be huge, may be shared among many simultaneous tasks.
**Globals are persistent on the Hard Drive (or other devices like flash drives) as they are the database representation in MUMPS.
**The intrinsic nature of globals in the MUMPS language largely hide the necessity of application programmers dealing with issues of file opening, buffering, caching, encryption, compression, etc. These are managed with historic sophistication by the binary tree encoding and dynamic creation of the MUMPS system. See MUMPS as an Operating System.

     ^PtData(ClinicId,PtNum,VisitNum,NoteNum,Line)=  ...  
     ;
     ;where  data is separated by Clinic first, then by patient, then visit, then note,
     ;   and the node itself contains the text for one line of the patient note.

This page has now been moved/renamed into book 3 to take on that role, and needs considerable revision.  Some content that is still here may need to be integrated back into book 1}}


==Introduction to Angles==

[[image:2D-Angle.png|right|thumb|250px|An angle between two lines in a 2-dimensional plane]]

An angle is formed when two lines intersect; the point of intersection is called the '''vertex'''.  We can think of an angle as the wedge-shaped space between the lines where they meet.  Note that if both lines are extended through the meeing point, there are in fact four angles.

The size of the angle is the degree of rotation between the lines.  The more we must rotate one line to meet the other, the larger the angle is.

Suppose you wish to measure the angle between two lines exactly so that you can tell a remote friend about it:  draw a circle with its center located at the meeting of the two lines, making sure that the circle is small enough to cross both lines, but large enough for you to measure the distance along the circle's edge, the circumference, between the two cross points.  Obviously this distance depends on the size of the circle, but as long as you tell your friend both the radius of the circle used, and the length along the circumference, then your friend will be able to reconstruct the angle exactly.

==Definition of an Angle==

An angle is determined by rotating a ray about its endpoint.
The starting position of 
the ray is called the ''initial side'' of the angle.
The ending position of the ray is called the ''terminal side''.
The endpoint of the ray is called its ''vertex''.
''Positive angles'' are generated by counter-clockwise rotation.
''Negative angles'' are generated by clockwise rotation.

Consequently an angle has four parts: its vertex, its initial side, its terminal side, and its rotation.  

An angle is said to be in ''standard position'' when it is drawn in a cartesian coordinate system in such a way that its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is  the positive x-axis.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Angle measure.svg||300px|an angle in standard position]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition of a Triangle==

A triangle is a planar (flat) shape with three straight sides.  An angle is formed between each two sides of a triangle, and a triangle has three angles, hence the name tri-angle.  So a triangle has three straight sides and three angles.

If you give me three lengths, I can only make a triangle from them if the greatest length is less than the sum of the other two.  Three lengths that do not make the sides of a triangle are your height, the height of the nearest tree, the distance from the top of the tree to the center of the sun.

===Triangle Ratios===

Angles are not affected by the length of lines: an angle is invariant under transformations of scale, that is:

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
If you make the triangle bigger, &lt;br/&gt;
but keep the sides in the same ratio, &lt;br/&gt;
its angles won't change.
{{TrigBoxClose}}

===Right Angles=== 

An angle of particular significance is the right angle: the angle at each corner of a square or a rectangle. A rectangle can always be divided into two triangles by drawing a line from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner.

It is also true that every right-angled triangle is half a rectangle.

[[Image:rightTriangle.png|left|thumb|Right Triangle]]

A rectangle has four sides; they are generally of two different lengths: two long sides and two short sides.  (A rectangle with all sides equal is a square.)  When we split the rectangle into two right-angled triangles, each triangle has a long side and a short side from the rectangle as well as a copy of the split line.

So the area of a right-angled triangle is half the area of the rectangle from which it was split.  Looking at a right-angled triangle, we can tell what the long and short sides of that rectangle were; they are the sides, the lines, that meet at a right angle.  The area of the complete rectangle is the long side times the short side. The area of a right-angled triangle is therefore half as much.

===Right Triangles and Measurement===
[[Image:Construction of bisection.svg|350px|right|How to bisect an angle]]
It is possible to [[w:bisection|bisect]] any angle using only circles (which can be drawn with a compass) and straight lines by the following procedure:

# Call the vertex of the angle O.  Draw a circle centered at O.
# Mark where the circle intersects each ray.  Call these points A and B.
# Draw circles centered at A and B with equal radii, but make sure that these radii are large enough to make the circles intersect at two points.  One sure way to do this is to draw line segment AB and make the radius of the circles equal to the length of that line segment. On the diagram, circles A and B are shown as near-half portions of a circle.
# Mark where these circles intersect, and connect these two points with a line.  This line bisects the original angle.

A proof that the line bisects the angle is found in [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI9.html Proposition 9 of Book 1] of the ''Elements''.

Given a right angle, we can use this process to split that right angle indefinitely to form any binary fraction (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^n}, n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}...&lt;/math&gt;) of it.  Thus, we can measure any angle in terms of right angles.  That is, a measurement system in which the size of the right angle is considered to be one.

&lt;!-- This will move to later in the book when we talk about radians.--&gt;
==Introduction to Radian Measure==
{|
|[[Image:En_Radian_cropped_color.png|right|frame]]Of course, it is equally possible to start with a different sized angle and split it into two equal angles.  We might consider the angle made by half a circle to be &quot;one&quot;, or the angle made by a full circle to be &quot;one&quot;.

Trigonometry is simplified if we choose the following strange angle as &quot;one&quot;:
*# Draw a circle with the radius marked.
*# From the point where the radius meets the circumference of the circle, measure one radius length along the circumference of the circle moving counterclockwise and mark this point.
*# Draw a line from this mark back to the center of the circle.
*# The angle so formed is considered to be of size one in trigonometry; in order to tell your friends that this is the method you were using, you would say 'measuring in radians'.
|}
====Understanding the three sides of a Radian====
To illustrate how the three sides of a radian relate to one another try the below thought experiment:
*# Assume you have a piece of string that is exactly the length of the radius of a circle.
*# Assume you have drawn a radian in the same circle.  The radian has 3 points.  One is the center of your circle and the other two are on the circumference of the circle where the sides of the radian intersect with the circle.
*# Attach one end of the string at one of the points where the radian intersects with the circumference of the circle.
*# Take the other end of the string and, starting at the point you chose in Step 2 above, trace the circumference of the circle towards the second point where the radian intersects with the circle until the string is pulled tight.
*# You will see that the end of the string travels past the second point.
*# This is because the string is now in a straight line.  However, the radian has an arc for its third side, not a straight line.  Even though a radian has three equal sides, the arc's curve causes the two points where the radian intersects with the circle to be closer together than they are to the third point of the triangle, which is at the center of our circle in this example.
*# Now, with the string still pulled tight, find the half way point of the string, then pull it onto the circumference of the circle while allowing the end of the string to move along the circle's circumference.  The end of the string is now closer to the second point because the path of the string is closer to the path of the circle's circumference.
*# We can keep improving the fit of the string's path to the path of the circle's circumference by dividing each new section of the string in half and pulling it towards the circumference of the circle.

====Is a radian affected by the size of its circle?====

Does it matter what size circle is used to measure in radians?  Perhaps using the radius of a large circle will produce a different angle than that produced by the radius of a small circle.  The answer is no.

[[Image:RadianDemo1.png|right|thumb|400px|Two different size radian-arcs have the same angle-measure regardless of their radius.]]


Recall our radian and circle from the experiment in the subsection above.  Draw another circle inside the first circle, with the same center, but with half the radius.  You will see that you have created a new radian inside the smaller circle that shares the same angle as the radian in the larger circle.  We know that the two sides of the radians emanating from the center of the circles are equal to the radius of their respective circle.  We also know that the third side of the radian in the larger circle (the arc) is also equal to the larger circle's radius.  But how do we know that the third side of the radian in the smaller circle (the arc that follows the circumference of the smaller circle) is equal to the radius of the smaller circle?  To see why we do know that the third side of the smaller circle's radian is equal to its radius, we first connect the two points of each radian that intersect with the circle with each other.  By doing so, you will have created two [[w:isosceles triangle|isosceles triangle]]s (triangles with two equal sides and two equal angles).

An isosceles triangle has two equal angles and two equal sides.  If you know one angle of any isosceles triangle and the length of two sides that make up that angle, then you can easily deduce the remaining characteristics of the isosceles triangle.  For instance, if the two equidistant sides of an isosceles triangle intersect to form an angle that is equal to 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, then you know the remaining angles must both equal 70º.  Since we know that the equidistant sides of our two isosceles triangles make up our known angle, then we can deduce that both of our radians (when converted to isosceles triangles with straight lines) have identical second and third angles.  We also know that triangles with identical angles, regardless of their size, will have the length of their sides in a constant ratio to each other.  For instance, we can deduce that an isosceles triangle will have sides that measure 2 meters by 4 meters by 4 meters if we know that an isoscleses triangle with identical angles measures 1 meter by 2 meters by 2 meters.  Therefore, in our example, our isosceles triangle formed by the second smaller circle will have a third side exaclty equal to half of the third side of the isosceles triangle created by the larger circle.  The relationship between the size of the sides of two triangles that share identical angles is also found in the relationship between radius and circumference of two circles that share the same center point - they will share the exact same ratio.  In our example then, since the radius of our second smaller circle is exactly half of the larger circle, the circumference between the two points where the radian of the smaller circle intersect (which we have shown is one half of the distance between the two similar points on the larger circle) will share the same exact ratio.  And there you have it - the size of the circle does not matter.

===Using Radians to Measure Angles===

Once we have an angle of one radian, we can chop it up into binary fractions as we did with the right angle to get a vast range of known angles with which to measure unknown angles. A protractor is a device which uses this technique to measure angles approximately.  To measure an angle with a protractor: place the marked center of the protractor on the corner of the angle to be measured, align the right hand zero radian line with one line of the angle, and read off where the other line of the angle crosses the edge of the protractor.  A protractor is often transparent with angle lines drawn on it to help you measure angles made with short lines: this is allowed because angles do not depend on the length of the lines from which they are made.

If we agree to measure angles in radians, it would be useful to know the size of some easily defined angles. We could of course simply draw the angles and then measure them very accurately, though still approximately, with a protractor: however, we would then be doing physics, not mathematics.  

The ratio of the length of the circumference of a circle to its radius is defined as 2π, where '''π''' is an invariant independent of the size of the circle by the argument above.  Hence if we were to move 2π radii around the circumference of a circle from a given point on the circumference of that circle, we would arrive back at the starting point.  We have to conclude that the size of the angle made by one circuit around the circumference of a circle is 2π radians.  Likewise a half circuit around a circle would be π radians. Imagine folding a circle in half along an axis of symmetry: the resulting crease will be a diameter, a straight line through the center of the circle.  Hence a straight line has an angle of size π radians.

Folding a half circle in half again produces a quarter circle which must therefore have an angle of size π/2 radians.  Is a quarter circle a right angle? To see that it is: draw a square whose corner points lie on the circumference of a circle.  Draw the diagonal lines that connect opposing corners of the square, by symmetry they will pass through the center of the circle, to produce 4 similar triangles.  Each such triangle is isoceles, and has an angle of size 2π/4 =  π/2 radians where the two equal length sides meet at the center of the circle. Thus the other two angles of the triangles must be equal and sum to π/2 radians, that is each angle must be of size π/4 radians. We know that such a triangle is right angled, we must conclude that an angle of size π/2 radians is indeed a right angle.

===Summary and Extra Notes===

In summary: it is possible to make deductions about the sizes of angles in certain special conditions using geometrical arguments.  However, in general, geometry alone is not powerful enough to determine the size of unknown angles for any arbitrary triangle.  To solve such problems we will need the help of trigonometric functions. 

In principle, all [[w:angle|angle]]s and [[w:trigonometric function|trigonometric function]]s are defined on the [[../The_unit_circle|unit circle]]. The term ''unit'' in mathematics applies to a single measure of any length. We will later apply the principles gleaned from unit measures to larger (or smaller) scaled problems. All the functions we need can be derived from a triangle inscribed in the unit circle: it happens to be a [[w:right triangle|right-angled triangle]]. [[Image:Define_a_radian.png|right|thumb|150px|The hypotenuse rotate counter-clockwise ]]

The center point of the unit circle will be set on a [[w:cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]], with the circle's centre at the origin of the plane &amp;mdash; the point (0,0). Thus our circle will be divided into four sections, or [[w:quadrant|quadrant]]s.

Quadrants are always counted counter-clockwise, as is the default rotation of [[w:angular velocity|angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (omega). Now we inscribe a triangle in the first quadrant (that is, where the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are assigned positive values) and let one leg of the angle be on the ''x''-axis and the other be parallel to the ''y''-axis. (Just look at the illustration for clarification). Now we let the [[w:hypotenuse|hypotenuse]] (which is always 1, the radius of our ''unit'' circle) rotate [[Wiktionary:counter-clockwise|counter-clockwise]]. You will notice that a new triangle is formed as we move into a new quadrant, not only because the sum of a triangle's angles cannot be beyond 180&amp;deg;, but also because there is no way on a two-dimensional plane to imagine otherwise.

== clarification for Summary and Extra Notes section ==

Can someone address the following statement appearing in the 4th paragraph of the Summary and Extra Notes section:

''Now we let the hypotenuse (which is always 1, the radius of our unit circle) rotate counter-clockwise.''

Actually the entire 4th paragraph seems confusing to me.  Is it trying to explain how angles are measured in the cartesian plane?  consider revising this section.
--[[User:209.67.181.254|209.67.181.254]] 00:12, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

The last section of the paragraph starting from &quot;Quadrants are always counted counter-clockwise,....&quot; is meaningless
The hypotenuse is equal to the square root of (2) not to 1 as in the aside picture

-'''The image changed , it's now clarify what the author say'''

== More Illustrations ==

That statement in the triangle ratios section, &quot;In particular, a triangle can be divided into 4 congruent triangles by connecting the mid-points on the sides of the original triangle together, each congruent triangle is similar on half scale to the original triangle&quot;, needs an illustration really bad.  It would really help those of us who actually read these wiki articles on math to learn it and are not math geniuses. Thanks

== More Clarity ==

In the &quot;In Simple Terms&quot; Section, under the subsection &quot;Introduction to Radian Measure&quot; --  I don't believe that this section is as clear as it could be. 

=== Textually ===
Textually speaking: If I understand the section correct, the step by step exercise involves the assumption that one is using a string of the length of the radius. If this is the case it would be good to state this explicitly. Were someone to be trying to follow along using a compass, they could easily become confused and assume that after extending the radius to the circumference, we'll mark this as Pt. 1, that they should then use the radius length to mark another point on the circumference using the radius length and then to use another radius length to connect the second point back to the center of the circle in order to create an equilateral triangle with three sides the same length, i.e. 1 radius. This would make the circumference between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 to be larger than one radius. A straight line between two points in 2 or 3-dimensional space is shorter than a curved line between the two points (or something like that, I must admit I haven't touched a math text since 1998 so I may be getting this wrong). The idea is, that if one is using a string here, then one is able to &quot;trace&quot; the circumference of the circle with the string for the length of the string, i.e. 1 radius, marking this point Pt. 2. This would make the length of the curvature of the circle, i.e. the circumference traced, equal to 1 radius. Thus the line between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would be LESS THAN the circumference length between the two points of 1 radius. The distance between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, making this third side of the triangle less than 1 radius. We would therefore have a triangle with two equal sides, each of 1 radius length extending out from the center of the circle and one line between the two points that must be less than 1 radius while the length of the circumference that shares Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 with this third side of our triangle being equal in length to the other sides of the triangle, all of them being 1 radius in length. Overall, tell people whether they should be using a string here or a compass. 

=== Visually ===

Visually, this could be shown by using the types of hash-marks employed in geometry. The two radius sides of our triangle would have 1 hash-mark, the length of the circumference of our circle between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would also have 1 hash-mark and the straight line between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 would have 2 hash-marks to indicate that it is equal in length to neither the radius lines or the circumference of the circle between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2. It might also be useful to show another example where we use the radius of the circle to create an equilateral triangle within the circle that touches the circumference of the circle at Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 (Pt. 1 is same as above but Pt. 2 here would be diff. from Pt. 2 above) and with our hash-marks indicate that all the sides of this triangle have equal lengths of 1 hash-mark but that now the circumference between Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 is not one radius in length by marking it with 2 hash-marks and further writing an indication that this length of circumference is NOT equal to a radian and the angle formed within is NOT equal to a radian. I will try to draw a makeshift image to show what I mean. I don't know how to upload the image here so if you'd like me to do that you'll have to explain how. I read the help file on image uploads but I don't want to mark up your nice looking page. Overall: Geometry-like hash-marks help.


== Relevance Needed ==
This &quot;simple terms&quot; introduction needs introduction of its own. Rather than some arcane discussion of how to bisect angles, we need a relation of trigonometry to our modern world. We need a discussion of cell-phone triangulation; we need a discussion of how a bridge or building will collapse without proper angle calculation; we need discussion of electromagnetic wave calculations for antennas and cooking of food; etc.

Like others mention in this discussion, I agree it needs pictures and diagrams; sore need. This is the age of the internet, not some dried up text in the back of the teacher lounge acting as a coaster.

== I'm not sure what this page adds ==

I've made a few cosmetic improvements, but I do wonder how it helps the book as a whole.  It isn't rigorous enough to deserve its name, and I doubt that anyone capable of dealing with the advanced topics would find it useful.--[[User:Wisden|Wisden]] ([[User talk:Wisden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisden|contribs]]) 09:25, 19 January 2011 (UTC)

:If in time we lose this page I won't mind.  IIRC Thenub314 was keen on the idea of a page about trig done rigorously, particularly defining 'what is an angle?', but I may be mis-remembering.  The history of this page is another matter.  It used to have an attempt at covering all of trigonometry in a very condensed way, so only introducing cos, then later presenting sin and results about sin in terms of cos.  Not the best for teaching it to someone relatively new to algebra. --[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 10:30, 19 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Emotion and motivation==
[[image:Thought_bubble.svg|thumb|70px|right|Cognitions and motives]]

Philosophical approaches to the emotions have been around for a long time, written with explanatory depth in such writers as [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] and [[w:Jiddu Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. Social psychological approaches use these perspectives as launching points from which further theories might proceed.

===Hedonistic theory of action===
This theory finds its roots explicitly from the [[w:philosophy|philosophy]] of [[w:Epicurus|Epicurus]], followed by philosophers like [[w:John Locke|John Locke]], [[w:Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham]], and [[w:Ludwig von Mises|Ludwig von Mises]] (among many others). The hedonistic theory (or [[w:psychological hedonism|psychological hedonism]]) states that human action occurs when:
* The actor is compelled to ''increase their pleasure'' by achieving a goal, or
* The actor is compelled to ''relieve the burden of uneasiness'' by achieving a goal.

Psychological hedonism has a fundamental place in most theories of action, most notably ''[[w:behaviorism|behaviorism]]'', ''[[w:praxeology|praxeology]]'', and ''psychosocial theory''.

===Psychosocial descriptions of motivation===
[[w:Erik Erikson|Erik Erikson]] conceived of a psychosocial developmental theory as an extension of Freudian psychodynamic developmental theory. The psychosocial model, called the &quot;psycho-social theory of the self&quot;, is meant to be used to explain the most important variables in bodily development, and how they might relate to socialization. It includes:
* The ''erogenous zones'' on the body which provide stimulation. For example, the oral, anal, and phallic zones. Can also be expanded to non-erogenous zones of the body, including cerebral-cortical, loco-motor, sensory-motor, respiratory, muscular, and kinesthetic;
* The psychosexual ''mode'', or the actions associated with each zone. For example, retention and elimination for the anal zone;
* The psychosocial ''modality'', or the social analogy that can be associated with each respective mode. For example, &quot;anal-retentiveness&quot;;
* The ''meaning'', or preferred external objects associated with each mode and zone.

With this addition, Erikson made steps towards a developmental theory that was both psychological and sociological. Psychosocial theory helps to explain what kinds of ''goals'' the social actor may develop.

All of the above theories have provided models by which we might describe the subject of emotions, but more needs to be said in order for the researcher to explain and predict them. Pivotal questions include, &quot;When and why do people have feelings?&quot;, &quot;Are emotions themselves a cause of action, or are they mere [[w:epiphenomena|epiphenomena]] (or illusions)?&quot;, and &quot;How does the brain work to create social emotions?&quot;

===[[w:Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]===
===[[w:Affect control theory|Affect control theory]]===
One attempt to explain human emotional behavior has come in the form of ''affect control theory'', which states that people in a situation will try to maintain any initial feelings or impressions that they have, rather than try to change them.

===Three schools of the emotions===
There are many ways in social psychology that have been used to study emotions. There is the ''social constructionist'' approach of James Averill and Rom Harre, and the ''realist'' approach of [[w:Paul Ekman|Paul Ekman]] and his study of facial expressions. In ''cognitive emotion theories'' there are the contesting works of Lazarus and Zajonc.

Social constructionist emotion research uses cultural evidence and review of historical documents. For instance, it's hard to find a western equivalent for Japanese emotion of ''amae''. Another example often used is the emotion of ''acide'', which has disappeared from European discourse in the 15th century.

===Emotion and sequence===
The main debate in the cognitive school has been about the sequence of events. In other words, a main concern has been: ''does cognition trigger emotion or does emotion trigger cognition?''

The conventional view on this issue is that first a person will feel an emotion, and second, that emotion will compel an action.

However, Willam James's theory of the emotions says the reverse: that we first experience physical feelings in our bodies that we afterward interpret as emotions. If one sees a bear in the woods and decides to make a run for it, then one interprets oneself later on as being scared because one's heart, respiration, and feet are functioning faster. Lately Antonio Damasio has revived Willam James' emotion theory in an updated version.

James' theory of emotions can be considered physiological as well as social, for he emphasizes the situational aspects that arouse emotions. Examples William James makes use of include music, aesthetic experiences, and moral judgements. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;These [subtler emotions] are the ''moral, intellectual, and æsthetic feelings''. Concords of sounds, of colors, of lines, logical consistencies, teleological fitnesses, affect us with a pleasure that seems ingrained in the very form of the representation itself, and to borrow nothing from any reverberation surging up from the parts below the brain.[...]

A glow, a pang in the breast, a shudder, a fulness of the breathing, a flutter of the heart, a shiver down the back, a moistening of the eyes, a stirring in the hypogastrium, and a thousand unnamable symptoms besides, may be felt the moment the beauty excites us. And these symptoms also result when we are ''excited by moral perceptions, as of pathos, magnanimity, or courage''.[...]

''In all cases of intellectual or moral rapture'' we find that, unless there be coupled a bodily reverberation of some kind with the mere thought of the object and cognition of its quality; unless we actually laugh at the neatness of the ''demonstration or witticism''; unless we thrill at the case of ''justice'', or tingle at the act of magnanimity; our state of mind can hardly be called emotional at all. It is in fact a mere intellectual perception of how certain things are to be called[...]&quot; (Principle of Psychology part II, 468 - 471) all italics added &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[w:Spindle neuron|Spindle neuron]]s===
Recent research by [[w:John Allman|John Allman]] has suggested that a certain kind of neuron in the brain may be responsible for the social emotions of humans and primates.

===Applications===
Whatever the theory of motivation, it will likely shed some light upon broader social issues such as [[w:Alienation|Alienation]] and [[w:depressed mood|Depression]].

==Social perceptions==
The ways in which people perceive and make judgments about events in the world.

; [[w:Attribution theory|Attribution theory]] 
: This field of social psychology is concerned with the ways in which people explain (or attribute) the behavior of others. It explores how individuals &quot;attribute&quot; causes of actions either to the ''actors'' involved or to ''situations'' -- in other words, whether or not an observer judges an actor to have had control over the act and its consequences. 
:One discovery in this field is that it is normal for people to place blame upon others when some harm befalls them, but they are more likely to [[w:fundamental attribution error|blame situations when the harm is upon themselves]]. Those suffering from [[w:depression|depression]] do not seem to be susceptible to the same error.

; [[w:Social comparison theory|Social comparison theory]]
: A theory created by [[w:Leon Festinger|Leon Festinger]] which postulates that people are more likely to compare their own situations and wellbeing to that of those who they are most similar.

; [[w:Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] formation
: An area of research that inquires into the attitudes and values people come to have. One question of particular interest is, &quot;Do attitudes cause actions, or vice-versa?&quot; Two theories which argue this question are [[w:reasoned-action theory|reasoned-action theory]] (Fishbein) and [[w:self-perception theory|self-perception theory]] (Bem), respectively.

; [[w:Theory of mind|Theory of mind]] module
: Research and experimentation has recently come to suggest that part of the human mind is innately specialized in creating and processing an awareness of other minds. This &quot;module&quot; is thought to be absent for subjects with '''[[w:autism|autism]]'''.

; Pattern recognition and chaos
: Human beings have a perceptual inclination towards finding patterns out what they sense, even if what they sense is noise. This desire for pattern-making can also manifest itself in a desire for social and intellectual orderliness. However, the extent to which the perceptual inclination towards orderliness leads to social and intellectual dispositions of the same kind requires further study. It may just as well be said that human beings, in the pursuit of creative endeavors, thrive upon some degree of chaos.

; Types of [[w:belief system|belief system]]s
: Belief systems can be structured according to certain variables: systematicity, empirical relevance, adaptability to new information, tolerance of competing beliefs, degree of commitment required to maintain, and style of belief organization.

==What is social psychology?==
'''Social psychology''' is the study of how individuals perceive, influence, and relate to others. According to Gordon Allport's classic definition, social psychology is an attempt to understand and explain how the thought, feeling, and behavior of individuals is influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. By imagined or implied presence, Allport is suggesting that the effects of [[social influence]] are felt even when there are no other people about.

==Psychological and sociological emphases==
Social psychology is usually considered as subfields of [[psychology]] or [[sociology]], which concentrate on the relative importance of individual or social influences and effects respectively. Some of the differences are organizational (e.g., psychological and sociological social psychologists tend to publish in different journals) whilst other differences include the type of processes emphasized by the respective disciplines.

Psychological social psychologists tend take an interactional approach to human social behavior which emphasizes factors both within the person (cognition, affect, motives, neurophysiology, and personality traits), and the immediate social situation. Sociological social psychologists tend to emphasize processes outside of the person at a more distant macro-level, such as social structure and a more immediate micro-level, such as social interaction. Both include the use of the individual and the group as units of analysis in their research.  

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
| '''Sociological social psychology'''
| Looks at the social behavior of humans in terms of associations and relationships that they have. This type leans toward sociology. One offshoot of this perspective is the ''Personality and Social Structure Perspective'', which emphasizes the links between individual personality and identity, and how it relates to social structures. Sociological social psychologists tend to publish in Social Psychology Quarterly. Sociological social psychologists usually are members of social psychology section of the American Sociological Association (ASA).

|-
| '''Psychological social psychology'''
| Looks at social behavior of humans in terms of the mental states of the individuals. Psychological social psychologists tend to publish in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, and Experimental Social Psychology. Psychological social psychologists usually are members of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA).

=== Relation to other fields ===
Social psychology has close ties with the other social sciences, especially [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. It also has very strong ties to the field of social philosophy.
* ''Sociology'' is the study of group behavior and human societies, with emphasis on the structures of societies and the processes of social influence. Includes all ''organizational behavior''.
* ''Psychology'' is the study of the underlying psychological processes that make all behaviors and experiences possible. Some examples of the things it seeks to explain are: the attribution of mental states to others, the notion of a unitary 'self', sight and perception, personality and identity, warfare and violence, love, being hungry, waking up, etc.
* ''Philosophy of the social sciences'' is the study of theoretical questions about the experience and behavior of persons and the justifications involved with how they are studied in the social sciences. It involves questions related to the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of language, social epistemology, and many other fields.

== History ==
The discipline of social psychology began at the dawn of the twentieth century. Landmark moments include the publication of Charles Horton Cooley's &quot;Human Nature and Social Order&quot; in 1902, which sought to explain the social order by use of the concept of a looking-glass self. The first textbooks in social psychology would be published six years later by E. A. Ross and William McDougall.

John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte and others laid the foundation for social psychology by asserting that human social cognition and behavior could and should be studied scientifically like any other natural science.

== The concerns of social psychology ==
=== General research interests ===
[[image:soc-psy_diagram.jpg|150px|right|Social Psychology Diagram]]
Social psychology attempts to understand the relationship between minds, groups, and behaviors in three general ways.

First, it tries to see how the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of '''individuals''' are ''influenced'' by the '''actual, imagined, or implied presence of other(s)''' (Allport 3).  This includes social perception, social interaction, and the many kinds of social influence (like trust, power, and persuasion). Gaining insight into the social psychology of persons involves looking at the influences that individuals have on the ''beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors'' of other individuals, as well as the influence that ''groups'' have on individuals. This aspect of social psychology asks questions like:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: #C7E1F5; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
* How do small group dynamics impact cognition and emotional states?
* How do social groups control or contribute to behavior, emotion, or attitudes of the individual members?
* How does the group impact the individual?
* How does the individual operate within the social group?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, it tries to understand the influence that '''individual perceptions and behaviors have upon the behavior of groups'''. This includes looking at things like ''group productivity in the workplace'' and ''group decision making''. It looks at questions like:
* How does persuasion work to change group behavior, emotion or attitudes?
* What are the reasons behind conformity, diversity, and deviance?

Third, and finally, social psychology tries to understand '''groups themselves as behavioral entities''', and the relationships and influences that one group has upon another group (Michener 5). It asks questions like:

* What makes some groups hostile to one another, and others neutral or civil?
* Do groups behave in a different way than an individual outside the group?

In European textbooks there is also fourth level called the &quot;ideological&quot; level. It studies the societal forces that influence the human psyche.

=== Underlying issues ===
In social psychology, as in any other discipline, there will be a number of underlying philosophical predispositions in the projects of scientists. Some of these predispositions involve the nature of social knowledge itself, the nature of social reality, and the locus of human control in action (Cote and Levine, 2002; Slife and Gantt, 1999).
	
One main and lasting crisis has been the debate over positivism and phenomenology. In the former, the research focus has been an attempt to find overarching, universal laws to social behavior and history. In the latter, by contrast, the emphasis is upon a focus of empirical study, and making accurate descriptions of social reality, regardless of whether or not they fit a grand theory or explanation. These two forms have tended to lend themselves to favor either quantitative or qualitative methods, respectively. In addition to these two orientations, there is a third outlook: a kind of social rationalism, which makes use of axiomatic presuppositions in order to explain social reality.

One underlying problem for the social psychologists is whether or not their studies can or should ultimately be understood in terms of the meaning and consciousness behind social action, as with folk psychology, or whether or not more objective materialist and behavioral facts are to be given exclusive study. This problem is especially important for those within social psychology who study meaning and language, and for those in the sociological social psychology tradition who favor symbolic interactionism, because a rejection of the study of meanings would lead to the reclassification of such research as unempirical.

Three persistent themes in the philosophy of the social sciences, and which directly affect social psychology, have been the '''structure-agency debate''', and the related arguments over determinism and free will. 

First, especially important among sociological social psychologists, the structure-agency debate (sometimes referred to by the terms &quot;individualism&quot; and &quot;holism&quot;) involves questions about the nature of social behavior: whether it is ultimately predictable in terms of the creative volition of the individual, or is largely a product of socialization, interaction, and greater social structures. (Bunnin and Tsui-James, 2003) 

The concern over free will has often been posed as philosophical and methodological, and not empirical, usually in the tradition of incompatibilism. However, some compatibilists see the issue as itself being something which can be investigated empirically by social psychologists. The work of Benjamin Libet is one example of research that has been taken to be an empirical refutation of the notion of free will.

=== Research ethics ===

Social psychologists are concerned with ethical issues, and there are certain ethical controversies that are especially apparent in this area. The goal of social psychology is to understand naturally occurring cognition and behavior in a social context, but the very act of observing people in social contexts tends to influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize '''deception''' to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on. This practice has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is not ethically correct, and that other research strategies (e.g. role-playing) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g. the Milgram experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and wellbeing of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or institutional review board. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is done to the participants, and that the benefits of the study outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study. Furthermore, a process of '''informed consent''' is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A '''debriefing''' is typically done at the conclusion of the experiment in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected as by routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for find prime numbers that is attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes.  The idea is to begin by listing all the natural numbers bigger than 2.
:&lt;math&gt;2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 \ldots&lt;/math&gt; 
and beginning with 2 we go to the first number that as not been crossed off and cross every multiple of that number that is later on in the list.

So in the case of 2, no numbers have been crossed so we start by removing every second number after 2.  Our list would then look like
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \cancel{4}, 5, \cancel{6}, 7, \cancel{8}, 9, \cancel{10}, 11, \cancel{12}, 13, \cancel{14}, 15, \cancel{16}, 17, \cancel{18}, 19, \cancel{20}, 21, \cancel{22}, 23, \cancel{24}\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
And we keep applying our rule.  Here our next number not crossed out will be 3, we cross out every third number after 3.  That will be 6, 9, 12,…  and our list the becomes
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \cancel{4}, 5, \cancel{6}, 7, \cancel{8}, \cancel{9}, \cancel{10}, 11, \cancel{12}, 13, \cancel{14}, \cancel{15}, \cancel{16}, 17, \cancel{18}, 19, \cancel{20}, \cancel{21}, \cancel{22}, 23, \cancel{24} \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
And so on.  At the end only the prime numbers will be left.  

In this case we have already found all of the primes less than 25.  This is because composite numbers must always have a prime factor less than their square root.  If this were not the case for some integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we could write &lt;math&gt;n=p_1\times p_2\times\cdots\times p_k&lt;/math&gt;.  Since we are assuming &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is composite we know there are at least two prime factors &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;.  If both of which are greater than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p_1\times p_2 &gt; \sqrt{n}\times \sqrt{n}=n&lt;/math&gt;.  This would contradict that &lt;math&gt;n=p_1\times p_2\times\cdots\times p_k&lt;/math&gt;.  So for us, since we have crossed out every number with a factor smaller than 5 we have crossed out every composite number less than &lt;math&gt;5^2=25&lt;/math&gt;.

== Tutorial Authors Wanted on Official Blender MediaWiki! ==

The main Blender documentation and tutorial authors are now working on the [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Official Blender MediaWiki]. If you're considering helping write Blender tutorials or documentation, please consider helping us at the official wiki instead.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

== Wanted! ==

* [[Blender 3D: The Gimp for the Blender]] &amp;mdash; texture creation using the Gimp
* Wouldn't it be nice with a big fat, always updated Blender reference book. The current hotkey reference should be merged into it. Maybe it's ok just to copy the [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlII/ official reference] for a start? [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlII/a11911.html#appendix_licenses_ocl (Open Content License)].
** Starting a [[Blender 3D: Reference Guide|Blender Reference]] book :) Hope this could be the one doc in what the developers edit changes.

== Namespacing ==

How we will now name modules? Like ''Blender 3D: ModuleName'' or ''Blender 3D/ModuleName''? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 16:14, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I think the better way to do it is &quot;Blender 3D: ModuleName&quot;.  This way the module can better be a stand-alone book.  What do you think?  --[[User:68.3.31.10|68.3.31.10]] 14:43, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Yes I agree. Who changed this anyway? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 11:04, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: From history was [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]]: (:s to /s. this naming scheme creates automatic back links to the top of the articles.) --[[User:Popski|Popski]]

With this few changes [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] just messed with redirections and there is no more history. C'mon!! If you start to make changes like this then do it right and please discuss first. You can use some Sandbox for such testings. This automatic back links are totally unimportant anyway, I'll put it back. -[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:58, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for doing that, Popski.  Hopefully I'll be able to get back onto this Blender book here in a week or so when I'm done with this terrible class I'm in, give you some help.  [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] was trying to help, but I don't think that this particular contribution was beneficial.  Just so everybody remembers, he has in the past contributed in a positive way many times, so it's all good. Popski, we need to get the templated keyboard shortcuts book going, I'll spend time on it in about a week, the templates will be very helpful for integration with the other blender books.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 04:56, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I know that he didn't want to make any harm, but why people don't say anything before doing such things? You'll be back in a week? Well, that's good news! :) Blender 2.37 have some new ShortCuts (need to add). Another good news is that is '''[http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40007&amp;start=15 Varuag]''' interested to have his !great tutorials here! Unfortunatly is his homepage as down as is www.blenderman.org :( What do you think [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] where to put such tutorials as are his car tutorials? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 21:24, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: Sweet!  Good job Popski!  We should probably put Varuag's tutorials up under the Intermediate Modeling/Mechanical Modeling section.  I haven't seen Varuag's stuff myself but I'm assuming it's pretty awesome.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:03, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Drawing from life ==

&quot;Drawing from life&quot; is the act of drawing what you see.  Life drawing is considered fundamental to most other types of art because it teaches the student to observe all aspects of their subject.  Life drawing is also easier to evaluate than more abstract art: If the student intends to draw a subject from life, then their artwork can be evaluated as how well it directly resembles the subject.

=== The mental process ===

The brain's visual system is large and complex, designed to reduce an image directly to a concept so that the person can then act on that concept.  While this process is useful for daily functioning and general survival, it actually impedes the process of drawing from life.  For example, here is the process that an untrained person might go through while drawing part of a face:

# The eye sees the subject's nose.
# The visual system reduces the image to the concept &quot;nose&quot;.
# The mind thinks, &quot;What do I know about a nose?  Noses have two nostrils.  Nostrils look round.&quot;
# The hand draws two circles.

Thus, instead of drawing the shapes of the nose that the artist sees, the artist draws a mental icon for &quot;nose&quot;, despite the fact that from most angles nostrils are not circular -- from many angles one nostril may even be totally obscured, but that won't stop the untrained artist from drawing it.  While there is artistic value in being able to identify and reproduce mental icons, the process is not helpful when learning to draw from life.

In learning to draw from life, artists learn to ignore the conceptual aspects of their subjects so that they can concentrate on the visual details.  Thus, life drawing skills are usually taught through a series of exercises that emphasize visual details while obscuring the whole.

=== Exercises ===

==== Copying an image using a grid ====

Drawing an image using a grid is a venerable technique for transferring a small drawing to a large surface such as an over-sized canvas or a wall. The technique itself is simple: divide the original small drawing into equal sections using lightly-ruled lines, and then create the exact same grid in larger proportion on the target surface. Afterward, transfer the drawing to the new surface section by section.

==== Copying an upside-down image ====

This process helps in training oneself to draw what you see, not what you would normally characterize something as. For example, if you were drawing a nose upside down and did not know you were drawing a nose, your mental concept of a nose would be suppressed, allowing you to draw more accurately and train yourself to look at the lines and shapes of what you're drawing.

==== Blind contour drawings ====

This involves choosing an object and drawing it without looking even once at your paper. This develops hand-eye coordination which helps in accurately depicting what you're trying to draw. For beginning artists, this exercise isn't concentrated on achieving a perfect likeness of whatever you're drawing, just draw what you see and don't worry about what it looks like. If you keep doing this, over time your hand-eye coordination will improve immensely and you will begin to be able to draw what you see accurately without even looking.

Introductory Exercise: Pierce a paper plate with a sharp pencil. (If you don't have a paper plate handy, any kind of stiff paper will do.) Put the plate over the top of your pencil, resting atop your hand, so that it blocks your view of your drawing paper. Draw any convenient object, perhaps your shoe, a set of keys, or items from the kitchen. The barrier makes it impossible for your drawing to come out &quot;right,&quot; which takes a lot of pressure off you as you gradually learn to see in a new way. Each time you practice, your brain will be making new connections between your eyes and drawing muscles, much as happened when you learned to ride a bike without thinking much about the bike. When you finish a drawing, you'll probably find it more humorous than accurate. Enjoy that, but also look for places where your line was fairly accurate. Later, you may find this a good way to loosen up before tackling your project for the day.

Advanced Exercise (from [The Animation Learner's Site]): Find a place where you can work undisturbed for half an hour. Place your sketch book open on a table on your right hand side, preferably tilted towards you. Hold your pencil lightly in your right hand, and place it roughly in the middle of your paper. Now, turn in your chair until you are looking in the opposite direction of your paper. Your right hand, the pencil and the paper are now behind you. Place your left hand on your knee and relax. VERY SLOWLY, start to trace the contours of your hand. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LOOK AT YOUR PAPER! Draw everything you see. Do not attempt to name something (like a fingernail) and then draw it, because you cannot see the paper you are drawing it onto. Just &quot;trace,&quot; as accurately as you can, the contours of that thing (which just so happens to be a fingernail). You should start by drawing for about 15 minutes at a time (use a timer!), and gradually work up to anywhere from 1/2 hour to 2 hours per hand. After you have been doing this exercise for several weeks, you may look at the paper occasionally to reposition your pencil. But do not move the pencil until you are again looking away.

==== Gesture drawings ====

In figure drawing, a gesture drawing is a very fast sketch--one or two lines at most--describing the primary motion or position of the body. A series of gesture drawings are usually sketched out in rapid succession as a warm-up prior to the start of a figure drawing class or session.

A gesture drawing does not show the surface details of an object, rather the forces that are contained within that object. Like contour drawing, it involves an almost complete loss of conscious thought and allows you simply to react to what you see. (from [The Animation Learner's Site])

Exercise (also from [The Animation Learner's Site]): Take any complicated object. A live model (clothed or nude) is best, but a flower, plant, pet, ribbon, or any other organically shaped object should do fine. (I would not recommend using your hand this time, as gesture drawing is very physical and involves the whole upper body and you will not be able to keep your hand still). Set your timer to 15 seconds. Yup, you heard right. You've got 15 seconds to draw the object in front of you. After the time is up, move the object or get the model to change poses. Repeat a minimum of ten times. Now set your timer to 30 seconds and repeat 5-10 times. Now set it to two minutes and repeat about five-ten times. Note that your drawing speed should NOT CHANGE; when you have 2 minutes you should draw like you have fifteen seconds.

==== Breaking images into shapes ====

The basis of all realistic drawing technique is solid geometry. One who draws well has an aptitude for conceiving an object as an inter-relation of component geometric solids. For example, a human leg may be conceived as a composite of rectangular shapes, or it may be conceived as a series of ovoid shapes--or a combination of the two. The choice the artist makes contributes to what is ultimately known as his or her ''style''.

==== Drawing using negative space ====

Do not try to draw the shape of the ball, draw the negative space around it.

==== Proportion through measurement ====

When rendering an object, an artist is in a constant state of analysis. Every object exists in relation to an adjacent object.

==== Drawing a ball ====

The seemingly simple exercise of drawing a ball so that it appears to be three-dimensional permits you to analyze and solve virtually every lighting analysis problem you will encounter when trying to render a figure realistically.

'''Potato Chips''' (''crisps'' in the UK), are [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatos]]. Most chips have [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] on them. Chips are thinner and more cooked than [[Cookbook:French Fries|French fries]], making them crunchy. In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], &quot;chip&quot; usually refers [[Cookbook:French Fries|french fries]].</text>

[[Image:Kiwi aka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|kiwifruit]]

The '''kiwifruit''' (or '''kiwi'''&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that to a New Zealander, the kiwi is the flightless and endangered national bird. So, it is best to avoid talking about eating a kiwi with them. Also, kiwi is used as a general term for a New Zealander, that is another reason why they call the fruit the kiwifruit instead.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It is the size of a large hens [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], and a is grown only in temperate climates. Kiwifruit flesh is said to taste and feel vaguely like strawberries, but with a strong green taste. When canned, kiwifruit become mushy and lose their color.

Raw kiwifruit is also rich in the protein-dissolving enzyme actinidin, which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer but can be an allergen for some individuals. Specifically, people allergic to papayas or pineapples are likely to be allergic to kiwifruit also.

This enzyme, which is quickly destroyed by boiling the fruit, makes raw kiwifruit unfit for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products. The enzyme will start to dissolve the milk proteins within a few minutes, leaving a very unpleasant bitter taste. However, sliced kiwifruit may be used as a garnish atop whipped cream as on one of New Zealand's favourite desserts, the [[Cookbook:Pavlova|pavlova]], without ill effects.

[[Image:Grappe_de_figues_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of [[fig]]s on a [[fig tree]]]]

The '''fig''' is a fruit. Though exquisite when fresh and ripe, it spoils far too quickly to make fresh fruit practical. Figs are usually available in dried form. There are two main types of fig, the small dark ones (mission figs) and the large pale ones (all others: calimyrna, kadota, brown turkey, etc.). Most dried figs are mission figs, but the other types generally taste a little better.

The fig is actually a flower inverted into itself, sometimes needing to be polinated by a wasp that crawls inside through the bottom hole.

Figs are highly nutritious. One serving of figs is 40 [[Cookbook:g|grams]], about ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], or about 3 Calimyrna figs or about 4 to 5 Mission figs. Figs are high in [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]], providing 20% of the Daily Value — more dietary fiber per serving than any other common dried or fresh fruit.

==Availability, selection, and storage==
Fresh figs are available July through September. Dried figs are never out of season, and are available all year. You can find them in your favorite grocery store in the produce or dried fruit section. Look for fresh figs that are soft and smell sweet. Handle carefully because their fragile skins bruise easily. You can store fully ripened figs in the refrigerator up to 2 days, assuming the store didn't already do so. Bring the figs to room temperature before serving.

The '''peach''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Peach flesh tastes and feels somewhat like [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]] flesh. Freestone peaches have flesh that separates easily from the pit. Cling peaches have flesh that clings to the pit. Cling peaches taste a bit better, but might not be worth the trouble. Peaches are fuzzy on the outside; some people will want to peel off the skin.

Choose peaches with a strong and pleasant smell. Peaches will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell. Do not refrigerate peaches.

[[Image:Apricots.jpg|thumb|right|200px|apricot]]

The '''apricot''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Apricots have loose pits that are fairly smooth. Apricots are plum-sized at most, sometimes smaller.

Apricots do not keep well. Most apricots are picked while very unripe, and never develop much apricot flavor. When ripe, an apricot is very soft but not mushy. Apricots are easy to bruise. Do not refrigerate apricots.

Apricots are commonly used in [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]].

To cut an apricot, slice around its seam, twist it in half, and lift out the pit. Be gentle.

When fresh apricots aren't in season, dried apricots are often available. Choose brown ones (without [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]]) if you can find them. Choose tough chewy ones over soft ones. Soft ones have a less intense flavor, more water, and often added glycerin.

Freeze-dried apricots are crunchy and extremely sweet.

==Seasonality==

{{Seasonality|Apricots|1|1|1|1|3|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}
The peak season for apricots falls in in the early summer (May through July on the northern hemisphere). [http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking/fd/features/article/0,13803,228653,00.html][http://www.produceoasis.com/TipOTDay_folder/Tips_folder/Jul15tip.html]

In North America, Apricots are available throughout the year from different regions:
* Mid-February through mid-March from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]]
* Mid-June through mid-July from [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]
* Mid-July through mid-August from Washington

[[Image:Bananas.svg|thumb|right|200px|bananas]]

The '''banana''' is a mildly sweet tropical fruit related to the starchy [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantain]].

Bananas are always picked green. When green, they have a &quot;green&quot; taste somewhat like [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|kiwifruit]]. Banana ripening is triggered by ethylene gas, and causes the release of ethylene gas. Most types of fruit will ripen when placed in a bag with ripening bananas. As bananas ripen, they turn yellow and then get brown spots that eventually merge to make the banana completely dark brown. A banana is generally best from immediately after the spots appear until the spots begin to merge, but this is a matter of personal preference.  Firm is better for eating out of hand or in fresh fruit recipes, softer and riper is generally better for baking.

Bananas are very easy to bruise. Bruises will make a banana brown and mushy on the inside.

Refrigeration causes the outside of the peel to turn dark prematurely.  Frozen bananas can be eaten as a treat (coated in chocolate), or defrosted for baking.

Dried banana chips are often available. Choose brown ones (without [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]]) if you can find them.

The banana is a rich source of potassium. The banana helps prevent both constipation and diarrhoea.

Bananas are relatively high in calories (a medium-sized banana has about 110 calories).  But they are a nutrient-dense food, contributing to a healthy diet by providing not only potassium but also calcium, carotene, vitamin C, vitamin B6, etc.

If substitution is desired, use [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|pawpaws]] instead of bananas. Pawpaws are generally more nutritious than bananas.

Green bananas can be used as a vegetable, and cooked by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Banana|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3}}
Bananas are a typical non-seasonal fruit, which means they are available fresh all year. They are usually grown in tropical countries.

[[Image:Ananas pflanze.jpg|thumb|right|200px|pineapple]]

The '''pineapple''' is a very sweet tropical fruit. It can be up to 1 foot tall. Pineapple is commonly eaten fresh, in desserts, or cooked as part of a sauce or glaze.

When buying fresh pineapple, choose a good-smelling fruit that feels solid. The topmost leaves should be a bit loose (meaning ripe) and not browning (meaning too old). There should not be a yeasty smell at the bottom.

When buying canned pineapple, choose pineapple packed in juice. Name-brand pineapple is sweeter, and thus better suited for eating without added sugar. The cheaper store-brand pineapple is fine for baking.

==Carving a fresh pineapple==
#Twist out the top. The top may be planted if you want a 4' (1.2[[Cookbook:m|m]]) diameter thorny bush that requires a couple years of frost-free weather. You'd also get a tall stalk, covered in lovely blue flowers, that turns into a pineapple.
#Slice away the skin. The best tasting pineapple is right under the surface, so don't cut too deeply.
#Carve out the &quot;eyes&quot;. These flower holes contain enzymes that can cause mouth irritation; they digest ''you'' a little bit. (pineapples can get revenge)
#Slice the pineapple the long way. Make 6 to 12 (8 is easy) wedges with the core along one edge of each wedge.
#Cut the core away from each wedge.
#Chop up the wedges as desired. The bottom part is sweetest and most likely to be spoiled.

== Seasonality ==

{{Seasonality|Pineapple|1|1|2|3|3|2|1|1|1|1|1|1}}

Pineapples have their peak season near the end of spring. In some locations, like Hawaii, they are available all year round.

'''Applesauce''' is mostly ground-up [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]. Acid, particularly [[Cookbook:Citric Acid|citric acid]], is often added for a sour flavor and to reduce browning.

Applesauce is often eaten warm with a bit of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]] sprinkled on top.

[[Image:Papaya.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Papayas]]                    
[[Image:Carica_papaya_-_papaya_-_var-tropical_dwarf_papaya_-_desc-fruit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Papayas]]                    

The '''papaya''' is a [[Cookbook:Melon|melon]]-like tropical [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with yellow-orange flesh enclosed in a thin skin that varies in color from green to orange to rose.

The papaya contains an enzyme called papain that is a meat tenderizer. It breaks down tough meat fibers. It is sold as a component in powdered meat tenderizer available in most supermarkets. Some people react badly to this when eating papaya.

==Selection==
Look for papayas that are partly or completely yellow in color, depending on variety, that give slightly to pressure, but are not soft at the stem-end. Avoid papayas that are bruised, shriveled, or have soft areas. Papayas that are hard and green are immature and will not ripen properly. Uncut papayas have no smell. Papayas that are cut should smell sweet, not bad or fermented.

==Storage==
Slightly green papayas will ripen quickly at room temperature, especially if placed in a paper bag. As the papaya ripens, it will turn from green to yellow. Place ripe papayas in a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator. Papayas will keep for up to a week, but it's best to use them within a day or two.

==Varieties==
There are two types of papayas, the Hawaiian and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]]. The Hawaiian varieties, also known as Solo papayas, are found most often in supermarkets. These fruits are pear-shaped, weigh about a [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] each, and have yellow skin when ripe. The flesh is bright orange or pinkish, depending on the variety. The Mexican varieties are not as common but can be found in Latino supermarkets. Mexican papayas are much larger then the Hawaiian types and can weigh up to 20 pounds and be more than 15 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long. Although the flavor is less intense than the Hawaiian varieties, they are still delicious and enjoyable.</text>

The '''cherry''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]].

Cherries are commonly available as:

*Fresh Fruit
*Dried
*Maraschino Cherries in Jars (dyed bright red)
*Canned (usually dark purple and soft)

When choosing fresh cherries, pick hard red ones if you prefer sour cherries that will last. Pick soft purple ones if you prefer sweet cherries. The stems should be green.

Maraschino cherries are a popular topping for [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]].

[[Image:PersimmonPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|Hachiya Persimmon]]                    
[[Image:Fuyu_persimmon.jpg|thumb|left|Fuyu Persimmon]]
The '''persimmon''' is a fruit that has fallen out of fashion for its poor keeping qualities. There are two main types, the tall ''Hachiya'' type and the short squat ''Fuyu'' type. Choose persimmons that are very soft but not mushy, and be very careful not to bruise them.

Although there are countless different varieties of persimmons, only two are commercially available. There are distinguishable by their shape.

*'''Hachiya:''' This type of persimmon makes up approximately 90 percent of the available fruit. It is identifiable by its acorn like shape. This persimmon is tart until it becomes soft ripe.

*'''Fuyu:''' This persimmon is gaining popularity here as it is in Japan. Similar in color, but looking like a squashed tomato, this variety is smaller, sweeter, and is edible while still firm.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
==Availability, Selection, Storage, Preparation==
Persimmons are widely available September through December, with a peak during November.

Choose persimmons with deep red undertones. Look for persimmons that are round, plump, and have glossy and smooth skin. Avoid fruits with blemishes, bruises or cracked skin and missing the green leaves at the top. Select ripe persimmons only if you plan to eat them immediately. Otherwise, buy firmer fruits and allow them to ripen.

Ripen persimmons at room temperature in a paper bag with an apple or banana. Store them in the refrigerator when ripe. Be sure to eat the fruit as soon as possible because overripe persimmons quickly turn to a mushy texture.

Ripe Fuyu persimmons, which look kind of like flattened tomatoes, will be crisp, while the acorn-shaped Hachiyas will be very soft and juicy.

Unripe Hachiya persimmons taste very bitter and will suck all the moisture from your mouth — not very pleasant. The tartness will go away as the fruit ripens.</text>

[[Image:Plums hanging.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plums on the tree]]
[[Image:Plums in basket.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plums in a basket]]
The '''plum''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]].

Choose plums with a pleasant smell. It's common for plums to develop a yeast growth on the surface, like grapes. Plums will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell, like other fruits. They benefit more than most fruits from being picked when absolutely ripe, but before the wasps get them, and plums sold in supermarkets tend to have been picked too early, which means they suffer less damage in transit, but never develop the full taste and fragrance. 

When chopped up and boiled down with sugar, plums make an excellent topping for [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]].

Plums can also be used very effectively with [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]]. Try using a purée flavoured with [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]] and [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

Dried plums are called prunes.

==Seasonality==

Plums are a typical summer fruit. Early-season varieties will start halfway through May (in the northern hemisphere), whereas later season varieties will be harvested until the third week of August. Some late varieties keep well enough to last until late November. [http://www.producepete.com/shows/plums.html]

The '''strawberry''' is a small sweet fruit.

Choose red strawberries, being careful to avoid any signs of rot. Rotting strawberries tend to have mushy spots that may be discolored and sunken, often turning a bit violet or lavender. Unripe strawberries tend to be pale, sometimes almost white.

When chopped up and boiled down with sugar, strawberries make a good topping for [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]].

Strawberries are used on several occasions, like [[cake]].

I added a couple of links to places where mason bees could be purchased. I am in no way affiliated with these retailers. I simply added them as a convenience, as mason bees are not necessarily the easiest thing to find for sale. I also want to mention that I have not purchased bees from either of these places, and don’t guarantee the quality of their stock. Rather I built a mason bee house (the one pictured in the module) and was lucky enough to have a few feral ones move in on their own (one of the residents is also pictured on the module).
--[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 04:22, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)

==Request for regional info==
From the mason bee article I found out mason bees are native to Japan and North America. I was wondering if the info on the page could be similarly used for similar bees found in Europe (if any)? --[[User:Egregius|Egregius]] ([[User talk:Egregius|talk]]) 21:26, 11 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

This is a classically inspired steak recipe, with influences from both [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] and [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisine]].

==Ingredients==
* Two 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (225 g) [[Cookbook:Beef|sirloin steaks]]
* [[cookbook:Montreal Steak Seasoning|Montreal steak seasoning]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|Cabernet Sauvignon]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* 8-10 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* ⅓ large white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 cloves [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 tbsp extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Dice the onion, shallots and garlic. Set these aside. 
# Pre-heat a medium-sized [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] to low-medium heat and pre-heat the barbecue to high.
# Throw the onions in the pan and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until light yellow. 
# Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sauté for a few minutes more. Make sure all ingredients are lightly crisped.
# Pour in about ⅓ of the wine and ⅓ of the vinegar. Let this simmer and reduce at a lower heat for about 5-10 minutes.
# Place the steaks on the [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]], seasoning with the Montreal steak spice.
# Add the rest of the wine and vinegar and season by sprinkling some fresh black pepper on top. Boil off until you no longer smell the alcohol coming from the steaming wine.
# Flip the steaks. You want them to be soft on the inside (cooked rare) yet quite charred on the outside, to get that charcoal flavor.
# Once the sauce has gone down to about ⅓ of its original volume, take off heat.
# Remove steaks from grill and take inside.

Place the steaks on your plates, cover with the sauce and serve!

You may wish to serve this flavourful dish with a side that compliments its strong flavors such as [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], new [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], or roasted [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]].

Serves two people.

There are several kinds of '''walnut''', the Persian walnut (by far the most common), the Black walnut (more flavorful and expensive), the Butternut, the Japanese walnut and others. Walnuts are very similar to [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]].

Walnuts go well with [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], making an excellent [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]] topping.

'''Hazelnuts''' are the nut of the common hazel. They are often used in [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] in combination with [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]].

==How to Skin and Roast Hazelnuts==

# Add 3 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (sodium bicarbonate) to 2 cups boiling water; 
# Add the nuts and blanch for 10 minutes. The baking soda neutralizes the acid skins, which can then be removed easily.
#Drain the nuts in a sieve and rinse with cold water.
#Place the nuts in a container of cold water.
#Remove the skins under running water and place peeled nuts in the sieve over a container.
#When all the nuts are peeled, dry them off by patting handfuls in paper towels.
#Salt the nuts to taste while still damp (optional). 
#To roast the hazelnuts, place skinned nuts on a baking sheet in a 275ºF oven for  20 - 30 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes.

To help slough off the skins after the hot and cold water process, rub between terry towels.

'''Crawfish''' are crustaceans related to [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], and [[Cookbook:Krill|krill]]. Crayfish are sometimes known as '''crawdads''', '''mudbugs''', or '''crayfish'''.

Crawfish can be found in muddy holes on the edge of a stream or pond, either above or below the waterline. They can pinch quite well.

Crawfish are usually [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole, often with boil seasoning in the water.
Most of the meat is in the tail and head, but some meat may be sucked out of the claws.

'''Emmental''', or ''Emmentaler'', is the cheese widely known as ''Swiss cheese'' in [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North America]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. It is a yellow, medium-hard cheese with a mildly tangy flavour from lactic acid fermentation. It is characterised by large holes left by gas bubbles produced during fermentation of the cheese.

Much of the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; produced under that name, and not designated Emmentaler, is in fact a processed cheese that is not made to the traditional Emmentaler process.</text>

The '''almond''' comes from the pit of a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]]. Bitter almonds, and the seeds of the related fruits, contain high levels of the poison cyanide. Normal almonds are safe to eat.

To remove the brown peels, [[cookbook:blanch|blanch]] the almonds (briefly plunge them into boiling water) and then put them in cold water. The peels will become loose enough to slip off.

Almonds go well with [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], or [[Cookbook:White Mountain Frosting|white mountain frosting]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Almonds|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1}}

{{spice}}

'''Asafoetida''' (''Ferula asafoetida''), is a dark amber resin which comes from the dried sap from the stem and roots of this wild fennel. The most commonly available form is '''compounded asafoetida''', a fine powder containing 30% asafoetida resin, along with [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Gum arabic|gum arabic]]. It is mainly grown in Iran, Afghanistan, and Kashmir.

This spice is used as a digestive aid and in pickles. Its odour is so strong that it must be stored in airtight containers; otherwise, it spoils other foodstuffs. It loses its smell in cooking, however, and presents an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]-like taste. In India, it is used especially by the Brahmin caste of the Hindus and by adherents of Jainism, who are not allowed to eat onions.

== Back to the real world ==

Beyond internally calculating values, we want our programs to interact with the world. The most common beginners' program in any language simply displays a &quot;hello world&quot; greeting on the screen. Here's a Haskell version:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; putStrLn &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; is one of the standard Prelude tools. As the &quot;putStr&quot; part of the name suggests, it takes a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; as an argument and prints it to the screen. We could use &lt;code&gt;putStr&lt;/code&gt; on its own, but we usually include the &quot;Ln&quot; part so to also print a line break. Thus, whatever else is printed next will appear on a new line.

So now you should be thinking, &quot;what is the type of the putStrLn function?&quot; It takes a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and gives… um… what? What do we call that? The program doesn't get something back that it can use in another function. Instead, the result involves having the computer change the screen. In other words, it does something in the world outside of the program. What type could that have? Let's see what GHCi tells us:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t putStrLn
putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;IO&quot; stands for &quot;input and output&quot;. Wherever there is &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in a type, interaction with the world outside the program is involved. We'll call these &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; values ''actions''. The other part of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; type, in this case &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, is the type of the return value of the action; that is, the type of what it gives back to the program (as opposed to what it does outside the program). &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced as &quot;unit&quot;) is a type that only contains one value also called &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; (effectively a tuple with zero elements). Since &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; sends output to the world but doesn't return anything to the program, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; is used as a placeholder. We might read &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;action which returns &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

A few more examples of when we use IO:

*  print a string to the screen
*  read a string from a keyboard
*  write data to a file
*  read data from a file

What makes IO actually work? Lots of things happen behind the scenes to take us from &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; to pixels in the screen, but we don't need to understand any of the details to write our programs. A complete Haskell program is actually a big IO action. In a compiled program, this action is called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. From this point of view, to write a Haskell program is to combine actions and functions to form the overall action &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; that will be executed when the program is run. The compiler takes care of instructing the computer on how to do this.

{{Exercises|1=
Back in the Type Basics chapter, we mentioned that the type of the [[Haskell/Type_basics#Real world example: openWindow|&lt;code&gt;openWindow&lt;/code&gt; function]] had been simplified. Can you guess what the simplification was?
}}

== Sequencing actions with ''do'' ==

'''do''' notation provides a convenient means of putting actions together (which is essential in doing useful things with Haskell). Consider the following program:

{{HaskellExample|1=What is your name?|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStr &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

{{body note|1=
Even though &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation looks very different from the Haskell code we have seen so far, it is just syntactic sugar for a handful of functions, the most important of them being the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; operator. We could explain how those functions work and ''then'' introduce &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. However, there are several topics we would need to cover before we can give a convincing explanation. Jumping in with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; right now is a pragmatic short cut that will allow you to start writing complete programs with IO right away. We will see why &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; works later in the book, beginning with the [[../Understanding monads/]] chapter. 
}}

Before we get into how ''do'' works, take a look at &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;. It goes to the outside world (to the terminal in this case) and brings back a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. What is its type?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t getLine
getLine :: IO String
&lt;/source&gt;

That means &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; is an IO action that, when run, will return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. But what about the input? While functions have types like &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; which reflect that they take arguments and give back results, &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; doesn't actually take an argument. It takes as input whatever is in the line in the terminal. However, that line in the outside world isn't a defined value with a type until we bring it into the Haskell program.

The program doesn't know the state of the outside world until runtime, so it cannot predict the exact results of IO actions. To manage the relationship of these IO actions to other aspects of a program, the actions must be executed in a predictable sequence defined in advance in the code. With regular functions that do not perform IO, the exact sequencing of execution is less of an issue — as long as the results eventually go to the right places.

In our name program, we're sequencing three actions: a &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; with a greeting, a &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;, and another &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;. With the &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;, we use &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation which assigns a variable name to stand for the returned value. We cannot know what the value will be in advance, but we know it will use the specified variable name, so we can then use the variable elsewhere (in this case, to prepare the final message being printed). The final action defines the type of the whole &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block. Here, the final action is the result of a &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt;, and so our whole program has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Exercises|1=
Write a program which asks the user for the base and height of a right angled triangle, calculates its area, and prints it to the screen.
The interaction should look something like:
&lt;pre&gt;
The base?
3.3
The height?
5.4
The area of that triangle is 8.91
&lt;/pre&gt;
You will need to use the function &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; to convert user strings like &quot;3.3&quot; into numbers like 3.3 and the function &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to convert a number into string.
}}

=== Left arrow clarifications ===

While actions like &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; are almost always used to get values, we are not obliged to actually get them. For example, we could write something like this:

{{HaskellExample|1=executing &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; directly|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this case, we don't use the input at all, but we still give the user the experience of entering their name. By omitting the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;, the action will happen, but the data won't be stored or accessible to the program.

==== &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; can be used with any action except the last ====

There are very few restrictions on which actions can have values
obtained from them. Consider the following example where we put the
results of each action into a variable (except the last...  more on that
later):

{{HaskellExample|1=putting all results into a variable|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  x &lt;- putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; gets the value out
of its action, but that isn't useful in this case because
the action returns the unit value &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.  So while we could technically get the value out
of any action, it isn't always worth it.

So, what about the final action?  Why can't we get a value out of that?  Let's see what happens
when we try:

{{HaskellExample|1=getting the value out of the last action|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  x &lt;- putStrLn &quot;Please enter your name: &quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  y &lt;- putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;, how are you?&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Whoops! Error!
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
HaskellWikibook.hs:5:2:
    The last statement in a 'do' construct must be an expression
}}
}}

Making sense of this requires a somewhat deeper understanding of Haskell than we currently have. Suffice it to
say, whenever you use &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; to get the value of an action, Haskell is always expecting another action to follow it.
So the final action cannot have any &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;s.

=== Controlling actions ===

Normal Haskell constructions like &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
can be used within the &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt; notation, but you need to take some
care here. For instance, in a simple &quot;guess the number&quot; program, we have:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;
                    doGuessing num
            else putStrLn &quot;You Win!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember that the &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt; construction takes three arguments:
the condition, the &quot;then&quot; branch, and the &quot;else&quot; branch. The condition needs to have type &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;,
and the two branches can have any type, provided that they have the ''same'' type. The type of the entire &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
construction is then the type of the two branches.

In the outermost comparison, we have &lt;code&gt;(read guess) &lt; num&lt;/code&gt; as the condition.
That has the correct type. Let's now consider the &quot;then&quot; branch. The code here is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
          do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we are sequencing two actions: &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt;. The first has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is fine  The
second also has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is fine. The type result of the
entire computation is precisely the type of the final computation.
Thus, the type of the &quot;then&quot; branch is also &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. A similar
argument shows that the type of the &quot;else&quot; branch is also &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.
This means the type of the entire &lt;tt&gt;'''if/then/else'''&lt;/tt&gt;
construction is &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which is what we want.

Note: be careful if you find yourself thinking, &quot;Well, I already started
a &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt; block; I don't need another one.&quot; We can't have code like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    do if (read guess) &lt; num
         then putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
              doGuessing num
         else ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, since we didn't repeat the &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt;, the compiler doesn't know
that the &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; calls are supposed to be
sequenced, and the compiler will think you're trying to call
&lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; with three arguments: the string, the function
&lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; and the integer &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt;, and thus reject the program.

{{Exercises|1=
Write a program that asks the user for his or her name.  If the name is
one of Simon, John or Phil, tell the user that you think Haskell is a

}}

== Actions under the microscope ==

Actions may look easy up to now, but they are a common stumbling block for new Haskellers. If you have run into trouble working with actions, see if any of your problems or questions match any of the cases below. We suggest skimming this section now, then come back here when you actually experience trouble.

=== Mind your action types ===

One temptation might be to simplify our program for getting a name and printing it back out. Here is one unsuccessful attempt:

{{HaskellExample|Why doesn't this work?|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn &quot;What is your name? &quot;
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ getLine)
&lt;/source&gt;

Ouch! Error!

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
HaskellWikiBook.hs:3:26:
    Couldn't match expected type `[Char]'
           against inferred type `IO String'
}}
}}

Let us boil the example above down to its simplest form. Would you expect this program to compile?

{{HaskellExample|1=This still does not work|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn getLine
&lt;/source&gt;}}

For the most part, this is the same (attempted) program, except that we've stripped off the superfluous &quot;What is your name&quot; prompt as well as the polite &quot;Hello&quot;.  One trick to understanding this is to reason about it in terms of types.  Let us compare:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()
 getLine  :: IO String
&lt;/source&gt;
We can use the same mental machinery we learned in [[../Type basics/]] to figure how this went wrong. &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; is expecting a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; as input. We do not have a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;; we have something tantalisingly close: an &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt;. This represents an action that will ''give'' us a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; when it's run. To obtain the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; wants, we need to run the action, and we do that with the ever-handy left arrow, &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;.

{{HaskellExample|1=This time it works|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn name
&lt;/source&gt;

Working our way back up to the fancy example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do putStrLn &quot;What is your name? &quot;
    name &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ name)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Now the name is the String we are looking for and everything is rolling again.

=== Mind your expression types too ===

So, we've made a big deal out of the idea that you can't use actions in situations that don't call for them. The converse of this is that you can't use non-actions in situations that expect actions. Say we want to greet the user, but this time we're so excited to meet them, we just have to SHOUT their name out:
{{HaskellExample|1=Exciting but incorrect.  Why?|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char (toUpper)

main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    loudName &lt;- makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (&quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot; ++ loudName)

-- Don't worry too much about this function; it just capitalizes a String
makeLoud :: String -&gt; String
makeLoud s = map toUpper s
&lt;/source&gt;

This goes wrong...
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
    Couldn't match expected type `IO' against inferred type `[]'
      Expected type: IO t
      Inferred type: String
    In a 'do' expression: loudName &lt;- makeLoud name
}}
}}

This is similar to the problem we ran into above: we've got a mismatch between something expecting an IO type and something which does not produce IO. This time, the trouble is the left arrow &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;; we're trying to left-arrow a value of &lt;code&gt;makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt;, which really isn't left arrow material. It's basically the same mismatch we saw in the previous section, except now we're trying to use regular old String (the loud name) as an IO String. The latter is an action, something to be run, whereas the former is just an expression minding its own business. We cannot simply use &lt;code&gt;loudName = makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt; because a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; sequences ''actions'', and &lt;code&gt;loudName = makeLoud name&lt;/code&gt; is not an action.

So how do we extricate ourselves from this mess?  We have a number of options:
* We could find a way to turn &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; into an action, to make it return &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt;. However, we don't want to make actions go out into the world for no reason. Within our program, we can reliably verify how everything is working. When actions engage the outside world, our results are much less predictable. An IO &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; would be misguided. Consider another issue too: what if we wanted to use makeLoud from some other, non-IO, function? We really don't want to engage IO actions except when absolutely necessary.
* We could use a special code called &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; to promote the loud name into an action, writing something like &lt;code&gt;loudName &lt;- return (makeLoud name)&lt;/code&gt;. This is slightly better. We at least leave the &lt;code&gt;makeLoud&lt;/code&gt; function itself nice and IO-free whilst using it in an IO-compatible fashion. That's still moderately clunky because, by virtue of left arrow, we're implying that there's action to be had -- how exciting! -- only to let our reader down with a somewhat anticlimactic &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; (note: we will learn more about appropriate uses for &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; in later chapters).
* Or we could use a let binding...

It turns out that Haskell has a special extra-convenient syntax for let bindings in actions. It looks a little like this:

{{HaskellExample|1=&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks.|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (&quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot; ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

If you're paying attention, you might notice that the let binding above is missing an &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings inside &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks do not require the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword. You could very well use it, but then you'd have messy extra do blocks. For what it's worth, the following two blocks of code are equivalent.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!|sweet
!|unsweet
|-
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
    putStrLn (
        &quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot;
            ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 do name &lt;- getLine
    let loudName = makeLoud name
    in  do putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ loudName ++ &quot;!&quot;)
           putStrLn (
               &quot;Oh boy! Am I excited to meet you, &quot;
                   ++ loudName)
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

{{Exercises|
# Why does the unsweet version of the let binding require an extra &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; keyword?
# Do you always need the extra &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;?
# (extra credit) Curiously, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; is exactly how we wrote things when we were playing with the interpreter in the beginning of this book. Why is it ok to omit the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword in the interpreter but needed (outside of ''do'' blocks) in a source file?

== Learn more ==

At this point, you have the fundamentals needed to do some fancier input/output. Here are some IO-related topics you may want to check in parallel with the main track of this course.
* You could continue the sequential track, learning more about [[../Type Declarations/|types]] and eventually [[../Understanding monads/|monads]].
* Alternately: you could start learning about building graphical user interfaces in the [[../GUI/]] chapter
* For more IO-related functionality, you could also consider learning more about the [[../Hierarchical libraries/IO|System.IO library]]

Krummelpap is traditionally eaten at breakfast, mostly with a bit of milk, butter, and sugar, or at dinner, where it is served with a sauce like gravy.

It is slowly cooked on a stove.

==Ingredients==
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*250 ml water (boiling/hot) or more as needed
*700 ml maize

==Procedure==
#Add maize and salt to a large pot (like the one used for rice).
#Add a third of the water and mix with a fork so that it makes little balls or crumbs.
#Add more water but only a little at a time while mixing. Make sure that you don't add too much water.
#Put the stove on a LOW heat and stir with a fork every 10 minutes. Keep the lid on; it is the steam that cooks the maize.
#Taste it after 35 minutes to test if it is done. If it still tastes like maize, leave it - the wonder of this porridge is that you can't overcook, but you can burn it.
#It takes approximately 50 minutes to cook.

== Folds ==

Like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, a ''fold'' is a higher order function that takes a function and a list. However, instead of applying the function element by element, the fold uses it to combine the list elements into a result value.

Let's look at a few concrete examples. &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; could be implemented as:

{{HaskellExample|sum|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sum :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
sum []     = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

and &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; as:

{{HaskellExample|product|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
product :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
product []     = 1
product (x:xs) = x * product xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

&lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a list of lists and joins (concatenates) them into one:

{{HaskellExample|concat|&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
concat :: [[a]] -&gt; [a]
concat []     = []
concat (x:xs) = x ++ concat xs&lt;/source&gt;}}

All these examples show a pattern of recursion known as a fold. Think of the name referring to a list getting &quot;folded up&quot; into a single value or to a function being &quot;folded between&quot; the elements of the list.

Prelude defines four &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; functions: &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt;.

=== foldr ===

The ''right-associative'' &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; folds up a list from the right to left. As it proceeds, foldr uses the given function to combine each of the element with the running value called the ''accumulator''. When calling foldr, the initial value of the accumulator is set as an argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr            :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
foldr f acc []     = acc
foldr f acc (x:xs) = f x (foldr f acc xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument to &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; is a function with two arguments. The second argument is value for the accumulator (which starts at a neutral &quot;zero&quot; value). The third argument is the list to be folded.

In &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. In many cases (like all of our examples so far), the function passed to a fold will be one that takes two arguments of the same type, but this is not necessarily the case (as we can see from the &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; b -&gt; b)&lt;/code&gt; part of the type signature — if the types ''had'' to be the same, the first two letters in the type signature would have matched).

Remember, a list in Haskell written as &lt;code&gt;[a, b, c]&lt;/code&gt; is an alternative (syntactic sugar) style for &lt;code&gt;a : b : c : []&lt;/code&gt;.

Now, &lt;code&gt;foldr f acc xs&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; definition simply replaces each cons (:) in the &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; list with the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; while replacing the empty list at the end with &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr f acc (a:b:c:[]) = f a (f b (f c acc))
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how the parentheses nest around the right end of the list.

An elegant visualisation is given by picturing the list data structure as a tree:
   :                         f
  / \                       / \
 a   :       foldr f acc   a   f
    / \    -------------&gt;     / \
   b   :                     b   f
      / \                       / \
     c  []                     c   acc

We can see here that &lt;code&gt;foldr (:) []&lt;/code&gt; will return the list completely unchanged. That sort of function that has no effect is called an ''identity function''. You should start building a habit of looking for identity functions in different cases, and we'll discuss them more later when we learn about ''monoids''.

=== foldl ===

The ''left-associative'' &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; processes the list in the opposite direction, starting at the left side with the first element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl            :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; a
foldl f acc []     =  acc
foldl f acc (x:xs) =  foldl f (f acc x) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

So, brackets in the resulting expression accumulate around the left end of the list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl f acc (a:b:c:[]) = f (f (f acc a) b) c
&lt;/source&gt;

The corresponding trees look like:
   :                            f
  / \                          / \
 a   :       foldl f acc      f   c
    / \    -------------&gt;    / \
   b   :                    f   b 
      / \                  / \
     c  []                acc a

Because all folds include both left and right elements, beginners can get confused by the names. You could think of foldr as short for fold-right-to-left and foldl as fold-left-to-right. The names refer to where the fold starts.

{{body note|1=
''Technical Note'': foldl is ''tail-recursive'', that is, it recurses
immediately, calling itself. For this reason the compiler will optimise it to a
simple loop for efficiency. However, Haskell is a lazy language, so the calls to
''f'' will be left unevaluated by default, thus building up an unevaluated
expression in memory that includes the entire length of the list. To avoid
running out of memory, we have a version of foldl called &lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt;
that is ''strict'' — it forces the evaluation of ''f'' immediately at each step.

An apostrophe at the end of a function name is pronounced &quot;tick&quot; as in
&quot;fold-L-tick&quot;. A tick is a valid character in Haskell identifiers.
&lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt; can be found in the &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt; library module
(imported by adding &lt;code&gt;import Data.List&lt;/code&gt; to the beginning of a source
file). As a rule of thumb, you should use &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; on lists that might
be infinite or where the fold is building up a data structure and use
&lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt; if the list is known to be finite and comes down to a single
value. There is almost never a good reason to use &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; (without
the tick), though it might just work if the lists fed to it are not too long.
}}

''

=== foldr1 and foldl1 ===

As previously noted, the type declaration for &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; makes it quite possible for the list elements and result to be of different types. For example, &quot;read&quot; is a function that takes a string and converts it into some type (the type system is smart enough to figure out which one). In this case we convert it into a float.

{{HaskellExample|The list elements and results can have different types|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
addStr :: String -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
addStr str x = read str + x

sumStr :: [String] -&gt; Float
sumStr = foldr addStr 0.0&lt;/source&gt;
}}

There is also a variant called &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;fold - R - one&quot;) which dispenses with an explicit &quot;zero&quot; for an accumulator by taking the last element of the list instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr1           :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
foldr1 f [x]     =  x
foldr1 f (x:xs)  =  f x (foldr1 f xs)
foldr1 _ []      =  error &quot;Prelude.foldr1: empty list&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

And &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt; as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl1           :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
foldl1 f (x:xs)  =  foldl f x xs
foldl1 _ []      =  error &quot;Prelude.foldl1: empty list&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note: Just like for foldl, the Data.List library includes foldl1' as a strict version of foldl1.''

With foldl1 and foldr1, all the types have to be the same, and an empty list is an error. These variants are useful when there is no obvious candidate for the initial accumulator value and we are sure that the list is not going to be empty. When in doubt, stick with foldr or foldl'.

=== folds and laziness ===

One reason that right-associative folds are more natural in Haskell than left-associative ones is that right folds can operate on infinite lists. A fold that returns an infinite list is perfectly usable in a larger context that doesn't need to access the entire infinite result. In that case, foldr can move along as much as needed and the compiler will know when to stop. However, a left fold necessarily calls itself recursively until it reaches the end of the input list (because the recursive call is not made in an argument to f). Needless to say, no end will be reached if an input list to foldl is infinite.  

As a toy example, consider a function &lt;code&gt;echoes&lt;/code&gt; that takes a list of integers and produces a list such that wherever the number n occurs in the input list, it is replicated n times in the output list. To create our echoes function, we will use the prelude function &lt;code&gt;replicate&lt;/code&gt; in which &lt;code&gt;replicate n x&lt;/code&gt; is a list of length n with x the value of every element.

We can write echoes as a foldr quite handily:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
echoes = foldr (\ x xs -&gt; (replicate x x) ++ xs) []
take 10 (echoes [1..])     -- [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

(''Note:'' This definition is compact thanks to the &lt;code&gt;\ x xs -&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
syntax. The &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, meant to look like a lambda (λ), works as an
''unnamed'' function for cases where we won't use the function again anywhere
else. Thus, we provide the definition of our one-time function ''in situ''. In
this case, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; are the arguments, and the
right-hand side of the definition is what comes after the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.)

We could have instead used a foldl:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
echoes = foldl (\xs x -&gt; xs ++ (replicate x x)) []
take 10 (echoes [1..])     -- not terminating
&lt;/source&gt;

but only the foldr version works on an infinite lists. What would happen if you just evaluate 
&lt;code&gt;echoes [1..]&lt;/code&gt;? Try it! (If you try this in GHCi or a terminal, remember you can stop an evaluation with Ctrl-c, but you have to be quick and keep an eye on the system monitor or your memory will be consumed in no time and your system will hang.)

As a final example, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; itself can be implemented as a fold:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map f = foldr (\x xs -&gt; f x : xs) []
&lt;/source&gt;

Folding takes some time to get used to, but it is a fundamental pattern in functional programming and eventually becomes very natural. Any time you want to traverse a list and build up a result from its members, you likely want a fold.

{{Exercises|1=
#Define the following functions recursively (like the definitions for &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; above), then turn them into a fold:
#* &lt;code&gt;and :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if a list of Bools are all True, and False otherwise.
#* &lt;code&gt;or :: [Bool] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns True if any of a list of Bools are True, and False otherwise.
#Define the following functions using &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt;:
#* &lt;code&gt;maximum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the maximum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;max :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum of two values).
#* &lt;code&gt;minimum :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the minimum element of a list (hint: &lt;code&gt;min :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; returns the minimum of two values).
#Use a fold (''which one?'') to define &lt;code&gt;reverse :: [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a list with the elements in reverse order.

:Note that all of these are Prelude functions, so they will be always close at hand when you need them. (Also, that means you must use slightly different names in order to test your answers in GHCi.) 
}}

== Scans ==

A &quot;scan&quot; is like a cross between a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and a fold. Folding a list accumulates a single return value, whereas mapping puts each item through a function returning a separate result for each item. A scan does both: it accumulates a value like a fold, but instead of returning only a final value it returns a list of all the intermediate values.

Prelude contains four scan functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanl   :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; [a] 	
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; accumulates the list from the left, and the second argument becomes the first item in the resulting list. So, {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;scanl (+) 0 [1,2,3] = [0,1,3,6]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanl1  :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] 
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt; uses the first item of the list as a zero parameter. It is what you would typically use if the input and output items are the same type.  Notice the difference in the type signatures between &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;scanl1 (+) [1,2,3] = [1,3,6]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
scanr   :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
scanr (+) 0 [1,2,3] = [6,5,3,0]
scanr1  :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
scanr1 (+) [1,2,3] = [6,5,3]
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions are the counterparts of &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt; that accumulate the totals from the right.

{{Exercises|1=
# Write your own definition of &lt;code&gt;scanr&lt;/code&gt;, first using recursion, and then using &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;. Do the same for &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; first using recursion then &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt;.
# Define the following functions:
#*&lt;code&gt;factList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a list of factorials from 1 up to its argument. For example, &lt;code&gt;factList 4 = [1,2,6,24]&lt;/code&gt;.
''More to be added''}}

==filter==

A common operation performed on lists is [[Wikipedia:Filter (mathematics)|filtering]] — generating a new list composed only of elements of the first list that meet a certain condition. A simple example: making a list of only even numbers from a list of integers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
retainEven [] = []
retainEven (n:ns) =
-- mod n 2 computes the remainder for the integer division of n by 2.
  if (mod n 2) == 0
    then n : (retainEven ns)
    else retainEven ns
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition is somewhat verbose and specific. Prelude provides a concise and general &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; function with type signature:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/source&gt;

So, a &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; Bool)&lt;/code&gt; function tests an elements for some condition, we then feed in a list to be filtered, and we get back the filtered list.

To write &lt;code&gt;retainEven&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, we need to state the
condition as an auxiliary &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; Bool)&lt;/code&gt; function, like this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
isEven :: Int -&gt; Bool 
isEven n = (mod n 2) == 0
&lt;/source&gt;

And then retainEven becomes simply:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven ns = filter isEven ns
&lt;/source&gt;

We used ns instead of xs to indicate that we know these are numbers and not just anything, but we can ignore that and use a more terse point-free definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven = filter isEven
&lt;/source&gt;

This is like what we demonstrated before for &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and the folds. Like &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, those take another function as argument; and using them point-free emphasizes this &quot;functions-of-functions&quot; aspect.

==List comprehensions==

List comprehensions are syntactic sugar for some common list operations, such as filtering. For instance, instead of using the Prelude &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, we could write &lt;code&gt;retainEven&lt;/code&gt; like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainEven es = [n | n &lt;- es, isEven n]
&lt;/source&gt;

This compact syntax may look intimidating, but it is simple to break down. One interpretation is:

* (Starting from the middle) Take the list ''es'' and draw (the &quot;&lt;-&quot;) each of its elements as a value ''n''.
* (After the comma) For each drawn ''n'' test the boolean condition &lt;code&gt;isEven n&lt;/code&gt;.
* (Before the vertical bar) If (and only if) the boolean condition is satisfied, append ''n'' to the new list being created (note the square brackets around the whole expression).

Thus, if &lt;code&gt;es&lt;/code&gt; is [1,2,3,4], then we would get back the list [2,4]. 1 and 3 were not drawn because &lt;code&gt;(isEven n) == False &lt;/code&gt;. 

The power of list comprehensions comes from being easily extensible. Firstly, we
can use as many tests as we wish (even zero!). Multiple conditions are written
as a comma-separated list of expressions (which should evaluate to a Boolean, of
course). For a simple example, suppose we want to modify &lt;code&gt;retainEven&lt;/code&gt; so that only numbers larger than 100 are retained:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
retainLargeEvens :: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
retainLargeEvens es = [n | n &lt;- es, isEven n, n &gt; 100]
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, we are not limited to using &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; as the element to be appended when generating a new list. Instead, we could place any expression before the vertical bar (if it is compatible with the type of the list, of course). For instance, if we wanted to subtract one from every even number, all it would take is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evensMinusOne es = [n - 1 | n &lt;- es, isEven n]
&lt;/source&gt;

In effect, that means the list comprehension syntax incorporates the
functionalities of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;.

To further sweeten things, the left arrow notation in list comprehensions can be combined with pattern matching.  For example, suppose we had a list of &lt;code&gt;(Int, Int)&lt;/code&gt; tuples, and we would like to construct a list with the first element of every tuple whose second element is even. Using list comprehensions, we might write it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
firstForEvenSeconds :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
firstForEvenSeconds ps = [fst p | p &lt;- ps, isEven (snd p)] -- here, p is for pairs.
&lt;/source&gt;

Patterns can make it much more readable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
firstForEvenSeconds ps = [x | (x, y) &lt;- ps, isEven y]
&lt;/source&gt;

As in other cases, arbitrary expressions may be used before the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. If we wanted a list with the double of those first elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds :: [(Int, Int)] -&gt; [Int]
doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds ps = [2 * x | (x, y) &lt;- ps, isEven y]
&lt;/source&gt;

Not counting spaces, that function code is shorter than its descriptive name!

There are even more possible tricks:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
allPairs :: [(Int, Int)]
allPairs = [(x, y) | x &lt;- [1..4], y &lt;- [5..8]]
&lt;/source&gt;

This comprehension draws from ''two'' lists, and generates all possible &lt;code&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; pairs with the first element drawn from &lt;code&gt;[1..4]&lt;/code&gt; and the second from &lt;code&gt;[5..8]&lt;/code&gt;. In the final list of pairs, the first elements will be those generated with the first element of the first list (here, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), then those with the second element of the first list, and so on. In this example, the full list is (linebreaks added for clarity):

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; [(x, y) | x &lt;- [1..4], y &lt;- [5..8]]
[(1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(1,8),
 (2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),
 (3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),
 (4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(4,8)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

We could easily add a condition to restrict the combinations that go into the final list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
somePairs = [(x, y) | x &lt;- [1..4], y &lt;- [5..8], x + y &gt; 8]
&lt;/source&gt;

This list only has the pairs with the sum of elements larger than 8; starting with &lt;code&gt;(1,8)&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(2,7)&lt;/code&gt; and so forth.

{{Exercises|1=
# Write a &lt;code&gt;returnDivisible :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]&lt;/code&gt; function which filters a list of integers retaining only the numbers divisible by the integer passed as first argument. For integers x and n, x is divisible by n if &lt;code&gt;(mod x n) == 0&lt;/code&gt; (note that the test for evenness is a specific case of that).
#
# Write a function &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;choosingTails :: [[Int]] -&gt; [[Int]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; using list comprehension syntax with appropriate guards (filters) for empty lists returning a list of tails following a head bigger than 5: &lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
choosingTails  [[7,6,3],[],[6,4,2],[9,4,3],[5,5,5]]
-- [[6,3],[4,2],[4,3]]
&lt;/source&gt;
#
# Does the order of guards matter? You may find it out by playing with the function of the preceding exercise.
#
# Over this section we've seen how list comprehensions are essentially syntactic sugar for &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Now work in the opposite direction and define alternative versions of the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; using the list comprehension syntax.
#
# Rewrite &lt;code&gt;doubleOfFirstForEvenSeconds&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; instead of list comprehension.

=Blair Witch Project/Cloverfield=

''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[Cloverfield]]'' differ from the standard shooting style in several different ways.

* The whole film is presented as if it were an unedited documentary, filmed by the protagonists, and as such the shooting style resembles that of an amateur documentary or a home movie. 
* This includes shaking shots when the characters are running and more or less useless or irrelevant shots when the characters are just fooling around with the cameras.
* A large part of the Blair Witch Project is in black and white, as one of the cameras that the protagonists carry with them only shoots in this format. This adds to the realism of the movie.

=Ken Loach=

The films of Ken Loach have an incredible authenticity and 'realness' to them.  How does he achieve this?

Taken from &quot;Loach on Loach&quot;

* Never use [[w:Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]]
* Run the entire scene for every shot, don't break the scene down into little &quot;shot length&quot; segments.
* Light the entire scene so you're not artificially telling the audience &quot;THIS is the lead actor for this scene, the others are less important&quot;
* Don't give the actors marks (indeed, you don't have to because you're lighting the entire scene)
* Actors should have vulnerabilities

=Dogme/Dogma=

From [http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/28/dogme1.html Bright Lights Film Journal]: ''Copyrights lawyers are out of luck. Anyone can obtain a Dogme certificate if he (or she) shoots a film in accordance with the ten rules known as &quot;The Vow of Chastity.&quot;''

===The Vow of Chastity===

* Shooting on location (no imported props or sets)
* Sound and image produced together
* A handheld camera
* Natural light
* No optical work or filters
* No superficial action (murders, weapons)
* No temporal or geographic alienation
* No genre films
* Film format must be Academy 35mm.
* No signature; the director must not be credited.

=Alfred Hitchcock=

A man dedicated to suspense and intrigue

Emotion is the ultimate goal of each of his shots.  Hitchcock believed that emotion came directly from the actor's eyes.  By bringing us closer or tearing us away he used camera angles to jerk us into the feeling of his moments.

The camera should be just like a person looking around for something out of place in a room.  This allows the audience to feel like they are involved the action.  Scenes can often begin by panning a room showing close-ups of objects that explain plot elements.

Hitchcock also loved to keep us on our toes by throwing in shots fast and close after being slow and far...

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Temperature?==
There are a few ways we can describe temperature. But a large amount of them are surprisingly poor. Sadi Carnot for instance imagined heat as a liquid, and it was this view that allowed him to develop heat engine theory.

Here we will develop a way of viewing temperature that makes it useful in a Thermodynamic point of View.

==Two systems in Thermal Contact==
Imagine two systems, 1 and 2, with total energy E = E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Entropy S = S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conservation of energy of the system means that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = E - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; always.

Differentiating by E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; we see that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{matrix}
\frac{d E_2}{d E_1} &amp;=&amp; \frac{d(E - E_1)}{dE_1} \\ 
&amp;=&amp; -\frac{d E_1}{dE_1} \\
&amp;=&amp; -1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now if we look at Entropy changing with Energy.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} + \frac{d S_2}{d E_1}
= \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} + \frac{d S_2}{d E_2}\frac{d E_2}{d E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} - \frac{d S_2}{d E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At equilibrium there is no change in entropy, so when the systems are at the same temperature
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial E_1} = \frac{d S_1}{d E_1} - \frac{d S_2}{d E_2} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We use this to define Temperature.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T^{-1} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E}_{N,V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
N and V means the Volume and Number of Particles is fixed.

Or for a specific system
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T_i^{-1} = \frac{\partial S_i}{\partial E_i}_{N_i,V_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Usage==
If we were to look at how entropy changed with temperature, it is easy to show that as entropy always increases, energy always flows from the hotter body to the cooler one. Try it.

One of the equations wasn't parsing correctly at the time of writing. I've left it as is because the error message was 'Unknown Function \begin' which should be recognised. I'm not really sure what the problem is.

[[Image:Food Processor 2.jpg|thumb|An electric food processor]]

A '''food processor''' is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate various repetitive tasks in the process of preparation of food. In modern times, it is usually equipped with an electric motor, although there are manual versions.

Typically, a food processor will have a vessel (called a bowl), with a removable lid to contain ingredients during processing operations. The lid has an integrated feeder tube to allow the introduction of unprocessed food during operation. At a minimum, a removable rotating blade that [[Cookbook:Chopping|chops]] or [[Cookbook:Purée|purées]] (depending on the speed and duration of processing selected) the food is fitted within the bowl. Often food processors can accommodate other kinds of blades. For example, bladed discs for [[Cookbook:Slicing|slicing]], [[Cookbook:Grater|shredding]], or grinding. Occasionally, food processors can be fitted with other devices that allow it to overlap completely in function with other kitchen appliances. For example, [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]], [[Cookbook:Beater|beater]], [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hook]], or juicer attachments (such as with the processor pictured).

Here are several nice features that make using functions easier.

== let and where revisited ==

As discussed in earlier chapters, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; are useful in local function definitions. Here, &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
addStr :: Float -&gt; String -&gt; Float
addStr x str = x + read str

sumStr :: [String] -&gt; Float
sumStr = foldl addStr 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

But what if we never need &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; anywhere else? Then we could rewrite &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; using local bindings. We can do that either with a &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; binding...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr =
   let addStr x str = x + read str
   in foldl addStr 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

... or with a &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr = foldl addStr 0.0
   where addStr x str = x + read str
&lt;/source&gt;

... and the difference appears to be just a question of style: Do we prefer the bindings to come before or after the rest of the definition?

However, there is another important difference between &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;let...in&lt;/tt&gt; construct is an expression just like if/then/else. In contrast, &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses are like guards and so are not expressions. Thus, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings can be used within complex expressions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x =
    if x &gt; 0
        then (let lsq = (log x) ^ 2 in tan lsq) * sin x
        else 0
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression within the outer parentheses is self-contained, and evaluates to the tangent of the square of the logarithm of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the scope of &lt;code&gt;lsq&lt;/code&gt; does not extend beyond the parentheses; so changing the then-branch to

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
        then (let lsq = (log x) ^ 2 in tan lsq) * (sin x + lsq)
&lt;/source&gt;

does not work without dropping the parentheses around the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;.

Despite not being full expressions, &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses ''can'' be incorporated into &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expressions: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeColour c = 
   &quot;This colour &quot;
   ++ case c of
          Black -&gt; &quot;is black&quot;
          White -&gt; &quot;is white&quot;
          RGB red green blue -&gt; &quot; has an average of the components of &quot; ++ show av
             where av = (red + green + blue) `div` 3
   ++ &quot;, yeah?&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the indentation of the &lt;tt&gt;where&lt;/tt&gt; clause sets the scope of the &lt;tt&gt;av&lt;/tt&gt; variable so that it only exists as far as the &lt;tt&gt;RGB red green blue&lt;/tt&gt; case is concerned. Placing it at the same indentation of the cases would make it available for all cases. Here is an example with guards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doStuff :: Int -&gt; String
doStuff x
  | x &lt; 3     = report &quot;less than three&quot;
  | otherwise = report &quot;normal&quot;
  where
    report y = &quot;the input is &quot; ++ y
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that since there is one equals sign for each guard there is no place we could put a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; expression which would be in scope of all guards in the manner of the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause. So this is a situation in which &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; is particularly convenient.

== Anonymous Functions - lambdas ==

Why create a formal name for a function like &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; when it only exists within another function's definition, never to be used again? Instead, we can make it an anonymous function also known as a &lt;code&gt;lambda function&lt;/code&gt;. Then, &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; could be defined like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sumStr = foldl (\ x str -&gt; x + read str) 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression in the parentheses is a lambda function.  The backslash is used as the nearest ASCII equivalent to the Greek letter lambda (&amp;lambda;). This lambda function takes two arguments, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, and it evaluates to &quot;x + read str&quot;. So, the &lt;code&gt;sumStr&lt;/code&gt; presented just above is precisely the same as the one that used &lt;code&gt;addStr&lt;/code&gt; in a let binding.

Lambdas are handy for writing one-off functions to be used with maps, folds and their siblings, especially where the function in question is simple (beware of cramming complicated expressions in a lambda — it can hurt readability).

Since variables are being bound in a lambda expression (to the arguments, just like in a regular function definition), pattern matching can be used in them as well. A trivial example would be redefining &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; with a lambda:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
tail' = (\ (_:xs) -&gt; xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: Since lambdas are a special character in Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; on its own will be treated as the function and whatever non-space character is next will be the variable for the first argument. It is still good form to put a space between the lambda and the argument as in normal function syntax (especially to make things clearer when a lambda takes more than one argument).

==  Operators ==

In Haskell, any function that takes two arguments and has a name consisting entirely of non-alphanumeric characters is considered an ''operator''. The most common examples are the arithmetical ones like addition (+) and subtraction (-). Unlike other functions, operators are normally used infix (written between the two arguments). All operators can also be surrounded with parentheses and then used prefix like other functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- these are the same:
2 + 4
(+) 2 4
&lt;/source&gt;

We can define new operators in the usual way as other functions — just don't use any alphanumeric characters in their names. For example, here's the set-difference definition from &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(\\) :: (Eq a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
xs \\ ys = foldl (\zs y -&gt; delete y zs) xs ys
&lt;/source&gt;

As the example above shows, operators can be defined infix as well. The same definition written as prefix also works:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(\\) xs ys = foldl (\zs y -&gt; delete y zs) xs ys
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the type declarations for operators have no infix version and must be written with the parentheses.

=== Sections ===

''Sections'' are a nifty piece of syntactical sugar that can be used with operators. An operator within parentheses and flanked by one of its arguments...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(2+) 4
(+4) 2
&lt;/source&gt;

... is a  new function in its own right. &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, has the type &lt;code&gt;(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. We can pass sections to other functions, e.g. &lt;code&gt;map (+2) [1..4] == [3..6]&lt;/code&gt;. For another example, we can add an extra flourish to the &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; function we wrote back in More about lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList m = map (m*)
&lt;/source&gt;


If you have a &quot;normal&quot; prefix function and want to use it as an operator, simply surround it with backticks:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
1 `elem` [1..4]
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called making the function ''infix''. It's normally done for readability purposes: &lt;code&gt;1 `elem` [1..4]&lt;/code&gt; reads better than &lt;code&gt;elem 1 [1..4]&lt;/code&gt;. You can also define functions infix:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
elem :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
x `elem` xs = any (==x) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

But once again notice that the type signature stays with the prefix style.

Sections even work with infix functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(1 `elem`) [1..4]
(`elem` [1..4]) 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, remember that you can only make binary functions (that is, those that take two arguments) infix.

{{Exercises|1=
* Lambdas are a nice way to avoid defining unnecessary separate functions. Convert the following let- or where-bindings to lambdas:
** &lt;code&gt;map f xs where f x = x * 2 + 3&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;let f x y = read x + y in foldr f 1 xs&lt;/code&gt;
* Sections are just syntactic sugar for lambda operations. I.e. &lt;code&gt;(+2)&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; x + 2&lt;/code&gt;. What would the following sections 'desugar' to? What would be their types?
** &lt;code&gt;(4+)&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;(1 `elem`)&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;(`notElem` &quot;abc&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

== new shortcuts ==

These new WB:''FOO'' shortcuts are not short. That defeats the whole point of having them. One may as well click their way to the page instead.
: They are, however, consistent with how it is done in Wikipedia. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 00:34, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:: Wikipedia is such that any 3-letter shortcut will cause a conflict. Thus, the prefix. Wikibooks already prefixes books to avoid inter-book conflicts, so you can leave off the &quot;WB:&quot; for shortcuts. You might lowercase them too; most non-flamers can type lowercase faster than uppercase.
::: First, sign your posts so I know who is writing... second, it's virtually some form of &quot;unwritten&quot; convention that &quot;WB&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks&quot; are reserved &quot;book names&quot; for project use (consistent with one of the two major naming conventions - even then the faux-namespace convention is up to debate - [[Cookbook]] uses it but [[Wikijunior]] does not).  As for lowercase, that could be made in the near future... [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 03:10, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Slow VFD ==
One reason that VfD can seem to be slow is not necessarily the number of admins, but the number of legitimate ''votes'' and thus the arising of a clear consensus. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:26, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

True, but you can't blame the community on that.  I thought admins were to assume that a lack of votes meant that the community was largely apathetic (although that could be deletionist POV).  Oh well, I wouldn't touch those executive decision stuff for a while (I consider myself a &quot;junior admin&quot; and believe only &quot;senior admins&quot; could do that...)...

==Protection==
Hi. I saw your report in [[MediaZilla:2197|MediaZilla]] about the [[Main Page]] here. Currently, it is only protected against page moves, not editing. If you want it really protected, you or another admin will need to protect it without selecting the &quot;protect from page moves&quot; box. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 04:38, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for the how-to.  That I didn't know about before. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:41, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== anon user blocks ==

Please consider that IP addresses get reassigned. I'm reminded of the problems had in sending email from a newly-purchased block of IP addresses whose previous owner was a spammer. IP address reuse is something like this:
*dial-up - less than 1 day
*cable modem IP assignment via DHCP lease - a few months
*dorm room assignment - 3 to 10 months
*apartment lease - 1 year
*employment - won't go on forever, and employers reassign addresses too
So a year should do the job, right?
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:48, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

True, but these blocks are consistent with similar blocks on other IPs by other admins. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 07:18, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== The Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire walkthrough ==

I believe you are right that it is a copywrite violation. I've found the source of this page, with use of Google. It comes from [http://faqs.ign.com/articles/503/503704p1.html], a walkthrough which says who has permission to use it: 
            Copyright Notice: This is Copyright ©2004 by Jason Howell and me frog
                        (Colin Scully), and may only be used on Gamefaqs.com,

                        contact and possible Legal action.

It also says at the end:

I found this page using two quotes (one of which has a grammer mistake), and found a few other quotes there as well. And if you look at the history of that page, you can see that it is in the process of being converted from a text file (like it would be at Gamefaqs.com) to wiki-project formatting.

[[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] deleted all the information about us trying to have his illegally copied page removed from Wikibooks. Is there anything to be done about this?

By the way, I wonder if there is any connection between his name and Bulbaboy from Wikipedia. (Another illegal copying of Pokémon web stuff?)
[[User:User142|User142]] 15:42, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== Type Affinity vs. Type Matching ==

1)  I have not found a single place in Wikipedia or Wikibooks where the phraze &quot;Type Affinity&quot; is used.
: Try [[Pokémon:Battle Basics]]. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 20:54, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
:: Are there any other pages in Wikipedia or Wikibooks? If not, changing &quot;tpye affinity&quot; in one section of one page is a lot easier than changing 387 Pokémon pages.[[User:User142|User142]] 08:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

2)  On the web, I've found that both names are used.

Since currently, the only term used in Wikipedia and Wikibooks to describe this is &quot;Type Matching&quot;, and since this term is used elsewhere, we should continue using this term in the Wiki projects.

== How can I insert a picture from Wikipedia? ==

I am working on a Pokemon walkthrough (One which is my own work, not from some on-line source which is copywrited by someone else!). I think that the Type Chart from Wikipedia should go in it. The tag there is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Pokemon_Type_Chart.PNG|thumb|right|Type Chart]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;. How can I insert it here in Wikibooks?

: Just for the record, remember to put the walkthrough in the Pokémon space and not the Wikibooks Pokédex space.  Anyways, I don't think you can use templates across wikis - best to just copy and paste. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:30, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== Ivyboy needs to be banned, for days already! ==

Please ban [[User:Ivyboy]] ASAP. He has:

#repeatedly removed legit (justified, etc.) VfD notices
#repeatedly removed VfD discussion instead of participating in it
#moved the [[User:Bulbaboy]] page over his own, making the users appear to be the same

I think you can consider all this to be his vote against the pages he has created, so that all can be quickly dealt with too.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:10, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

As the person who clued in to his activities by putting the vfd notice, I have to let another admin do the dirty work (ethical reasons).  But rest assured that another admin is on the case. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:33, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

In general I like that policy and wish every admin would follow it. I think moving Bulbaboy's user page was pretty extreme though. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:56, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== A question regarding copywrite (NOT about Ivyboy) ==

If when playing the game I miss how much money a particular trainer pays the winning player, may I copy that from a walkthrough which says &quot;''Certain in-game content (as in enemy status info, etc can be re-published on any FAQ or Site, but must be written in your own words.''&quot;? After all, the number is a number, and there is only one natural way to represent it. (By the way, the site I'm talking about IS the same site which [[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] stole from, but I am not going to do such a thing!)[[User:User142|User142]] 17:32, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

== My new Walkthrough ==

I would like you to express your opinion about [[Wikibooks Pokémon:User142 Ruby Walkthrough|my Ruby walkthrough]].

By the way, most of the page is actually in the templates, and when I make the Sapphire walkthrough I will just need to put in the templates with a few small changes. Any later edit will be done at the same place for both. Wikibooks is good for doing it in this way. One of the things I dislike about most walkthroughs is the face that the Ruby and Sapphire (or the Gold and Silver, or the Red abd Blue) data is all together, and it doesn't look nice even if it is readable.
[[User:User142|User142]] 09:45, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I'm guessing that eventually you might move it to a place that fits the book's naming conventions (such as [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough]]), right?  It's just that using &quot;Wikibooks Pokémon&quot; makes me somewhat uneasy (the name &quot;Wikibooks Pokédex&quot; was chosen as there was one at Wikipedia, hence to differentiate the two).  Also, you might want to stick to [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions|Wikibooks naming conventions]] here, and put the book title in the page title (eg. [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough:Start Game Ruby]] or [[Pokémon:Pokémon Ruby Walkthrough/Start Game Ruby]] rather than [[Start Game Ruby]], which is ambiguous in regards to which book it is a part of).

Hi. I'm sorry about the late reply; I don't come by much all that often than I ought, and I should perhaps try and make an effort and do some work rehashing my content and making sure they're still all fresh and whatever.
But on to pressing matters: I think your proposal reads without any major problems arising immediately in my mind, which is a Good Thing. Its important to categorize our content closely, in order to distinguish How-To type texts from texts aiming to be self-contained references to texts aiming for a nonfiction feel. If I can comment on any Wikibooks pages with any policy proposals, let me know, and I'll throw in my two cents. Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:41, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

This is a guide on how to install Mambo Open Source for a complete newbie. I will assume that you have transfered the files to a compitable server. If not, please read the [[Mambo Open Source/Placing_the_files|placing the files]]-article.

This part of the installation ensures that the server is compatible with Mambo and that Mambo will run on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MAMBOTOC_SMALL}}

For Mambo to work, you need to place the files in a supported environment. There are several options available, this article explains the two main options.

==Local==

If you have a server system compitable with Mambo on the same computer that you work on, this is called local placement of files. It means that you place the files the same location as you are placing them from. Follow this link for more information about [[Mambo_Open_Source/Server_requirements|server and system requirements]].

The only thing you will need to know is the root folder of your server - place mambo within this folder. The correct location varies depending on your platform:

*''MSAS'' - C:/Program Files/MSAS/http_root/www
*''Linux'' - www/public_html/
*''Mac OS X'' - /Library/WebServer/Documents
*''Apache on windows'' - C:/Program Files/Apache Group/htdocs

This root folder will be the folder that opens when entering the server - in a local setting this is mostly done by entering &quot;localhost&quot; or the corresponding IP, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, as URL. If you place mambo in a folder called &quot;cool&quot; inside your server root (e.g. C:/Program Files/MSAS/http_root/www/cool), you will have to enter &quot;localhost/cool&quot; in your browser to visit your &quot;cool&quot; Mambo website.

==Remote==

This explains the process of moving the files from your local computer to a remote location, as e.g a webserver.

===Getting and FTP program and connect===

Remote placement of files means that the files will be placed somewhere else than on your own computer. Do do this, you will need a program that allows you to, and in this case an [[w:Comparison of FTP clients|FTP-programm]] will be suitable. There are many good, free ftp programs available, here are some recomendations:

*[http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/ FileZilla]
*[http://www.ipswitch.com/ ws_ftp] - standard specs ftp client.
*[http://www.smartftp.com/ SmartFTP] - lots of advanced features, as secure connections.

After installing the program, you will need to set it up for connection to the remote location. You must have the correct access information for this, as username and password, and you also need to know how to use this data properly in the FTP-program. This varies from program to program, but usually it is something like this:

*Enter your username in the username field
*Enter yout password in the password field
*Enter the adress to the remote location in the adress field
*Press connect!

This should solve your problem, but if it doesn't, contact the owner of the remote location, usually a webhost, and ask for details about FTP connection.

===Transfer the files to the remote location===

After setting up a proper connection to the remote location, you will need to transfer the files to it. The way this is done varies very much from server to server, and there are many ways of doing it. This is a very common explanation of how it shoud be done, that may not fit exactly to all cases.

Once you login to the remote location via the ftp program, you will probably get a list of folders. This may be ''public_html'', ''public_ftp'', ''cgi-bin'' and ''www''. This is different from server to server. Anyway, almost all servers have one of these or both: ''public_html'' and ''www''. It should not matter in wich of these folders you put the content, they are usually overlapping each other.

This folder is called the root of the site. When you enter the site by it's URL, you see the content of the root folder. If you have a website there, it will show! Take a look at these examples:

*''www.domain.com'' takes you to ''public_html''
*''www.domain.com/folder'' takes you to ''public_html/folder''
*''folder.domain.com'' sometimes return ''public_html/folder'' too - it depends on how the server is configured.

When you place mambo into this, you should place the files directly to the public_html or www folder. Mambo supports installation on subfolders, so if that is what you need do it - but usually you don't want this, the Mambo site should simply appear when your visitor types www.domain.com.</text>

I just did a major overhaul of the QBasic article on Wikipedia. In the proccess, I removed two excessively large example programs from the article, which I thought didn't belong in an encyclopedia, but were more of a tutorial thing. So here they are, I hope someone finds a place for them here:

&lt;pre&gt;
DO
 CLS            'This clears the screen.  It's the default first line, as it gets rid of
                'unwanted text and graphics.  By the way, the apostrophe is a comment.
                'Everything past it is ignored by QBasic, which is why I can say anything.

 PRINT &quot;Press escape to end the insane beeping!  Muahaha!&quot;  'PRINT prints text to the screen.
                                                            'The quotes tell Qbasic that the stuff
                                                            'inside is a ''string''. PRINT can be
                                                            'replaced by a question mark &quot;?&quot;.

 DO WHILE INKEY$ &lt;&gt; CHR$(27)  'Checks to see if the user is pressing &quot;escape&quot;; the
  'ASCII value of that key is represented by &quot;CHR$(27)&quot;,
  'the ASCII value of escape is 27.  &quot;DO WHILE&quot; creates a loop, saying &quot;Do this until
  'the user [[whatever comes after the &quot;DO WHILE&quot;, in our case presses escape]]

  LET x% = INT(RND * 9000 + 100) '&quot;LET&quot;-This &quot;declares&quot; the variable.  It's obsolete, so you could
                                 'just say &quot;x% = [[whatever]]&quot;.
                                 '&quot;RND&quot; generates a smallish random number.  Multiplying it by 9000
                                 'makes it a number between 0 and 9000.  &quot;+ 100&quot; makes it between 100
                                 'and 9100. &quot;INT&quot; makes it an integer (number without a
                                 'decimal point) and the &quot;%&quot; tells QBasic it's an integer, rather
                                 'than, say, a string.

  SOUND x%, 1    'This makes a ''sound'', with its frequency (pitch) being x [[Hz]]. This number has to
                 'be between 36 and 32767, but ordinary speakers can't produce a frequency anywhere near
                 '32767 Hz, and only girls and a few other humans can easily hear pitches much beyond
                 '14000 or so.  The writer of this program may have little hearing much beyond
                 '9100 or so. &quot;, 1&quot; says that the sound will last 1 ''[[clock tick]]''.  A clock tick in
                 'QBasic happens 18.2 times a second. So, this program will make some CRAZY beeps.

                'stop and start over.

LOOP WHILE beep$ = &quot;y&quot; OR beep$ = &quot;Y&quot; 'Tells the program to goto the start, if the users types &quot;y&quot;

In this tutorial we cover initializing the Super Nintendo and changing the background to a beautiful shade of green.  

== Required Tools ==
* The [http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html WLA-65816 Macro Assembler]. There are the [http://www.mediafire.com/?eownw7vsmimasad binaries for Linux 32 bit]
* A SNES emulator, such as [http://byuu.org/bsnes/ bsnes], [http://www.zsnes.com Zsnes] or [http://www.snesemu.net/windows.html Geiger's debugging version of Snes9x, for windows].
* An initialization routine and a header. The initialization routine is self-explanatory; it's a piece of code that clears/resets system values and sets the SNES up for use. The header contains assembler directives for WLA which do things like define the ROM's name, size, vectors, etc.

== The Tutorial ==

=== Assembler directives ===

If you decide to put the init routine and the header in separate files, it will be necessary to tell the assembler to include them.
 .include &quot;Header.inc&quot;
 .include &quot;Snes_Init.asm&quot;
 VBlank:    ; Needed to satisfy interrupt definition in &quot;header.inc&quot;
     RTI
This part can be skipped by putting the header and init code in your main file.

You can find the [[Super NES Programming/Initialization_Tutorial/Snes_Init| ASM-code for the Snes_Init.asm here on Wikibooks]], and you can find [[Super NES Programming/Initialization_Tutorial/header| the header here.]]

=== Starting the program ===

In the header file, the label &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Start&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is declared as the reset vector, so that is where the program shall begin executing:

 Start:

=== Initializing the SNES ===

Most demos reset the SNES to a known state.  Since emulators probably start in a known state, it may be unnecessary to reset the state for an emulated ROM.  Resetting the SNES, however, may be necessary for the demo to run on actual SNES hardware.

To reset the SNES, we set a number of hardware registers to zero and zero all the bytes in WRAM.  Here, we use the initialization macro &lt;tt&gt;Snes_Init&lt;/tt&gt; from the file &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Snes_Init.asm&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; from the SNES Devkit, which does this for us:

     ; Initialize the SNES.
     Snes_Init

=== Setting the background color ===

First, we set the accumulator to 8 bits, to modify single bytes of RAM.  We do this by setting the appropriate bit in the CPU status register:

     sep     #$20        ; Set the A register to 8-bit.

==== Step 1: Force VBlank ====

The SNES refreshes its screen to match the signal output to the television, so knowing how the television updates its image can help you understand how certain special effects are performed in the SNES.

A television displays an image on the screen using an electron beam, which it sweeps across the screen from left to right, one horizontal line at a time from top to bottom.  Additionally, television images are ''interlaced'', meaning that the television alternates displaying a screenful of all the even-numbered scanlines with a screenful of all the odd-numbered scanlines; each screen of even- or odd-numbered scanlines is called a ''field''.  An NTSC television (as used in the U.S. and Japan) displays roughly 30 frames per second, while a PAL television (as used everywhere else) displays 25 frames per second.  Thus, an NTSC television displays about 60 fields per second, while a PAL television displays 50 fields per second.

Between lines, when the electron beam is being moved from the right end of one scanline to the left beginning of the next scanline, the electron beam is turned off; this is called the ''horizontal blank'' or ''HBlank''.  Certain special effects -- like the perspective effects of the Final Fantasy VI airship -- can be performed on the SNES by changing graphics settings during HBlank.

Likewise, between fields, when the electron beam is being moved from the bottom of the screen to the top, the electron beam is turned off; this is called ''vertical blank'' or ''VBlank''.  If you update the screen while the electron beam is turned on, the results displayed to the user are unpredictable; they may shear or have other artifacts.  Therefore, you want to make all your modifications to the screen during HBlank or VBlank.  Since VBlank is much longer than HBlank and covers the whole screen, most updates should be done during VBlank.  VBlank occurs once per field, or about 60 times per second on NTSC machines and 50 times per second on PAL machines.

There are two ways to ensure that your code executes during a VBlank:
* Wait for a VBlank non-maskable interrupt ('''NMI''').
* Turn off the screen by setting the eighth bit of the Screen Display Register ($2100).

Here, we force VBlank by turning off the screen, using the following code:

     lda     #%10000000  ; Force VBlank by turning off the screen.
     sta     $2100

==== Step 2: Setting the Background Color ====

The SNES stores 16-bit colors in the following format:
* &lt;tt&gt;High byte: 0bbbbbgg&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;Low byte:  gggrrrrr&lt;/tt&gt;

The color that we will use is &lt;tt&gt;00000000 11100000&lt;/tt&gt; (0 blue, 7 green, 0 red) -- a dark green.  We set the background color of the screen using the Color Data Register ($2122):

    lda     #%11100000  ; Load the low byte of the green color.
    sta     $2122
    lda     #%00000000  ; Load the high byte of the green color.
    sta     $2122

==== Step 3: Ending VBlank ====

We end the VBlank by turning the screen back on and setting the brightness to 15, again using the Screen Display Register ($2100):

    lda     #%00001111  ; End VBlank, setting brightness to 15 (100%).
    sta     $2100

=== Ending the program ===

Unlike many computer programs, SNES programs aren't really designed to end.  SNES games are intended to keep running until the user turns the system off or presses reset.  In our case, though, the SNES has done all that we wanted it to do, and now we would like it to sit still and not change anything.  We accomplish this with an infinite loop:

     ; Loop forever.
 Forever:
     jmp Forever

If we didn't have this loop at the end, the SNES would start executing any code or data that happened to follow our program, which may make the SNES do something that we didn't intend.

Alternatively, we also could've used the &quot;STP&quot; command. This command stalls the SNES' CPU until the console is reset.  The endless loop is a good practice, though, because eventually we'll need a main program loop, and that is what this will become.

== Assembling the ROM ==

Once we have our program in a file -- let's call it &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.asm&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; -- we want to assemble it into a ROM image, so that we can run it in an emulator.  First, we execute the WLA 65816 assembler to turn the assembly file into an object file:

 wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj

This should create the object file &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.obj&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

Then, we need to link the object file into a ROM.  The WLA linker requires a link file that lists the files to be linked.  We'll make one called &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.link&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; with the following contents:

 [objects]
 Greenspace.obj 

Then, all we need to do is to execute the WLA linker:

 wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

This should create the ROM image &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.smc&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, which we can then run in an emulator.

To make the compile and link steps easier to run repeatedly -- as we might want to do when alternating between editing and testing -- we can put the commands in a [[w:en:Shell script|shell script]], &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.bat&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; in DOS/Windows, or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for UNIX.

 wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj
 wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

If you use UNIX you need to add ''#!/bin/bash'' as the first line of the file. Under Windows, it's a good idea to add ''@echo off'' as the first line.

Alternatively, if you are on a UNIX-based platform, it is possible to create a makefile and use the [[w:en:make_(software)|make]] utility. To do this, create a file named &quot;&lt;tt&gt;makefile&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

 Greenspace.smc: Greenspace.asm Greenspace.link
     wla-65816 -vo Greenspace.asm Greenspace.obj
     wlalink -vr Greenspace.link Greenspace.smc

After creating this file, simply use the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; command, and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Greenspace.smc&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; will be created.

Building and maintaining this cookbook requires work, some of which is tedious. It is good to pitch in, doing your part to take care of things. Here are some of the many things you can do.

==Stop spammers and vandals==
Notice the &quot;[[Special:RecentChanges|Recent changes]]&quot; link in the left sidebar. You can use this to see the most recent modifications. There is a drop down menu near the top of the list that lets you select a specific namespace.  Choose the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace, and click the go button.

Now you can see all the recent cookbook edits. You can revert an edit by going to the page history, choosing the most recent good version, editing ''that'' version (note the warning you'll see), and saving the result. If you are fairly sure that the bad edit was intentionally bad, get an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|admin]] to block the user. You can report problems in the [[WB:AA|administrative assistance reading room]].

==Nominate and judge potential editors==
[[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|Requests for permissions]] require votes. Without votes, progress will tend to be slow. Without editors, the vandals and spammers run wild. If you see a user who appears fit to be an editor, you should nominate them on that page. While there, vote for all the candidates that seem decent to you.

==Add pictures for ingredients and tools==
See [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] for where the pictures are or should be.  Start at [[commons:Category:Food|Category:Food]] as a first place to look, but some images may not be properly categorized.

Many US government sites are excellent sources of public domain (no copyright) pictures. You can use Google image search with the site:gov option to find these. To be more specific, site:usda.gov or site:fda.gov can be used. Use site:mil for military sites (as the military does serve food). In general, do not use these photos for recipes. After you find an appropriate image, upload it either here or at Commons, and add it to the pages.

==Add pictures for recipes==
For recipes, you really should cook the food. For example, this cookbook has two lemon meringue pie recipes. The pies look and taste different from each other, although they are similar. It would be bad to use a generic picture from an unknown recipe. As above, images can be stored at the Wikimedia [[commons:|Commons]] to make images available for all Wikimedia Foundation projects, or uploaded to Wikibooks for cookbook-only use. 

When taking pictures, try to use something other than a yellowish 60W light bulb and Xenon flash. Natural sunlight, GE Reveal bulbs, and most plant (greenhouse) lights will work well, especially if you can hold the camera steady and suppress the flash. Try to show both the inside and outside of foods where this would be applicable. Cropping the image would be a good idea; use the jpegtran program with the lossless-crop option if you have it.

==Standardize formatting and add links==
All cookbook pages should have links at the top to various parent-like pages, with the [[Cookbook]] link itself at the left. For simplicity and aesthetic reasons, separate these links with the &quot;'''|'''&quot; symbol. Add category links at the bottom of the page. Use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' if you need to keep pictures from spilling into the wrong section. Use a bullet list for ingredients, and a numbered list for the procedure. Link most alcoholic drinks into the [[Bartending]] guide instead of into the [[Cookbook]]. Link all ingredients the first time they are used. Also do this for [[Cookbook:Units of measurement|units of measurement]] and the less-well-known [[Cookbook:Equipment|equipment]]. 

The casing for book titles should match that of Wikibook's scheme for titles, that is, title-case (e.g. &quot;'''F'''ish and '''C'''hips&quot;).  Keeping page names in sentence-case violates Wikibook's page naming convention, see the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|manual of style]].  To make linking easier, [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirect pages]] should be created, so links to either title appear as &quot;blue&quot; active links, and duplicate pages are not created.  At least one contributor prefers actions (&quot;Boil'''ing'''&quot;, not &quot;Boil&quot; or &quot;Boiled&quot;) in gerund form. They also advocate keeping ingredient lists in lower-case.

==Help describe and rate the recipes==
Many recipes are poorly described. Beginning cooks can not imagine what the result is supposed to be like. You can describe the food right at the top of the recipe. You can discuss your cooking attempts on the recipe's talk page. If you are able to compute Calories accurately, you might do so. It would be helpful to assign difficulty levels and total preparation times.

==Convert units==
Leave the original [[:Category:Units of measurement|units]] as they are, whatever they may be, and add the new units in parentheses after them. Unit conversion requires more care than most people expect. A &quot;Large&quot; [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] in the USA is about the same as a &quot;size M&quot; egg in the EU; you should remove the size indication if you believe it refers to one of these normal sizes. The USA uses Queen Anne units, while Britain uses imperial (and metric) units. Imperial units are generally about 20% larger than Queen Anne units, so look for signs of a non-USA recipe author (based on [[Cookbook:International food terms|food terms]] and spelling) before you convert the units. Be aware of the distinction between [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (mass or weight) and [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]]. Proportion is important: if you convert 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] as 2 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] then use 4 mL for 1 t and 190 mL for 1 c, but if you convert 1/2 t as 3 mL then use 6 mL for 1 t and 285 mL for 1 c. Adjust the pan size, serving count, and eggs (ouch) as required to match.

==Get junk pages deleted, and save the legit pages==
Simply add '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete|your reason goes here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to the top of any page that no reasonable person might want to keep. If there has been significant human effort put into the page, you should instead place the page up for a [[WB:RFD|deletion vote]] and use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{RFD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to mark the page. At the [[WB:RFD]] page, you can also vote on other pages that have been put up for a deletion vote. Be sure to vote based on the quality of the page; for example a vegetarian should take care to vote in favor of something like the [[Cookbook:Beef]] page in spite of any personal disgust at the concept of eating beef.

==Link from Wikipedia to the Cookbook==
Many topics (recipe, ingredient, tool, activity) discussed here in the Cookbook are also covered in [[w:Main_page|Wikipedia]]. From a page over there, you can link to a cookbook page called '''Cookbook:Whatever''' by using '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookbookpar|Whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to make the link. You might best do this at the very top of an &quot;External links&quot; section; the result will be a box on the right side of the page.

This recipe describes how to make home-made ''Marshmallows''. They can be used in [[:Category:Marshmallow recipes|any recipe that calls for marshmallows]].
 
==Ingredients==
*About 1 cup confectioners' sugar 
*3 1/2 envelopes (2 tablespoons plus 2 1/2 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin 
*1/2 cup cold water 
*2 cups granulated sugar 
*1/2 cup light corn syrup 
*1/2 cup hot water (about 115 degrees) 
*1/4 teaspoon salt 
*2 large egg whites 
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*1/2 cup vegetable oil

==Procedure==
#Oil bottom and sides of a 13 by 9 by 2-inch rectangular metal baking pan and dust bottom and sides with some confectioners' sugar.
#In bowl of standing electric mixer or in a large bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let stand to soften.
#In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar, corn syrup, hot water, and salt over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 240 degrees, about 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved.
#With standing or a hand-held electric mixer beat mixture on high speed until white, thick and nearly tripled in volume, about 6 minutes if using standing mixer or about 10 minutes if using hand-held mixer. In a large bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites (or reconstituted powdered whites) until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat whites and vanilla into sugar mixture until just combined. Pour mixture into baking pan and sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over top. Chill marshmallow, uncovered, until firm, at least three hours, and up to 1 day.
#Run a thin knife around edges of pan and invert pan onto large cutting board. Lifting up 1 corner of inverted pan, with fingers loosen marshmallow and let drop onto cutting board. With a large knife trim edges of marshmallow and cut marshmallows into roughly 1-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and add marshmallows in batches, tossing to evenly coat.

==Variation==
Coat with toasted coconut or cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bass guitars have similar design features to other types of guitar but scaled up: thicker strings, longer neck and larger body, etc. This allows lower notes to be created when the strings are tuned to a playable tension. They are sometimes categorized as guitars but are also occasionally categorized as a separate instrument. Although there are many variations, the standard bass guitar has four strings tuned EADG, one octave lower than the bottom four strings of a guitar in standard tuning. Although the bass guitar can be played like an oversized guitar, it also draws much inspiration from double basses and the instrument has a vocabulary of playing styles and music all of its own.

== Slapping And Popping ==
One of the distinguishing features of the bass guitar is the slap style. It is typically distinct to the bass guitar, although it has been used on acoustic guitars by skillful players.

Slapping is accomplished by percussively striking the string - usually E or A on a standard tuned bass - with the left hand side of the thumb (for a right-handed player). This is done towards the neck of the bass. The thumb is then pulled away as quickly as possible, to create a distinct, &quot;fretty&quot; noise.

Popping is accomplished by curling the fingertip of the index or middle finger under the string - usually the D or G string. The string is then plucked to create a similar sound to slapping on the thicker strings. This is, again, performed towards the neck of the bass.
*[http://www.howtoslapbass.com/slap-bass-tutorial/?=wiki Slap Bass Tutorial Video (Free)]

== Different Basses ==
The &quot;standard&quot; bass is a 4 string bass, tuned EADG (low to high). Other variations of this tuning include DADG and CGCF. These lower tunings are often used in metal and heavier music, as they extend the instrument's range lower.  Altering the tuning of a bass to a lower range (or any other fretted instrumented) by reducing string tension can cause problems that new players should be aware of: looser strings are more prone to &quot;fret buzz&quot;, in which a string rattles on the fretboard, producing a sound that is usually unwanted.  Loosening strings also alters the tension on the neck, which can lead to warping the neck.

To achieve a clear tone on notes lower than standard tuning, a standard 5-string bass adds a low B string, with the bass normally tuned BEADG (low to high).  It is also common to restring a 4-string bass as BEAD, leaving off the high G.  There exist strings that go even lower in range, however these are typically found only on specialty instruments.

==Bass Runs==
Bass runs are particularly nice sounding. For example if one wants to change from a C chord to an Am chord, they could do a nifty bass run.
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

 --C chord--                                       --Am Chord--

 E A D G B E              E A D G B E              E A D G B E
 ===========     ==&gt;      ===========      ==&gt;     ===========
 | 3 2 | 1 |              | 2 2 | 1 |              | | 2 2 1 |

== Coordination ==

Coordination may be defined as the process of managing dependencies between activities (Malone &amp; Crowston, 1994). The need for coordination arises from the fact that literally all organizations are a complex aggregation of diverse systems, which need to work or be operated in concert to produce desired outcomes. To simplify the picture, one could decompose an organization into three broad components of actors, goals and resources. The actors, comprising of entities such as management, employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders perform interdependent activities aimed at achieving certain goals. To perform these activities, the actors require various types of inputs or resources. As explained later in the paper the inputs may themselves be interdependent in the ways that they are acquired, created or used. The goals to which the actors aspire are also diverse in nature. Some of them will be personal while others are corporate. Even where the goals are corporate, they address different sets of stakeholders and may be in conflict. 

Calls for coordination are evident is situations where a) temporality is a factor, such that effects of delays or of future consequences of today’s decisions are not immediately apparent b) there is a large number of actors c) there is a large number interactions between actors or tasks in the system or d) where combinations or occurrences in the system involve an aspect of probability (stochastic variability). In summary, the more complex the system (and organizations are complex aggregations) the more coordination is necessary.

Multiple actors and interactions, resources and goals need to be coordinated if common desired outcomes are to be achieved. Viewed from the need to maintain perspective and solve problems that might arise from these multiplicities, coordination links hand in glove with the concept of systems thinking.

In contrast to traditional methods of problem analysis, system thinking focuses on how a component of a system under study interacts with other constituents of the same system (Aronson, 1998). Organizations are systems in the sense that they comprise of elements that interact to produce a predetermined behavior or output. Traditional analysis approaches focus on isolating individual parts. The systems thinking approach instead works by expanding the analytical spectrum to take into account the broader picture of how the constituent parts of the system interact with each other. Change in a constituent part of a system may constrain efficient functioning of other parts of the same system or alter required input or output specifications. Others, especially resources, may need to be used in combination to achieve desired changes. The point here is that looking at small parts of an interacting system involving multiple actors, resources and goals may accentuate a problem that analysis seeks to solve. Coordination, in a systems thinking approach fashion is called for.

Crowston (1998) refers to coordination theory as “a still developing body of theories about how coordination can occur in diverse kinds of systems. According to this theory, actors in organizations are faced with coordination problems. Coordination problems are a consequence of dependencies in the organization that constrain the efficiency of task performance. Dependencies may be inherent in the structure of the organization (for example, departments of a university college interact with each other, constraining the changes that can be made to a single department without interfering with the efficient functioning of the other departments) or dependences may result from processes - task decomposition or allocation to actors and resources (for example, professors teaching complementary courses face constraints on the kind of changes they can make without interfering with the functioning of each other).

The solution to coordination problems, according to coordination theory, lies in the actors performing additional activities called coordination mechanisms. A professor who wishes to change a course module must check if the changes will affect other courses in the department and other departments in the college. The theory maintains that dependences and mechanisms to counter them are general in the sense that they arise in one form or another in nearly every organization. The theory this makes a recommendation that it is essential to identify and study dependences in a system and their related coordination mechanisms before decisions are made or action taken. Actors must also realize that there are several mechanisms to manage a dependency each of which may result in different processes. The ideal one should be based on situational factors and often involves trade offs. To summarize, an organization considering change (or an organization in the process of formation) ought to first identify inherent dependences and coordination problems likely to be faced and then choose from alternatives the coordination mechanism that best achieves the desired goals in the circumstances (Crowston, 1998). A key point here is that coordination mechanisms are variable parts of the organization system and that choice of a specific mechanism has consequences for efficiency and goal achievement.

A simplified typology of the kind of dependences that call for coordination in an organization may be: 
a) Task-task:
o	Tasks may have overlapping, conflicting or outputs with the same characteristics;
o	Common inputs for tasks may be shareable, reusable or non-reusable
o	The output of one task may be the input of other tasks or a prerequisite for performing subsequent tasks. There may be conflict in specifications that need coordination.
b) Task-resource i.e. resources required by a task
c) Resource-resource: a situation in which one resource depends on another resource. 
Each of these dependences requires an appropriate coordination mechanism to manage it.

In conclusion, solution to organizational problems, implementation of change or formation of a new organization involves the management of numerous dependences among tasks, resources and goals. Dependences are best managed by coordination of the dependent parties. The choice of a specific coordination mechanism results in a unique organizational form and/or processes that have consequences for achievement of organizational goals. Coordination is a constituent application of systems thinking in the sense that it requires an organization wide examination in how a change in one component of the organization affects other components of the same system. The aim of coordination is not new; improvement of performance is a universal organizational goal. Approaching the task from a broad perspective differs from the traditional mechanisms of analysis i.e. breaking down the problem into small parts. Finally focusing on dependences and coordination mechanisms is not a one-time effort. For organizations in dynamic environments, it is a recurring theme.

'''Grotten Hans''' is a recipe that has been called a big dumpling but is basically steamed sweet bread.  The recipe was traditional in the German areas of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/archrecipes/index.cgi?cat=German-Russian NDSU Recipe Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
*¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|c]]. [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 c. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]], beaten
*3 c. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
# Cream lard, sugar and salt.  Add eggs. Mix flour and baking powder.  
# Add this flour mixture to the lard mixture alternatively with the milk. Mix well.  
# Pour into a well-greased 2-pound coffee can.  A piece of wax paper on the bottom of the can works well.  Cover with foil, and tie this on with a string.  
# Set this tin into a large kettle of hot water several (3) inches deep.  This will steam the dumpling.  Cook for 2 hours.  The old way was to dip a towel in hot water, then cold water, then sprinkle with flour.  
# Pour dumpling onto towel and tie up.  Drop into boiling water and cook 2 hours.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Raisin Sauce:
*2 c. [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]]
*2 c. [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 scant tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

Mix raisins, water, lemon juice, cinnamon and sugar.  Simmer for 1 hour.  Thicken with cornstarch. Serve over Grotten Hans.  Cherry sauce is nice also.

Serve with ham.

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a date]] ==

===Deletion discussion (Kept, no consensus to delete)===

'''Keep and Edit''' Most of the material is indeed unvarifiable and not easily scientifically proven, however it is usefull. Many of the techniques in social research indeed is controversial. Neverthelsess keep it and rather than deleting it allow it to remain and fix itself so that the most fundamental principles can surface themselves. Original, finished work should go to [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikisource]. Wikibooks is a place to develop books.

My main concern right now is that it is not presented as a book or as a guide, but more or an encyclopedia entry. To be truly usefull as a book, textbook or a guide which it claims to be, it must be writen from the perspective or &quot;how&quot; versus the present &quot;what&quot;. We are not talking about what it is, we are talking about how to do it. Let's stop asking what it can do for me and start asking how I can make it better.

--[[User:Seductionreport.com|Seductionreport.com]] 06:57, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

Some parts of this book seem to be similar to the now-deleted Getting a Girl. (See [[/Archive]]). The other parts seem like a simple joke. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 21:52, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)
* If you were following the earlier VfD discussion, the current book grew out of that debate.  Rather than fixing the old book in place, the current book(s) were created out of an NPOV'ed subset of the old content.  I was the one who NPOV'ed and moved it; I am certainly not one of the original authors, and the subject matter doesn't interest me much.  However, I think that we should be having the difficult and serious discussion about whether such a book is appropriate for Wikibooks, not whether poorly-written or highly POV content belongs here (it doesn't!).  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:24, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
** As for my take on keeping or deleting it, I think the content has the potential to be useful, neutral, and presented in the form of a textbook; I also think it could be an enjoyable read, along the lines of the many self-help books published on the subject.  I have conflicting thoughts about what Wikibooks content should encompass, but my current thoughts on the matter lend themselves to a '''weak keep'''.  Pages that induced me to try to salvage the previous book were [[Getting_a_girl (for guys)/Appearance|Appearance]] and [[Getting a girl (for guys)/Dating ideas|Dating ideas]].  --[[User:Sj|Sj]]

'''Keep''' Some people really do need all the help they can get. Maybe not you. Have some pity on fellow human beings who are struggling to satisfy one of life's most basic needs.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:14, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

'''Comment''' To be fair, they authors seem to have tried to address the bias towards straight men by adding three other sections. It also now uses subpages so it isn't polluting the main namespace like the old one was. I'm no longer sure about this so please do not count me listing this page as a vote either way. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 23:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' I'm kind of curious to see where this book goes, and I'm amused by what's already in there (its predecessor, [[Getting a girl]], was extremely funny), but I see nothing in the book so far that indicates that it's going to be more than people's random ideas and suggestions that they've thought about over the years, none of which is scientific, verifiable, and much of which is bound to be contradictory.  The very nature of what has been written thus far indicates, to me, that the book has about zero chance of being useful to anybody, or worse, that anyone taking the book seriously will be as likely to be harmed by its contents as helped. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 21:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:By that argument, the Cookbook needs to go too. The recipes are all nothing more than people's random ideas and suggestions that they've thought about over the years, none of which is scientific, verifiable, and much of which is bound to be contradictory. This &quot;Getting a data&quot; book would have been damn useful to me 15 years ago. Have some pity, will you? Many of your fellow humans are suffering. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:34, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:: &lt;[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 21:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)&gt; If the book were renamed &quot;tips on how to get a date,&quot; then sure, it would be an appropriate resource for various ideas about dating, kind of like a cookbook, or really, tips on any subject, and there would be no need for it to be scientific.  Also, a recipe book is rarely contradictory: each recipe is a particular means to its own end (i.e., incapable of contradicting other recipes, because recipes by their very nature do not need to contain general principles about cooking--any such information is beyond its scope), and any internal contradictions within a recipe can quickly be spotted.  Additionally, a recipe book is also quite verifiable.  If someone follows the recipe, and gets a pile of grey goo when they were expecting an eclair, then they will know that something was either wrong with their ability to follow the instructions, or with the recipe itself.  The wiki philosophy can and will (over time) sort out any recipes that produce results that differ from the expectations set forth in the recipe.  The ideas set forth in &quot;getting a girl/date,&quot; however, are not verifiable, and where the results differ from what is written, the error can scarcely be traced to a particular element wrong in the instructions or in the execution of the instructions.  The wiki philosophy simply doesn't work for such casual advice: we cannot asymptotically arrive at &quot;truth,&quot; because there is no truth to arrive at--just a shitload of unverifiable conjecture.  What you would have found helpful 15 years ago could easily cause another person great distress now, and not simply because they failed to follow the clear and precise instructions.
*:: In addition to these general issues, I have some problems with the specifics of how this book is being approached.  To begin with, the book seems to frequently rely on the premise that a girl can be &quot;gotten.&quot;  In many cases, a given man will be incapable of &quot;getting&quot; a particular girl, and following the instructions set forth will essentially further his transformation into an obsessive, determined maniac that will find himself presented with a restraining order.  Also, most principles around &quot;getting a girl&quot; are largely dependent on context, and yet no attempt is made to clarify this, or to establish which principles are general ones, which are applicable only to specific contexts (and to what contexts they are applicable), and which might be applicable to many, but not all contexts.  The problem here is that people are only familiar with the contexts to which they've been exposed, and are not suited for giving advice to another person in differing circumstances.
*:: Consider this ridiculous piece of advice: &quot;A girl likes to know that you would fight for her honor and to keep her safe (whether she can defend herself or not).&quot;  While this may have been useful information to a particular person in every (potential or otherwise) dating situation they've been in (though in such a case, I suspect that there are some problems with that person's analysis of those situations), there are also many scenarios in which this outmoded idea (and any behavior that follows from it) is totally inapplicable.  Yet the book presents it as a general statement, with no explication regarding what circumstances it might be true in, and with no explanation of what sort of knowledge or expertise the author has that he might be able to give such advice, and no reference to any data (solid or otherwise) that is capable of supporting this.  Any claim that the author simply &quot;knows this to be true&quot; is simply bullshit--a single person's experience, no matter how broad or deep, cannot establish profound knowledge of the human condition in general.  The best we could hope for is that this piece of information is based on international surveys, statistical analysis, and years of experimentation through relationship therapy--in which case this information would then provide us with certain types of contexts and scenarios for which the information is appropriate (which is certainly not all of them), and it would certainly be much more detailed.
*:: That sample piece of advice is not unusual within the text of the book as it stands.  The entire book is written in the same way.  '''My vote stands'''.&lt;/[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]&gt;
*:: Comment: this book is not a form of pity, it is a form of &quot;kicking them while they're down,&quot; if anything. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]
*:::I see. The problem is that the book is not politically correct. The example you present (able and willing to keep her safe) is in no way outmoded... even if many woman won't admit it to themselves. It will be outmoded perhaps some day, after about a million years of future human evolution. The premise that &quot;getting a girl&quot; via pursuit is possible is mostly true as well, and it is something I wish I'd understood about 15 years ago. It sure did work for my step-sister-in-law's husband, who is now married to the woman of his dreams. Tradition still works, surprisingly well in fact. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:41, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::: That is not a matter of political correctness.  I am not as concerned about the offensiveness of the content (as some others are) as I am the inaccuracy, invalidity, and purely speculative qualities of the information.  You have given evidence of this with your attempts to back up the information using purely information from your own life (which is necessarily incomplete data, the sort of which does not belong in this book--and if the book is to be composed entirely or even mostly of this information, then it does not belong in wikibooks). [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 00:13, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*::::: I see no such requirement for wikibooks. The wikipedia entry for wikibooks says &quot;manuals, and other texts&quot;, but says nothing about prohibiting the humanities. This sure counts as a manual. It also might actually get used... the idea of a wiki &quot;book&quot; being used to teach a serious college science course is just laughable. A guide to getting women doesn't need to be stable and well-organized over an entire semester. In other words, it's perfect for a wiki. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:39, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::::: On the contrary, what is &quot;perfect for a wiki&quot; are books containing information that can be repeated (if it is providing instructions, as in a cookbook), verified, and improved by the community.  This, on the other hand, only contains speculation and opinions that are lumped one on the other (with some of the most awful poetic phrasings), without any truth that can be arrived at.  There are some experimental ideas out there about creating fiction or art on a wiki, or other such contributional work that has no truth to arrive at, but wikibooks is not one of those projects.  The idea of a wiki &quot;book&quot; being used to teach a serious college science course is not at all laughable, it just happens to be something of a distant hope at this point in time.  All of the wiki projects are long-term projects, and even the most mature one: the English wikipedia, is not a terrible good reference as of yet.  All indications are that it will be in time, however--or that it will be good enough for most people, most of the time.&quot; [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 02:50, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*::::::: The guide for getting women actually does have truth that can be verified and improved upon. The methods may differ from what you are familiar with. One simple way things could work would be for people to mark tactics as they succeed or fail. Any variations caused by situation are experimental error, just as in any science. In time, each method will have a success rate associated with it, with accuracy according to how often the method was attempted. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:39, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:::::::: That, my friend, is a contentious and non-neutral point of view, as is everything I've read within the text about which we are arguing. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 20:30, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*I've asked for Jimbo Wales' opinion, as it's not in anybody's interests for him to find out about this months later and delete it. See [[w:User_talk:Jimbo Wales#b:Getting a date]]. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 00:52, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' noticed [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] comment to Jimbo and thought I would read it and add my two cents. Seems worthy of keeping and seeing what will happen. [[User:Trödel|Trödel]]

*'''Delete''' This is not a textbook and the &quot;advice&quot; is unhelpful and simplistic. I don't think any scholarship will ever make its way to this module, either. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:35, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*:: The advice is helpful, particularly regarding mindset and overcoming fear. It would be easy to improve this book. Doing so while a vote for deletion hangs over it is not exactly fun. (yeah right, people are going to contribute to something under threat of being destroyed) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*Jimbo has suggested that this book should be moved to [[w:Wikicities]]. Would the proponents of this book be happy with that as a compromise?
*:Hmmm, this is more of a textbook than the [[Cookbook]], which really does need to move to it's own domain. So I might like the cookbook to move, pending some study of server reliability and capacity. The Getting_a_date book does really seem to belong on wikibooks, fitting in rather decently with both the stated mission and the various structural restrictions imposed by a shared wiki. The cookbook on the other hand, has outgrown a shared wiki and has no need for the proposed linearization-to-paper enhancements that this wiki might be getting. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:42, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' The textbook, while currently somewhat simplistic, is no worse than a lot of other books out there. If people attempt to follow the advice in there and come back with their experiences, it would improve in a controlled manner. I see nothing sacred in this subject; it is probably a craft that can be learned by a dedicated student. The argument that people will get hurt is silly: If you engage in dating (or life) you will get hurt. most likely. That is the price of the game. If you followed the advice in the book, at least you have something to blame :)

(Edit: I think many parts of the current version deals with not only dating, but with psychology (fear), health (diet) and interaction skills in general so I believe there are a lot of interesting information in it even if its not about dating.

*'''Keep''' the most apeal of Wiki-everything comes from that it is-not-a-paper thing, simplistic no problem there are peole needing simplistic advice, other guys and gals can click throught by the time the book grows, this book can be left here, if there is any joke parts of it they can be fixed. Anyway I admit this book for me is a great way to indulge my extravert part, by examining other peoples view on this subject in every simplistic detail.''The Getting a girl'' had many problems beyond title.~~Gnomz007 from Wikipedia

=== Deletion discussion here instead of at [[WB:VFD]] ===
&lt;s&gt;This discussion is interesting, but I missed it, instead posting at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. I would think that this discussion is too biased in favor of the book, because of its location. Use the VFD page so that the entire Wikibooks community can discuss it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Sorry, that was February 2005, now it is November 2005. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:21, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a girl (for guys)]] ==

I'm confused. I read on the vote for deletion page that this book was to be deleted, yet it has not only been re-created, but has forked into 4 different books. Am I mis-understanding something here?
: I believe you are.  The book was npov'ed, content was removed, other neutral content was added, and the book was properly identified as &quot;getting a date&quot; for only one of the four most common sexual orientations and circumstances.  This was done after discussion with Jimbo and others involved with the previous debates.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:29, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:This book is good, but it's got a few bad features: It's written from the first person, it's not NPOV, it's somewhat America-centric, or at least Western-hemisphere-centric. It needs a lot of work, but it has a right to existance. The dating ideas are a good repository! --wp:is:Spm

Double Your Dating ? Why do we have that there, if we are having external links 
can we seperate them into commercial and non-commercial sites David DeAngelo 
is well known on the internet for his dating books , but I don't think this is the place
for it though, does anyone agree?  If we put up david's material 
whats to stop us putting out all the other seduction/pickup
stuff that's out there ? --aUserOnline

== Discussion from [[Talk:Getting a guy (for girls)]] ==

=== Additions after my proximity edit ===

I bet those were all made by women, still mystified by what men want.  I tell ya, it ''is'' that simple. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 14:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Guide to Social Activity]] ==

I have not edited every submodule, but I unilaterally decided to move [[Getting a date]] to [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]]. Explanation:
# [[Getting a date]] was nominated for cleanup, yet there was no recent work on it.
# I wanted to write [[Guide to Social Activity/Alcohol]] and decided that alcohol and courtship belong in the same book.
# Users have threatened [[Getting a date]] with deletion, despite efforts to improve it. I wanted to continue these efforts to improve it.
# [[Getting a date]] was unnecessarily divided four ways, depending on the gender of the participants. There is not much difference between a man with a woman, and a woman with a man, so I decided to combine them.
# The book contained mostly advice for dating, but I think that it should contain additional material, such as a description and history of dating.
--[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:20, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;I want to merge in [[Getting a boy]], but [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]] is at votes for deletion, and [[Getting a boy]] is not a deletion candidate. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:38, 1 December 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Since [[Getting a boy]] is now a deletion candidate, and seems useless, I have voted to delete it and removed the proposal to merge it here.

=== Problems while improving the Courtship module ===

I am trying to fix [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]] (formerly [[Getting a date]]). The three major improvements are:
# ''Establish gender-neutrality.'' Some persons claim that the old version was [[wikt:sexist|sexist]]; I think that the module should be gender-neutral. The information, in most cases, is as applicable to a man and a woman as to the other three cases.
# ''Establish verifiable information.'' By finding Wikipedia or Internet links, I can use these to determine whether the usefulness of the existing content. (I have already removed some of the existing content that I expect not to try and verify.)
# ''Broaden scope of some modules.'' Some modules are doing poorly, and improvements would probably broaden their scope from courtship to social activity in general.

I have made not much actual progress for this. Most of what I tried so far was to establish gender-neutrality. In particular, sometimes I am trying to provide general information, and sometimes I am trying to write a how-to. I might need to make another module first, perhaps [[Guide to Social Activity/Alcohol]], and use it as a module for Courtship. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:30, 9 December 2005 (UTC)


== I miss Rock 'n roll ==
This dating site is too sweet and christian. It only takes in account the stereotype relationships without taking the reality into account that all people are different. There is no atention for gays and lesbians. There is no atention for the bad boys and the fact that girls tend to like bad boys. 'Showing respect for everybody you meets' sounds like bullshit to me. I don't like the rolemodels that girls should let the boys ask them out and that boys should be protective. We have just witnessed 50 years of attempts to create freedom. Must we go back to the days in which half of the population was not able to find happyness in a relationship. I think this whole guide should be nominated for deletion. (Proud to be from Holland and to be an atheist)--[[User:82.139.82.196|82.139.82.196]] 22:14, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

:The [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship]] (formerly [[Getting a date]]) recently survived a &quot;votes for deletion&quot;. There are several flaws with the current text, but I am very slow to fix them. I have already removed some problem sections and entire subpages, but not all of the bad parts are missing.

:I am somewhat surprised that this text is finding readers. How are readers finding this module? I thought the only way to navigate to here was through {{bad link|Category:How-tos}}. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

:I found it through a Wikipedia article of the same name. All I have to say is that for something as fundamental as a relationship, it is impossible to make a gender-neutral article. I'm a very left-wing liberal, but for a topic that is the reason for gender you just cannot treat it like that. While I respect the fact that it doesn't always have to be the guy who asks the girl out or that it doesn't even have to be a guy and a girl at all, I think that you have to accept the fact that women and men interact differently and it would make more sense to have situation based guides for each that allow for the reader to be either a leader of follower. --[[User:64.148.27.99|64.148.27.99]] 02:11, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== ? ==

Is this worth adding to the article?

== Biased ==

Am I the only one who feels that this book is too biased towards heterosexual males? What about the rest of us? 01:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

I think this is biased towards adults who live in cities. ;( [[User:Icelandic Hurricane|Icelandic Hurricane]] 14:15, 22 July 2007 (UTC)
:Poor town kids... [[User:Icelandic Hurricane|Icelandic Hurricane]] 13:46, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

I agree (probably a few years to late).  This book seems to be one person's opinion passed off as researched advice, I particularly love the point about Saisburys!  I really don't see how to clean this up without deleting 90% of the module.</text>

PyGTK For GUI Programming is an in-depth tutorial on the python bindings to the GTK+ toolkit, assuming no previous knowledge of GTK+.  The reader is expected to know enough about the Python programming language to be able to understand the examples, although experience with building GUI interfaces in general is not required.

Have re-written the introduction and added the first steps chapter.  Working on re-writing events and hope to add more content as I get round to it.  There is a very comprehensive tutorial at http://www.pygtk.org/tutorial.html , but I sure things can be explained more clearly, and perhaps some practicable solutions to specific tasks.  Anyhow, nothing will happen very fast.  [[User:4crickj|4crickj]] ([[User talk:4crickj|talk]]) 19:31, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

''O would that all were truly Christian! It is easy to be a Christian on the tongue, but hard to be a true one. Today [1910] some five hundred million souls are Christian, but the real Christian is very rare: he is that soul from whose comely face there shineth the splendour of Christ; and who showeth forth the perfections of the Kingdom; this is a matter of great moment, for to be a Christian is to embody every excellence there is.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, in experiments with finite sample spaces, the outcomes are equiprobable.
In such cases, the probability of an event amounts to the number of outcomes comprising this event divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.
While counting outcomes may appear straightforward, it is in many circumstances a daunting task.
For example, consider the number of distinct subsets of the integers {1, 2, ... , n} that do not contain two consecutive integers.
This number is equal to

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \phi^{n+2} - (1 - \phi)^{n+2} }{ \sqrt{5} } ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2&lt;/math&gt; is the ''golden ratio''.
It can also be obtained recursively through the ''Fibonacci'' recurrence relation.

Calculating the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed is part of the field of ''combinatorics''.
In this section, we introduce useful counting techniques that can be applied to situations pertinent to probability theory.

==The Counting Principle==

'''The Fundamental Rule of Counting''': 
If a set of choices or trials, T1, T2, T3, …, Tk, could result, respectively, in n1, n2, n3, …,nk possible outcomes, the entire set of k choices or trials has n1×n2×n3× … ×nk possible outcomes. (The numbers n1, n2, n3, …, nk cannot depend on which outcomes actually occur.) 

By the Fundamental Rule of Counting, the total number of possible sequences of choices is 5×4×3×2×1 = 120 sequences. Each sequence is called a permutation of the five items. A permutation of items is an ordering of the items. More generally, by the Fundamental Rule of Counting, in ordering n things, there are n choices for the first, (n-1) choices for the second, etc., so the total number of ways of ordering a total of n things is 
n × (n-1) × (n-2) × . . . × 1. This product, n×(n-1)×(n-2)× . . . ×1, is written n!, which is pronounced &quot;n factorial.&quot; By convention, 0! = 1

The counting principle is the guiding rule for computing the number of elements in a cartesian product as well.

&lt;math&gt;
S \times T = \{ (x, y) | x \in S \wedge y \in T \} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The number of elements in the cartesian product S x T is equal to mn.
Note that the total number of outcomes does not depend on the order in which the experiments are realized.

[[Image:countingprinciple.png]]

'''Example:'''
Consider an experiment consisting of flipping a coin and rolling a die.
There are two possibilities for the coin, heads or tails, and the die has six sides.
The total number of outcomes for this experiment is 2 x 6 = 12.
That is, there are twelve outcomes for the roll of a die followed by the toss of a coin: 1H, 1T, 2H, 2T, 3H, 3T, 4H, 4T, 5H, 5T, 6H, 6T.


The counting principle can be extended to compute the number of elements in the cartesian product of multiple sets.
Consider the finite sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_r&lt;/math&gt; and their cartesian product

&lt;math&gt;
S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_r
= \left\{ (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_r) | s_p \in S_p \right\} .
&lt;/math&gt;

If we denote the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;S_p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n_p = | S_p |&lt;/math&gt;, then the number of distinct ordered r-tuples of the form &lt;math&gt;(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_r)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n = n_1 n_2 \cdots n_r&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example - Sampling with Replacement and Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered 1 through n.
A ball is drawn from the urn, and its number is recorded on an ordered list.
The ball is then replaced in the urn.
This procedure is repeated k times.
We wish to compute the number of possible sequences that results from this experiment.
There are k drawings and n possibilities per drawing.
Using the counting principle, we conclude that the number of distinct sequences is
&lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:'''
The power set of S, denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all subsets of S.
In set theory, &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of all functions from S to {0, 1}.
By identifying a function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; with the corresponding preimage of one, we obtain a bijection between &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; and the subsets of S.
In particular, each function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic function of a subset of S.

Suppose that S is finite with n = |S| elements.
For every element of S, a characteristic function in &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; is either zero or one.
There are therefore &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; distinct characteristic functions from S to {0, 1}.
Hence, the number of distinct subsets of S is given by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Formulae'''
The formula for counting combinations has special cases that are worth memorizing: 
''nC0 = nCn = 1'' (There is only one way to pick no thing and only one way to pick all n things.) 
''nC1 = nCn-1 = n'' (there are n ways to pick one thing or to leave one thing out) 
''nCk = nCn-k'' (There are the same number of ways of picking k of n things as there are of leaving out k of n things)
 
[[Image:powerset.png]]

== Permutations ==
'''Permutation:''' an arrangement of objects without repetition where order is important.
Permutations using all the objects: ''n'' objects, arranged into group size of ''n'' without repetition, and order being important. P(n, n) = N!
Example: Find all permutations of A, B, C, D, F, G, H,

Permutations of some of the objects: ''n'' objects, group size ''r'', order is important. P(n, r) = N!/(n-r)!
Example: Find all 2-letter combinations using letters A, B, C, D, F, G, H,
'''Distinguished permutation:''' if a word has ''n'' letters, ''k'' of which are unique, let ''n'' (n1, n2, n3....nk) be the frequency of each of the ''k'' letters: N!/(n1!)(n2!)(n3!).

Consider the integer set S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
A ''permutation'' of S is an ordered arrangement of its elements, a list without repetitions.
The number of permutations of S can be computed as follows.
The number of distinct possibilities for the first item is n.
The number of possibilities for the second item is n-1, namely all the integers in S except the first element in the list.
Similarly, the number of distinct possibilities for the m-th item is n - m + 1.
This pattern continues until all the elements in S are listed.
Summarizing, we find that the total number of permutations of S is n ''factorial,
n! = n (n-1) ... 1 .

'''Example:'''
We wish to compute the number of permutations of S = {1, 2, 3}.
Since the set S contains three elements, it has 3! = 6 permutations.
They can be listed as 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.

[[Image:permutation.png]]

=== Stirling's Formula ===

The number n! grows very rapidly as a function of n.
A good approximation for n! when n is large is given by Stirling's formula,

&lt;math&gt;
n! \sim n^n e^{-n} \sqrt{ 2 \pi n}
&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
The notation &lt;math&gt;a(n) \sim b(n)&lt;/math&gt; signifies that the ratio a(n)/b(n) approaches one as n tends to infinity.

=== k-Permutations ===

Suppose that we list only k elements out of the set S = {1, 2, ... , n}, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to count the number of distinct k-permutations of S.
Following our previous argument, we can choose one of n elements to be the first item listed, one of n-1 elements for the second item, and so on.
The procedure terminates when k items have been listed.
The number of possible sequences is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) .
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:'''
A recently formed music group has four original songs they can play.
They are asked to perform two songs at a music festival.
We wish to compute the number of song arrangements the group can offer in concert.
Abstractly, this is equivalent to computing the number of 2-permutations of four songs.
Thus, the number of distinct arrangements is 4!/2! = 12.

[[Image:kpermutation.png]]

'''Example - Sampling without Replacement, with  Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered one through n.
A ball is picked from the urn, and its number is recorded on an ordered list.
The ball is not replaced in the urn.
This procedure is repeated until k balls are selected from the urn, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to compute the number of possible sequences that results from this experiment.
The number of possibilities is equivalent to the number of k-permutations of n elements, which is given by n!/(n-k)!.

== Combinations ==
'''Combinations''': arrangement of objects without repetition, where order is NOT important.
A combination of ''n'' objects, arranged in groups of size ''r'', without repetition, and order being important. C(n, r) = n!/r!(n-r)!
Another way to write a combination of ''n'' things, ''r'' at a time, is using the Binomial notation ('''Binomial Distribution'''). Combinations of this type are referred to verbally as &quot;n choose r&quot;.

Consider the integer set S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
A ''combination'' is a subset of S.
We emphasize that a combination differs from a permutation in that elements in a combination have no specific ordering.
The 2-element subsets of S = {1, 2, 3, 4} are
{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4} ,
whereas the 2-permutations of S are more numerous with
(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4),
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) .
There are therefore fewer 2-element subsets of S than 2-permutations of S.

[[Image:combination.png]]

We can compute the number of k-element combinations of S = {1, 2, ... , n} as follows.
First, we note that a k-permutation can be formed by first selecting k objects from S and then ordering them.
There are k! distinct ways of ordering k objects.
The number of k-permutations must then equal the number of k-element combinations multiplied by k!.
Since the total number of k-permutations of S is n! / (n-k)!, the number of k-element combinations is found to be

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} = \frac{ n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) }{ k! } .
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called a ''binomial coefficient''.
Observe that selecting a k-element subset of S is equivalent to choosing the n-k elements that belong to its complement.

'''Example - Sampling without Replacement or Ordering:'''
An urn contains n balls numbered one through n.
A ball is drawn from the urn and placed in a jar.
This process is repeated until the jar contains k balls, where &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.
We wish to compute the number of distinct combinations the jar can hold after the completion of this experiment.
Because there is no ordering in the jar, this amounts to counting the number of k-element subsets of a given n-element set, which is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Again, let S = {1, 2, ... , n}.
Since a combination is also a subset and the number of k-element combinations of S is &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;, the sum of the binomial coefficients over all values of k must be equal to the number of elements in the power set of S.
Thus, we get

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} = 2^n.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Partitions ==

Abstractly, a combination is equivalent to partitioning a set into two subsets, one containing k objects and the other containing the n-k remaining objects.
In general, the set S = {1, 2, ... , n } can be partitioned into r subsets.
Let &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; be nonnegative integers such that
'''
&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{p = 1}^r n_p = n.
&lt;/math&gt;'''

Consider the following iterative algorithm that leads to a partition of S.
First, we select a subset of &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; elements from S.
Having chosen the first subset, we select a second subset containing &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; elements from the remaining &lt;math&gt;n - n_1&lt;/math&gt; elements.
We continue this procedure by successively choosing subsets of &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; elements from the remaining &lt;math&gt;n - n_1 - \cdots - n_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; elements, until no element remains.
This algorithm yields a partition of S into r subsets, with the p-th subset containing exactly &lt;math&gt;n_p&lt;/math&gt; elements.

We wish to count the number of such partitions.
We know that there are &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{n_1!(n-n_1)!}&lt;/math&gt; ways to form the first subset.
Examining our algorithm, we see that there are

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n - n_1 - \cdots - n_{p-1})!}{n_p!(n - n_1 - \cdots - n_p)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

ways to form the p-th subset.
Using the counting principle, the total number of partitions is then given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_r!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called a ''multinomial coefficient''.

'''Example:'''
A die is rolled nine times.
We wish to compute the number of outcomes for which every odd number appears three times.
The number of distinct sequences in which one, three, and five each appear three times is equal to the number of partitions of {1, 2, ... , 9} into three subsets of size three, namely

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{9!}{3! 3! 3!} = 1680 .
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above analysis, we assume that the size of each subset is fixed, three subsets of size three.
Suppose instead that we are interested in counting the number of ways of picking the sizes of the subsets, r subsets of &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; size, where the sum of the sizes is a constant.
Specifically, we wish to compute the number of ways integers &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r&lt;/math&gt; can be selected such that every integer is nonnegative and

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p = 1}^r n_p = n&lt;/math&gt;.

We can visualize the number of possible assignments as follows.
Picture n balls spaced out on a straight line and consider r-1 vertical markers, each of which can be put between two consecutive balls, before the first ball, or after the last ball. 
For instance, if there are five balls and two markers then one possible assignement is illustrated below.

[[Image:Partitioning.png]]

The number of objects in the first subset corresponds to the number balls before the first marker.
Similarly, the number of objects in the p-th subset is equal to the number of balls between the p-th marker and the preceding one.
Finally, the number of objects in the last subset is simply the number of balls after the last marker.
In the figure, the integer assignment is

&lt;math&gt;
(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (0,2,3).
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Partitioning2.png]]

Two consecutive markers imply that the corresponding subset is empty.
There is a natural bijection between an integer assignment and the graphical representation depicted above.
To count the number of possible integer assignments, it then suffices to compute the number of ways to position the markers and the balls.
In particular, there are n + r - 1 positions, n balls, and r - 1 markers.
The number of ways to assign the markers is equal to the number of n-combinations of n + r - 1 elements,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{n!(r-1)!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example - Sampling with Replacement, without Ordering:'''
An urn contains r balls numbered one through r.
A ball is drawn from the urn and its number is recorded.
The ball is then returned to the urn.
This procedure is repeated a total of n times.
The outcome of this experiment is a table that contains the number of times each ball has come in sight.
We are interested in computing the number of distinct outcomes.
This is equivalent to counting the ways a set with n elements can be partitioned into r subsets.
The number of possible outcomes is therefore given by

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{n!(r-1)!} .
&lt;/math&gt;

== Computing Probabilities ==

In this section, we present two straightforward applications of combinatorics to computing the probability of winning the lottery.

'''Example - Pick 3 Texas Lottery:'''
The Texas Lottery game ''Pick 3'' is easy to play.
A player must pick three numbers from zero to nine, and choose how to play them: exact order, or any order.
The Pick 3 balls are drawn using three air-driven machines.
These machines use compressed air to mix and select each ball.

The probability of winning while playing the exact order is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{10} \frac{1}{10} \frac{1}{10}
= \frac{1}{1000} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of winning while playing any order depends on the numbers selected.
If three distinct numbers are selected then the probability of winning is 3/500.
If a number is repeated twice, the probability of winning is 3/1000.
While, if the same number is selected three times, the probability of winning becomes 1/1000.

'''Example - Mega Millions Texas Lottery:'''
To play the Mega Millions game, a player must select five numbers from 1 to 56 in the upper white play area of the play board, and one Mega Ball number from 1 to 46 in the lower yellow play area of the play board.
All drawing equipment is stored in a secured on-site storage room.
Only authorized drawings department personnel have keys to this door.
Upon entry of the secured room to begin the drawing process, a lottery drawing specialist examines the security seal to determine if any unauthorized access has occurred.
For each drawing, the Lotto Texas balls are mixed by four acrylic mixing paddles rotating clockwise.
High speed is used for mixing and low speed for ball selection.
As each ball is selected, it rolls down a chute into an official number display area.
We wish to compute the probability of winning the Mega Millions Grand Prize, which require the correct selection of the five white balls plus the gold Mega ball.
The probability of winning the Mega Millions Grand Prize is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{51!5!}{56!} \frac{1}{46}
= \frac{1}{175 711 536} .
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Random Variables: Definitions==

Formally, a ''random variable'' on a probability space &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma,P)&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable real function ''X'' defined on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (the set of possible outcomes)

:&lt;math&gt;X: \Omega\ \to \ \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, 

where the property of measurability means that for all real ''x'' the set 

:&lt;math&gt;\{X \le x\} := \{\omega\in \Omega|X(\omega) \le x\} \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. is an event in the probability space.

===Discrete variables===

If X can take a finite or countable number of different values, then we say that X is a ''discrete random variable'' and we define the ''mass function'' of X, p(&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) = P(X = &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;), which has the following properties:
* p(&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 0
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} p(x_i) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Any function which satisfies these properties can be a mass function.

;Variables
:We need some way to talk about the objects of interest. In set theory, these objects will be sets; in number theory, they will be integers; in functional analysis, they will be functions. For these objects, we will use lower-case letters: a, b, c, etc. If we need more than 26 of them, we’ll use subscripts.

;Random Variable
:an unknown value that may change everytime it is inspected. Thus, a random variable can be thought of as a function mapping the sample space of a random process to the real numbers. A random variable has either a associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or a probability density function (continuous random variable).

;Random Variable &quot;X&quot;
:formally defined as a measurable function (probability space over the real numbers).

;Discrete variable
:takes on one of a set of specific values, each with some probability greater than zero (0). It is a finite or countable set whose probability is equal to 1.0.

;Continuous variable
:can be realized with any of a range of values (ie a real number, between negative infinity and positive infinity) that have a probability greater than zero (0) of occurring. Pr(X=x)=0 for all X in R. Non-zero probability is said to be finite or countably infinite.

===Continuous variables===

If X can take an uncountable number of values, and X is such that for all (measurable) ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;P(X \in A) = \int_A f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;,

we say that X is a ''continuous variable''. The function f is called the ''(probability) density'' of ''X''. It satisfies:
*&lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge\ 0\ \forall x \in\ \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1&lt;/math&gt;

===Cumulative Distribution Function===

The ''(cumulative) distribution function'' (c.d.f.) of the r.v. X, &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; is defined for any real number x as:

:&lt;math&gt;F_X (x) = P(X \le  x)=\begin{cases} \sum_{i: x_i \le\ x} p(x_i), &amp; \mbox{if }X\mbox{ is discrete} \\ \, \\ \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(y) dy, &amp; \mbox{if }X\mbox{ is continuous} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The distribution function has a number of properties, including:

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to-\infty} F(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty} F(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* if x &lt; y, then F(x) &amp;le; F(y) -- that is, F(x) is a non-decreasing function.
* F is right-continuous, meaning that F(x+h) approaches F(x) as h approaches zero from the right.

===Independent variables===
&lt;!-- Due to not understanding the notion of function, r.v. and density, the following is not correct

2 Variables x and y are independent if their joint probability function is the product of their individual probability functions

&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= f(x)* f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

For example if

&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=exp(-(x+y))x,y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
and if
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=exp(-x) x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(y)=exp(-y) x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

then x and y are independent random variable

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is inflation?'''

Inflation can be defined as the increase in the overall level of prices. Whilst the price of individual goods or services may vary due to changes in [[supply and demand]], [[production costs]] or technological progress, inflation refers to the increase in the price level as a whole or for a selection of goods and services (commonly referred to in economics as a [[basket of goods]]).  The result of inflation is that the nominal amount of goods and services that a unit of currency can purchase (its [[purchasing power]]) declines over time. 

Of course, there is, in theory, nothing which make inflation an inherent feature of our economies. In historical times there have been prolonged periods of [[deflation]] (where the overall level of prices falls) as well as [[hyperinflation]] and [[disinflation]].

'''Examples'''
1) ..... The average price of a specific &quot;basket&quot; of goods and services today is 100. If one year later the average price of a &quot;basket&quot; containing the SAME goods and services will cost you 300, then the currency of your country is worth only 1/3 as much as a year ago as a result of inflation. As a result of inflation all the prices of the SAME goods and services have increased.

..... Inflation is stated as a percentage. Assume, for example, that inflation is steady, every year the same, at 2% per year. Then an item that costs now 100 would cost after 1 year 102, then in future years: 104.04 106.12 108.24 110.41 112.62 114.87 117.17 119.51 121.90 and so on.


2) ..... Labor or labour unions always want more and more money to &quot;make ends meet&quot;, and so do most other people. The price of goods and services must cover all costs, including all involved salaries and wages. If the currency is worth less as a result of inflation, then all costs go up, and therefore all prices go up. But because prices go up, everybody wants a raise in wages/salary. Therefore the costs go up again, the prices go up some more, and so on and so on. THAT is the unfortunate result of the inflation &quot;spiral&quot;.

[[Image:Hand Beater.jpg|right|thumb|Egg beater (hand powered)]]
A '''beater''' is the normal [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] attachment, typically somewhat [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]-like in shape. It can also be a hand-powered tool, usually called an ''egg beater'', as shown at right.

Beaters are used with foods that do not require great force to mix. Example usages:

*making [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] from [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*[[Cookbook:Beating|beating]] [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] to make a [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]]
*mixing thin [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] batter

Beaters are not suitable for mixing thick [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookie]] dough, [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] dough, or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] dough. The beaters might stall the motor of the mixer or bend. Beaters are also difficult to clean dough from. You should use [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hooks]] for such tasks.</text>

[[Image:Handheld Electric Beater.jpg|thumb|right|electric mixer with beaters]]
[[Image:Hand Beater.jpg|thumb|right|hand-cranked mixer (&quot;beater&quot;)]]

A '''mixer''' is a kitchen appliance for mixing, beating, kneading, and whipping.

Usually, a mixer is used with [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]-like [[Cookbook:Beater|beater]] attachments. These are usually removable from an electric mixer, but permanently attached to a hand-cranked mixer. For this reason hand mixers are sometimes simply called beaters.

A typical mixer is electric and has two removable beaters that spin in place. The mixer comes with an optional stand that holds the mixer and a purpose-made bowl, allowing the bowl to rotate. Helical (corkscrew-like) [[Cookbook:Dough Hook|dough hook]] attachments are usually provided for working with moderately tough dough. Sometimes these mixers are sold cheaply without the stand and bowl.

A more effective and expensive design uses a stationary bowl and a single beater that moves in an orbital motion in addition to rotating. In this case the mixer can not be operated in a hand-held manner, but it is more likely to have a powerful motor and provide good support for unusual attachments like grinders. Mixers of this type can be very large. Sometimes the bowl is clamped at both sides rather than being held from the bottom.

A hand-cranked mixer can only perform the job of a [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]. Compared to a whisk, the advantage of a hand-cranked mixer is gearing that allows for high speed.</text>

[[Image:Waffle Maker.jpg|thumb|right|Electric waffle maker]]

A '''waffle maker''' (also known as a waffle iron) is a type of kitchen appliance used to make [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]]. It usually consists of two hinged metal plates, moulded to create the square indentations found on waffles. The batter is poured between the plates, and heated to make the waffle. Commonly these come equipped with an internal heating element, although waffle irons exist that do not depend on electricity; they generally are held over an open flame.

Rectangular shaped waffle irons often can be converted to a '''griddle''' (or flat iron) by removing the iron plating and flipping it over.  This is ideally used to make pitchy breads (specifically pancakes), but can also double as an ungreased frying pan (grease will generally run into the spill groove; batter should be too thick).  Oddly shaped or patterned irons usually lack this feature, as they will heat unevenly.  Check the manual or manufacturer's website before attempting this conversion.

And no man hath&lt;br&gt;ascended up to heaven, but he that came&lt;br&gt;down from heaven, even the Son of man&lt;br&gt;which is in heaven.

He&lt;br&gt;that believeth on me, as the scripture hath&lt;br&gt;said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of&lt;br&gt;living water. (But this spake he of the&lt;br&gt;Spirit, which they that believe on him&lt;br&gt;should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not&lt;br&gt;yet given; because that Jesus was not yet&lt;br&gt;glorified.) Joh. 7: 37-38

|And said unto them, It is written, My&lt;br&gt;house shall be called the house of prayer;&lt;br&gt;but ye have made it a den of thieves.&lt;br&gt;Mt. 21: 13 (Joh. 2: 14-17)
|-
|I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me,&lt;br&gt;and art become my salvation. The stone&lt;br&gt;which the builders refused is become the&lt;br&gt;head stone of the corner. This is the&lt;br&gt;Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 118: 22-23
|The Stone&lt;br&gt;rejected by&lt;br&gt;authorities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read&lt;br&gt;in the scriptures, The stone which the&lt;br&gt;builders rejected, the same is become the&lt;br&gt;head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing,&lt;br&gt;and it is marvellous in our eyes?&lt;br&gt;Mt. 21: 42
|-
|Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,&lt;br&gt;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&lt;br&gt;Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he&lt;br&gt;said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye&lt;br&gt;indeed, but understand not; and see ye&lt;br&gt;indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart&lt;br&gt;of this people fat, and make their ears&lt;br&gt;heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see&lt;br&gt;with their eyes, and hear with their ears,&lt;br&gt;and understand with their heart, and &lt;br&gt;convert, and be healed. Is. 6: 8-10
|People do not&lt;br&gt;believe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Therefore they could not believe, because&lt;br&gt;that Esaias said again, He hath blinded&lt;br&gt;their eyes, and hardened their heart; that&lt;br&gt;they should not see with their eyes, nor&lt;br&gt;understand with their heart, and be&lt;br&gt;converted, and I should heal them.&lt;br&gt;These things said Esaias, when he&lt;br&gt;saw His glory, and spake of Him.&lt;br&gt;Joh. 12: 39-41&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|In those days they shall say no more, The&lt;br&gt;fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the&lt;br&gt;children’s teeth are set on edge. But every&lt;br&gt;one shall die for his own iniquity: every&lt;br&gt;man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth&lt;br&gt;shall be set on edge. Behold, the days&lt;br&gt;come, saith the Lord, that I will make a&lt;br&gt;NEW COVENANT with the house of&lt;br&gt;Israel, and with the house of Judah.&lt;br&gt;Jer. 31: 29-31
|Ministers the&lt;br&gt;New Covenant&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|For I say unto you, I will not drink of the&lt;br&gt;fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of&lt;br&gt;God shall come. And he took bread,&lt;br&gt;and gave unto them, saying, This is my&lt;br&gt;body which is given for you: this do in&lt;br&gt;remembrance of me. Likewise also the&lt;br&gt;cup after supper, saying, This cup is the&lt;br&gt;NEW TESTAMENT in my blood which is&lt;br&gt;shed for you. Lu. 22: 18-20&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom&lt;br&gt;I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath&lt;br&gt;lifted up his heel against me. Ps. 41: 9&lt;br&gt;(ca. 1000 B.C.)
|The betrayal of&lt;br&gt;Christ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|I speak not of you all: I know whom I have&lt;br&gt;chosen: but that the scripture may be&lt;br&gt;fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath&lt;br&gt;lifted up his heel against me. Joh. 13: 18
|-
|They that hate me without a cause are&lt;br&gt;more than the hairs of mine head: they that&lt;br&gt;would destroy me, being mine enemies&lt;br&gt;wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that&lt;br&gt;which I took not away. Ps. 69: 4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Hated without&lt;br&gt;cause&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|If I had not done among them the works&lt;br&gt;which none other man did, they had not&lt;br&gt;had sin: but now have they both seen and&lt;br&gt;hate both me and my Father. But this&lt;br&gt;cometh to pass that the word might be&lt;br&gt;fulfilled that is written in their law, They&lt;br&gt;hated me without a cause. Joh. 15: 24-25
|-
|And I said unlo them. If ye think good, give&lt;br&gt;me my price, and if not, forbear. So they&lt;br&gt;weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.&lt;br&gt;Zec. 11: 12
|Price paid for&lt;br&gt;Jesus' betrayal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And said unto them, What will ye give me,&lt;br&gt;and I will deliver him unto you? And they&lt;br&gt;covenanted with him for thirty pieces of&lt;br&gt;silver. Mt. 26: 15
|-
|Awake, O sword, against my shepherd,&lt;br&gt;and against the man that is my fellow, saith&lt;br&gt;the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and&lt;br&gt;the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn&lt;br&gt;mine hand upon the little ones. Zec. 13: 7&lt;br&gt;(ca. 500 B.C)
|Forsaken by&lt;br&gt;disciples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then saith Jesus unto them. All ye shall be&lt;br&gt;offended because of me this night: for it is&lt;br&gt;written, I will smite the shepherd, and the&lt;br&gt;sheep of the flock shall be scattered &lt;br&gt;abroad. Mt. 26: 31 (Mk. 14: 50)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|And the Lord said unlo me, Cast it unto the&lt;br&gt;potter: a goodly price that I was prised at&lt;br&gt;of them. And I took the thirty pieces of&lt;br&gt;silver, and cast them to the potter in the&lt;br&gt;house of the Lord. Zec. 11: 13&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Price of&lt;br&gt;betrayal cast&lt;br&gt;away on a&lt;br&gt;potter’s field&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he cast down the pieces of silver&lt;br&gt;in the temple, and departed, and went and&lt;br&gt;hanged himself. And the chief priests took&lt;br&gt;the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful&lt;br&gt;for to put them into the treasury, because&lt;br&gt;it is the price of blood. And they took&lt;br&gt;counsel, and bought with them the potter’s&lt;br&gt;field, to bury strangers in. Mt. 27: 5-7
|-
|False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my&lt;br&gt;charge things that I knew not. Ps. 35: 11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|False witnesses&lt;br&gt;at His trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|For many bare false witness against him,&lt;br&gt;but their witness agreed not together.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 14: 56
|-
|He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,&lt;br&gt;and as a sheep before her shearers is&lt;br&gt;dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:7
|Silent before&lt;br&gt;His accusers as&lt;br&gt;a lamb to the&lt;br&gt;slaughter
|And he answered him to never a word;&lt;br&gt;insomuch that the governor marvelled&lt;br&gt;greatly. Mt. 27: l4 (Joh. 1: 29)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|But he was wounded for our&lt;br&gt;transgressions, he was bruised for our&lt;br&gt;iniquities: the chastisement of our peace&lt;br&gt;was upon him; and with his stripes we are&lt;br&gt;healed. Is. 53: 5
|Jesus' scourging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
|Then released he Barabbas unto them: and&lt;br&gt;when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered&lt;br&gt;him to be crucified. Mt. 27: 26&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|As many were astonied at thee; his visage&lt;br&gt;was so marred more than any man, and&lt;br&gt;his form more than the sons of men:&lt;br&gt;Is. 52: 14 
|His marred&lt;br&gt;visage (face)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then Jesus came forward, wearing the crown&lt;br&gt;of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilatus&lt;br&gt;said to them, [&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Christianity/ECCEHOMO|&lt;small&gt;ECCEHOMO&lt;/small&gt;]]&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Behold the&lt;br&gt;man. Joh. 19: 5
|-
|And if a man have committed a sin worthy&lt;br&gt;of death, and he be to be put to death, and&lt;br&gt;thou hang him on a tree: His body shall not&lt;br&gt;remain all night upon the tree, but thou&lt;br&gt;shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he&lt;br&gt;that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy&lt;br&gt;land be not defiled, which the Lord thy&lt;br&gt;God giveth thee for an inheritance.&lt;br&gt;De. 21: 22-23
|The Saviour's&lt;br&gt;crucifixion&lt;br&gt;according to the&lt;br&gt;law of the land&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he said unto them the third time, Why,&lt;br&gt;what evil hath he done? I have found no&lt;br&gt;cause of death in him: I will therefore&lt;br&gt;chastise him, and let him go. And they&lt;br&gt;were instant with loud voices, requiring&lt;br&gt;that he might be crucified. And the voices&lt;br&gt;of them and of the chief priests prevailed. &lt;br&gt;And Pilate gave sentence that it should be&lt;br&gt;as they required. Lu. 23: 22-24
|-
|I gave my back to the smiters, and my&lt;br&gt;cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:&lt;br&gt;I hid not my face from shame and spitting.&lt;br&gt;Is. 50: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Spat upon in&lt;br&gt;humiliation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And they smote him on the head with a&lt;br&gt;reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing&lt;br&gt;their knees worshipped him. And when&lt;br&gt;they had mocked him, they took off the&lt;br&gt;purple from him, and put his own clothes&lt;br&gt;on him, and led him out to crucify him.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 15: 19-20
|-
|For dogs have compassed me: the&lt;br&gt;assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:&lt;br&gt;they pierced my hands and my feet.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 22: 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|He is nailed to&lt;br&gt;the cross&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|The other disciples therefore said unto him,&lt;br&gt;We have seen the Lord. But he said unto&lt;br&gt;them, Except I shall see in his hands the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and put my finger into the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his&lt;br&gt;side, I will not believe.&lt;br&gt;Joh. 20: 25 (Re. 1: 7)
|-
|Therefore will I divide him a portion with the&lt;br&gt;great, and he shall divide the spoil with the&lt;br&gt;strong; because he hath poured out his&lt;br&gt;soul unto death: And he was numbered&lt;br&gt;with the transgressors; and he bare the sin&lt;br&gt;of many, and made intercession for the&lt;br&gt;transgressors. Is. 53:12
|Numbered with&lt;br&gt;transgressors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|The parting of&lt;br&gt;His garments by&lt;br&gt;castings lots&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for&lt;br&gt;they know not what they do. And they&lt;br&gt;parted his raiment, and cast lots.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 34
|-
|I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:&lt;br&gt;mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 69: 3
|He becomes&lt;br&gt;thirsty&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|They gave him vinegar to drink mingled&lt;br&gt;with gall: and when he had tasted thereof,&lt;br&gt;he would not drink. Mt. 27: 34

|And they that passed by reviled him,&lt;br&gt;wagging their heads. Mt. 27:39&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|All they that see me laugh me to scorn:&lt;br&gt;they shoot out the lip, they shake the head,&lt;br&gt;saying, He trusted on the Lord that he&lt;br&gt;would deliver him: let him deliver him,&lt;br&gt;seeing he delighted in him. Ps. 22:7, 8
|Railing and&lt;br&gt;taunting toward&lt;br&gt;Christ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|-
|And he bare the sin of many, and made&lt;br&gt;intercession for the transgressors.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|But the other answering rebuked him,&lt;br&gt;saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing&lt;br&gt;thou art in the same condemnation? And&lt;br&gt;we indeed justly; for we receive the due&lt;br&gt;reward of our deeds: but this man hath&lt;br&gt;done nothing amiss. And he said unto&lt;br&gt;Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou&lt;br&gt;comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said&lt;br&gt;unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day&lt;br&gt;shalt thou be with me in paradise.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 42-43

|An intense&lt;br&gt;lonely cry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|-
|For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;&lt;br&gt;neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to&lt;br&gt;see corruption.

Then&lt;br&gt;opened he their understanding, that they&lt;br&gt;might understand the scriptures, And&lt;br&gt;said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus&lt;br&gt;it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise&lt;br&gt;from the dead the third day: And that&lt;br&gt;repentance and remission of sins should&lt;br&gt;be preached in his name among all&lt;br&gt;nations, beginning at Jerusalem, And&lt;br&gt;ye are witnesses of these things.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 24: 44-48 (Ac. 2: 22-28)

While you were as&lt;br&gt;sheep gone astray; you are now returned&lt;br&gt;to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.&lt;br&gt;I Pe. 2: 22-25 (1 Co. 15: 3)

[[Image:Toaster.jpg|thumb|right|A Toaster]]

A '''toaster''' is a kitchen appliance for toasting food such as sliced bread, crumpets, and bagels. Toasted bread is called toast. A typical toaster uses heat radiated from hot electric elements to heat a piece of bread. The toasting process consists of reducing the bread's water content, raising its temperature, and slightly charring and caramelizing its surface. The caramelizing process is a chemical reaction in which the complex starch molecules break apart into simpler sugar molecules upon heating. That is why toast is usually sweeter than normal bread.

More recent additions to toaster technology include the ability to toast frozen bread (as with the toaster pictured), separate operation levers to allow users to toast either two or four slices, and reheating functions which allow toast to be warmed without being burned.

A '''pasta maker''' or '''pasta machine''' is a medium-sized kitchen tool designed to simplify the process of rolling and cutting [[Cookbook:Egg Noodles|egg noodles]], or other kinds of dough to make fresh [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] such as ravioli, lasagne, fettuccine, and tagliatelle.

The machine is used to roll pasta dough into a progressively thinner sheet with each pass through the machine. When the desired thickness is reached, the sheet can be used as it is to make ravioli. Some machines (like the one shown) have inbuilt cutters where the sheet can be passed through a cutter and separated into strips of the appropriate width.

Unlike an extrusion type pasta maker, the manual type has a crank attached or in most cases, slots for a crank on the side.  The crank turns a series of rollers, some interlocking to cut, and others just to flatten.  An adjuster wheel on one side controls the distance between the flat roller wheels.  There are typically two sets of cutting wheels, each with its own slot for the crank.  One set is very finely spaced for cutting spaghetti, the other is spaced at about ¼&quot; (5 mm) for fettuccine.</text>

== Arabia, Pre-Islam ==
Before the rise of Islam, the Arabian peninsula was dominated by nomadic '''Bedouin''' cultures that dominated the region.  The polytheistic bedouin clans placed heavy emphasis on kin-related groups, with each clan clustered under tribes.  Warfare between tribes was common among the Bedouin, and warfare was given a high honor.  The difficult living conditions in the Arabian peninsula created a heavy emphasis on family cooperation, further strengthening the clan system.

Although the majority of Arabia was nomadic, there were several important cities that came into being as centers of trade and religion, such as Yathrib [Medina], '''Mecca''', Karbala and Damascus.  The most important of these cities was Mecca, which was an important center of trade in the area, as well as the location of the '''Ka'ba''', one of the most revered shrines in polytheistic Arabia.

Culturally, Pre-Islamic Arabia was similar to what would come later, with some notable differences.  Pre-Islam, most Bedouin tribes were polytheistic and animist, with some notable exceptions (three of the ruling tribes of Yathrib were Jewish).  A few tribes worshiped one supreme being, called Allah, but this was not common.  Like later cultures in the region, the Bedouin tribes placed heavy importance on poetry as well as oral tradition.

== Muhammad and the Beginnings of Islam ==
'''Muhammad''' was born to the prominent Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe.  His father died befor he was born and his mother died when he was six. He was raised by his grandfather until he died when Muhammad was eight and later by his uncle.  Muhammad was raised as, and became, a merchant.

While a young man, Muhammad worked as a trader for a wealthy widow, '''Khadijah''', whom he would marry a few years later.  His work as a merchant arguably influenced his philosophy as he encountered different cultures and religions, most notably Christianity and Judaism.

Around 610 AD, Muhammad received the first of his revelations from the angel Gabriel; these revelations were written (in Arabic) into the '''Qu'ran''', where they would form the basis for the religion of '''Islam'''.  The early followers of this new faith were small, including mostly his wife, some clansmen, some servants and slaves.  Muhammad began to preach his new faith to his clan and the people of Mecca.

As Islam spread, the dominant clan in Mecca, the '''Umayyad''', saw the new faith as a threat to their political power and to their religious power held by controlling the polytheistic shrines at Ka'ba.  As the religion spread, Muhammad grew to be further threatened by the Umayyads.  Muhammad was perceived as a danger similar to the conditions in Yathrib, where two religions (Judaism and the Bedouin religion) fought for power.  

Because of the the danger for Muhammad and his followers in Mecca, they left Mecca in favor of Yathrib.  This event is known as the ''hijra''.  Muhammad was jubilantly welcomed in Yathrib, and the city was renamed &quot;Medina&quot;, due to his ability to end the religious quarrels in the city.  Islam spread rapidly in Medina, and became a center of the new faith.  Muhammad's power grew in the city of Medina.

Under Muhammad's leadership, Medina strengthened in power and soon rivaled Mecca.  Muslim raids on Meccan treaders further endangered the Umayyads.  The Quraysh fought with the Muslims in the mid-620s.  In 628, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with the Umayyads.  In 629, Muhammad and 10,000 converts returned to Mecca.  Claiming to have proven the power of Allah, the shrine at Ka'ba was smashed. The Umayyads and others in Mecca converted to Islam in time.

== The Rise and Fall of the Umayyad Empire ==
Muslim armies conquered most of Arabia by 633, further spreading Islam.  Muslim armies soon conquered north Africa, Mesopotamia and Persia, significantly shaping the history of the world through the spread of Islam there.

Following the death of Muhammad in 632, tribal leaders convened on who should succed him.  After much debate between the choices of '''Ali''' (Muhammad's son-in-law) and '''Abu Bakr''' (Muhammad's close friend, an early convert, and political strong), Abu Bakr was chosen to lead and became the first caliph, this decision would later spawn controversy.'''Ali''' would go on to become the fourth caliph later 

During the caliphate of Abu Bakr (632-634 AD), the warlike Bedouin clans united to spread Islam.  The weakness of the rich Byzantine and Persian empires encouraged them to expand.  These new lands were placed under Arab control through this jihad (Western fallacy is that jihad is used to spread Islam.  Jihad is a struggle and comes in many forms).

A '''dough hook''' is a [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] attachment, typically shaped like a helix (corkscrew shape) or hook. Beaters are used with foods which require great force to mix. Example usages:

*[[Cookbook:Knead|kneading]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* kneading [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] dough
*mixing tough cookie batter

Dough hooks are not very good for making [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] from [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Beat|beating]] [[Cookbook:Egg|Eggs]] to make a [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]], or mixing thin [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] batter. Normal [[Cookbook:Beater|beaters]] are much more efficient for these tasks.

Unlike most beaters, dough hooks are typically easy to clean.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Autonomic Nervous System==
*maintains homeostasis by controlling organs, glands, and heart
*controls blood flow, pressure, body temp, and stomach secretions

==Introduction==
*Definition: motor neurons that supply nerves to glands, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles
*The somatic nervous system has different effectors, pathways, and neurotransmitters
*motor unit of ANS is two-neuron chain
**preganglionic neuron is in CNS
**preganglionic axon synapses with ganglionic neuron (an autonomic ganglion) outside CNS
***axon is lightly myelinated, thin
**postganglionic axon extends from the ganglionic neuron to the effector organ
***axon is unmyelinated, thinner
*somatic motor division has no ganglia
*norepinephrine is released at effector organs in sympathetic division
*acetylcholine is released at effector organs in parasympathetic division

==ANS Divisions==
*Parasympathetic and Sympathetic
**usually have opposite effects on same organs/glands - called ''dual innervation''
#Parasympathetic Division
#*conserves body energy
#*maintains base levels for homeostasis
#Parasympathetic effects:
#*pupils constrict
#*increased digestion activity
#*lowered blood pressure, heart rate, breathing
#Sympathetic division
#*fight-or-flight
#Sympathetic responses:
#*pupils dilate
#*increased blood pressure, heart rate, breathing
#*bronchioles dilate
#*increased blood glucose levels for increased muscle activity
#*sweating
#*During exercise, blood is taken from the skin and digestive viscera to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles.

==ANS Anatomy==
*divisions are distinguished by
**origin
***parasympathetic - brain and sacrum
***sympathetic - thoracic and lumbar
**length of fibers
***parasympathetic - long preganglionic, short postganglionic
***sympathetic - short preganglionic, long postganglionic
**location of ganglia
***parasympathetic - close to visceral effector organs
***sympathetic - close to spine

===Parasympathetic===
*oculomotor nerves (III) - for constricting pupils
*facial nerves (VII) - activates nasal, lacrimal, and salivary glands
*glossopharyngeal nerves (IX) - salivary glands
*vagus nerves (X) - 90% of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers
**to neck, nerve plexuses
**cardiac plexuses
**pulmonary plexuses
**esophageal plexuses
**aortic plexus
**supplies liver, gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, kidneys, pancreas, proximal large intestine
*sacral outflow
**serves distal large intestine, bladder, ureters, reproductive organs
*parasympathetic fibers never run in spinal nerves

===Sympathetic===
*more complex than parasympathetic - more organs
*sympathetic neurons produce the lateral horns, which are absent in sacral region of spinal cord
*nerves leave cord through the ventral root
**pass through the white ramus
**enter chain ganglion, where it either:
**#synapses in same ganglion

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nut}} | [[Cookbook:Vegetables]] | [[Cookbook:Legume|Legume]]

The '''peanut''', also known as the '''groundnut fruit''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Legume|legume]] that is often used as if it were a [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]].

Peanuts are used to make [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]], [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], and [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]].

==Recipes featuring peanuts include==
*[[Cookbook:Gado-gado|Gado-gado]]

==Warnings==
*Moldy peanuts are deadly. They contain [[w:Aflatoxin|aflatoxin]]. In time, even low amounts can lead to cancer.
*Many people are horribly allergic to peanuts. [[Cookbook:Cashew|Cashews]] can often be substituted.</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Microsoft's XPS format ==
Someone added: &quot;Microsoft has introduced a new PDF-like fixed document format named XPS, based on XML. This format has already gained the support of many industry heavyweights and is poised to become a great format for archival purposes.&quot; Appart from not being NPOV the comparison with PDF is not quite correct. I'll look at that after the move. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 21:06, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== HTML vs. RTF ==

I'm surprised to see no mention of HTML.
Is RTF significantly superior to HTML?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

See this article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_document_markup_languages

Good point, I think I'll redo that bit. The danger is that people using MSOffice will think that saving it as html is a good thing. In that specific case RTF is better. -- Duncan (not signed in)

== JPEG vs. PNG ==
I'd like to point out that JPEGs saved at level 12 (highest quality) are, in fact, lossless. They are sometimes also smaller (though not always) than an equivalent PNG image, and thus may be preferable for use (especially considering their universal use; not all applications can read PNG.)

''No. JPEGs are always lossy.''
''Have you ever compared images before and after JPEG compression?''
''The [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/section-13.html JPEG FAQ (Last-modified: 28 March 1999)] says''

:&quot;cranking a regular JPEG implementation up to its maximum quality setting *does not* get you lossless storage; even at the highest possible quality setting, baseline JPEG is lossy because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  Roundoff errors alone are nearly always too small to be seen, but they will accumulate if you put the image through multiple cycles of compression (see section 10).&quot;

''While I've heard that the Joint Photographic Experts Group are working on lossless compression of images, my understanding is that far more applications understand PNG than any kind of &quot;lossless JPEG&quot;.''
''If this situation has changed since 1999, I will be very suprised -- please tell me more. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)''

: The JPEG2000 standard allows for lossless compression, but it is a) proprietary (that is, licenses need to be purchased for software implementing the standard) and b) not highly deployed or well supported in software due to a) ... 
: ''The thing about standards is... there's so many of them to choose from.''
: -- [[User:Horst.Burkhardt|Horst.Burkhardt]] ([[User talk:Horst.Burkhardt|talk]]) 08:21, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

== patents ==

While patents may be a problem '''now''', they are certainly no special risk for '''long-term''' data storage. If anything, that eliminates the risk. The patent will expire. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Thoughts (Encryption, DRM, Spreadsheets, multiple formats) ==

Perhaps the dangers of DRM and encryption should be mentioned? I'd hate to see someone archive something in, say, an encrypted odf and forget the key... Also, why are databases and spreadsheets listed together? Why isn't it mentioned that it may be wise to store multiple copies? For example, keeping an ODF and an ASCII text file of the same thing, or a vector graphic and then a rasterized copy.

:Please sign you comments in future. Someone is very welcome to write about DRM. Not my field. Password issues are valid and should be included, would anyone like to add a note where appropriate? Yes, people should keep multiple copies, but that's for a backup article to say, maybe we could mention it though. ODF files are ASCII compliant, though I have questions about the uncompression issues in the future - any thoughts out there? --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 09:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

==linking style==
Why did you change [[Cookbook:Gado-gado]]? Maybe you misread my changes. To someone ''not'' editing the page, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s and [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; look identical. ([[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s and [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]) To someone editing the page, it is easier to read and change the wikitext if the &quot;s&quot; is inside the square brakets.
* Untrue.  Putting the plural outside of the square brackets is better style.  It discourages the habits of using piped links and redirects unnecessarily, and it discourages the habit of treating the square brackets as if they were parentheses, which they are ''not''.  (I've seen ''punctuation'' put inside the square brackets before now, because of such thinking.)  The claim that it is easier to change the wikitext if the whole word is within the square brackets is false.  (After all, [[Help:Editing#Links.2C_URLs|link]]ing is a basic feature of the wiki markup that every editor soon learns to be familiar with.)  Indeed, doing so actually makes things ''harder'' to edit, since it encourages practices and thinking that lead to mistakes and broken links, for the reasons given. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 09:30, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
** You're using Wikipedia thinking on Wikibooks, where it truly does not belong. Piped links are mandatory here. If I wish to change the word, the rules of the English language dictate that I might also need to change the ending. I should not need to hit the arrow key or delete and retype the square brackets. Having the word in one place is obviously more readable too; breaking words for no reason is very bad.
*** Wrong on both counts.  The wiki markup is the same everywhere, and the same thinking applies everywhere.  (You are apparently unaware that the page that I linked to above, [[Help:Editing]], is the same everywhere.  It's from Meta.)  And piped links are ''not'' mandatory here.  They are simply ''more common'', which is simply because hiding the existence of sub-pages is more common.  That's not the same as being mandatory.  Moreover, the argument about &quot;rules of the English language&quot; is just silly.  There are no &quot;rules of the English language&quot; that dictate wiki markup.  There ''are'', however, good stylistic and foolproofing reasons to take advantage of the WikiMedia blended ending feature, which I've outlined above. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 23:29, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==the [[Cookbook]] style==
We don't use subpages in the cookbook. This has been generally agreed upon and accepted. Please take care next time you edit pages related to the cookbook. Following the style everyone else uses would be greatly appreciated. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:58, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
*''This has been generally agreed upon and accepted.'' &amp;mdash;  False.  See the big pastel box at the top of [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]].  ''Please take care next time you edit pages related to the cookbook.'' &amp;mdash;  The person that you should be addressing your comments to is the anonymous user who created the cookbook pages without adhering to ''any'' convention, not me.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:26, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
**Yes indeed, see that page. In the pink box: &quot;for all '''future''' Wikibooks&quot;. Then, if you can read down the page a bit, the Cookbook is given as an example of a book using the &quot;:&quot; convention. So, right on that page, it says you should use the &quot;:&quot; for the Cookbook. Then you can simply look around in the Cookbook, see [[User_talk:Gentgeen]] where Gentgeen agrees with me, notice that even the recipe template uses &quot;:&quot; notation... Note that I do have some respect for people who can admit they are wrong. In any case, you are expected to abide by the style of any book you edit, even if you don't like that style. Style changes need to be generally agreed upon '''by the normal cookbook editors''' (Gentgeen, me, Redlentil, etc.), then fully implemented with the horrendous task of converting everything. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:37, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
***''I do have some respect for people who can admit they are wrong.'' &amp;mdash; By that principle, we should only respect you for admitting that you were wrong for addressing your comments to me instead of to the anonymous user who created the cookbook pages without adhering to ''any'' convention.  You still haven't. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)

''I am my contributions history''

Heh. Lemme guess. Someone complained about the &quot;red link&quot;. But I agree with you.

== Transwiki ==
I see you either you or your bot is moving pages from the transwiki pseudo-namespace into the [[Cookbook]] without fixing the links. For example, [[Cookbook:Drawn butter]]. Can you please avoid this, since newbies tend to click on these and fill them in with dictionary definitions. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
*The 'bot copies the pages exactly as they stand, as it should.  If you want the internal links turned into interwiki links, then either ''fix them yourself'' or have some patience and ''wait'' until I've processed the entire queue and I'm free to go back and join everything up.  (It should be obvious that I'm only partway through a long task.  I haven't even linked the new cookbook recipes into the Cookbook proper, yet.) [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:43:56, 2005-08-18 (UTC)
**Okay. It's fine if you intend to fix all this yourself, but I'd prefer you did these transwikis one at a time, and fix them before moving onto the next. As a general rule, stuff dumped here from WP which is not fixed up to conform will get deleted. Sorry, but I don't have the time to fix-up all the unwanted shite from WP. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:18, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
***There's no &quot;unwanted shite from Wikipedia&quot;.  That's simply false.  I suggest less parochialism and more looking at what is actually the case.  Read the transwiki log and the actual articles that have come through the system.  As for how you would prefer me to work, since you state that you don't &quot;don't have time&quot; to do the actual work yourself, you'll have to accept the way that those of us who ''do'' do the work, choose to do it. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)
****Even if &quot;the work&quot; you &quot;choose&quot; to &quot;do&quot; is more of a hinderance to our goals than a help? However. Let me try to be more helpful. I don't mind people leaving stuff in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, but when moving content from there to an actual book, it ought to meet the guidelines of the book in question. If you can't be bothered to fix it up, then just leave it in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, so someone else can do it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:29, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
*****''Even if &quot;the work&quot; you &quot;choose&quot; to &quot;do&quot; is more of a hinderance to our goals than a help?'' &amp;mdash; It's not a hindrance in any way.  Your question is based upon a false premise and is unanswerable.  It's also sneering in tone.  The remainder of your comments, talking about what &quot;I prefer&quot; and &quot;I don't mind&quot;, come across as exceedingly egotistical, moreover.  You are not the king of Wikibooks.  That's [[User:Jimbo Wales]].&lt;p&gt;''If you can't be bothered to fix it up'' &amp;mdash;  Have a care!  If there's anyone at whom the charge of &quot;cannot be bothered&quot; can be levelled at here, it is ''you'', not anyone else.  See your above response to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sofixit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;p&gt;''just leave it in the transwiki pseudo-namespace, so someone else can do it'' &amp;mdash;  That's entirely the wrong idea, and is a recipe for stagnation.  If an editor knows what book or bookshelf the transwikied article belongs in, then it is perfectly all right to rename the article there and link it into the book/bookshelf, leaving further attention to the article to other editors.  Wikibooks is founded upon the notion of ''collaborative editing'', remember.  It is ''not'' required that one editor do either everything or nothing.  Rather, it is perfectly acceptable for one editor to do just ''one'' of the steps towards improving a book.  Every little helps.  [[User:Kellen]] is demonstrating collaboration in action.  This is how wikis are supposed to work.  Please watch and learn.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:03:55, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
******Okay. Let's end this exchange of personal insults, as it's not achieving anything useful. In keeping with site policy, you ought to update your bot's code to change links of the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:article|article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:49, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*******Again you demand that ''I'' do edits that ''you'' (singular) want made.  I reiterate the &amp;#123;&amp;#123;sofixit&amp;#125;&amp;#125; above: ''If you want something edited, edit it yourself.''  This is a wiki.  I also reiterate my suggestion that you watch and learn from [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 23:51, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
*****I think in the case of the Cookbook, the additional tagging of things with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; takes care of this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
Hi, for the transwikis, would you mind adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top so that we can see they need help? Thanks! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:25, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
*Bear in mind that if you want to tag all of the pages with whatever tags you like yourself, you need only follow [[Special:Contributions/Uncle G's 'bot]] or (the probably more convenient) [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log/Articles moved to here]]. (I haven't logged the page moves in the latter, yet.  But it is reasonably obvious even without that which are the recipe articles.) [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 02:33:06, 2005-08-19 (UTC)
**I'm not trying to be snarky, but if you have a bot going through stuff, a lot of which is Cookbook-related, it would be more useful for your bot to automatically tag them than for someone like me to go through and manually tag them. This will lessen the amount of work you do later (assuming you'd update links, etc, etc by hand) since someone unfamiliar with the fact that you are doing transwikis might pay more attention to them if they're properly demarcated. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:20, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki of images ==
What's the proper form for the tranwiki-ing of images? I have [[w:Image:Arambas.jpg]], which should probably go to commons (it's linked from a transwikied recipe; unlinked anywhere else on WP). I didn't see any documentation on this -- do I just save it and reupload it? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:08, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*I don't know.  I've never done it.  If an image were a ''public domain'' image, then you could just download and upload it.  I don't know the procedure for GFDL images.  I believe that, for starters, you're supposed to upload all of the older revisions of the image in addition to the current one.  The problem with ''that'' particular image is that it isn't tagged with its copyright status, so we don't even know whether it is allowable on Commons at all.  I've listed it at [[w:Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:11:01, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

== Nomination for Adminship ==
I hope you don't mind, but I've [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Nominations for adminship|nominated you for adminship]] here on Wikibooks.  You've been a solid editor and contributor here, and seem to have a good grasp of what is going on in terms of general policies.  I'm not expecting you to necessarily be active in admin duties, but you certainly have proven yourself ''here'' on Wikibooks as an avid contributor and somebody IMHO worthy to have the extra privileges that can be given to admins.  If you would like this, please reply and accept the nomination. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

== MoC ==

Hi, I'm curious what you think of [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/The_Manual_of_Crime#Jimbo.27s_recommendation_on_Wikibooks_policy|Jimbo's comment]] with respect to the MoC (and indeed to wikibooks in general). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Sandbox and bot ==
Please change the way your bot resets [[WB:SB|Sandbox]]. Sandbox does not need to be included in the page any more, because it's included in {{tl|Welcome to the SandBox!}}. Now there are two shortcuts in Sandbox. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 00:12, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
*Done.  It will take effect from the next pass. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==
Transwikied articles aren't easy to find now. I suggest your bot adds a template categorising new articles in category like ''Transwikied articles''. We should also provide link to this category and instructions what to do with these pages, f.e. from Projects in Community portal. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:57, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
*They're easy to find, and always have been.  No categories are required.  All transwikifications performed by me are recorded in the [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 01:07, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
But this page is not linked well, it's hard to reach it. BTW, why your bot does not have bot flag? I don't like bots appearing at recent changes. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
*It's the standard place to find the transwiki log on ''all'' projects.  And [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does not do the sort of high volume work that requires a flag.  That's the remit of [[User:Uncle G's major work 'bot]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:14, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== computer systems ==
I am making a list of all laptop computers currently sold (new) for under $500.
I think such a list should go on a wiki. (That way, other people can help me keep the list up-to-date by removing things that are no longer being manufactured, and adding new things as they come on the market).

(I've already stuck the list online at
http://communitywiki.org/odd/ComputerComponent/NoteBook
.
However, that location is very experimental / non-permanent, and I'm looking for a better location.
)

Do you think such a list would be appropriate for Wikibooks? Should I stick that list on or near modules [[Computers for Beginners/Buying A Computer]] or [[How To Build A Computer]], or is there somewhere else more appropriate?

I ask you because I see from [[Special:Undelete/Computer_Magazine/Systems/Reviews]] that
: Uncle G deleted &quot;Computer Magazine/Systems/Reviews&quot; (Reviews are fundamentally incompatible with the [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].)
I hope this simple &quot;list of all laptop computers currently sold (new) for under $500&quot; can be made NPOV without too many conflicts. What do you think?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:55, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
*Speaking for myself only and not for other editors (so double check at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]): Unlike the case for reviews, the question here is one of compatibility with the project aims, not neutrality.  A simple catalogue of computer prices, even a collaboratively written one, doesn't seem to me to fall within the &quot;instructional and educational texts&quot; remit of Wikibooks ''at all''.  It's neither instructional nor educational.  One wouldn't expect to find that sort of thing within a school textbook on computers or within a &quot;teach yourself computers&quot; book.  I don't see it as falling squarely within the &quot;sum of human knowledge&quot; remit of the Wikimedia Foundation projects as a whole, even.  The Wikimedia project whose remit comes closest would be Wikipedia, but it's not close enough I think.  A collaboratively maintained catalogue of computers by price would almost certainly be excluded from Wikipedia, on the grounds of it being original research and Wikipedia not being a resource for conducting business.  I know that customer-maintained &quot;price watch&quot; sites exist elsewhere on the World Wide Web.  Have a look around to see whether there is one that covers laptop PCs.  If not, maybe it's time for you to set up your second wiki. &amp;#9786; [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:31, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

*I actually saw the discussion.  If the community is happy that we actually ''need'' users with this privilege (as opposed to relying upon Stewards) in the first place, I'll accept that nomination.  Do you think that we need the opinions of more editors on that? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:49, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
**I think 2-3 people with CheckUser rights would be just ok, but I don't see third candidate for this function now, noone has expressed will to become one. Maybe you have any suggestions? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
***I'll think it over.  Are 2 insufficient? [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

*[[Special:Import]] is only available to administrators.  [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does not have administrator privileges, and so cannot use it. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
**Aren't you an admin here?

***That's wrong.  You are confused about what Wikibooks doesn't want.  What Wikibooks doesn't want is people just copying and pasting articles from other projects here.  That's very different to the proper transwikifications that [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]] does.  The 'bot does all of the several things that are necessary for GFDL compliance.  Part of the reason that we don't want people just copying and pasting articles here is that plain copies and pastes ''aren't'' GFDL-compliant, and unless someone like me comes and fixes them to be GFDL compliant (which I've actually done several times in the past few years &amp;mdash; using the 'bot) we have to delete them for copyright reasons.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:35, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
****Well, that's part of it, but the advantage of imported pages is that the contrib list is all in one place (rather than partially on the history page and partly on the talk page). There are still some cases where we could use the bot though, since Import won't work on pages with much over 1k revisions (surprisingly, there are a lot of those). You don't need a bot for importing... it's very fast and easy, automatically added to the import log, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:02, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

== Deletes? ==
Hi - thanks for the work - appreciated.  I see you marked a couple of autobio type pages for deletion.  I ''think'' they are supposed to be subpages of [[Instructional Technology]] (a class project type one I think with a few other misnamed pages).  Would you be happy with them being moved to there?

==new books and such==
So, I ask around where to put a new book about FIT2D. People tell me that that is a 'good question' and suggest the Physics bookshelf. The latter proves to be a protected page, but there is a [[Modern Physics]] book that has a page titled [[Modern Physics:X-Ray Diffraction Techniques|X-ray ''diffraction'']] but only contained references to [[XANES]] which is X-ray ''spectroscopy'' not diffraction. So I clean it up a bit and start my FIT2D page there and now it gets tagged as not being linked ot anything, but [[XANES]] does not. Is this part of a general policy to discourage any new additions?

[[User:Iarlagab|Iarlagab]] 13:50, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*Please read our [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], and [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]].  Our policy is to encourage textbooks, and we attempt to ensure that orphaned single pages aren't left lying around forgotten.

==Catullus==

Hello, I've been making steady progress on [[The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus]], and I've got quite a few poems comprehensively annotated. I was wondering, where I could find a template that warns the user of obscene content? Similar to the template right at the top of the contents page. As you may know, Catullus was infamous for his downright disgusting remarks to his enemies. Thanks in advance. [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 17:13, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

Actually, looking at the code, I think I can do just as well by editing yours? Would something like this be appropriate? [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Poetry_of_Gaius_Valerius_Catullus/113 Catullus 113] [[User:Alakazam38|Alakazam38]] 17:19, 12 May 2007 (UTC)
*We generally, on any Wikimedia Foundation project, don't do individual content disclaimers for individual pages.  In part this is because there is no neutral standard for deciding what pages such disclaimers should not apply to, and in part because they are wholly redundant.  At the bottom of ''every page here'' you will find a link to the project's disclaimers, amongst which is our [[Wikibooks:Content disclaimer]], which applies globally to all content.

==[[Special Relativity]]==

Thanks for tackling the issue of deleting that page.  The page in question is no longer linked from the main TOC to the advanced section of the book and it is good that you have raised the issue of whether it should exist at all. SR is in a conceptual vice with the ill informed skeptics on the one hand trying to undermine it using Euclidean ideas and working theoretical physicists on the other hand saying (correctly) that the geometrical interpretation of SR is inconsistent with GR! It is difficult to know what to do in this situation and I have just reflexly taken the approach of adding another section where an objection would undermine the text (probably incorrectly in the case that you raised).

*Has it ''actually'' done so?  Did the OTRS volunteer, whoever that was, check that the person from the U.N. contacting xem was in fact authorized to re-licence the copyright?   Did xe check that the U.N. even had the rights to re-licence those of its books that have long lists of authors (such as ''Living with Risk'' whose list of contributors extends to 4 pages)?  Did xe check that the U.N. was actually licencing this as [[w:free content|free content]]?  It might have been merely confirming what it says in the copyright licence of (for example) ''Indicators of Progress'', which is that &quot;Any part of this text may be reproduced without permission provided that it is reproduced accurately and not in a misleading context and the source of the material is clearly acknowledged by means of the above title, publisher and date.&quot;, which is non-free because it prevents the creation of modified versions that differ from the original.

**I was the person who handled that, and the answer is &quot;yes&quot; on all counts.

****No you didn't, you nominated them for speedy deletion. I'm guessing you would have deleted immediately yourself them if you had the tools. The only reasons these questions got asked is because you couldn't delete them yourself, and I happened to notice that you had tagged them.&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't have to point out that as an OTRS agent it's basically my job to handle permissions issues like this adequately - I do have some idea what I'm doing, otherwise I wouldn't have access. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:55, 4 December 2008 (UTC)
*****Your assumptions reflect how ''you'' would handle this, not how I would.  Stop painting me with your own colours.  You clearly don't handle things well.  That doesn't mean that I would do as you do.&lt;p&gt;How I would handle it is, self-evidently, how I ''did'' handle it, by nominating the articles for deletion as copyright violations.  I notice that you once again failed to answer the question, which I have clearly asked twice, and which I clearly ''did'' ask.  (Again, it's right there in front of you, above.)  This avoidance on your part leads me to doubt your claims that you handled this properly.  You are an OTRS ''volunteer'', not an OTRS ''agent''.  You don't automatically assume a mantle of infallibility by volunteering for something.  Are you going to answer the questions?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hmm, I see that beater has moved to mixer. I'm not familiar with a distinction between beaters and mixers. To me, it seems that different cultures have different norms for their terminology. For me, it's beater for the hand powered, hand-held, and the bench top versions. But, I suppose that the majority opinion rules. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 03:16, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

[[Image:Bain-marie.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Using two pots as a double boiler]]

A '''double boiler''' is a double-walled cooking pot with water in between the walls. This construction limits the maximum temperature to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] point of water, which is generally about [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|200 °F to 212 °F]] (93°C to 100 °C). Two suitably sized pots can function as a double boiler, provided that the inner pot can be kept from touching the outer pot (except perhaps at the top edge) and can be kept stable enough.

If the inner pot seals fairly well against the outer pot, it is not necessary for the inner pot to touch the water.

Double boilers are most commonly used to melt [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]. They can be used to cook [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], preventing the outside from crusting before the inside is fully cooked. Double boilers are also used in the making of Hollandaise sauce and custard-style ice creams to cook egg yolks.

A similar device is the [[Cookbook:Bain-Marie|bain-marie]], which is for use in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section explains the various camera types and accessories available on the market. It does not attempt to categorize '''all''' available accessories - that's impossible - but attempts to describe the generic types of cameras and accessories available.

==Buying a camera==

===Types of digital cameras===

Broadly speaking Digital cameras can be segregated into two major types: '''Consumer''' and '''Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR)'''. A third type, the '''Prosumer''' camera, usually offers all the features of the consumer camera with some of the features of the DSLR. 

*'''Digital Consumer Cameras'''
:These are made as an all-in-one device. They typically have a fixed lens, and are often loaded with a lot of gimmicks to make them attractive to the average consumer. '''Consumer''' cameras can be roughly divided in two subcategories: 

:* [[wikipedia:Point-and-shoot_camera|Compact Cameras]]
[[File:Panasonic-lumix-tz5.jpg|thumb|right|A Panasonic Lumix TZ5 compact camera]]
::These are generally designed with form in mind over functionality, and are designed to have a high form-factor for the stylish crowd. They tend to have very basic user control or have predefined modes, and often don't allow for much manual adjustments. Typically, these cameras have more pixels and lower image quality.

::These cameras are a good choice if you always want to have your camera with you; they tend to have good form-factor and are lightweight, and most of them can fit into your pocket. Point-and-Shoot cameras can be used without any special knowledge, so they are attractive for those who just want to document events in their lives and do not want go deep into technical aspects of photography.

:* High-end Consumer Cameras
[[File:S6000fujifilmfinepix.jpeg|thumb|right|Fujifilm Finepix S6000 bridge camera.]]
:: These have additional manual control features to allow more creativity and flexibility. For the photography enthusiast, these tend to be the bridge between Point-and-Shoot, and the almost inevitable progression to Digital SLR. 

:: In fact, some of these cameras try to look like Digital SLR cameras but do not have interchangeable lenses and ''Through The Lens'' viewfinder. As they are built with components similar to those found in the Point-and-Shoot cameras, they also suffer from the technical limitations of the Point-and-Shoot cameras. However, better quality control and the use of better optics means these camera can deliver images that are quite good.

: If you have a limited budget and still want to get some of the effects like DOF (Depth Of Field) in your shots then you must select the camera which provides the option of Aperture and Shutter Priority shooting Modes. You can select the model based after trying your hand to click using these settings at the shop. There are many Digital Consumer Camera which have these facilities. Th

[[File:Nikon D700 mit 105-1.8 01 08.jpg|thumb|The Nikon D700 professional camera.]]
*'''Digital Single Lens Reflex Cameras (Digital SLR) '''
:These have ''Through The Lens'' viewfinder, and typically have an interchangeable lens (there are a few digital SLRs which have fixed lenses. In general, however, SLR cameras, both traditional and digital, will have interchangeable lenses). The image sensors on digital SLRs are much larger and of a different construction than on consumer cameras and contributes to higher image quality. 

:Digital SLR focuses on giving high manual control to the user, and when combined with possibility to change lenses, gives a high degree of flexibility to the user. Entry-level Digital SLRs usually have several different automatic modes (similar to Consumer cameras) to make them less intimidating for beginners.

:The high degree of quality control and the array of high-quality optic lenses has a correspondingly huge drawback: cost. A Digital SLR tends to cost a good deal, and a professional level Digital SLR can be 10 to 20 times the cost of a Consumer camera.. ''before'' adding the cost of the lens.

[[File:Nikon D80DSLR.jpg|thumb|Nikon D80, the successor to the D70]]
*'''Digital Prosumer Cameras'''
:'Prosumer' is a term coined by the media and picked up by the industry to describe cameras that are professional in quality but yet sold at consumer prices. It can also be used to describe users of said cameras.

:As such, Prosumer cameras can be either High-end Consumer cameras, or Digital SLR. The key distinguishing factor is high quality at a low price band, and not so much the type of camera.

:As a practical example, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]]'s ''D70'', a Digital SLR, is generally talked of as a prosumer camera model, and/ or as an entry-level Digital SLR. At the same time, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]]'s recent addition to their ''Coolpix'' series are largely SLR-like cameras which are also considered prosumer due to their quality.

:In recent years, as the technology in digital photography progressed and matured, [[wikipedia:Nikon|Nikon]] in particular has been pushing more models into the prosumer market. In a similar vein, [[wikipedia:Canon|Canon]] has also been pushing their digital camera models in this direction in direct competition. Other manufacturers like [[wikipedia:Sony|Sony]] and [[wikipedia:Fujifilm|Fujifilm]] are pushing more towards the Point-and-Shoot market, with more emphasis on form-factor and ease-of-use rather than on pushing the capability of their cameras.

:As such, while more prosumer cameras are on the market, these are largely from very well established manufacturers that has extensive experience in camera manufacturing. At the same time, a slew of Point-and-Shoot cameras are coming on the market, some from companies which have very little experience in this industry.

===Memory Cards===
Nearly all digital cameras have an SD-Slot and many newer cameras can use the SDHC-Cards up to 32GB. So the memory card type should not be the deciding factor when purchasing a camera. 
However, if you have other digital devices that use memory cards like an Smartphone, then this may factor into your decision, because not only will this allow you to save some the cost of duplicate sets of cards, but it may allow you directly view the photographs on your Smartphone.

That being said, here is a list of the most popular memory card formats:


'''[[:wikipedia:SD_Card|Secure Digital]]''' [[File:SDHC_memory_card_8GB.png|thumb|8GB SDHC card]] (SDHC) are widely available in a wide range of sizes (up to 32GB) and are cheaper than CompactFlash (CF). 
Because of their smaller size, they are available in many cameras from entry-level up to DSLR-Cameras. 
There is also newer SDXC standard that allows for up to 2TB capacity, many newer devices since 2010 do support these cards.

There is also older SD standard that allows for up to 2GB capacity, which is supported by many older devices.
SDHC and SDHC devices are backward compatible and SD(HC/XC) cards are forward compatible.

'''[[:wikipedia:CompactFlash|CompactFlash]]''' [[File:CompactFlash_Sandisk_4GB_ExtremeIII.jpg|thumb|4GB CompactFlash card]] (CF) cards are widely available in a wide range of sizes (up to 32GB) and are cheaper per megabyte than other standard media. Most prosumer cameras now use CF. CF cards come in two varieties:
*CF Type I - 3.3 mm thick. Cameras designed for CF Type I can't use CF Type II.
*CF Type II - 5 mm  thick. Cameras which use CF Type II also can use CF Type I.  Some manufacturers are selling [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_Microdrive Microdrives] (mini hard drives) packaged in the CF II format.  If your camera supports the CF Type II format it may also support the Microdrive.

'''[[:wikipedia:Multi_Media_Card|Multi Media Card]]''' (MMC) are similar to SD card from outside, but not compatible with SD cards. 

'''[[:wikipedia:XD-Picture_Card|xD-picture Card]]''' (xD) are developed by Fuji and Olympus. They are very compact in size, but usually about two times more expensive than CF or SD cards.

'''[[:wikipedia:Memory_Stick|Memory Stick]]''' (MS) are used by most Sony cameras, and only by Sony Cameras. Most of MS cards are produced by Sony (the only other manufacturers are SanDisk and Lexar) this factor influence rather high prices of MS cards
Memory Stick Duo (MS Duo) variant which is smaller in size, and can be used with regular MS card cameras via adapter.

When buying a digital camera the safe bet is to choose camera which can use CompactFlash, SDXC or SDHC cards. Some cameras can use two different types of cards (e.g. Olypus E-5 and Canon EOS 1D Mark IV can use CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards).

===Battery Life===

Digital compact cameras with no optical viewfinder need much more power than other cameras, because the LCD display is the largest power consumer.

Nearly all digital cameras come with '''[[:wikipedia:Rechargeable_battery|rechargeable]]''' '''[[:wikipedia:Lithium-ion_battery|Li-ion batteries]]'''. Some DSLR cameras like the Pentax K-x use standard Mignon batteries and the most DSLR cameras can be attached to a '''[[:wikipedia:Battery_grip|battery grip]]''', which can hold multiple batteries.


'''Non-rechargeable batteries''' refer to the common batteries cells, commonly available in a variety of sizes. Non-rechargeable batteries are not recommended, because most batteries (or cells) are designed to discharge gradually over time; digital cameras draw power in bursts, which quickly exhausts ordinary batteries. There are batteries designed specifically for digital camera usage, but these tend to be expensive.

Rechargeable batteries have one additional advantage, and that's universal compatibility. You can go to pretty much any country and recharge them with a universal charger supporting 110-230V.

== Other Accessories ==
===Card Readers===
Most cameras come with a [[wikipedia:USB|USB]] connection which you use to transfer digital images from the camera to your computer.  If you are lucky, both your computer and your camera use the USB 2 specification.  Some older cameras use the slower USB 1 specification, or slower yet, your computer's COM port to transfer images.  A device that can speed things up is a USB card reader, which can be purchased at an electronics store, usually for less than the price of one memory card alone.  Most card readers support more than one card type; just make sure it supports the card type you use.  When you wish to transfer the images from the card to the computer, connect the card reader to your computer, pop the card into the card reader, and copy the images from the card to the computer by using file drag and drop.

Many laptop and netbook computers made by Dell, Acer, Asus, and other manufacturers now have built-in card readers. Some support only SD cards, while others support a wider variety. These small card readers seldom support CompactFlash, due to that card's large size and the fact that CF cards can be read using an inexpensive PC card adapter.

===Lens Filters===
[[File:LensFilter-001.jpg|thumb|Three commons styles of lenses filters]]
Among the first accessories a serious photographer considers is lens [[wikipedia:Filter_%28photography%29|filter]]s.  There are many filters available for DSLR lenses, less so for fixed lens cameras.  Lens filters have a threaded mount that screws onto the front of a lens.  They work by modifying the light before it passes through the lens for a wide range of interesting and useful effects.  

When you buy a lens filter you need to buy the correct size for your lens size.  Look for the a number on the front of your lens, some common lens sizes are 52mm and 55mm.  Many camera shops carry the more common sizes.  If yours does not, you may want to contact the manufacturer of your lens if you have a DSLR, or of your camera if you have a fixed lens camera.

A word of caution applies to using colored lens filters with digital photography.  Colored (e.g. orange, red and blue) filters work by limiting the light of a given color passing through the lens; using a blue filter compensates for a yellowish cast; using an orange filter compensates for a bluish cast.  These are used mainly with film photography for color balance, but since almost all digital cameras have an automatic white balance, the effect of a colored filter will not be the same as with film.  In addition some new prosumer cameras have built in filter effects so using an additional colored filter would never be necessary.

Some common and interesting lens filters are:

'''[[wikipedia:Infrared_filter|Infrared Filter]]''' or IR Filter. This filter reduces visible light and allows IR light to pass through the lens; the filter itself appears black or reddish-black.  Infrared images can appear ghostly or other-worldly simply because Infrared radiates and reflects off objects differently than does visible light.

'''''[[wikipedia:Diffusion_filter|Diffusion Filter]]'''. ''A diffusion filter is a translucent photographic filter used for a special effect. When used in front of the camera lens, a diffusion filter softens subjects and generates a dreamy haze. This can also be improvised by smearing petroleum jelly on a UV filter or shooting through a nylon stocking. Diffusion filters may be uniform or may have a clear center area to create a vignette of diffused area around the clear center subject.

Diffusion filters are also used in stage lighting (and likewise in photography setups), where they may also be called diffusion gel, or just diffusion. This is a reference to color gel, which is another type of lighting gel. Diffusion gels soften the light in order to reduce or diffuse shadows or glare.

Silk sheets can also be used in this manner, and in fact were until the invention of translucent plastics. &quot;Opal&quot; is a common translucent or opalescent diffusion.''''

'''[[wikipedia:Polarizer|Polarizing Filter]]'''.  This filter is made of polarizing glass that rotates freely in a circular ring.  A polarizing filter cuts down on reflected light from some angles while allowing light from other angles to pass through the filter.  The effect of a polarizing filter is to darken either the sky or reflections off leaves or water depending on the position of the filter.  The effect can be quite pronounced and appealing.  For more information on how polarizing filters work, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization Polarization]

'''[[wikipedia:UV filter|UV Filter]]'''.  This filter cuts down on UV rays that can make your photograph appear hazy or excessively bluish on bright days.  UV filters come in a range of strengths.
''TIP:'' To protect the front element of that expensive lens you've purchased, get a mild-strength UV filter and screw it onto the lens.  The cost of the filter is very small in comparison to the cost of the lens and having the filter always in place can protect the front lens element with the added benefit of reducing haze whenever you use the lens.  Note: There is considerable controversy on the actual protection a filter supplies to a lens in the event that it dropped. Shards of glass can be very damaging to the surface of the lens.  Many will argue that a lens hood will provide significantly more protection to the front element of a lens AND help reduce the effects of flare and loss of contrast from strong side lights (to which filters are prone).

===Tripods===
[[File:Mini tripod.jpg|thumb|Mini-tripod]]
Tripods are three legged devices used to support a camera to provide stability and greatly improve the quality of photographs.  A single-legged tool that serves the same function is referred to as a monopod.  Because a tripod can remove almost all camera motion, the quality of a tripod is almost as important as the quality of the lens.  The cost of a tripod can vary by an amazing amount.  Flimsy tripods are less stable, durable, flexible, and may even be heavier than a high-quality tripod.

Tripod substitutes:
*monopod
*beanbag

This section deals with the nuts and bolts of actually taking pictures. This is the part where most of us like to spend time on.

====Camera Basics====

A camera is made of two basic parts - the lens, and the camera body. The lens and camera body work together to form all the functions found on this page. 

===Choosing your Level of Control===

Taking a digital photo can be as easy as turning on the camera, pointing it, and pressing the shutter button. The camera will make all the necessary decisions for you. This of course, assumes that you have your camera controls set to auto or program mode. A point and press camera will not make correct adjustments when scenes are heavily back-lit or in mixed light situations for example.  Advanced cameras allow you to take more control of this process, to allow you to hopefully take better photos. But care must be taken, otherwise you may actually take worse photos. You will need to decide what level of commitment you want to make to taking terrific photos. There is no guilt here, just do what is best for you.

===Controlling Exposure===
[[Image:Shutter speed in Greenwich.jpg|800px|thumb|center|A demonstration of the effect of exposure in night photography. Longer shutter speeds mean increased exposure.]]
Digital cameras capture a limited range of brightness. File formats like jpeg and tiff, and computer monitors and printers have limits also.

When a digital image is significantly underexposed, certain parts of the image will be simple black, other parts will not express colors accurately, and digital noise will be visible.

Overexposure can cause areas to become simple white, without detail. This is known as &quot;blowing out the highlights.&quot;

In automatic mode, most digital cameras try to adjust exposure to make every picture average brightness. This may not be what you want if you are taking a picture of a bride, or a flamingo, or fireworks. You can improve your pictures by controlling exposure.

====Exposure Value of an Image====

There are four factors which affect the brightness of your image:

* [[wikipedia:Exposure_value|Exposure value]] (EV). Brightness of the scene itself.
* [[wikipedia:Aperture|Aperture]]. The size of the entrance pupil of the lens. The larger the aperture, the more light; the smaller the aperture, the less light.
* [[wikipedia:Shutter_speed|Shutter speed]]. The length of time over which an exposure is made. The longer the exposure, the more light that falls on the imaging medium; the shorter the time, the less light.
* [[wikipedia:Film_speed#Digital_camera_ISO_speed_and_exposure_index|ISO speed]]. Increasing the ISO setting on a digital camera increases the sensitivity of the sensor to light.

====Setting Exposure====

''[[wikipedia:Exposure_%28photography%29|Exposure]]'' - controls the amount of light which reaches the image sensor. Exposure is measured in ''[[wikipedia:Exposure_value|ev]]''. The Aperture and Shutter work together to allow the correct amount of light into the camera. If, for reasons to be discussed later, you wish to make the shutter speed faster (letting in less light); you must compensate by having the aperture open wider (letting in more light). This relationship is known as reciprocity (as it is a reciprocal relationship). As stated in the introduction, you can feel free to play with your camera and get a feel for how this principle can be used without worrying about wasting valuable film. 

*''[[wikipedia:Aperture|Aperture]]'' - defines the size of the opening in the lens. Aperture is measured in ''[[wikipedia:F-number|f-numbers]]'' and often referred to as &quot;f-stops.&quot; Discussion of f-stops is counterintuitive in that the larger the f-stop - the smaller the opening of the lens. The correct unit usage of f-stops appear like: f/2, f/4, f/5.8, etc... However, most cameras find it more economical to truncate the display to show: 2, 4, 5.8, etc... Forgetting that the larger the f-stop - the smaller the hole is a common pitfall of early camera students. 

*''[[wikipedia:Shutter_speed|Shutter speed]]'' - defines the exposure time i.e. the time for which the shutter is held open during the taking of a photograph to allow light to reach the sensor.  Shutter speed is measured in seconds or fractions of a second (e.g. 1s, 1/30s, 1/60s, etc.). 

====Sensitivity of the sensor - setting ISO speed====
[[File:ISO comparison.jpg|thumb|250px|ISO 100 on top compared to ISO 1600 on the bottom.  Taken with a Canon EOS 400D.  Different cameras will have different, but similar results.]]
In film photography, ISO measures the sensitivity of the film used. The more sensitive the film, the less light required to make an appropriate exposure. Consequently, the more sensitive the film, there is a noticeable increase in grain. In digital photography, the metaphor is maintained. The more sensitive you tell your sensor to be, the less light you need to create an exposure; but, it will also be more sensitive to noise. The difference is slight and only a matter of terminology (grain versus noise) but the idea as a whole is transferable. 

There is always a correlation between ISO and noise; however, the amount of noise present at a particular ISO setting is dependent on the specifications of the image sensor - and thus, every camera is different. ''Generally speaking'', professional level cameras have less noise for each of the ISO settings compared to the same settings on consumer level cameras. 

Prosumer SLR cameras tends to perform very well up to ISO800, and even at ISO1600, the noise is noticeable but tolerable. As can be expected, ISO1600 offers a tremendous advantage to photographers in low light/ night environment.

====What is light metering ?====

It should be stated that &quot;metering&quot; is photographer talk for &quot;measuring.&quot; Metering, in photography, can either refer to measuring the light or measuring the actual distance from the camera to the subject. 

There are normally three types of light-metering: evaluative, center weighted average and spot. Your camera uses these to decide on what exposure it should aim for.

Evaluative means your camera will try and choose an exposure which will work well for the entire image. However the implementation of this feature can vary vastly from camera to camera meaning that different cameras will make different decisions in the same lighting conditions. Evaluative metering usually is preferable when you use automatic or semiautomatic (Av aka Aperture Priority, and Tv aka Shutter priority) exposure setting.

Spot is the exact opposite of the Evaluative setting, rather than taking into account the whole of the image it tries to choose an exposure that is appropriate for whatever appears in the center of the image ignoring the rest of the image. This metering method is useful if you set the camera to manual exposure mode. A typical camera has dynamic range of about 6 ev steps. Areas for which camera show +3 ev in picture will be absolutely white, and areas with -3 ev will be absolutely black. The easiest way to set correct exposure will be to meter highlights (brightest white spots) in your composition and set exposure so that highlights read at +2.7 or +3 ev. 

Center weighted falls between these two settings, the camera chooses an exposure which will work well for the entire image, but places more importance on getting the exposure right for the center section.

====Exposure modes of digital camera====

Usually a digital camera has three types of exposure modes:
* Automatic modes (A, Autopicture, different picture modes (portrait, landscape etc.), P (Program)), in which the camera sets your aperture and shutter speed. 
* Semi-automatic or priority modes:
** Shutter priority (Tv) - you set the shutter speed and the camera sets the correct aperture.
** Aperture priority (Av) -  you set the aperture and the camera sets the shutter speed.
* Manual mode (M and B) - you set the aperture and shutter speed.

===How to achieve sharp digital photographs===

The reasons for the lack of sharpness in your digital photos can be attributed to one or more of the following reasons:

* Camera movement.
* Lack of proper focus.
* Using a &quot;soft&quot; camera setting.

'''Camera movement''' (or camera shake) usually comes from hand-holding your camera while using a slow shutter speed.  To minimize camera movement while using slow shutter speeds of 1/25th of a second or lower you should use a tripod.  If you don't have a tripod with you, try placing the camera on a flat surface and using the camera's self timer (obviously, this works best when there is not much movement in the scene).  Sometimes, if the lighting conditions are marginal where your shutter speed is right at 1/25th of a second, if you have a very steady hand, you can try holding your breath briefly as you snap the shutter.  You can also try manually increasing the shutter speed at the expense of using a wider aperture (lower f-stop).  Generally, a higher shutter speed decreases the effect of camera movement, but the lower f-stop decreases the depth of field and requires more careful focusing.

'''Lack of proper focus''' is another cause for lack of sharp photographs.  Fortunately, most digital cameras today come with autofocus capabilities.  In a few fixed lens cameras and in almost any digital SLR, the autofocus can be disabled allowing you to focus the lens manually.  Greater care must be exercised to make sure the object that you wish to be the center of attention in the photo is sharply focused.  

In more inexpensive cameras, the only focus adjustment may be a normal and macro mode.  The normal mode is usually represented by a mountain icon and the macro mode is usually represented by a flower icon.  If your camera only supports these two modes, make sure it is in the proper mode before you snap the shutter to achieve the sharpest photos. 

Camera with normal and macro focusing modes

'''Poor lighting conditions''' may cause your photos to lack definition and contrast.  You may notice that even when you use a tripod and with your camera handling the autofocus, your photographs may not appear as sharp as you might wish.  This is especially true for available light photographs where you do not wish to use a flash.  The fault for this lies not with your camera but with the scene itself.  In cases like this, try increasing the available light shining directly on the subject.  This can improve the photograph by allowing the edges to be more sharply defined against the background.

'''In camera sharpening''' can also affect the sharpness of an image.  Some higher end cameras offer a sharpness adjustment that usually ranges from +2 or +3 to -2 or -3 with zero in the center.  Increasing the sharpness can give you crisper looking images, and decreasing it will give a more &quot;soft focus&quot; effect.  Some photographers like to use a soft-focus effect when taking portraits, especially of women, because it tends to smooth out the appearance of the skin.  Increasing the sharpness will not compensate for camera shake or lack of proper focus.  Many photographers choose to leave the sharpness setting at zero and perform any sharpening in the post-processing stage.

===What's the slowest exposure time you can get away with ?===

&quot;Camera shake&quot; is what happens when you don't hold the camera sufficiently still. The longer the exposure time, the longer you have to hold the camera perfectly still, and the more chance there is for shake.

How long an exposure time you can use before being affected by camera shake depends very much on the individual.  With a lot of practice it's possible to hold the camera still for as much as half a second, but most people should be able to hold a camera still for 1/20 of a second with a little practice. Beginners should be able to hold for 1/25 of a seconds without problem.  

As a general rule of thumb, it is recommended to not use a shutter speed lower than the inverse of the focal length of the lens used.  For example, if you use a 50mm lens, try not to use a shutter speed slower than 1/50.

Another way to find out what shutter speed to use is by testing. 

# Pick something which will stay motionless and has straight lines which can easily be used to detect blurring. A good option would be a piece of paper which has large lettering printed on it, or use a suitable book cover.
# Be somewhere that has a reasonable amount of light (not necessary - but then all of your photos won't have the same brightness). If light is sufficient, feel free to turn off the flash to allow you to take photos faster.
# Switch your camera to exposure-time/shutterspeed priority mode.
# Set the camera to a reasonably long exposure time (say 1 second).
# Take a photo of your target in the way you normally take photos. Don't go out of your way to try to be more stable unless you are willing to do that every time you take a photo.
# Reduce the exposure time by one or two steps (how long this is in seconds will depend on your camera).
# Repeat the last two steps until you get down to about 1/30th of a second.

Now load the photos onto your computer, the one taken at 1 second will be blurred unless you are some sort of statue, but as the exposure time decreases the amount of blurring decreases.  Go through the photos in order until you find where the blurring is no longer noticeable. That photo will represent the maximum exposure time you can take photos without &quot;camera shake&quot;. Don't worry if you didn't note down the exposure times while taking the photos because most modern digital camera will store the information alongside the photo using what is known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF EXIF]. Most photo-manipulation packages can read this EXIF information as can many stand-alone EXIF-readers.

(If you use Windows XP you can get the EXIF information by right clicking on the photo and choosing properties, then the summary tab and clicking on advanced.)


The EXIF-data will include a lot of information, but the field you'll want to find is &quot;exposure time&quot; which, logically, will tell you the exposure time used when that photograph was taken.

Now you know what exposure-time you can get away with.  Many photographers have their own techniques for stabilizing the camera  so that they can use longer exposure times. These normally involve levering body parts against each other for greater stability. One common technique is to hold the camera directly against the brow or nose. Another is to try to lean against the nearest stable object like a tree, wall, etc., and then hugging your elbows into your chest. How well these work for you will very much depend on you, and of course, practicing.

Now that you know how long an exposure time you can get away with using your normal technique, you can start experimenting with other ways to hold your camera that will allow for longer exposure times without causing camera shake.

When taking shots with exposure times longer than you normally use, it's a good idea to take several shots if you have the spare memory. The more shots you take the better the chances that you manage to hold sufficiently still for one of them to come out well.


As a general rule of thumb, the ''longest'' exposure time that tends not to be affected by camera shake is about 1/60th of a second or 1/125th of a second. At those values, the camera shutter is operating fast enough that the image captured is typically not affected by camera shake. 

However, such values are typically achieved only at locations with good lighting, say, a typical afternoon outside. It is tricky to achieve this lighting indoors and photography at those shutter speeds without compromising on ISO (see below) or aperture is difficult at times

In addition to this, high end digital cameras are starting to appear with image stabilization or vibration reduction technologies. These ''can'' help to increase the longest exposure time to about 1/30th of a second or even 1/15th of a second when used right, and it is a huge advantage in indoors/ low light environment. Unfortunately, the technology is expensive at the moment, but it would eventually trickle into the more consumer-friendly models.

===The non-human approach to reducing camera shake===

Use a tripod or monopod. Failing the availability of either, find a flat, stable surface you can set your camera on. You may find that a small bean or wheat bag helps when placing your camera onto an uneven surface. If your camera allows you to set it off remotely or to use a timer, these also help reduce camera shake to an absolute minimum. 

Another technique that can be used for stabilizing your camera is, if you have a camera strap, turn your self into a bipod. This is done by steadying your legs and then pulling the camera away from yourself.

Some cameras have a function that attempts to compensate for camera shake by moving the sensor or parts of the lens.

===When is long exposure time useful ?===

Sometimes a long exposure time is the best way to increase the brightness of a shot in the low light situations. However longer exposure time can also increase &quot;noise&quot; in images. Many cameras have an automatic noise reduction system which kicks in at about 1.25-1.5 seconds. This means that the camera has to do more post-processing after the shot is taken so it may take slightly longer before the camera is ready to take another shot.

There are also times when you want to deliberately cause light streaks. Moving objects such as stars (for the ultra-long exposures) and cars (at night, when the headlamps are on) can create quite beautiful photographs when you utilize long exposure deliberately.

There can be cases when one wants to capture a portrait at night with usual exposure and flash no details in background can be captured. Here a longer exposure is taken with flash, flash can freeze and provide detail of person's face while longer exposure time will generate details of small lights in the background.

===Why do images become darker with short exposure times  ?===

Let's say you want to shoot a little leaguer running to first base, and not have it blurred.  If your camera is in a semi-automatic mode (for example shutter-speed priority), you can adjust the shutter-speed to be faster (i.e. shorter exposure time).  The camera then tries to modify the other settings (flash and aperture size) to make the image have an appropriate brightness.  

But there are limits to how far the camera can go. The amount the aperture can be opened is physically limited.  Once the aperture has been opened to its widest and the camera is out of other options, the brightness can't be increased further. This means that when you decrease the exposure time beyond that point the image will get darker, or &quot;underexposed&quot;.

Luckily your camera will be able to tell you when it reaches this point. How it does this varies from camera to camera but the most common way is to make the aperture size change to red on the display (you may have to have the LCD display turned on to see this).  On many cameras this information is only updated when the shutter button is pressed half way. Further details on this should be available from your camera manual.

===At larger apertures, why do images become brighter ?===

Just as in the case above, where short exposure time images can become darker, or underexposed, when you exceed the camera's ability to &quot;open up&quot; the aperture, the camera is limited by how much the aperture can be closed down. So, in very bright conditions, if the camera cannot close down further, images will be brighter, or &quot;overexposed&quot;. Again, most cameras have a way of warning you when this point is reached, and unless in manual mode, will not allow you to shoot.

===Why should I take control of exposure time ?===
[[Image:Shutter_speed_waterfall.gif|frame|Shutter speed can have a dramatic impact on the appearance of moving objects. Changes in background blurring are apparent from the need to adjust the aperture size to achieve proper exposure.]]
Hopefully  by now you understand the basics of exposure time and how it affects your shots. If you have shots that you've taken before that have turned out blurred now is a good time to go and have a look at their EXIF information and pay attention to the environment the photos were taken in. Almost certainly, your blurred photos will have been taken in low light situations and the EXIF information will reveal that the exposure time was fairly long (longer than your &quot;stability limit&quot;). 

You should now be able to make educated guesses as to what your camera's automatic system was doing that resulted in blurred images. The camera detected low light so it probably tried to compensate by turning the flash on and opening the aperture as far as it could.  However, even after doing this, the camera thought the photo would be too dark, so it increased the exposure time. Here it made the fatal mistake! Since the camera doesn't know how stable you can hold the camera or if it is on a tripod, it assumes that you can hold perfectly still for as long as you want.

Since you know that's not true, this is a perfect example of a situation where you should step in and take control. In most situations you don't want a blurred photo, (though you do have to consider what you want). If, for example, you would prefer a darker photo but without blur or camera shake, then all you have to do is switch to shutter-speed priority mode, set the exposure time to a setting which you are comfortable with, and let the camera handle the rest of the settings. 

What if you want the image brighter? Well, the simple answer is to increase the lighting.  If you're indoors, then turn the lights on if they aren't on already or set up what you want to shoot near window light. If that's not an option, you can start playing with other settings such as the ISO. Increasing the ISO can increase the brightness of the shot by increasing the camera's sensitivity to light, but at the expense of causing more noise to appear in the image (more on ISO later). 

All of these choices involve compromise, and your camera can't choose which compromise to make for you as it doesn't know why you want the photo and what's important about it. Only you can make that decision, and that's why you have to take control.

===Why change the aperture ?===
[[File:Page 01.jpg|250px|thumb|An example showing how a narrow depth of field can impact a photo.]]
In general, cameras are fairly good at automatically changing the aperture to deal with the light situation.

However, as mentioned earlier, if you want to increase Depth of Field (the range around your subject that remains in focus) or improve the focus on distance shots, you might want to step in and make the aperture smaller.

Without getting into a lot of theory and mathematics, aperture widths are measured in what are called &quot;F-Stops&quot; written like this: f/1.0, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6 f/8.0, f/11, f/16 etc. As these numbers get larger, the aperture gets smaller. So from these numbers f/1.0 means the aperture is the widest (wide open in fact), while f/16.0 is the smallest.  When you increase the size of the aperture by setting it to a lower numbered f-stop, it is called '''opening up'''.  When you decrease the size of the aperture by setting it to a higher numbered f-stop, it is called '''stopping down'''.

Put your camera into manual aperture priority and move the dial back and forth to adjust it.  You will see the numbers in the view finder change as you open and close, and can see the range of options your specific camera has.  Each of these numbers represents one &quot;stop&quot; more or less of light reaching the camera.  Another, more indirect way of changing the aperture, is to switch to time mode and do the same drill, observing that the time notation changes for the amount of the light reaching the camera.  The numbers show what part of a second the aperture is open.  For example, t/90 means 1/90th of a second.  You will see the numbers change something like this: t/90, t/125, t/180, t/250, t/350, t/500.  Again, as the numbers change, so does the amount of light-- there's one &quot;stop&quot; less light with each shorter exposure.

If you use aperture-priority mode on your camera, beware of the same problems that you can get in fully automatic mode. Your camera may increase the exposure time significantly to compensate for less light through the aperture, so make sure the exposure time isn't too long when taking the shot.

If it is too long, then you have to use a tripod or other method to stabilize your camera, and switch to manual mode.   This will mean that you have to set both the aperture and exposure time by hand. But that's not too hard, now that you see that the numbers simply represent step changes in the amount of light reaching the camera. 

Remember, as shown above, each step increment change of either the f/stop or time exposure represents one &quot;stop&quot; of light.  As long as the change is proportional between these measurements, the amount of light is the same.  I.e.  If you open the lens up more, shorten the time the same number of steps to still get the same amount of light... if you close the lens more, increase the time the same number of steps to still get the same amount of light. 

So, here's how you can set manually without fancy light meters.  Simply find out what the camera's light meter is recommending in the automatic mode.  For example, it may think you need t/250 with f/8.  But you want to get a greater depth of field, say f/16.  That is two steps smaller aperture than f/8, hence, two stops less light.  So in manual mode, set f/16 (which is two clicks less light than recommended to get the right amount of light) and then INCREASE the amount of light two stops above what the automatic setting recommended, in this case, moving two clicks from t/250 to t/125. Actually, you can simply think of it as turning two &quot;clicks&quot; up or down for each setting and don't worry about the numbers.  

Again, a simple solution for manual mode is to take the automatic mode setting, then switch to manual and &quot;click&quot; the same number of steps up or down to get your new aperture and speed settings.

Most camera lenses do not produce images of the best resolution with the aperture wide-open (e.g. f/1.4 on a 50 f/1.4 lens). Stopping down (increasing the f-stop setting) can improve their resolution, often drastically. This can be referred to MTF charts.  Using f/8 or f/11 on most lenses produces an image with fine detail. Beyond this would actually degrade images due to diffraction, so don't overly stop-down unless you need greater depth of field.


The major trade off a photographer will encounter when fiddling with the aperture is this: low aperture allows more light in, but at the cost of Depth of Field; high aperture allows less light in, but have more Depth of Field.

Normally, you would want to shoot with aperture as low as possible, as not having enough light is typically more common than having too much light. Under some circumstances though, a low aperture gives more headaches than the increased light. One very obvious case is when you are taking photographs in macro mode. 

In macrophotography, you are pushing the camera to capture details on a small object, typically close to the lens. In these cases, when the object is close to the lens, ''Depth of Field is critical''. Having insufficient Depth of Field means only part of the object is in focussed. This is good if it's your artistic intention, but that's rarely the intention.

In these cases, you have to stop down to higher aperture numbers, and balance the trade offs elsewhere. Normally these come out from shutter speed (longer shutter speed) or ISO (higher ISO settings), which is why macrophotography tends to occur in controlled environment.

Thus, as a general rule of thumb, an aperture of around f/4 is probably adequate for normal photography; anything lower and you begin to get noticeable loss of Depth-of-Field. At f/2.8, the Depth-of-Field is visibly constrained to fairly narrow bands.

For macrophotography, apertures around f/8 or f/10 or even higher are common. such high aperture values would mean a corresponding increase in shutter speeds.

There is another aspect of apertures that may not be obvious to casual users. Higher apertures gives you more ''Depth-of-Field'', which means more things are in focus -- ''which means you have more room for errors in terms of focussing''.

This is most obvious when you have a low-aperture lens, shooting a distance (really distant! Say, 150~200+ metres away) object, in poor light and/ or on a moving platform.

(Aside: One has to wonder why a photographer is in these conditions, but we digress... )

Even with autofocussing technologies in today's camera, getting a sharp picture in those circumstances is difficult. Autofocussing relies largely on contrast and not so much on image context, so it is easy for the autofocus to focus on the wrong portion of the subject.

If your aperture is set high enough, this isn't an issue; ''depth-of-field'' will ensure your subject is in focus. However, if you are shooting at low apertures -- say, f/2.8 --
the low ''depth-of-field'' will mean you need to be very precise in your focussing to ensure the subject is in focus. Make a mistake (easy enough when your lens is hand-held and shooting at 150+ metres), and your subject slips out of the ''depth-of-field'' and you end up with a blurred shot.

As such, using a high aperture gives you more margin of error when it comes to focussing on a subject. As usual, you have to adjust for the (generally) lower amounts of light a higher aperture implies, and it becomes a balancing act.

===Changing what automatic/semi-automatic mode aims for===

When you use automatic, shutter-priority, or aperture-priority modes the camera has a fixed idea about what exposure (brightness) it should aim for. What if you want to change this without having to use manual mode ?

Luckily most cameras come with a feature known as &quot;exposure compensation&quot; which allows you to underexpose or overexpose shots easily. However how much you should change the exposure depends on the situation and on your camera, so the best way you can learn is by experimentation.

Many digital cameras tend to overexpose and it's common for photographers to use an exposure compensation of -1/3 to -2/3 as default.

Many photographers use &quot;bracketing&quot;, this is the name given to when you take several photos with a range of exposures to ensure one photo comes out with the correct exposure. Automatic mode normally gets fairly close to a good exposure so taking photos at one level above and below its defaults will probably get you a good shot.

===Speeding up recovery time ?===

recovery time (also called latency) is the time taken between shots (i.e. after you take a photo how long do you have to wait before you take another)

You can speed up the recovery by turning some or all of the following things off,

* compression
* image sharpening
* flash
* getting a better memory card

Latency time is one of the downfalls of point and shoot type digital cameras, but as time goes by and technology improves the latency time has been reduced dramatically. More advanced digital SLR cameras are as fast as their film counterparts ever were with some professional SLRs offering up to eight frames per second with a buffer of forty frames.

===Image sharpening===

The general opinion is that image sharpening should be left to the post-processing stage. Some cameras offer in-built sharpening, however these are normally less sophisticated than those available on most photo-manipulation packages. There is no technical advantage in using in-built sharpening over using a computer based sharpening tool. Actually image sharpening must be the last step in image manipulation, so if you will need some post processing the in camera sharpening will only decrease the quality of the final image.

The canon user manual will suggest which settings to use with their higher end digital SLRs.

===Photo effects/Color modes===
[[File:Photograph.sept1895.jpg|thumb|Sepia was a technique used to preserve photos and is now a sought-after style for some situations.]]
These let you take shots in Black and White, Sepia, vivid mode, etc. The basic rule is don't use them, shoot in colour and apply these effects in post-processing if you want them. Like with sharpening, your computer is able to take advantage of more sophisticated algorithms resulting in a better end-result.

===White balance===

White balance often confuses beginners; after all, white is white, isn't it?

Actually, it isn't. Your camera sees what colour an object is; unfortunately this won't be the same colour as humans see. This is because the human brain makes people see non-white colours as white.

The colour of an object is dependant on the light source, however humans automatically adjust so that anything which roughly combines the primary light colours together appears white.

&quot;White-balance&quot; is the name given to the technique cameras use to try and depict the image as humans see it. Most cameras will have at least three options (daylight, fluorescent, and tungsten) and may have many more which are designed to adjust to the light source.

Some cameras will also have a custom option, the custom option will allows you to setup a &quot;White-balance&quot; for a specific lighting situation. The way it works is that you have to show it something which is white (or more often a grey card) and using that it makes corrections to the photos taken.

Luckily automatic white-balance detection is fairly sophisticated so most of the time leaving white-balance on auto mode will get you the result you want.

===Depth of Field and achieving blurring effects===
[[File:DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of a very shallow depth of field.]]
The [[wikipedia:Depth_of_field|depth of field]] (DOF) is the distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus. Areas which are out of DOF look blurred. Sometimes it's very useful to have shallow DOF to separate the subject from the background (and/or foreground). Photographers try to get the subject in focus and the background slightly blurred. 

DOF for given camera depends on three factors:
* Distance to subject. Getting closer to subject will make DOF shallower;
* Lens focal length. The longer focal length will make DOF shallower;
* Aperture. The larger aperture will make DOF shallower;

Despite there are three factors which affect DOF, only aperture can help you control it. If you choose a longer lens to get the full subject in frame you need to increase the distance to your subject and these two factors will compensate effects of each other. 

So to have shallow DOF you need:
* fill as much of the frame as possible with your subject (it is usually easier with a long lens)
* set big aperture (f4.0, f2.8 or even f1.4 if you have such lens)

Worth noting that cameras with bigger sensors will have shallower DOF for the same f-number, because of the same focal length of the lens you will need to get nearer to your subject to fill the frame. So with a digital SLR getting shallow DOF is much easier than with a compact Point &amp; shoot camera.

It is also possible, relatively easily, to introduce blurring at the post-processing stage although the effect may not be as good compared to that done in-camera.

===Taking infra-red photos===
[[File:Infrared 09073-kalamis.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of a photo taken by a converted Sony DSC-F828.]]
Some digital cameras have sensors which are capable of detecting infrared, if your camera is capable of doing so then you should be able to obtain a infrared filter relatively cheaply (about £10 GBP/ $15 USD) which allows you to take infrared photos.

The simplest way you can tell if your camera is infrared-sensitive is to point an infrared source into your lens and see if it is visible on your LCD screen. Almost any infrared source can be used including remote controls (point the emitter at your lens and hold down a button on your remote).


A more technical explanation follows:

All digital camera sensors are capable of detecting infrared; this is actually a problem with early digital cameras, because they pick up infrared and as such alters the captured image.

To deal with this issue, camera manufacturers build something called a ''hot mirror'' into digital cameras. Effectively this is an IR filter, designed to filter out IR so that the final images are not affected by the extra 'light' coming in.

''Hot mirrors'' aren't 100% effective, thus some cameras are more sensitive to IR than others. Of course, if you are daring enough, you can open up your digital camera and replace the ''hot mirror'' with a glass of matching optical index, '''but this is not recommended and not advised'''. Doing that will almost certainly void your warranty, and sometimes break the camera.

IR filters are filters which filter ''out'' non-IR light; the filter itself appears black or reddish-black. When you hold it up to a light source, you may see a dim image of the light source showing through, but pretty much nothing else will show up.

But attach the filter to a IR-sensitive camera, and when you take photographs, you will see some images captured. How does this work?

Essentially, it's the same idea how photographs are taken. IR light are reflected off objects the same way 'normal' light is, and the IR filter will remove the 'normal' light, leaving the camera to interpret only the IR light. This results in an image that can be eerie in the extreme: Trees are white (IR reflects off leaves strongly), dark clothing becomes white and vice versa, things simply aren't what you expect.

IR photography does have some issues to take note of. First, IR light tends to be lower in intensity, so you need to compensate with lower aperture, longer shutter speed, and/or higher ISO. Also, IR focuses slightly differently from normal, which is why some SLR lens have IR markings for them. So you may end up with slightly out-of-focused images.

The last issue is not technical, but moral. IR can and does reflect straight through clothing, especially thin clothing. This can lead to some morally questionable photography, although it's really really much harder to achieve than people are led to believe. The ability does exist though and it has to be left to the individual photographer's morals to determine what to take in IR.

===Example shots===

* An action shot 
:: Obviously we want a short exposure time here, to compensate we would open up the aperture. We might also use the flash, but remember using the flash will mean you have to wait for the flash to warm up/fire.

* A landscape shot
:: This time we'd want a narrow aperture as we want to photograph a large area with a deep depth of field. If we want to increase the brightness of our shot then we'll need to increase the exposure time (as the flash probably won't be powerful enough to light up our scene). In a landscape shot the most likely source of motion is the photographer, so it's best to take these shots using a tripod to avoid motion.

* A framed painting
:: If there is glass in front of the painting you will almost certainly want to turn the flash off otherwise you'll get effects like this:
::[[image: frameref.jpg]]
::Which obviously you want to avoid. Using a wide-aperture is an obvious move, if you have a tripod or otherwise stable place where you can place the camera a long-exposure time will also help. If you still don't have enough light then you might consider increasing the ISO but going over ISO 400 is likely to cause a noticeable noise effect on the final image. 

::Another solution would be to take the photo at an angle to reduce the reflection of the flash, however &quot;straightening&quot; the photo in post-processing may take more effort than it is worth.

*Glass enclosed exhibits
:: Most of what we've said about framed paintings also applies here, however you're more likely to be able to get away with taking photos at angles. Consider the following two images which are both taken with flash,
[[Image: dodoflash.jpg]]
[[Image: dodoflash2.jpg]]
:: In the second the reflection from the glass is almost unnoticeable, while in the first it destroys the balance of the image. However all is not lost in the first image either as the majority of the flash reflection happens away from our main target we should be able to remove most of the flash reflections in post-processing:
[[Image: dodoflash3.jpg]]
:Another problem with this sort of image is that the glass can often reflect other items in the room including the photographer. One way to avoid this is to take the photo while holding the camera very close to the glass. A secondary advantage of this approach is that you can make it appear that there is no glass between yourself and the exhibit for example in the following photo,

[[Image:Siberischer tiger de.jpg|400px]]

Another way to dramatically reduce reflections is with the use of a polarizer.

*Portraits
:: Use a shallow depth of field and try to avoid using an on-camera flash. If you can't increase the surrounding lighting use an external (preferably bounce flash) flash instead. Using the on-camera flash will create harsh shadowing and is responsible for red-eye.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

'''Easy Wedding Soup''' is a simple variation on Italian Wedding Soup that requires only four ingredients and water.

==Ingredients==

* 6 cups [[Cookbook:Broth|chicken broth]] (from [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cubes]] is fine)
* 2 cups [[cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 10 oz packet frozen [[cookbook:spinach|spinach]]
* 12 oz spicy [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] (pre-cooked)
* 3 tbsp acini di pepe (''pastina'', little bead-like [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]])

==Procedure==
# Bring broth and water to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] in 4 quart [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]].
# Add frozen spinach.
# Cut sausage into small pieces.
# Add sausage and acini di pepe
# Bring back to boil and allow to boil for 10 minutes.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
* Calorie content may vary depending on the specific ingredients you use; 80 kcal is reasonable.
* The spicy sausage will impart more subtle flavor to the soup, making further spicing unnecessary.  Using different types of sausage will vastly change the character of the soup.
* This recipe may require salt if you use home made chicken stock.  Bouillon cubes tend to be heavily salted already.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Frankie Roberto. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Frankie Roberto~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of using certain theoretical approaches to instructional design?

'''Behaviorism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness -the learner may find themselves in a situation where the stimulus for the correct response does not occur, therefore the learner cannot respond. - A worker who has been conditioned to respond to a certain cue at work stops production when an anomaly occurs because they do not understand the system.

Strength - the learner is focused on a clear goal and can respond automatically to the cues of that goal. - W.W.II pilots were conditioned to react to silhouettes of enemy planes, a response which one would hope became automatic.

'''Cognitivism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness - the learner learns a way to accomplish a task, but it may not be the best way, or suited to the learner or the situation. For example, logging onto the internet on one computer may not be the same as logging in on another computer.

Strength - the goal is to train learners to do a task the same way to enable consistency. - Logging onto and off of a workplace computer is the same for all employees; it may be important do an exact routine to avoid problems.

'''Constructivism'''&lt;br&gt;

Weakness - in a situation where conformity is essential divergent thinking and action may cause problems. Imagine the fun Revenue Canada would have if every person decided to report their taxes in their own way - although, there probably are some very &quot;constructive&quot; approaches used within the system we have.

Strength - because the learner is able to interpret multiple realities, the learner is better able to deal with real life situations. If a learner can problem solve, they may better apply their existing knowledge to a novel situation.

== Four Teleological Orders ==

According to Quentin Smith (1981), the four teleological orders are the relations of one aim to another as (1) a “means to” it, (2) a “part of” it, (3) a “concretion” of it, and (4) as “subsumed” under it. These teleological orders interconnect three different types of aims: (1) ends, (2) goals and (3) purposes.
Smith uses the term “ends” to refer to those aims that are directly pursued in voluntary actions. Ends are terms of one or both of the teleological relationships that we are designating as the “means to” relationship and the “part of” relationship. The ends that are terms of these relationships are either physical ends, mental ends, or interpersonal ends. 
1. Physical ends are either to alter the physical structure of my surroundings (such as to saw a branch in half), or to alter and move my body for its own sake (as is the case when I engage in exercise). 
2. Mental ends are not to change the physical environment or my body, but to “bring to my mind” ideas, images or memories. Examples of mental ends are “to solve a mathematical problem,” “to recall a person’s name,” “to read a poem,” and “to conceptualize in an accurate manner a vague insight.” 
3. Interpersonal ends are to influence or affect the consciousness of another person. 
Goals are formally defined as aims that are constituted by two or more ends. The smallest scale goals are constituted by the fewest ends, and the largest scale goals are constituted by thousands of ends. Goals differ in essence from ends in that they are mediate aims of voluntary actions, whereas ends are immediate aims of these actions. An end is immediately and directly attained by an action: it is the volitional activity and striving that either are the end itself, or that bring about the end as their direct result. A voluntary action, however, cannot immediately attain a goal. A goal must be attained by a series of voluntary actions, such that they become attained only through the attainment of a series of complete actional ends. In this sense the attainment of the goal is mediate: it is mediated by the attainment of a series of actional ends.
The explanation of this definition of goals involves a distinction of goals from complete actional ends. Complete actional ends differ from goals in two respects. Complete actional ends are such that: (1) they are continually posited from the moment they are willed by a volition until the moment they have been completely attained by the subsequent voluntary action. This entails that these ends (2) are pursued in a continuous and uninterrupted action and striving, such that I act and strive without intermission from the moment I will the end to be attained until the moment I attain it. 

== Goals ==

Goals, on the other hand: 
(1) are not continually posited from the moment they are willed until the moment they are attained. Rather they are posited as my aims at different times. The pursuit of a goal is interspersed with modes of behavior that do not aim at attaining the goal; these modes of behavior may be actions that aim to attain other goals, or they may be non-actional modes of behavior, such as passions, moods, periods of day-dreaming, sleeping, etc. 
(2) Corresponding to this discontinuous positing of the goal, the voluntary activities and strivings that aim to realize the goal are engaged in at different times.
This definition of goals indicates that they differ from ends in the manner in which they are posited and pursued. They do not necessarily differ in their contents (although they usually do). This occasional similarity between their contents is apparent in the smallest scale goals and the complete actional ends. At one time I may pursue and attain one aim in a single voluntary action, and at another time I may pursue and attain a similar aim in two or three different actions. In the first case, since the aim is attained in a single action, it is nothing more than the complete end of this action. In the second case, it is the mediate aim of several actions: it is the goal to which the several actional ends are ordered. 
This distinction between ends and goals enables us to note a fundamental difference in kind among the various aims of actions. This difference is usually overlooked. For example, Sartre does not distinguish between the different kinds of aims we empirically desire. For Sartre (L’Etre et le Neaot; Paris: Librairie Gallimard, 1943), “drinking a glass of water” and “conquering Gaul” are undifferentiated instances of the aims we can empirically desire. However we believe there is a fundamental difference in kind between these two aims. The aim of “drinking a glass of water” is achieved in a single and continuous action, whereas the aim of “conquering Gaul” is achieved by a vast number of such actions. The former aim is an end, the immediate aim of one action, whereas the latter aim is a goal, the mediate aim of a number of actions.
The relation of goals to purposes is different in kind than the relation of ends to goals. Goals are neither “means to” nor “parts of” purposes, but “concretions” of purposes. Goals “make concrete” the “abstractions” that are purposes. Specifically, goals are the concrete determinations of undetermined instances of universals. It is the nature of purposes to be undetermined instances of universals, and it is the nature of goals to be the particular determinations of these instances. Whereas ends and goals constitute the unique individuality of our actions, purposes are the unconditioned meanings of our actions. They are the ultimate “reason” or “what for” of our actions. If it is asked why or “what for” a person is engaging in an action, the final reason he can give is that he is doing it in order to realize a purpose. While goals are the meaning of ends, in that ends are pursued for the reason that they realize goals, purposes are the meaning of goals, for purposes are the “reason why” we pursue goals.

If we consider this order and distinction between these terms and their relationships, then the order of things may be presented in the way similar to graph above.  Once the purpose of the action is formulated in the mind of a person, he/she pursues the goal(s) required to be accomplished, in order to achieve definite (and desired) end(s), with ultimate result of fulfilling this purpose. 
Ends, goals and purposes, as they are interrelated by the four teleological orders, constitute a teleological structure of voluntary actions. According to this interpretation of goal structure, the goal is mediate aim of a number of actions. Hence, it consists of the series of actions intended to achieve proximal and distal effects. If we use Smith’s example, adapted from Sartre, aim of “conquering Gaul” requires series of actions. In order to achieve this military aim, Julius Caesar might have devised this series of actions: 
•	Divide the territory into areas of responsibility between legions, in order to prevent communication of Gaul tribes. 
•	Ascertain key terrain features that need to be controlled by legions, to establish camps and uninterrupted lines of communication and supplies for the troops, etc. 
These hypothetical actions of Caesar would represent the series of activities designed to achieve proximal effects. Distal effect of this series of actions would still be, of course, “conquering Gaul.” 
The structure above has five levels, each level being an interrelationship between some of these aims. The relationship between ends and other ends constitute the level that lies at the basis of this structure: the “part of” and “means to” order between ends is the irreducible foundation of voluntary and aim—directed action. Founded upon this basic level of the interconnection of ends, there is a second level consisting of the “part of” and “means to” relations between ends and goals. And upon this level there is based a third level: the “part of” and “means to” relations that connect goals to other goals. These relations serve as the foundation for a fourth level of this teleological structure: the “concretion” order that links goals to purposes. Upon this level there is built the uppermost level, which is the “subsumption” order that connects purposes to other purposes. The final purpose in this “subsumption” order is the empty purpose of “attaining some purpose.” This is the most general aim of voluntary action, and with it the teleological relationships terminate. Any phenomenon that is to become an aim of human action can only do so through being integrated in an immanent fashion within this interconnected teleological structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Despite appearing to be an impossibility on first observation, it is quite possible to keep bees in residential or even heavily residential areas. Though it is not necessarily the easiest or most successful method of beekeeping, residential beekeeping is by no means an unfeasible act. It is often possible to keep bees in the most crowded suburban areas, within small residential lots or even on the rooftops of mid sized buildings. If enough effort is made, it is usually possible to keep bees in some capacity within an urban environment. For the most success, beekeepers of this ilk must adapt and manage in such a way as to cause the least amount inconvenience for both their bees and their neighbors.

Because of the factors affecting residential beekeepers, they will almost always act as a [[Beekeeping/Hobby Beekeeping| hobbyist beekeeper]], or in some areas rent a hive from a local commercial beekeper. Due to limited amount of space and resources, it is recommended that residential beekeepers start small with just two or three hives, and only expand once a proper feel for the local area has been achieved. However, some residential beekeepers also have other apiaries, in which they can create a small [[Beekeeping/Sideline Beekeeping| sideline]] business, but rarely do they go the [[Beekeeping/Commercial Beekeeping| commercial]] route.

Before keeping bees in a residential area, be sure to know local laws, requirements and regulations. Some areas don’t allow beekeeping and other areas require a permit to be purchased. If you are on good terms with your neighbors and wish to remain as such, it may be a good idea to speak with them before committing yourself to keeping bees in a populated area.

==Hive Placement Factors==
When working the urban environment with bees, particular attention must be taken to properly place the hive to eliminate or increase certain [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Behavior| behaviors]] and actions of the bees.
===Out of Sight, Out of Mind===
Chances are, a new residential beekeeper’s neighbors will not be as excited about bees as the new neighborhood beekeeper. Keeping this in mind, it is often a good idea to keep any hives out of direct line of sight, or disguise hives that are out in the open. Sometimes all it takes is moving a hive from a front or peripheral yard into the backyard. Keeping hives out of sight may eliminate blame for any sort of insect stings, and in the extreme case [[Beekeeping/Vandals| vandalism]]. Most people will not even realize that a neighbor keeps bees if a hive is well placed, which may divert a great deal of stress and controversy. This is not to say that neighbors shouldn’t be allowed to know about beekeepers in the area, but often they must first be appeased and educated before they would be agreeable to this new possibly threatening circumstance.

===Flight Pattern===
In general, bees exiting the hive to gather food will fly between three to ten feet from the ground. Having bees fly in people’s path will likely cause a great deal of unnecessary alarm. Planting tall plants or placing a fence a few feet in front of your hives will force the bees to choose a flight pattern that will take them above head level. Some beekeepers may even choose to locate their hives on a rooftop to eliminate conflicting paths.
===Hive Location===
Preferably, colonies of bees should be kept in a location in which they receive a full day’s sunlight. Shaded and cold bees tend to be more aggressive and ready to sting. Though it may not always be possible, the main hive entrance should be pointed to the southeast to get the best of the early morning sun. 
A placement of hives near neighbor’s yards is unadviseable, especially if the neighbors have young children who play outdoors. It is also advised that bees be kept away from swimming pools, as they may attempt to make it their primary water source.

==Resources==
One of the most important issues of beekeeping is having the proper resources for the bees.
===Foraging===
During most times of the foraging season, bees will be able to find adequate supplies of nectar and pollen for survival. Keep in mind that most bees choose to forage within a two-mile radius but ten is not unheard of. A two mile radius means that the bees will cover over 8,000 acres of land. Within this land, even in residential areas, many people have gardens, fruit trees and decorative gardens. So foraging may be no problem whatsoever to residential beekeepers. 
===Supplementing===
Occasionally, it may be necessary to supplement the diets of residential bees. But the same guidelines may be followed as with any other form of beekeeping.
===Water===
Depending on location, water may be a scarcity to the bees of a residential beekeeper. Bees require water to regulate hive temperature and for diluting honey for feeding. Water is often collected from the nearest source, though bees seem to prefer shallow pools of warmer standing water. Because of this, it is advisable to supply bees with a source of water so they do not attempt to drink from neighboring pools or birdbaths. Keep in mind that during the hotter parts of the year in some regions of the US, a single healthy colony of bees may use up to a gallon or more of water a day. Some beekeepers have a faucet slowly dripping over a shallow dish or plate. Once bees start using a specific water source, it may be difficult to prevent them from returning. It is often best to provide a non-diminishing supply of water near the hive before the bees begin flying.

==Working The Colony==
Whenever a beehive is opened or in some way disturbed, a potentially dangerous reaction may occur. To diminish the possibility of negative action, it is advisable to follow a set of guidelines when working the hive. 
===Be Aware of Nectar Flows===
A nectar flow may be the best possible time in which to work a colony. During a good flow, many of the [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| workers]] will be out of the hive foraging. This diminished population offers the best time to examine the colony. Be aware of the nectar flows in your area, though this may not be possible without good observations for several years. During a time of nectar dearth, bees may be more defensive and more populous in the hive.

===When to Open the Hive===
Weather and time of day hold a large influence over the temperament of a colony of bees. Opening a hive during non-peak condition, such as early morning, a rainy or windy day, or during cold weather should be avoided whenever possible. To minimize the likelihood of problems, hives should only be worked on ideal warm sunny days. This however, is also the time of day when neighbors tend to be out and about. When possible only work the hive when no one else is around the immediate vicinity.

===Expect Observers===
When working a hive, neighbors, especially children, may become interested in what you are doing. If you don’t mind an audience, be sure to have some extra protective gear on hand so some of your spectators may get a closer look or even help out. If you don’t have any protective gear to share be sure that spectators stay a reasonable distance away so they won’t chance getting harmed. Now would also be a good time to casually educate those around you in the art and science of beekeeping. A beekeeper, can often use a good assistant, some one who repeatedly chooses to watch may be just that person. It may even be a good idea to invite friends and neighbors to learn and enjoy your hobby. Just be prepared to answer many questions.

===Avoid Robbing===
Honey, nectar or hive parts exposed, or even leaving a colony open for a few minutes may encourage a [[Beekeeping/Robbing| robbing]] situation, which will likely lead to many defensive, ready-to-sting bees flying around. Always seal hives and cover attractive hive parts as soon as possible when working to avoid this situation.

===Avoid Gloves===
Wearing gloves while beekeeping can be a bad idea. Stings on hands are easily removed and the resulting pain quickly subsides. Generally stings on gloves are not felt, but alarm pheromones are released each time and will cause other bees in the hive to attack. Often this will build and the beekeeper will ignore a cycle that the residential beekeeper should avoid. Wearing gloves may cause the beekeeper to miss one of the best identifiers of colony mood. Working barehanded, a beekeeper is less clumsy and will be less likely to allow the bees to get out of control.

==Tips==
;Gentle Bees :When keeping bees in residential areas it is important to keep gentle bees. Select a [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race of bees]] that is known to act non-aggressively. If a colony becomes temperamental, don’t hesitate to re-queen it.
;Consider Your Neighbors :It is best to keep your neighbors happy, though you may be within your legal right to keep bees on your property, an angry neighbor can cause severe problems for a beekeeper. For more information on this subject, see the [[Beekeeping/Gaining Support| Gaining Support of Friends and Neighbors]] module.
;Avoid Swarming :Even though a swarm of bees is often no threat, neighbors will not perceive it as such. 
;Join Hobbyist Associations :Often a residential beekeeper does not have the room or the need for some seasonal beekeeping equipment, by joining an association it may be possible to share such equipment an thereby eliminate some cost. If such an association is not available consider paying a small fee to a beekeeper with the proper equipment for rental or usage.
;Hive Design :Because a residential beekeeper often has differing requirements, you may want to consider alternate hive designs such as a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], which are known to be easier to work, cheap, and to encourage gentler bees.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== STRATEGIES TO ADOPT E-LEARNING ==

'''Incorporate e-learning or blended learning into the corporate strategy by linking training to a business goal.''' 

*It is imperative that training needs are clearly defined and matched to business goals. Management must then communicate loud and clear these strategic messages to all departments, champion its initiation, and maintain its support until results are achieved. 
*Of course, one needs to be mindful of the concept of &quot;scope creep,&quot; in which too many project needs are tied to a learning solution that tries to answer all departmental needs but ends up never fully adopted by any department. 

'''Match the appropriate e-learning learning methodologies to training needs.'''

*The foundation of organization-wide e-learning is the licensing of a learning management system (LMS). At its simplest level, an LMS registers students, runs courses, and generates reports on their completion. At more complex levels, an LMS performs many other functions, such as creating certification tracks, allowing the entry of offline learning results, and so on. 

*Buyers should only license systems that support either the SCORM (Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model) or AICC (Aviation Industry Computer Based Training Committee) standard for e-learning programming, and should only license content that is compliant with those standards. Most systems, but not all, comply with at least one of these standards. Compliance with one of the two is adequate, since most content providers will provide content for either. 

*Buyers need to be aware of another standard that isn't related to content production, the Standard Object Access Protocol (SOAP). This enables an LMS to integrate with a human resources information system. This integration can enable anything from the automatic updating of employee information from a program such as PeopleSoft to more complex analyses of job performance and training results. 

*A newer product is the Learning Content Management System (LCMS). This enables the storage of content pieces such as images, videos and documents in the system with the purpose of making them available for content creation by the organization.

'''ELearning Defined'''

E-Learning is not just about how technology is used in education.  It is a much broader term that has come to include both technical and social dynamics.  It is not a stretch to say that our society is moving (has moved) from an industrial age to an information age based on knowledge.  E-Learning will have an increasing role in this shift.  Some people think of E-Learning as just online or web learning, but it is a very narrow view.  There is more to it than just learning with computers and more elements makeup E-Learning than just websites.  Cognitive Design Solutions (CDS) created three different levels of E-Learning definitions.  The three levels are: Internet enabled instruction, Technology-based instruction and Learning tools of the New Economy. [http://www.cognitivedesignsolutions.com/images/elearn_define2.gif]
*In internet enabled instruction definitions dealing with networking technology would be found.
*The Technology-based instruction includes methodology issues such as:  instructional design, best practices and collaboration elements.
*Learning tools of the New Economy look at cultural and social impacts that are being advanced by technology.[http://www.cognitivedesignsolutions.com/ELearning/E-Learning1.htm]

Basically, what CDS is saying is that to do E-Learning justices one must look at the whole makeup of E-Learning (the technology, methodology and social elements). These three elements have interaction with each other to produce new networks to support learning.  When instituted correctly, E-Learning, provides a new array of tools and practices that can add value to a traditional learning setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Defining Visual Rhetoric

{{cquote|Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing [discovering] in any given case the available [appropriate] means of persuasion|30px|30px|Aristotle|qtd. in Bizzell 160}}

{{cquote|The duty and office of Rhetoric is to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the will|30px|30px|Bacon|qtd. in Bizzell 629}}

According to the rhetoric page on this wiki site, rhetoric is the art of persuasion using language.  The classical philosophers used rhetoric in their speeches to persuade people to their point of view.  The art uses style and many different formulas to make the most pertinent argument to convince their audience.  The classical sophist, Gorgias, said rhetoric had the power to create images in a person's mind.  Quintilian also believed that rhetoric presented images into people's minds (Blakesley 2).  Visual rhetoric is actually representations and images.  It is using images to convince people instead of using words.  
 
	Images have just begun to be analyzed as rhetoric.  They have surrounded people since cavemen began drawing pictures on cave walls.  Images today are used in [[../Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric|Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric]] advertisements, schoolbooks, movies, magazines, paintings, the list could go on forever because images are everything we see.  The visual surrounds people all the time.  The definition of visual rhetoric depends upon the scholar, but it can be any range of the items listed previously.  In Defining Visual Images, the authors, Charles Hill and Marguerite Helmers,  explain that visual rhetoric is “understanding how images… work upon readers” (Helmers 2).  So visual rhetoric is the study of what impression visuals give a viewer.  There are many categories to look at when determining this impression or impact.
  
	One aspect of visual rhetoric is intertextuality.  This is how one image relates to another image.  Are there similarities?  Is it a certain type of image, advertisement, family photo?  This is important because the more images that are similar, the more symbols our society comes to know, and the study of semiotics is born.  The reason that images can mean something or create emotion in viewers is because of semiotics.  Objects in images represent concepts known to our culture, that have a common meaning throughout our society.  One example is the American flag.  The American flag in an image at least in America, stands for freedom.
  
	Psychology must also be looked at when studying images.  Trying to figure out what impact certain colors, shapes, symbols have on people is important in figuring out their reactions.  This psychology could change from culture to culture.  Cultural studies are then also important.  Two people from different backgrounds could see images in completely opposite views.  Read more about this [[../Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric|Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric]].
  
	Visual rhetoric found its beginnings in art criticism.  Analysts would look at aspects in the design and symbolism in a piece of fine art, to try and explain what the artist was trying to say.  One example of this is Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh.  To some people it is just a pretty painting to look at, while others see a foreshadowing to his death.  He includes a cypress tree, which is a cemetery tree.  He also has the stars, in Van Gogh’s time, heaven was being in the stars.  Now that painting would be looked at by a rhetorician and be analyzed in the same way- by looking at all aspects of it.  

	Visual rhetoric is highly connected to design.  When the maker of an image is creating it, he looks at the lines.  What direction are the lines going?  Are they thick or thin?  Are they diagonal?  In The Grammar of Visual Design, Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen write about vectors.  [[Rhetorical Vectors]].  Vectors are diagonal lines throughout an image.  Vectors create action in an image.  They determine whether or not an image is narrative or conceptual.  Another ‘grammatical’ concept in their book is modality.  Modality is how believable or realistic an image is- [[../Modality and Visual Representations of Reality|Modality and Visual Representations of Reality]].  Another ‘gramatical’ concept in their book is framing and salience.  Kress and Leeuwen say that the rhetoric of an image is affected by the framing around it- the way the image is cropped.  This makes the image either more or less believable.  
All of these concepts need to be analyzed in order to determine the rhetoric of an image.  And even through looking at each aspect scholars may disagree about the meaning.  Each person has previous knowledge and experiences that lead him or her to have his or her own opinion about different symbols.  But through semiotics and using ‘grammatical’ concepts, hopefully the study of visual rhetoric can become more stabilized and well thought of in intellectual circles- [[../Status of Visual Rhetoric and Visual Literacy in the Academy|Status of Visual Rhetoric and Visual Literacy in the Academy]].

  Back to [[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/Work arounds]]

A simple hack I made to get around the limitation on the number of mice. It gets around the problem by ignoring that there are multiple mice.

This is useful if you have a trackpad on a laptop and need to use an external mouse. 

&lt;pre&gt;
function [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse_AllowMultipleHack(windowPtrOrScreenNumber)
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
%
% Returns the current (x,y) position of the cursor and the up/down state
% of the mouse buttons. &quot;buttons&quot; is a 1xN matrix where N is the number of
% mouse buttons. Each element of the matrix represents one mouse button.
% The element is true (1) if the corresponding mouse button is pressed and
% false (0) otherwise. 
%
% % Test if any mouse button is pressed. 
% if any(buttons)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing a button.\n');
% end
% 
% % Test if the first mouse button is pressed.
% if buttons(1)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the first button!\n');
% end
%
% % Test if the second mouse button is pressed.
% if length(buttons)&gt;=2 &amp; buttons(2)
%   fprintf('Someone''s pressing the second button!\n');
% end
%
% length(buttons) tells you how many buttons there are on your mouse.
%
% The cursor position (x,y) is &quot;local&quot;, i.e. relative to the origin of
% the window or screen, if supplied. Otherwise it's &quot;global&quot;, i.e. relative
% to the origin of the main screen (the one with the menu bar).
% 
% NOTE: If you use GetMouse to wait for clicks, don't forget to wait
% for the user to release the mouse button, ending the current click, before
% you begin waiting for the next mouse press.
%
% fprintf('Please click the mouse now.\n');
% [x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% while any(buttons) % if already down, wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while ~any(buttons) % wait for press
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% while any(buttons) % wait for release
% 	[x,y,buttons] = GetMouse;
% end
% fprintf('You clicked! Thanks.\n');
% 
% NOTE: GetMouse no longer supports this obsolete usage:
% xy = GetMouse([windowPtrOrScreenNumber])
% where xy is a 1x2 vector containing the x, y coordinates.
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Even if your mouse has more than three buttons, GetMouse will return as
% many values as your mouse has buttons, 
%
% GetMouse can not cope if your computer has more than one mouse connected. 
% It exits with an error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section of the [[Beekeeping| beekeeping wikibook]] exists as a place to quickly answer some frequently (and perhaps some non frequently) asked questions. Answers will generally be brief and possibly point in the direction of a pre-existing module on the subject. Any items that go into particular depth and don’t have a related module may eventually become a new module. Because of the ease and simplicity involved in answering (most) quick questions, there may, and likely will, exist information within this module that is not present in other modules.

Please keep in mind that most questions have a wide range of possibly correct answers. An old saying goes “if you ask 100 beekeepers the same question you will get 101 different answers.” Though some beepers may disagree with that statement, which does not change the fact that there will be different opinions as to the correct answer to a question. Because of this, hopefully more than one answer may be supplied for each question. If you choose to answer any questions, please do not simply remove answers you disagree with, rather add reasons to support your decision and let the reader gather information as they please.

If you have a particular question that has not been answered within the overall beekeeping wikibook, or have a question for this list which you wish to know the answer too please submit it to the [[Talk:Beekeeping/Frequently Asked Questions| frequently asked questions discussion page]].

==Getting Started==
;How much does it cost to get started beekeeping?
:This depends completely on the new beekeeper, equipment can be built, and items purchased new or used. Depending on how many hives are desired, access to bees and so forth. A complete hobbyist beginner may spend any where from $0 to $1000.

;How much time does it take to keep bees?
:Beekeeping is a seasonal task. During the winter there is little to be done, during the spring your time may be completely occupied. Once a beekeeper becomes accustomed to keeping bees it may take any where between five to thirty minutes per hive per week during the active season. However, this is not to say that beekeeping can’t consume more time if desired. 

;Is a license or permit required to keep bees?
:This is wholly dependent on where you live and possibly the number of hives you wish to keep. If you call your local agricultural department they can likely point you in the right direction.

;Do I need to join a local association or club to keep bees?
:Joining a club or association will likely never be a requirement, though doing so is greatly advised. Some clubs require yearly dues, but often this money is quickly more than paid back through the resources that the club provides.

==Bee Stings==
;How often do beekeepers get stung?
:This is dependent on many factors, including the [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| race]] of bees the keeper keeps, the temperament of the individual colonies, the number of colonies and the beekeepers attitude and skill. Every beekeeper that does his or her job properly will get stung at some point, it is rarely the goal, but sometimes the result. A beekeeper may expect more stings as they begin keeping bees, and fewer as they continue.

;Does being stung hurt?
:It can, and likely won't depending on where the sting occurred. The best protection against being stung is not to bother the bees, however the second best is to wear the proper protective gear such as a [[Beekeeping/Veil| veil]] or [[Beekeeping/Bee Suit| bee suit]]. Some beekeepers even purposely get stung around ten times a season to build and keep a tolerance to bee venom, causing intermediate stings to hurt and swell less.
;How many people in the US die as a result of bee stings?
:Statistics show that lightning is more likely to lead to death than bee stings.

;I was stung by a bee, how should I remove the stinger?
:The stinger should be removed as soon as possible by scraping it out, such as by using a finger nail or credit card. Squeezing the stinger, and attached venom pouch, may cause the release of more venom in to the skin.
;Do bees really die after stinging a person?
:Yes, if the bee that stings is a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bee]] it will lose its life shortly after stinging. A [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]] may survive after stinging, however it is extremely unlikely to be stung by a queen.

;I was stung by a bee and received some redness and swelling in the immediate area, was this an allergic reaction?
:No, this may be a standard reaction to a bee sting, however consult a doctor to be sure.

==Hive Population==
;How many bees live within a colony?
:There may be any where between 10,000 to 80,000 bees in a colony. Population is highly dependant on the activity and season of the bees. 

;How many queen bees exist in a hive?
:Normally there only exist a single mated queen bee within a hive, though it is not unheard of to have two, but it is even rarer to have three.

==Bee Flight==
;How fast can bees fly?
:Bees can fly between 12 and 20 miles per hour.

;How far do bees fly in a life time?
:[[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| Worker bees]] may fly up to 500 miles during their foraging existence which may last on average between 5 and 30 days.

;What is the radius bees will fly from their home site in order to forage?
:Bees will only fly as far as they need to, but may fly as far as 5 to 10 miles from home.

==Foraging==
===Nectar Collecting===
;What percentage of foraging bees collect nectar?
:Around 50 to 80 percent

;How many trips will a single bee make a day to forage for nectar?
:As many as 30 trips for a single bee have been recorded

;How much nectar can a bee collect during a single trip?
:A full load of nectar may weigh about 85% of the body weight of a bee.

===Pollen Collecting===
;What percentage of foraging bees collect pollen?
:Around 15 to 30 percent

;How many trips will a single bee make a day to forage pollen?
:As many as 50 trips for a single bee have been recorded

;How much pollen can a bee collect during a single trip?
:Rarely more than 15 mg

==Castes==
===Queen Bee===
;Does the queen sting and lay eggs with the same body part? &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 25 Apr 2005)&lt;/small&gt;
:Yes, other than its use to deposit eggs in the center of an empty cell, the [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee's]] stinger secondary function is inject other competitive queens with venom in order to eliminate them. The bee’s stinger is a modified ovipositor, which developed in to a defensive mechanism.

==Eliminating Bees==
;How can neighbors be prevented from keeping bees? &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 25 Apr 2005) &lt;/small&gt;
:In most areas there is no legal way to prevent a neighbor by force from keeping bees on their own property. If a law does not already exist preventing beekeeping in your community, you may wish to speak to a local government representative in order to instate one. However, there is often no good legal reason to instate such a law and beekeepers associations tend to fight as a group preventing any such law from being created. Checking zoning laws may be a secondary option, but most allow beekeeping as long as the hive population is below a certain level, which is often in the hundreds. The best option is to speak to your neighbor and explain your grievances in order to work out compromise, though be aware that in most cases they have no legal requirement to make you happy.

==Hive Products==
===Honey===
;Isn't it somewhat unsafe to eat honey produced in residential areas? It could be contaminated with [[w:Rhododendron|rhododendron]] or azalea nectar, and thus poisonous. &lt;small&gt;(Submitted by [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 3 May 2005)&lt;/small&gt;
:While it is true that bees can forage nectar from plants with [[Beekeeping: Bad Bee Plants| human toxic nectar]], you have to consider the distribution of such flowers. If poison-nectar plants are the predominant source of nectar for forming honey, don’t eat the honey produced. However, in most cases such nectar sources are few and far between on the foraging path of honeybees. This in combination with the sheer amount of nectar that must be gathered to make a small amount of honey makes the occurrence of honey poisoning extremely rare. Experienced beekeepers should be aware of possible toxic honey their hive may produce, this honey is often collected and used only for feeding back to the bees. If there is any question, avoid using any honey that you don’t trust.

;Is it a good idea to feed infants or people with immune deficiencies honey?
: No, honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with severe immune system deficiencies. This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present within the honey. This level of botulism present should have no ill effect on a healthy person.

#How can I keep bees away from the flowers and water in my yard? -[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:58, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:: I personally am unaware of any sort of bee repellant, but I will see what I can find out. My best advise is not to plant flowers that are attractive to bees. There is not much you can do in regard to water, other than not letting it stand uncovered. If the simple presence of bees worries you, keep in mind that lightning kills more people than bees do. Once I get around to it, and assuming some one else dose not first, I will write and post an article addressing the issues of the (lack of) danger that bees pose. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 02:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
::: Well, that would be wrong. Bee stings can lead to infection. I had to get antibiotics and a tetanus vaccination the last time I was stung. My toe swelled up terribly, over a few days following the sting. Probably I would be dead if I hadn't gotten some modern antibiotics. Had I died, I'm pretty sure the bacteria would have gotten credit for my death, thus underestimating the danger of bees. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
::::I more specifically, should have said that bee venom as the direct causes deaths less likely than lightning. As true with any wound, infection is possible and secondary effects may occur, which should be treated if necessary. The wound created by a bee sting should be treated as any other wound. In cases where allergies do not exist, it takes about ten stings per pound of body weight to administer a lethal dose of venom. More statistics relating to insect sting deaths can be found [http://bee-quick.com/StingDeath.html here] or from the [http://www.nationmaster.com/cat/Mortality World Help Organization]. If allergies are a problem, you should, as I advise everyone with that problem, carry an epinephrine pen. Remember that Epinephrine only treats a symptom and reduces the profusion to your tissues thus reduces swelling and allows your airway to re-open, it does nothing to stop the underlying problem. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)

==Answer Discussion==
*How is a bee supposed to hold 0.5 mL of necter? That's 1/2 cc. A bee is about 1/4 cc total. They don't bring buckets with them. A hummingbird might, just barely, be able to hold this much. from [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] on 20:45, 25 Apr 2005)&lt;br&gt;
:A full load of nectar may weigh about be about 85% of the body weight of a bee. This may seem like a lot, but bees are more than adequate to complete the task. Keep in mind that an adult bee can easily carry away hive debris many times her size and weight. The only thing that limits the amount of nectar that can be brought back is the size of the bees honey stomach. According to my source, which I now see is wrong, claims that .5 mL is about the size of a drop from an eyedropper. I did not initially see the error as I don't normally use SI, I removed that segment of the answer and hope someone has a better one. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 21:42, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)
*Is it better to leave a bee stinger in until a proper tool can be found, or to just crudely squeeze at the stinger immediately? -[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:58, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:See the answer to the question “I was stung by a bee, how should I remove the stinger?” under the [[Beekeeping: Frequently Asked Questions#Bee Stings| bee stings]] category. The short and sweet answer is use a finger nail to scratch it out and avoid squeezing the stinger if possible. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 02:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
::Well yes, but the problem is that I don't carry a proper tool with me. My fingernails are often very short. So, do I search for a proper tool or just squeeze the stinger with blunt fingers? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:::I too keep my nails rather short, in fact I just clipped them last night. As luck would have it, I was stung this afternoon during an inspection. (I nor any of my family has been stung unless we were directly distressing a bee, in this case I had the hive open and was not paying attention and crushed a bee) The stinger came right out with a flick of the finger. If you don’t have the proper tool, such as a credit card, a knife or even a pen or a business card, you can pinch the stinger between your fingers and remove it. However, doing this you are quite likely to cause more venom to be introduced to the wound. Time is also an issue, as the stinger will both pump more venom, and work its way deeper into the skin if given the chance. Depending on how quickly you can get access to the proper tool may depend on your choice of removal. Also remember that bees leave behind a chemical scent marker when they sting, possibly encouraging more bees to sting the general area, so leave the area, and mask the scent if possible. -[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:36, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Why, in a world where everyone is so determined to be different, do vectors offer a bridge across the active and intentional need to see objects in uniquely different ways?'' But most importantly: what is the bridge? Vectors are “forces generated by the shapes and configurations of visual objects. A vector is characterized by its magnitude, direction, and base of attack. Visual vectors are seen as oriented in both directions unless a special base determines the origin of the vector’s attack and thereby its direction&quot; (Arnheim 218). Without vectors, the commonality that brings critics and casual observers, alike, together to agree on the aesthetic value of an image would not exist.

Let us first look at what it is that vectors do. Vectors are used to &quot;visually realize different ways in which objects and their relations can be represented&quot; (Kress and van Leeuwen 56). Vectors act as visual cues to the observer of an image that perform like road signs to connect two separate objects that give the viewer direction as to where to look and what to look at next in a temporal capacity, or artifact. The importance lays in the connection that is conveyed by the use of a vector or vectors because they not only act as visual cues in paintings, but are found in everyday images and scenes. We experience and interpret vectors in our everyday lives whether through photos, diagrams,  architecture, or advertisements. Vectors tell us visually what we would normally say verbally.

== Vector usage ==
Vectors are connectors that we use in order to tell or interpret a story. When used in a narrative or narrative process, vectors act as a set of visual symbols or characteristics brought together in order to persuade or draw attention to certain aspects of a piece. Narrative representation or process is one way to determine why it is that vectors are rhetorical. When one thinks of a painting that is highly influential, almost immediately he or she is drawn to a certain point in the image that is of interest. This main focus in direction must be present for rhetorical vectors, and essentially images, to effectively communicate with the viewer. Direction is established by a given object in the image or simply by a layout of the action. There are many different elements that go into making a vector and therefore may be “formed by bodies or limbs or tools ‘in action’, but there are many other ways to turn represented elements into diagonal lines of action. A road running diagonally across the picture space, for instance, is also a vector and the car driving on it an ‘Actor’ in the process of ‘driving’. In abstract images such as diagrams, narrative processes are realized by graphic elements…” (Kress and van Leeuwen 59) Kress and Van Leeuwen discuss the concept of ‘Actor’ and ‘Goal’ as an important aspect in the narrative interpretation process. Vectors must initiate from single or multiple sources, often this main source is the ‘Actor’ in which the direction of an image originates. The ‘Goal’ is what the vector is drawing attention to, or the intended outcome, whether it’s the viewer, another point in the image, or within upon itself.

== Vector Relationships ==
Vectors also help us realize different types of relationships that are represented in images. These three relationships are:

*'''Unidirectional transactional action'''
*'''Bidirectional transactional action''' 
*'''Non-transactional action'''

In the first, Unidirectional transactional action, a vector is formed that connects an 'Actor' and a 'Goal'. This vector is normally moving from the body of the 'Actor' and is directed toward the 'Goal'. For instance, if a human being were pointing at an orange in a picture, a vector would be coming from the pointing hand a the orange, showing us that our focus should move from the hand toward the orange. In the second relationship, Bidirectional transactional action, a vector is shot between two subjects that are connected. For instance, if two humans are looking at each other, a double-headed vector would be moving between the two of them pointing at each other. A relationship is being formed between the two with the aid of the vector which is linking them. In the final relationship type, a Non-transactional action, a vector emanates from an 'Actor', but does not point at another participant. For instance, this could be a human being looking off into the distance to something outside of the image. We cannot assume the subject, or 'Actor', is looking at anything, so the vector emanating from his person is not linked to another participant, making the relationship formed by the vector non-transactional. (Kress and van Leeuwen 74)

== How are vectors used? ==
There are two ways in which vectors can be used whether in the form of direct address or drawing attention to an &quot;imagined act&quot; (Kress and van Leeuwen 117). More often we interpret vectors as a form of direct address rather than constituting an imagined act because vectors in the form of a direct address draw our attention and are more apparent, oftentimes, to viewers than searching for meaning in an image by themselves. For example, older military recruitment posters feature [[Image:479px-Unclesamwantyou.jpg|thumb|Vectors eminate from Uncle Sam's eyes and hand toward the viewer.]]a strong, determined, and influential-looking individual that points directly at the audience as if to give the impression that it is viewer that should become part of the values advertised in the poster. This type of direct address forces the viewer to become interactive with the image. Immediately after viewing the image, there is a certain relationship established between the 'Actor' in the image and the audience ,especially in the military advertisement, because the vector is directed at the viewer at an eye level, forcing the audience to acknowledge their relationship.

== Vectors in everyday life ==
Vectors are not only limited to two-dimensional images; they are around us in everyday life.  Buildings or sculptures may use vectors to draw one's eyes to a specific location.  Many other three-dimensional objects or even humans use vectors on a daily basis as a form of non-verbal communication.  For instance, try this experiment.  Go stand in a busy area and just look up in a direction towards nothing particular.  Passersby will look toward where your eyes are pointing.  This is because your focus on nothing at all is shooting a vector from your eyes in a specific direction. Vectors will prompt others to look that way as well. Vectors help to facilitate logical progression of an image, creating a relationship between the 'Actor' and 'Goal' in order to portray messages and connections to an audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In recent years there has been a shift in the academic field of rhetoric to include not only studies of rhetoric as they pertain to the written and spoken word, but also as they relate to images.  However, while most scholars agree on the validity of visual rhetoric and find it deserving of academic study, the attention given visuals’ rhetorical purpose is still very contested in academia; due to its novelty, it has not yet been determined how to study or explain visual rhetoric.    

The problems that visual rhetoric has encountered in obtaining a place in higher education have surprisingly little to do with visual rhetoric’s validity as an academic subject.  Rather, a main reason that visual rhetoric has faced some difficulty in being accepted widely as a legitimate academic discipline is the fact that not many people know what “visual rhetoric” encompasses.  This is not to say that people have no idea what visual rhetoric is - in fact the opposite is the case.  Visual rhetoric lends itself to so many [[../Definitions of Visual Rhetoric|Definitions of Visual Rhetoric]] that there is quite a bit of confusion concerning where to draw the line between what should be studied as visual rhetoric and what should not be.  Indeed, the very scholars who extol the legitimacy of visual rhetoric as a discipline and lobby for its rightful place in academia, often do not share a definition of “visual rhetoric.”  

The meaning of both parts of the two-word term “visual rhetoric” is debatable, and this has caused a great deal of confusion as to what actually falls under the umbrella of visual rhetoric.  For example, more than twenty scholarly definitions of the word “rhetoric” can be found at the [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/rhetoricdefinitions.htm American Rhetoric website].  Although a common trend of “persuading/informing” seems to run through most of the definitions of rhetoric, it is easy to see that visual rhetoric is thought of very differently from one person to the next.

The same can be said of the word visual.  What types of “visuals” should be studied as worthwhile examples of visual rhetoric?  Popular subjects include: charts and graphs, internet visuals, paintings, traditional two-dimensional images, television, etc. See [[../Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric|Mediums and Manifestations of Visual Rhetoric]]. Debates over which of these outlets are the most capable of being studied in a scholarly fashion as rhetoric are disputed.  From the perspective of many scholars, it seems far-reaching and a bit naive to say that all images are rhetorical and as such deserve to be studied.  Yet others claim that all visuals possess rhetoric and deserve attention.  

Correspondingly, there is no unanimously agreed upon method by which visual rhetoric should be incorporated into academia.  Hypothetically suppose that an agreed upon definition of visual rhetoric has been established and the problem of what should be studied no longer is an issue.  There then arises a dilemma concerning how to relate visual rhetoric studies to society, and how to interpret the power visual rhetoric possesses.  In other words, how should visual rhetoric be presented to students in an academic setting?  Should visual rhetoric be studied as a totally new and unique form of expression, or does it go hand-in-hand with traditional perspectives about verbal and written rhetoric?  There seems to be a division between those scholars who wish to study visual rhetoric through means similar to that of text-based rhetoric, and those who see the two as totally separate, believing that visual rhetoric is independent and deserves its own unique interpretation.  In the scholarly debate between these two options, the former seems to have become more of the norm.

Due in part to a lack of faith in images as deserving of scholastic study, visual arguments have in many cases been taught through methods similar to those of textual arguments.  Notes art historian Barbara Stafford concerning what she sees as a widespread attitude towards images: “In spite of their quantity and globalized presence, for many educated people pictures have become synonymous with ignorance, illiteracy, and deceit.” (Hill, 3).  If one inserted the words &quot;sculptures&quot; or &quot;monuments&quot; (See [[Visual Rhetoric/3D and 2D Visual Persuasion|3D and 2D Visual Persuasion]]) in place of the word “pictures” in Stafford’s claim, the result would be the same; in academia, words often bare more intellectual weight than visuals.  This reality, combined with the fact that many of the professors teaching visual rhetoric courses are actually trained in traditional writing and rhetoric disciplines as opposed to graphic design or art, has led many academics to align visual rhetoric with written rhetoric.  Scholars in many instances have even gone so far as to explain visual rhetoric in terms of the same grammatical rules as are used in written language.  This approach is in reality probably not a bad one, and most likely successfully serves the purposes of evaluating visual rhetoric.  However, if visual rhetoric is to gain a substantial foothold in academia, more attention needs to be given to how visuals act independently from language.

Overall, the emergence of visual rhetoric classes in upper education is constantly improving as they become more widespread and the dialogue of visusal rhetoric becomes more acceptable.  At this point in the infancy of academically studied visual rhetoric, the main objective of scholars should be to engage in purposful discussion about what visual rhetoric is and what it is not, all the while keeping in mind the goal of visual rhetoric’s emergence as a full-fledged academic discipline.

== Overview ==

Like most other bicycle bearings the headset needs periodic maintenance to keep it running smoothly.

There are two basic types of headset.

The style more common on older bikes is the threaded system, so called because the steerer tube of the fork is threaded. The top bearing race (cone) screws onto the fork steerer tube and is held in adjustment by a lock nut. The stem has an extension that extends down into the steerer tube and is held in place by a wedge.  

Most new bikes now use the threadless system. The fork steerer has no threads. Unlike the threaded system the steerer tube extends beyond the top of the headset. The stem clamps onto the steerer tube holding everything together.  The headset bearings are tensioned (adjusted) by an allen bolt that pulls up on a star nut inserted into the steerer tube.  This applies tension against the upper bearing race (the stem needs to be loosened when for this adjustment to be made).

Headsets also use several different bearings types including loose ball bearings, roller bearings and cartridge bearings.

== Threadless Headsets ==
[[Image:br_aheadset.png|right|thumb|Threadless headset cross section]]
[[Image:Bicycle headset (threadless) exploded view-en.png|right|thumb|an exploded view of a threadless headset]]

=== Tools required ===

=== Disassembly ===

* Remove the pre load adjustment bolt on the top of the steerer tube. Also remove the top cap and any spacers that are above the stem.

* Making sure the fork is supported loosen the bolts clamping the stem to the steerer tube. Now the stem is loose pull it off the steerer tube. Since the stem is holding everything together the fork is free to fall out the bottom of the head tube if not restrained.

* Occasionally the conical compression ring will have a tight grip on the steerer. A gentle tap on the steerer tube with a mallet or your palm will free it up. Some (sealed-bearing) headsets will have a rubber O-ring fitted into the compression ring (bearing cap). Have a replacement handy, or take care not to shear the O-ring.

* Remove the fork from the frame, take care to note the location and orientation of the individual pieces.

* Clean and inspect bearings and races.

=== Assembly ===

* Apply grease to both cups, crown race and bearings.

* Assemble the parts in reverse order that you removed them

* Slide the stem and spacers onto the steerer tube (but leave loose) and refit the top cap and bolt.

* The bearings are adjusted by tightening and loosening the top bolt. The bearings should be adjusted so there is no play. Clamp the front brake and rock the bike backwards and forwards to check.

* Now the bearings are correctly adjusted line up the stem and tighten the bolts.

== Threaded Headsets ==
[[Image:br_threadedheadset.png|right|thumb|Threaded headset cross section]]

=== Assembly and adjustment ===


Adjustment of the threaded headset bearings is similar to the technique used for all cup and cone bearings.  The stem is not a part of the headset and should be removed for all of this work.  Don't worry about applying too much grease, excess will be squeezed out.
* Clean all old grease and dirt off all balls, races, cones, etc.
* Apply fresh grease to crown race and place clean (preferably new) bearing balls on the crown race, applying more grease as needed.  Be careful not to drop any balls.  If the balls are in a cage, slide the cage down the steerer tube and place it on the race.
* Slide the fork into the steerer tube of the frame, again being careful not to drop any balls.
* Apply fresh grease to the top cup and place clean (preferably new) bearing balls on the top cup, applying more grease as needed.  Be careful not to drop any balls.  If the balls are in a cage, carefully place the cage in the top cup.
* Apply a thin layer of grease to the fork steerer tube threads (mainly to ease removal in the future).
* Screw the threaded race down the fork until it is tight enough to prevent any balls from falling out, but still leaving some play, to be adjusted later.
* Slide down any washers on top of the threaded race.  The washers are often keyed to fit in a notch in the steerer tube of the fork.
* Screw the headset locknut down the steerer tube and loosely against the threaded race (and washers).
* Finger tighten the threaded race down so that the fork turns easily but has no side-to-side play.  If it is too loose, it will be possible to wobble the fork side-to-side.  If the bearings are in poor condition, some compromise might be required, where the movement is slightly difficult in some positions and slightly wobbly in others.
* Holding the threaded race with one hand, finger tighten the locknut against the threaded race.
* Use two headset wrenches (or one headset wrench and one large adjustable wrench), tighten the locknut against the threaded race, without moving the threaded race.  
* After the locknut has been tightened, the movement of the fork should still be smooth and without wobble.  Loosen the locknut and repeat the previous step until this is achieved.  If this can't be achieved, possible causes are: worn bearing balls, worn rolling surfaces, incorrect number of balls, bent fork steerer tube.
*Wipe off excess grease and admire the results of your efforts.

[[Image:Saucepan.jpg|thumb|right|A saucepan]]
A '''saucepan''' is a cooking vessel generally used on top of a range for heating food and / or reducing sauces.

Saucepans can be made of a variety of materials, like aluminium and stainless steel, and the cooking surface can have a non-stick coating, like Teflon. As with all pans the heavier the gauge of the metal the better (especially at the base); it enables more even heat distribution, which makes sticking and burning less likely. Some saucepans have a thick sheet of thermally conductive aluminium laminated into their base for that purpose (like the one shown). A coating of copper on the base allegedly has the same effect, but it would need to be reasonably thick to have any real benefit.

High-sided sauce pans are most useful for heating foods with high liquid content. Low-sided and flare-sided (called Windsor pans) saucepans are most effective for reducing sauces and other liquids.</text>

[[Image:Stock Pot.jpg|thumb|right|A stock pot]]
A '''stock pot''' is a very large and deep cooking vessel generally used on top of a range for making stock or soup.

Stock pots can be made of a variety of materials, like aluminium and stainless steel, As with all pans the heavier the gauge of the metal the better (especially at the base); it enables more even heat distribution, which makes sticking and burning less likely. Some stock pots have a thick sheet of thermally conductive aluminium laminated into their base for that purpose (like the one shown). A coating of copper on the base allegedly has the same effect, but it would need to be reasonably thick to have any real benefit.  They can also contain copper, and carbon steel. Pasta is an example of food that could be cooked in these pots.</text>

[[Image:Paring Knife.jpg|thumb|right|A paring knife]]

#A '''paring knife''' is a small knife than the chef's knife and mostly used for shaping and trimming food. It is a most useful  knife for small &amp; intricate work like removing Jalapeño seeds, de-veining shrimp, skinning vegetables, coring an apple and mincing vegetables.
#'Sheep's foot paring knife' and 'Birds Beak paring knife' are widely used types of paring knives.

It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to sharpen knives.</text>

[[Image:Sharpening Steel.jpg|thumb|right|A steel]]

There are various kinds of '''knife sharpeners''' available for maintaining the sharpness of knives.

A '''sharpening stone''' or '''oil stone''' is also known simply as a '''stone''', and is a tool for maintaining the sharpness of knives. It consists of a carborundum stone, a block of ceramic, or a metal plate with embedded diamond dust. There are generally three 'grades' of stones: a coarse stone for rapid renewal of a badly damaged blade, a medium stone for general work and a fine or Arkansas stone to put the final edge to the blade.  Many of these require the addition of an appropriate lubricant, such as oil or water, to carry away the &quot;cuttings&quot; from the edge while sharpening.  The lubricant prevents the pores in the stone from becoming clogged up with the metal and grit created by the process.

For maintaining the edge on a knife, and not for intensive sharpening, the '''honing steel''', also known simply as a '''steel''', is the choice of professional chefs.  These do not actually sharpen knives, unless they have fine diamond grains on them, but they are often mislabeled as &quot;sharpening steels&quot;.

The steel was originally used to straighten the sharpened edge of a blade where use had pushed it to one side or another on a microscopic scale.  This is preferred, as the metal is brought back to its sharper state quickly, often a matter of four or five strokes of the steel, by restoring the existing edge rather than stone-cutting a new one.  

A steel usually consists of a hardened steel rod with many tiny grooves scored lengthwise. Seemingly paradoxically, they can also be made from a ceramic material specifically intended for sharpening hardened knives, as a standard steel can quickly become blunted. Another version is the diamond steel, with tiny specks of industrial diamond dust bonded to its surface. These are very effective for both sharpening and honing the edges of knives, but they tend to wear away at the knife far more quickly than do other kinds of steel. 

To use a steel, the knife is drawn across roughly perpendicular to it, somewhat like a slow slashing motion, that both takes the knife across the steel while moving down the steel's length, alternating sides of the knife with each pass.  Home cooking enthusiasts will find that a inexpensive (US$20) steel will bring many knives back to life in moments.  

Holding the knife at the appropriate angle, about 15-25 degrees, to match the existing stone-cut angle, the first moves of the knife will feel kind of rough and resistant to the steel.  The feel will diminish within five or ten strokes, even holding the same angle and pressure.  That is the steel telling you the job is done.  A good steel will extend the life between stone sharpening by many months in most cases.

An '''egg slicer''' is a food preparation utensil used to slice peeled, hard-boiled eggs quickly and evenly. It consists of a slotted dish for holding the egg and a hinged plate of wires or blades that can be closed to slice.

Though primarily used for eggs, an egg slicer can also be used to uniformly slice soft fruits and vegetables like mushrooms or strawberries.

[[Image:Potato Masher.jpg|thumb|right|A potato masher]]

A '''potato masher''' is a food preparation utensil used to crush cooked food. Its name comes from its most common use: crushing cooked potatoes for mashed potatoes.

The potato masher consists of a handle connected to a mashing head. The handle can either be upright or sideways. There are two types of heads. The first is a large gauge wire in a rounded zig-zag shape. The second is a plate with holes or slits (as shown). The potato or other food is mashed by grabbing the handle and pushing down on the foodstuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Emulation, is quite simply the translation of software written for a different subset of hardware or for a different operating system into software which will run on the current platform.  To put it quite simply its any computer program that mimics the behavior of any other piece of computer hardware, such as an older computer or video game console.
Why would one want to do this? Here are some reasons:

# '''Maintaining Investment in Older Software''' - Software isn't cheap these days, yet most of us have investments in older software that is still perfectly functional, except for incompatibilities with newer hardware and operating systems. Why throw it away?
# '''Experimentation''' - Oftentimes when writing drivers for a piece of hardware or when writing software to run on a microprocessor one often wants to make sure they have a working piece of software before writing it onto the hardware.  Sometimes the hardware you're writing the software for may not even exist yet.  In either case emulation software is invaluable as it allows you to debug errors in your program without risking the hardware device, emulators can also provide more detailed information on errors that occur, thus they are ideal for testing software without risking the hardware.
# '''Nostalgia''' - Let's face it. We all have old games or operating systems that we know and love. Perhaps it is no longer practical to use them full time, but it's always pleasant to play around with them once in a while.

[[Image:Wire Rack.jpg|thumb|right|cooling rack]]

A '''cooling rack''' (also known simply as a '''wire rack''') is used to allow air to circulate freely to cool [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods, and to prevent them getting soggy from condensation.

A tight grid is typically the best format for a cooling rack, to prevent thin baked goods from breaking or falling through.

An alternative is often to flip the baked goods upside down and leave them in the original hot pan.</text>

[[Image:Mixing Bowl.jpg|thumb|right|mixing bowl]]

A '''mixing bowl''' is a deep bowl that is particularly well suited for mixing ingredients together in.

These come in many materials, such as stainless steel, ceramic, glass, and plastic.  If using a handheld [[Cookbook:Electric mixer|electric mixer]] rather than a standing mixer, be sure to get mixing bowls that will be usable with such a mixer, and which have high enough sides to prevent splatter from it.

Typically one should have at least three mixing bowls of different sizes, as it is often necessary when baking to keep mixtures of ingredients separate.  Also, prepared dough can be stored in the refrigerator directly in the mixing bowl, so consider bowls which can handle temperature change well and/or which have lids for such storage (if your bowls do not have lids, plastic wrap or aluminum foil may be used to cover them).</text>

A '''sifter''' is a device used to simultaneously sieve and aerate flour and other dry ingredients used in baking. It should be noted that a simple [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]] can be employed for the same task, with the same result. It is sometimes refered to as a &quot;tami&quot; (French).</text>

[[Image:CookbookPizzaPan.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pizza Pan]]

A '''pizza pan''' is used to [[Cookbook:Baking|bake]] [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]]. It is usually an aluminum disk, about 18[[Cookbook:Inch|&quot;]] (450 mm) in diameter, with lots of small holes to let moisture out for a crispy crust. Sometimes a mesh of steel wire is used.

With completely uncooked pizza [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]], a [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] can be substituted. (this alone will not produce a crispy crust) With a partially cooked crust, the pizza can be placed on an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] rack without any pan at all.

An aluminum pizza pan should not be cleaned with caustic oven cleaner, as the resulting chemical reaction will damage it.</text>

[[Image:Kookplaat.jpg|thumb|right|cooktop]]
A '''cooktop''', also known as a '''range''' or '''stovetop''', is an [[Cookbook:Appliances|appliance]] used for heating [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pots and pans]]. Most cooktops are attached to the top of an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]].

Cooktops vary in their methods of heat generation, with some models providing multiple options. The various methods include:

==Gas==
Gas is traditional and well-loved by many expert cooks. Gas responds quickly to adjustments and generally provides high heat output. Gas works with any pan, including the round-bottomed [[Cookbook:Wok|woks]] that are best for [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-frying]]. The flame can be useful for cooking a [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|marshmallow]] or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] on a fork. Gas cooktops are often very durable. Gas cooktops often come with gas ovens, which are not good for producing crunchy and crispy foods.

==Electric Coil==
Electric coil cooktops are cheap, common, but don't allow the heat output to be adjusted quickly.

==Induction==
Induction is the most energy efficient cooktop method which uses magnetic induction energy to produce heat, rather than directly applying heat energy. Induction allows instantaneous heating, which reduces cooking time and reduces room temperatures when compared to other conventional methods. The induction surface is cooler and safer than ceramic cooktops. Induction cooktops have a smooth flat surface that is easy to clean. 

Unfortunately, they require flat-bottomed magnetic pots and pans. Aluminum and copper will not work. Stainless steel may work poorly. Cast iron and carbon steel work well. 

Induction cooktops now have a significant electronic component integrated in its control and operation. Safety mechanisms such as pan detection, spill detection, temperature sensor - 'safety cutoff' and residual heat indicators (to indicate a surface is hot) are quickly becoming standard features.

Other features include; electronic touch controls, child safety lock, unsuitable pan detection, preset temperature routines and programs, and power consumption optimization.

Predominant manufacturers include: Kleenmaid, St George, and Whirlpool.

Ceramic cooktops act like electric coil cooktops, but they are easy to clean. They are also fragile and expensive.</text>

      <comment>/* Habit 1: Be Proactive */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The first three habits, 1. '''be proactive''', 2. '''begin with and end in mind''', and 3. put the '''first thing first''', are grouped together in a category called '''private victory'''. Private victories are personal and relate to you as an individual person. In contrast, the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Public victory|following three habits]] are grouped together as habits geared towards [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Public victory|public victory]], and are related to your social success and in working effectively with others.

== Habit 1: Be Proactive==
&quot;There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living&quot; – David Starr Jordan.

Being pro-active is the opposite of being re-active. Both are active, but the first is coming from an inner impulse inside yourself, powered by own desires, while the latter is reacting to outer circumstances. The worst case of being reactive is only acting on outer stimulus without any inner reflection, drive or initiative. To cultivate this initiative is achieved by taking full responsibility for your own life , by becoming response-able – able to choose your response to the world from the inside, before the world is showing you, that you have to act.
The space inside of us between stimulus and response is the space of our freedom to choose, to chose our response. It is what makes us human, and not stimulus-response animals. We are able to choose our reaction. &quot;Act or be acted upon&quot; is one headline that illustrates the point here.
The Circle of Concern and the Circle of Influence.
The Circle of Concern are all areas in life that we are concerned with, that we have &quot;on our radar&quot;, may it be our health, our children, the national dept or global warming. The Circle of Influence are those areas inside the circle of concern, that you actually can do something about now. My favorite example is the bad news on TV. Usually you can do absolutely nothing about it and you won’t do anything except saying &quot;Oh look how bad this is&quot;. Why should you pollute your mind with it and distract your focus to something you are helpless with? Can you see how futile and self-defeating this is?
  
If you are proactive you focus only on your Circle of Influence, where you actually can influence the situation. By doing so, you not only enable yourself to do something of value you also increase your Circle of Influence. If an event on the corner of your Circle of Influence is happening, you have the choice to act on it mastering the situation and so increasing your Influence, or you can move backwards which will decrease your Influence. An example would be if you lose your driving license because you can choose to do the tests again to regain it or you can choose to retreat from driving and then lowering your mobility, thus decreasing your Circle of Influence.

== Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind ==

&quot;What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us&quot; – Oliver Wendell Holmes.

This habit is based on the principle of Personal Leadership, which means you decide what you want , you lead yourself in the direction you choose. There are always two creations of everything that we do. The first of the creations is mental, in our heads and not yet materialized. This is what the second habit is about. The second creation is in the material world. This is what the third habit is about.
Beginning with the end in mind says that we need to develop a vision, a clear picture of what we choose to be and create in our lifetime. Stephen illustrates this succinctly by suggesting that you write your own funeral speech! What kind of person have you been, what did you stand for, what did you create? What were your contributions to the people you love and what difference have you made in their lives?
This is a fantastic visualization exercise that connects us deeply with ourselves and it is the perfect illustration of Begin with the End in Mind. Having such a personal vision rooted in our own values acts like a guidance-system. That is what the habit does: if you think from the end, you become like Michelangelo in the great metaphor of sculpting the statue of David out of a blog of stone, where he simply cut off the pieces of stones that were still in the way of his vision to materialize.

== Habit 3: First things first ==

&quot;First Things First

&quot;Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least&quot; – Wolfgang von Goethe.

The third habit is where you make your plan happen – where you develop an action-plan and execute it in the best way possible. While the second habit is the Leadership habit, this is the Management habit. And you do this in an effective way by setting priorities for the most important things first. Then you work on these first things until they are done. You exercise your discipline powered by your vision and goals where you know what you have to do to create this vision into reality. It is to really live your decisions, to walk your talk.
There are several tools here that can improve walking your talk. Setting the right priorities is one of the most important tasks. To set priorities, you first have to execute habit one and two of course, because otherwise – as Stephen also explains it – it happens to you that your ladder of success is leaning toward the wrong wall. If you have not taken full responsibility and clearly decided what you want in life, the priorities you set cannot have a deeper meaning to you. It just does not happen by accident. So choose proactively what you want first, then create an action-plan, set priorities and act on them.

Time Management

One of the most helpful things in execution is to effectively manage the time that we have available. Basically there are four areas where we spend our time. You can divide them into four quadrants by categorizing each task on a) Importance and b) Urgency:
 
A task is important or not important and it is urgent or not urgent:

1.	Quadrant of DEMAND – important and urgent
This is usually the core of a busy person, tasks that are important and also urgent, you just can not put them off and they have to be done now. It is important and should be well executed. 

2.	Quadrant of THE ZONE – important but not urgent
This is where you plan, improve, develop, build relationships and see opportunities. It is the basis for real success and the heart of leadership. 

3.	Quadrant of ILLUSION – not important but urgent
The quadrant of illusion is a serious problem in personal management because it deludes you into thinking that the tasks you do are important. However, they are only made urgent by demands from outside agents or by wrong judgments of yourself. In reality, they have no profound impact on your achievements at all. 

4.	Quadrant of ESCAPE – not important and not urgent
This is the area you need to avoid altogether if you are interested in success. It is the escape from what matters by distraction, because of fear, irresponsibility or fuzzy goals. 

What you need to do is move as much time as possible into The Zone (Quadrant II) and spend the rest of time in Quadrant I, the important and urgent demands. What you can do to raise awareness of your tasks is make a list of all tasks you do over the day or week. Then put all tasks honestly to the quadrant where you really spend your time doing them. Remember that it serves no purpose at all to be nice to yourself here, total honesty to yourself is always the most empowering thing you really can do. Then get rid of tasks in quadrant III and IV (not important) as soon as possible and move into Quadrant I and II. The best managers spend at least 50% of their time in Quadrant II and those are the most effective.

If you are really overwhelmed by Quadrant I and also III tasks (urgent), here is what you can do:
•	Do less: Say &quot;No&quot; more often, focus more on the most important tasks, your highest priorities, do less better! 
•	Delegate more: give tasks to people who can do it better, are more efficient, more qualified or more suitable for the task than you. 
•	Go into The Zone to create more resources for the urgent matters or lessen the urgency by better preparation and proactive planning. 

Please also take a look at my later article: A Beginners Guide to Time Management. 
These were the three habits for private victory as described by Stephen Covey. I think they are principles in fact. They are like natural laws for personal development and effectiveness. I’m looking forward to hearing your views and experiences with these three habits! What kind of successes or disappointments have you dealt with? Share them in the comments, I will also join in and answer questions of course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The second set of three habits, 4. '''think win-win''', 5. '''seek first to understand, then be understood''', and 6. '''synergize''', are the basis for '''public victory'''.

Public victory is success with others in teams and in relationships in general. They are shared victories where you help and are helped by other people.

Public victories are built on the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Private victory|private victories]] of the [[Seven Habits Study Guide/Private victory|first three habits]]. To be publicly successful in a deep or real way, you should first build the first three habits into your character. To try to do things another way is building on a false foundation and will bring about only short-term results.

== Habit 4: Think win-win ==
Many of us grow up with a competitive mindset, &quot;I win, you lose&quot;. Or, a beaten-down mindset, &quot;I give up, do whatever you want to me&quot;. Or, a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for most of the most valuable interactions we have in family and business, the most mature and effective point of view is seeking situations that benefit everyone involved. 

When we negotiate, we should seek to make deals that help everyone. In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal

== Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then be understood ==
To influence and help others, you must first actively listen to them and understand their situation and concerns. Think of the example of a doctor who gives a prescription over the telephone without getting all of the necessary information about the patient or his condition. This could lead to a serious or fatal error if the patient takes the wrong medicine. In the same way, you should be very careful when you start to give anyone advice that you understand the preoccupations and situation of that person. Even if your advice is very good, it will likely not apply to the situation.

Part of this is not just to listen passively but to listen actively and empathetically. Put yourself in the shoes of the other person. See the world from his perspective as best you can. Listen without judging.

Three main errors to avoid: 1. &quot;Hearing&quot; everything through a filter formed by your own world-view, imposing your pre-conceived ideas on everything that you hear. 2. 3.

All our life we have been frustrated when someone just won't understand. Someone who just argues for his position.  Understanding is the doorway to collaboration, friendship, and more. 
When seeking first to understand, honestly empathize with the person. Listen actively and then state their case back to them so they say &quot;yes that's exactly how I see it&quot;.  When that condition occurs, you may seek to be understood. The resulting exchange of ideas and feelings is bound to be synergistic, win-win.

The second set of three habits, 4. think win-win, 5. seek first to understand, then be understood, and 6. synergize, are the basis for public victory.

Public victory is success with others in teams and in relationships in general. They are shared victories where you help and are helped by other people.

Public victories are built on the private victories of the first three habits. To be publicly successful in a deep or real way, you should first build the first three habits into your character. To try to do things another way is building on a false foundation and will bring about only short-term results.

[edit] Habit 4: Think win-win

Many of us grow up with a competitive mindset, &quot;I win, you lose&quot;. Or, a beaten-down mindset, &quot;I give up, do whatever you want to me&quot;. Or, a mix of these and other mindsets. Each of these has its place. However, for most of the most valuable interactions we have in family and business, the most mature and effective point of view is seeking situations that benefit everyone involved.

When we negotiate, we should seek to make deals that help everyone. In cases where this is not possible, it is best to have the mindset from the outset that you will walk away from the deal.

[edit] Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then be understood

== Habit 6: Synergize ==
This habit deals with '''teamwork''' and opening yourself up emotionally to work with other people. It says that optimistic, emotionally-charged individuals who are living out the previous habits are able to work in amazing ways and come up with new alternatives together that no one of them would have come up with alone. The idea is that one plus one is three, or more, and the '''synergy''' happens when these &quot;third alternatives&quot; appear. It is a bit chaotic but fun and stimulating. Along with these there is a 3rd NOVEL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a world consumed with hatred, war, cheating, corruption, etc., one of the bible's greatest contributions to the world is the concept that God loves us.  The Bible give us wisdom about the meaning of love: the love of God for us and the love that we are called to share with others in order to make the world a better place.  Please consider these selections when thinking about love.


PSALM 139:7-8 offers us a glimpse of just how far God's love will go, even past the portal of death: &quot;Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?  If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths of [sheol], you are there.&quot;

The universality of God's love, as it originates in Abraham, has its roots in GENESIS 12:3 &quot;I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&quot;

The reach of God's love is found in PSALM 139:7-8 &quot;Where can I go from your spirit?  Or where can I flee from your presence?  If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in She'ol, you are there.&quot;

God's patience, expressed in love can be found in PSALM 145:8-10 &quot;The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.  The Lord is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has made.  All your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord, and all your faithful shall bless you.&quot;

God's gift of love, to all, is expressed in JOEL 2:28 &quot;I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.&quot;

Jesus explains the love of God in a way that is a challenge to many North Americans, in MATTHEW 5:43-46, &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.  For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?&quot;

Jesus tells a short story about God's love in LUKE 15:4 &quot;Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?  When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.  And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'&quot;

Paul gives us a beautiful image of love in 1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-8 &quot;Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude.  It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using tutor applications, the computer or software possesses all of the information and controls the learning environment.

Now that we've created our simple person, it's time to give him somewhere to go.  In this tutorial we'll create a mountain range using a few simple, and handy tools.

==Creating a simple plane==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SimplePlane.png|right]]
First we need a clean area to work with.
*Start off with a new project, using ''File &amp;rarr; New'', or hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|N}}.  If you have a default cube or plane just delete them now (select them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}).

Our first step is to create a large grid plane that we'll use for the ground and grow our mountains out of.
* Press{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} to enter top view.  This way our grid plane will be lying flat when we create it.
* Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|C}}. This sets the 3D cursor to (0,0,0) which will be the center of the grid we will add (or use - {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|S}} &amp;rarr; ''Cursor to Center'').
* Now add the grid with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|A}} &amp;rarr; ''Mesh'' &amp;rarr; ''Grid''.  This will be our canvas.
* Now add more vertices to the grid.  In the bottom of the toolbox window, change the number of X and Y subdivisions somewhere from 15 to 20.
* Change to Edit Mode using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}
* Scale the grid plane up by about 15
: First put the mouse close to the center of the grid plane and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Skey}} and drag the cursor away and watch the numbers in the bottom left of the 3D View. Hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}} while dragging to increment by 0.1 for a more precise measurement. Alternatively, to enter the exact amount yourself, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Skey}}, then simply type '''15''' and hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}.
* In the Tool Shelf at left, under ''Mesh Tools'' hit the ''Subdivide'' button 4 times. Alternatively, in the 3D View window you can press {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} to open the Special Menu and select ''Subdivide''.  You can also just hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}, because ''Subdivide'' is the first option in the Special Menu.
'''Noob Note:''' Using subdivision in edit mode will actually increase (double at least each time) the number of vertices. This does does not match to the screen shots provided in here. So you may want to do this only at the end of your modelling process.

==First mountain== 

Now that we have the ground, it's time to start growing our mountains.
* Make sure you have nothing selected ('''AKEY''').
* Select a random vertex with '''RMB'''. I usually start at the one that is 4 down from the top and 4 in from the left (the 4th vertex if you count the edges).
* Change to the side view with '''NUM3'''.
[[Image:Blender-Noob-to-Pro Proportional Menu.png|right]]
* Press '''O''' to change to proportional edit mode or use the button which shows a grey ring on the header of the 3D View. The button will change its color to blue. You can also use '''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Transform&amp;rarr;Proportional Edit'' (By default this button is located just below the 3D view).
* Once you've turned proportional edit mode on, another button appears to its right, the falloff button. Select Smooth Falloff here. Alternatively you can use the menu on the header of the 3D View (''Mesh &amp;rarr; Proportional Falloff &amp;rarr; Smooth'') or, using '''SHIFT + OKEY''' will cycle through all of the different falloff types while using the Proportional editing tool.
* Press '''G''' to grab the vertex. We should now have a circle surrounding the vertex, this is our ''radius of influence''. Basically any vertices inside this circle will be affected by any changes to the vertex itself.

'''Noob Note:''' If you're having trouble seeing or changing the radius of influence, try saving your scene and restarting Blender.

* Use the '''Mouse Wheel''' or '''PAGE_UPKEY''' and '''PAGE_DOWNKEY''' to adjust the radius of influence to include just over 2 vertices on each side of our selected vertex. (Depending on your version of Blender, you may need to use '''ALT + NUM+/ PAGE_UPKEY''' and '''ALT + NUM-/ PAGE_DOWNKEY''' and may need to hold down the '''LMB''' while using the '''Mouse Wheel''' to adjust the radius of the influence.On Mac, hold the &quot;fnKey&quot; down and hit &quot;page-up&quot; or &quot;page-down&quot;). In 2.41 you must 'grab' the vertex first - only then can you alter the sphere of influence (in my version, 2.42a, the 3D cursor had to be snapped to the selection before the wheel appeared).

'''Noob Note:''' To change the radius on a Macbook press &quot;fn&quot;+ up/down. OSX uses function + arrow keys as replacements for &quot;home&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, &quot;page up&quot; and &quot;page down&quot; keys.

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-FirstMountain.png|right]]
* Move the vertex up about 8 units on the Z-Axis. Do this by dragging the cursor up a little, and press the '''MMB'''; this should restrain the movements along the Z-axis. Now use '''CTRL''' to move it precisely. Alternatively you can use '''ZKEY''' to restrain movements to the Z-Axis and type '''8''' and hit '''ENTER'''. In older versions of Blender you may need to hit the '''NKEY''' before typing the number 8.

Congratulations, we just created our first mountain. Now it's time to see what other things we can accomplish with the proportional editing tool.

{{Clear}}

==Peaks vs. hills==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-Sharpfalloff.png|right]]
The 2.37 and onward releases offer at least 6 types and 2 modes of proportional editing. The previous release only has 2 of these types: Smooth and Sharp Falloff. We'll take a look at the difference between these two now.
* Change to top view again with '''NUM7'''. You'll notice that now your &quot;mountain&quot; looks like a few differently shaded squares in the grid; you're looking down on shaded tiles, but in the Z axis, they're all still perfectly aligned with the original grid.
* Select another vertex away from the first. Let's say 4 from the bottom 4 from the right (counting the vertices on the edges).
* Change back to the side view with '''NUM3'''
* Select Sharp Falloff from the menu on the bar of the 3D View. Alternatively, using '''SHIFT+OKEY''' will switch from one to the next of the 6 proportional editing modes while using the Proportional editing tool.
* As before, move the vertex up 8 units on the Z-Axis (''Note: The radius of influence will still be the same size as when we last used it'').
** '''GKEY'''
** '''ZKEY'''
** Type '''8''' and hit '''ENTER'''
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SharpVsSmoothFalloff.png|right]]
Now we can see the differences between the sharp and smooth falloff. The same number of vertices are affected in both cases; only the degree to which they are affected is different.

The different proportional editing modes can be selected from the box immediately to the left of the proportional editing type box. The mode box contains three options: Off, On, and Connected. &quot;Off&quot; means that proportional editing will not be used. &quot;Connected&quot; means that only vertices linked to the selected vertices will be affected by the radius of influence. &quot;On&quot; means that all vertices will be affected.

==Shaping the world==

[[Image:Blender_proportional_smooth_before_rotation.jpg|300px|right]]
Now that we've created a couple of Mountains, it's time to see how we can use proportional editing to shape them.
* First make sure we're in side view ('''NUM3''').
* Then on the smooth falloff mountain, the first one we created, select the vertex that is immediately down and left from the topmost point.
* Press '''RKEY''' to rotate, scroll the '''MMB''' to change effective radius so it includes other points. Your screen should look like the photo to the right.
You can see the size of the proportional editing circle, and that there is only one vertex on the mountainside selected.

* Next hold '''CTRL''' and rotate everything by -90. Alternatively, use '''RKEY''', '''NKEY''', and type '''-90''' and press '''ENTER'''. Your mountain should now look like this:


'''Noob note:''' be careful about the range of affected vertices. If the range is too small, then rotating will affect just the selected vertex. If the range is too large, it will rotate everything together. You can adjust the range by using the scroll wheel on the mouse.


{{Clear}}


[[Image:Blender_proportional_smooth_after_rotation.jpg|300px|right]]
Notice that the vertex itself did not move; since it is at the center of the circle it had no effect.  The adjoining vertices within the edit circle were rotated around it in decreasing amounts the further from the center they are.  Try doing it again with a larger proportional editing circle.
Feel free to play around with scaling or rotating from different view points (don't forget that you can also use '''GKEY''' to move vertices vertically or horizontally).


Try viewing your world from top view while rotating with a large effective radius.  You will see the nearby vertices move close to the full amount while vertices further away move less.

==Smoothing things out==
[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-RoundedMtns.png|right]]
Now that we have a couple of budding mountains, you probably think they look kind of choppy. Sure they would be good if we were making an 8-bit console game, but we're working with 3D here, we want things to look sharper (or maybe smoother) than that. There are a couple of approaches to this. The first is to use more vertices when we create our plane. And I won't lie, it works. But it's also a HUGE resource hog. It would take your home computer hours of work just to keep things updated, let alone run it. So instead, we fake it. The easiest way to do this is to turn on ''SubSurfaces'' (we saw this in [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 1|Detailing Your Simple Person 1]].) For our purposes, let's set the subdivision (''Levels'') to 2. Also, ensure our SubSurf algorithm is set to ''Catmull-Clark'' (this is the default setting).

Now, you'll notice that with SubSurf on, we lose a lot of hard edges that we had, essentially we have no sharp corners any more.  I don't know about you, but to me that doesn't make for a very interesting mountain range. So to restore our corners, we are going to use ''Weighted Creases for Subsurfs''.
* First turn off proportional editing with the '''OKEY''' , and ensure we're in side view with '''NUM3'''
**''Noob note: That means, the letter O key, not the zero key.  Also, NUM3 means &quot;3 ''on the numeric keypad,&quot;'' not on the top row of the keyboard.''
* Next, while still in edit mode, change to ''Edge Select'' mode with '''CTRL+TAB''' and select ''Edges''.  Alternatively press ''Edge Select Mode'' button at the bottom of the object window.
* In the Tool Shelf at left, select the Options tab, then under Edge Select Mode, choose Tag Crease.
* On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the two edges on the right. ''(see image below)''[[Image:Blender3DNoobtoPro-SharpMtnCreasing.PNG|right]]
* Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' or '''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Edit &amp;rarr; Edges &amp;rarr; Crease SubSurf'', then move the mouse away from the edge until the edge ''Crease'' reads 1.000 in the 3D viewport header. If moving the cursor there seems to be impossible, just hit 1 and enter.
As you move the cursor away from the edge you will notice two things. The first is that the edge becomes thicker as we move from it; this is showing how much of a crease we have (with ''Draw Creases'' turned on).  The second is that you will notice the subsurfed mesh moving closer to the edge as the sharpness increases.

==Naturalness==

Press '''CTRL+TAB''' and select vertices. Then go into front view '''NUM1'''. Select the second vertex from the top in the centre of our Sharp Falloff mountain, then go into side view '''NUM3'''. Push '''GKEY''' and drag the vertex inwards, not too far or your mountain will come out of itself on the other side. Just bring it in enough to make a small indent.

Then grab the top vertex and pull it down a small amount.
You will notice that there is a small &quot;crunch&quot; in your mountain.

Don't forget to select all, press '''WKey''' and hit the '''shade smooth''' button to smooth everything out.

OK, so your mountains are starting to shape up.  But they still look a bit too neat.  You could spend time moving each individual vertex but the chances are your model will still lack the natural feel.  What we need is some chaos.  Thankfully this is quite easy to accomplish.  Firstly select the vertices that make up your mountains, all of them and a few around the base (box and circle select will make this easier).  Select a few vertices between the mountains too.  Next we use something called fractals.  Fractals are chaotically (i.e. randomly) generated variables.  In short you can use these variables to give your mountains a &quot;wobbly&quot; look.  

[[File:Fractal.xcf|thumb|Fractal option in 2.6.x]]
In the Tools tab of the Tool Shelf, press Subdivide (under Mesh Tools), then look at the Subdivide submenu below. The value in the Fractal box is the strength of the fractal.  1 is very low and will barely change your model.  100 is very high and will twist your models into very odd shapes indeed.  Have a play with different values until you find one that you like.  Around about 15-30 should do it.  Hit OK and presto, your mountains have been transformed from clinical neatness, to lumpy chaos.


* If you make too many fractals, your computer will slow down. However, the more fractal you add, the more bumpy and realistic it looks!

''Noob Note: Repeatedly using the fractal tool seems to rapidly multiply the amount of vertices on your canvas.  I suggest using the tool once, and if the result isn't satisfying, undo the result ('''CTRL + Z''') and try it again with a different fractal strength.  Even after undo, your selected vertices remain selected.''

''Noob Note #2: If you have a new enough version of Blender (2.49 and up definitely has it, not sure about lower versions), there is a setting called Random in the Proportional Editing settings. Using this with a high radius may give a desired result for you without adding more mesh.''

== Adding your guy with the hat ==
If you changed to a new layer--
press ('''SHIFT''') select the layer with your guy on it or ('''SHIFT + 1'''). This will display both layers.  If you would like to move the landscape from the second layer to the first then with the landscape selected, press ('''M'''), and select the layer(s) you would like it on.
note- make sure you're in object mode.
If you started a new project--
To insert your guy with a hat, you can simply go to '''file''' &gt; '''append or link'''(shift+F1). In version 2.76, these are separate options right from the start, so you'll want to choose '''Append'''.
* Then select the file from the previous tutorial.  
* You will then see a list of objects you can insert or ‘append’. 
* First go into the 'Object' folder. Unless you renamed him/her, your person will probably be named “cube.” Select it. 
* Make sure that 'Append' button is pressed; otherwise you will not be able to scale or translate, or edit your model at all. (The 'Link' button will link a copy of your object into the current scene, and will update any changes when you reload the file. Unfortunately, this includes location and size, so we will not use it right now.)
* Press 'Load Library' to place your guy into the mountain scene. Please note, the ''Load Library'' button is top right. Confusingly, there is some text bottom left that says ''Load Library'' as well, but isn't clickable. 
* Repeat the process to get the hat (probably named “circle”).  To reset the parental relationship, see the instructions at the end of the [[../Putting Hat on Person/]] tutorial.  To scale them to the appropriate size, go to object mode by pressing '''TAB''' (unless of course you are already there).  Select the object you want to resize, then press the '''SKEY''' and use the cursor to scale as you see fit.  To undo any mistakes, use '''CTRL+Z'''.

'''Noob Note:''' To import the file once you have the list select the item, i.e. cube, and in the bottom right select &quot;Active Layer&quot; that will append it to your current proj when you click &quot;Load Library&quot; your work should be visible now.

'''Noob Note:''' Multiple items may be appended simultaneously. For instance: both 'cube' and 'circle' objects can be ''appended'' at the same time by highlighting both object names within the file browser by means of a RMB Click. RMB on object again to deselect.

&lt;noinclude&gt;This page is broken, minimal required information is missing.&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This tutorial shows you how to use displacement mapping to make a simple environment.

# Make a grid. (Add/Mesh/Grid) 32x32 will do just fine.  Be sure to create a Grid instead of a Plane, or you'll end up with just a flat plane!  This is because a Plane only has four vertices to manipulate - one for each corner - while a Grid has many, many more.  A 32x32 Grid, for example, would have over 1000 vertices.  The more vertices there are to manipulate, the more effect displacement mapping will have on the finished product.
# Set it smooth. (Editing/Link and Materials/Set Smooth)
# Make a new material for it. (Shading/Material/Add New)
# Make a new texture for the material. (Shading/Texture/Add New)
# Go to Shading/Texture Buttons. You can see your newly created texture there now.
# Change Texture Type to Clouds.
# Change the name of the texture to be more descriptive. For example GroundDisp or something similar.
# Go back to Shading/Material buttons. You can see our cloud texture applied now, but it's not applied correctly yet.  Let's fix this next.
# Go to Shading/Map To. This defines how the selected texture is mapped on our material. Uncheck Col, check Disp on, and set the Disp slider to a value like 0.200
# Set camera and a few lights to the scene.  (This is already done as part of the default scene in recent versions of Blender, such as 2.49)
# Render.

'''Noob Note''' It looks like from version 2.70 there is no shading as a main tool but rather as a subtool for Material, so in version 2.70 to get the effect described in here you have to check third checkbox in Texture&gt;Influence&gt;Geometry and adjust the slider

:: Several individuals, when working through this tutorial, had trouble getting anything more than a flat plane.  A few solutions were proposed (most are still visible on the Talk page), and while each worked in its own way, the vast majority of the time the problem stemmed from creating a Plane instead of a Grid.  Be sure to follow each step very carefully to ensure you don't miss anything or do a step incorrectly.

[[Image:Ground1.jpg]]

You can tweak the environment easily by changing Nor value in the Shading/Map To. This defines how strongly the displacement texture affects the material.

You could also add subsurfing to the ground area to get smoother results. Also feel free to tweak the texture and try out different alternatives.

Once your mountain looks good, try adding some Mist.

# Select the &quot;Mist&quot; button on the &quot;Mist/Stars/Physics&quot; Tab among the World buttons
# Add a Cloud Texture to the World and make it blend from white to gray

The end result is something like this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stephen Covey outlines several concepts before describing the &quot;Seven Habits&quot; in detail.

== Character vs. personality ethic ==
The author describes the difference between what he describes as the '''personality ethic''' and the '''character ethic'''. The character ethic is the idea that a person advances in basis of their character. This was culturally the main idea expressed in the US up until about WWI, when popular literature began to focus more on short-cuts and easy ways to manipulate situations or to get what you want. Character ethic depends on deep changes within each of us, while the personality ethic falls back on methods or techniques. The personality ethic does not challenge us; neither does it bring about deep changes within us. Phrases characteristic of the personality ethic are '''think positive''' and '''believe in yourself'''.

Cover
Paradigms are the mental maps that we use to describe the world around us. They are the lens that each of us uses to understand everyone and everything. The key of a paradigm isn't as much in the true nature of a thing as much as our perception of the thing.
 
Covey uses the example of a person trying to find his way through Chicago with a map of Detroit. No matter how hard he tries, he will never be successful. In the same way, when we have erroneous ideas of what something is like, we are destined to fail in dealing with whatever it is. We should work to have correct and healthy understandings of the world around us.

A paradigm shift is when we abandon an incorrect paradigm for a correct one. Covey describes how once he was frustrated in the subway to see the very bad behavior of a man's children, but when he found out that they were coming from the hospital where the mother had just died an hour before, his perspective changed completely. 

The key to maintain correct paradigms is to keep an open mind and realize that however much we see, there is always more to the picture.

== Principles ==
Principles are time experimented values that have worked through the ages regardless of social context.  Values such as &quot;seek first to understand, then to be understood&quot; or &quot;the golden rule: do unto others what you would have done unto you&quot; are the values that effective people of all ages have embraced.  They are not quick fixes, not something that you learn and execute over night.  They are values that you have to work on and master in order to become effective.

== Step-by-step development ==

== Raising our level of thinking ==

== Dependence &gt;&gt; Independence &gt;&gt; Interdependence ==
The habits are designed, when you put them in practice, to help you mature as a person. This process of maturing is described below:

:'''Dependence &gt;&gt; Independence &gt;&gt; Interdependence'''

We all start out life as babies completely '''dependent''' on our parents or other person to take care of us. This is a state of weakness and powerlessness.

As we grow up we work to become '''independent''', moving out of our parent's home, earning money for ourselves, etc. A person at this level is able to do things for himself and does not need anyone else to survive. 

The greatest human achievements come from people working at the third level, '''interdependence'''. This is when people work together to achieve a common goal, and is the level of maturity of many people in a mature society or organization. This is how mankind has achieved things together that no single person could do alone. Interdependence is the state of human development of greatest maturity and power.

As we develop our character as people, we grow in each of the seven areas described by the seven habits. In this process we move up the chart from dependence to independence to interdependence.

== Efficiency vs. Effectiveness ==
You can be efficient with things but not people.  With people you must be effective.

== Production vs. Production Capacity ==
Production is referred to as a useful product (either tangible or intangible) that is being produced.  Production Capacity is the process or method in which that product is being produced.  The product is usually a result that is either produced continually or on a regular basis thereby introducing the necessity of keeping P (Production) and PC (Production Capacity) in balance.  True effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced and the producing asset or capacity to produce.

== Financial, economic, and human wealth ==

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Space and time are two elements that reflect one another. It is important to understand how the two work in terms of visual rhetoric. Space as an element in visual rhetoric is often derived from narrative framing devices. Such a narrative is one that employs the evolution of time. For example, comics are a narrative through the evolution of time, but it is also being told spatially in the positioning of linear boxes and positioning of the subjects within the boxes.

== Static vs. Dynamic Visuals ==
In a static two-dimensional image, time exists only within the mind of the reader. In comic books, photo albums, images, and similar mediums, readers create an order within the content of the image, creating not only a coherent narrative, but also a sense of the passage of time. This task is performed with a large reliance upon shared cultural assumptions about how a page is read, be it left to right or down to up and so on. For purposes of visual rhetoric, the term time comes to mean an indefinite and continuous duration in which events succeed one another. Time can exist in all types of visual images.

=== Photo Albums ===
Compiling photo albums is an example of how visual rhetoric is a narrative through space. The layout and design of images on each page helps convey the intended feeling of how a person felt at one particular time and attributes to how the overall story is perceived. How well or how poorly completed the layout and design are can shape the impact of the message. 

To further elaborate, photo albums are a preservation of an event or time in place. Memories are made in the brain of the individual being and photo albums are a way to utilize space in a capacity separate from the self. It is important to note that fermunda cheese is really gross with this visual narrative form of communication, the interpretation of certain events in time vary from viewer to viewer. The events that occurred in the images will naturally evoke a different feeling for the subject than it will for the viewer looking in from the outside. The individual viewer’s feelings are based on his or her own experiences through the times in their lives and the places they have been. These places are spaces where events have occurred, which evidently shows that time and space do indeed reflect one another.

=== Film &amp; Video ===
[[File:Film_Reel_Series_by_Bubbels.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|A film reel.]]
Static images are not the only forms of visual rhetoric that utilize time and space. Time within dynamic visuals like film and video in motion-based mediums, is controlled less by the viewer. Time passes before the viewer with the only thinking taking place when scenes change and they must make a connection between their times and places. The viewer doesn't assemble the narrative, but only observes it. A moment on the motion picture screen is only a moment, while a moment on a page is, to the audience viewing it, eternal. While one may read beyond one section of an image, the previous one is still there and still visible. A viewer sees what they choose to see, not only what they are meant to see. Thus, it is possible to view multiple moments at once, from multiple perspectives, and yet still assemble them into a coherent whole. This is an aspect of the viewing of images that works at a level far beyond day-to-day human perception, which is always from a single perspective.

=== Theatrical Productions ===
Like film and video, plays and other theatrical productions are narrative stories told in a space bound by a stage surface. Plays are distinguished from motion pictures through time and space. Plays are a live event happening right in front of the viewer in real-time. Motion pictures are like photo albums in that it is more two-dimensional than three-dimensional. In many cases, theatrical performances transform the audience from the present day into another era. The mentality of the audience is not only affected by the time period of the play, but also by the placement of the actors and as well as the distance between the viewer and the stage. The space between the viewer and the story being told separates reality from fiction, or in some plays, non-fiction.

== Linear vs. Nonlinear Visuals ==
As well as seeing a single perspective, humans also usually view reality in a strictly linear fashion, moment to moment. Viewers will usually assemble an image into a linear narrative, but they can also do it non-linearly if they wish to. Some visuals lend themselves to non-linear readings, as they have no coherent order outside from the overall view they present, while others will only make sense in a straightforward order. The viewer does more work when reading non-linearly, as it is a different way of experiencing reality than we are accustomed to. Of course, the brain is thought to work in a largely non-linear manner, but our senses do not.

=== Comics ===
This idea of viewing reality in a linear fashion can be depicted in comic strips. Comics flow in a linear fashion telling a story through images and text. Many people do not realize that by reading and viewing comic strips they become a part of visual rhetoric. Each comic is compiled of individual boxes displaying images and when put together they go through time to get to an ending, or tell the story. Although they, unlike film and video, are still images, the idea of time is still depicted.

Some aspects of this reading are more intuitive, as the eye will naturally spend more time on a larger image or better focused object. If something is read first, it is read as first in the series of events assembled by the reader. Also, larger segments of the image seem to last longer as they take longer to read. Thus, when it comes to the reading of static images, space becomes equal to time.

== Conclusion ==
We can now see how elements from a variety of mediums can alter the viewers' perceptions by utilizing time and space. Static and dynamic visuals differ in how a viewer absorbs the content. The message that comes from dynamic visuals is fed to the audience more passively than static visuals. In order to understand static visuals, individuals need to be more active in analyzing its spatial components. While humans experience time linearly, media can show subjects to us in a non-linear fashion, silently altering perceptual time and space.

The current formatting makes the introduction 80% wide, leaving a very narrow strip for the TOC; (at the common width of 800 pixels or so) the TOC is hard to read, and the introduction is full of empty space.  I'm going to narrow the introduction somewhat, but it'll look differently broken on various browsers. --[[User:132.206.150.195|132.206.150.195]] 20:40, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I was hoping to add some more text and possibly relevant pictures to the introduction, I just have not gotten to it yet, nor apparently has anyone else. I do however think that the narrowing of the intro box did some good. I'm open to other options too. I like the intro (or at least the idea of an intro) on the main page, and the table of contents is long, but I think it is necessary. If there are any style/formatting experts out there your input would be greatly appreciated. Right now I seem to be the only one doing any major work on this book, which is fine by me for now, but this also means every one has to deal with my god-awful formatting and design style. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 03:49, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)

&lt;!-- according to Google, &quot;cookie sheet&quot; is over 38 times as popular as baking tray --&gt;
[[Image:Oven Tray.jpg|thumb|right|cookie sheet]]

A '''cookie sheet''', sometimes called an '''oven tray''' or '''baking sheet''', is used to hold uncooked food items (typically [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]) while [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] within an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]. If it has sides, they are very low, to allow fast removal of cookies to a cooling rack. Unlike a typical [[Cookbook:Pizza Pan|pizza pan]], an oven tray is rectangular and usually does not have any holes.

Baking sheets are available in non-stick materials, but these tend to overbrown cookies on the bottom before thoroughly cooking them.  To avoid this, professional bakers use more evenly conductive materials, such as heavy-gauge stainless steel, covered with a sheet of [[Wikipedia:Parchment Paper|parchment paper]] or a silicone baking mat to provide a non-stick effect without altering the sheet's effectiveness.

Many consumer alternatives, such as insulated aerobake sheets, are also available, which will cook more slowly but with similar effectiveness.

A baking sheet should be accompanied by a [[Cookbook:cooling rack|cooling rack]] of similar size which the baked goods can be quickly removed to when they are done cooking.</text>

==Name &quot;Ára&quot;==
I doubt that this name is intended to be the name for the long carrier. I think it's rather the name of a specific vowel tengwa. [[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 22:40, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I think it will be ok to bementioned with a question mark

==Témar arrangement==
I see no reason why the témar order should be changed. Is there any. Helios de Rosario Martínez hypothesis about the original Elvish témar values is very convincing and suggests that the reported order is the original one (see [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfscript/message/2340 a translation of his hypothesis]). [[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 22:40, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:This 'reconstructed' arrangement is also based on the word 'patakar' (p-t-k), which is not **'tapakar'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Expand}}
'''Ajax''' or &quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML&quot; is a phrase that was coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garret of [http://www.adaptivepath.com Adaptive Path] in his [http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php introductory article] on the subject.  (For a complete definition of the item, please see the Wikipedia [[w:Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] entry.)

The purpose of this guide is to show how to [http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/chapter1.html unobtrusively] add Ajax into your web application in such a way that your site will continue to function even when [[JavaScript]] is not enabled.  Through intelligently hooking JavaScript triggers to certain elements in your markup, you can successfully add a new layer of interactivity to your site without sacrificing backwards compatibility with browsers which do not support Ajax. In this way, you can enhance your site without cutting off users that choose to not enable JavaScript because of their security concerns (warranted or not) or due to [http://www.quirksmode.org browser quirks]. 

There are several web sites already dedicated to promoting (or denouncing) the use of Ajax.  Therefore, wherever possible, an attempt will be made to list these resources without bias.  Although I fully invite anyone to add to this document, because of intellectual property and copyright reasons, it's just impractical to get the consent of everyone to include their content.  Besides, these sites often showcase the very concept that they are attempting to describe.

When a concept is relative to Ajax it should be described here, but the definitive work should be relegated to other Wikibooks or websites where that concept has already been (or should be) fleshed out.  

In light of this, there are several concepts with which you should become familiar if you want to work with Ajax.  Although, not all of them are expressly required to cut and paste in some sample code, for '''hacking''' out your own code, the following are recommended.

*JavaScript 
**[[JavaScript|Wikibook:JavaScript]] , especially [[JavaScript/XMLHttpRequest]]
**[[Wikipedia:JavaScript]]
*XHTML
**[[Wikipedia:XHTML]]
*XML 
**[[XML|Wikibooks:XML]]
**[[Wikipedia:XML]]
*Document Object Model 
**[[Wikipedia:Document Object Model]]
*Cascading Style Sheets 
**[[CSS Programming|Wikibooks:CSS Programming]]
**[[Wikipedia:Cascading Style Sheets]]
*XSLT
**[[Wikipedia:XSLT]]

To make programming in Ajax easier, web developers may make use of a JavaScript [http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/ajax.html library for Ajax]. These JavaScript libraries allow the common problems of browser support for certain required objects to be abstracted, and mean that the developer can get on with the task of writing their application.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I must admit that this book is for fairly selfish reasons.  I've very excited about AJAX, however, roaming the Web and Googling for articles and samples is tedious.  Lots of people have made lists of examples, and there are several how-to's and discussions out there, but many of those are all singular efforts and it makes sense to have someplace that a guide can be written via a colaborative effort.  

Even though I've been working on Web Sites for 8 years now, there are tons and tons of things I don't know.  And the nice thing about these Wiki's is that several minds can come together and make a living book explaining the concepts and fleshing out ideas that can stay fresh with the times.

Well, I would like to spend more time on this right now, but my wife is having contractions :)

==AJAX or Ajax?==
Would you have any major objections to moving the page to [[Programming:Ajax]]?  I have a request for a page move over at [[Wikipedia:Talk:AJAX|Wikipedia]]; in both cases, the original author coined the term using the &quot;Ajax&quot; capitalization, not the &quot;AJAX&quot; one.  It just seems right to respect that use, but of course, I could be wrong! [[User:Delfuego|Jason]] 16:27, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

: Before deciding on a new name, it might be worth reading [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:33, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:: OK, I don't understand -- the policy doesn't have anything to say about this particular page move question.  The page's name (both the original and the suggested rename) respects the Wikibooks way of naming pages; I'm merely suggesting that we rename the technology-specific portion of the page title to respect the original name of the technology, and not perpetuate the all-caps mistake that's made its way here.  If I'm missing something, please let me know! [[User:Delfuego|Jason]] 23:40, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Sorry. That was a bit terse. What I was implying is that this page still follows the old &quot;bookshelf convention&quot; where the &quot;Programming&quot; part implies it's on the programming bookshelf. The new convention is that a colon (or a slash) should only delimit subpages in a book, not books in a bookshelf. Just rename it to [[Programming Ajax]] or [[Ajax Programming]] instead. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

==major criticism==
As I see it:
#The discussion of the Quenya mode does not belong here, since we don't know anything about explicitly second age Quenya writing.
#The mode of Beleriand belongs here, since the mode of Beleriand we know dates from the Second Age only in spite of its name.
#A discussion of the Númenorean mode fragments of DTS 50 belongs here along with the question whether it may be the origin of the attested 'general use'.
#In a related issue, a discussion of Sauron's tengwar use belongs here.
[[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 23:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:#The NCP mentions a Numenorean Quenya mode where the use of unutixi is demonstrated, when the a-tehta is not used. In order to discuss this mode here, I thought nice to present it in a theoretical table of the intermediate values. Appendix E for example says that Aze became Are and then Esse, but doesn't say about the (brief) period when the letter was Are, before becoming Esse. We also should show the period when Noldo was not ng- or n-, but ñ-. It's also a good place to show that ndy &gt; ny and that maybe these changes were the cause that Tyelpetema began to be not useful. Do you think it should go to the First Age?
:#I disagree. Since the Mode of Beleriand originates from the First Age, I think it proper to go there, despite the fact it might wrongly describe Second Age elements. Since we don't have First Age samples, the gap must be filled with the 'Moria mode'
:#I agree. As for the Numenorean mode, I think you are more qualified, so you can proceed if it's not much trouble.

::#We can't just fill in the gap of the Second Age with all the stuff we don't know where to put. We don't know when these developments took place. And with respect to the a-tehta being left away, this was not only done by the Númenoreans.
::#We don't know anything at all about First Age mode of Beleriand. We'd lie if we'd pretend we did. [[User:J. 'mach' wust|J. 'mach' wust]] 18:27, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Biscuits''' are a type of quickbread sometimes served with [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]] or [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]], especially for an informal or casual meal. Sometimes biscuits are served with [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]]. Often biscuits are served with [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]]. Eaters typically apply [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] to their biscuits. For breakfast, an eater might add a [[Cookbook:Fried Eggs|fried egg]], fried [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] or [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]. 

Biscuits come in two forms, cut and dropped. Cut biscuits use a fairly normal dough that is [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolled]] out and cut with a circular [[Cookbook:Cookie Cutter|cookie cutter]]. Drop biscuits use a somewhat more liquid dough that is dropped onto a [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] with a spoon.

==Procedure==
#Mix the dry ingredients.
#Cut (mix) in the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], preferably as you would for an [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|apple crisp]] or traditional pie crust.
#Add the milk, mixing only as needed to wet the dough or batter.
#If doing drop biscuits, you'll plop the batter by spoonfuls (large spoonfuls) onto the cookie sheet. Otherwise, for cut biscuits:
##Give the dough a quick [[Cookbook:Knead|knead]].
##Roll the dough out to 1/2 [[Cookbook:Inch|&quot;]], using flour as needed to avoid sticking.
##Cut circles with a 2.5&quot; cookie cutter, or carve hexagons (a honeycomb pattern) with a knife.
#Space the biscuits 1&quot; apart on the cookie sheet.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] 10 to 12 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperatures|450°F]] [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], stopping when lightly browned on top.
#Serve hot.

[[Image:CookbookEggrollTongs.jpg|thumb|right|192px|Tongs removing an [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] from very hot oil]]

'''Tongs''' are used to easily grasp and transfer food.

Cooking and serving tongs consist of shaped &quot;jaws&quot; attached to a pair of long handles equipped with a spring to open or 'release' them.  The 'scissor' style with looped handles and smaller loops on the 'food' end is also popular.

The jaws or ends can have many shapes, ranging from a simple open loop on a bent-rod utensil shown here to gently scalloped and enclosed to grasp food without tearing or breaking the crust.  A good pair will be easy to hold and have very little 'flex' when grasping things like chicken breasts or 6-8 ounce (170-130 g) steaks.  Cheaper tongs will have very little 'hold' on anything of substance and are likely to create more problems than they solve.  Avoid buying anything that cannot easily pick up and manipulate another copy of itself in the store.  

They are commonly made from pressed steel sheet metal, steel rods or plastic. They offer mild protection from hot food mainly from the distance they provide from the cooking and can help a lot in preparing and serving a meal.

Tongs intended for handling food that is heavy or very hot can be made of steel rods, with a rubber-coated scissors-like handle for better control. Stronger versions of the pressed-steel tongs have proven very useful and adept in handling heavier and more cumbersome foods.</text>

[[Image:Sieve.jpg|thumb|right|A sieve]]

A '''sieve''' (also known as a '''strainer''') is a kitchen utensil used to separate liquids or fine dry foods (like flour) from larger particles. It can also be used to break up lumps in dry ingredients (like cocoa powder) or to purée cooked foods by passing them through the sieve. Modern sieves are usually made from fine stainless steel mesh that has been pressed into a hemispherical shape, and then embedded in a plastic or steel carrier with a handle.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
===The Board and Pieces===

The board is the shape of a six point star, with holes for possible moves of the pieces, typically marbles or pegs.  The center of the board forms a hexagon with five holes along each side. Each point forms a triangle with ten (10) holes in four rows;  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.  The points are typically different colors, corresponding to the colors of the pieces.

=== The Object===
The object of the game is to be the first to get all of your pieces from the point in front of you across the board, and completely into the point on the opposite side.

===Starting===
2, 3, 4, or 6 players can play a game. Each player chooses the color of his or her pieces and fills one of the points of the star with his or her pieces as follows:
Two (2) players begin at the opposite ends of the star, across from each other.
Three (3) players set up occupying every other point.
Four (4) players set up with two on one side, across from the other two players.

Players typically agree on the method to determine who plays first, and second.  (The roll of a die, coin tosses, youngest, etc.)  Play usually follows a clockwise or counter-clockwise order. 
 
===Play===
On a player's turn they must move only one piece.  The move may consist of moving one piece into the adjacent empty hole, the piece may jump over one adjacent piece into a empty hole, or can make two or more multiple jumps.  The player can jump over their own pieces, or over the pieces of any of the other players. Each jump in a string of multiple jumps must jump only one adjacent piece landing in an empty hole.  A piece cannot jump over two or more pieces in a line, but a piece can jump zig-zag over two or more pieces. 

Except for the holes along the edges, all (other) holes have six holes around them, corresponding to the direction of the next move or jump.

[[Image:Chinese checkers inicio.png|thumb|Green shows the two most common opening moves in Chinese Checkers; Red shows the next two more common moves.]]
===Opening Moves===
Knowledge of openings is very important to playing Chinese Checkers well -- similar to chess. In play among experienced players there are only a few openings that are commonly seen. Although there are 14 possible first moves (7 if you eliminate symmetrical moves for the first player), experienced players play only two. 


By far the most common first move is to move one of the two marbles on either end of front row of the four forward marbles one space forward and towards the center (as illustrated by green in the picture). This is the first move of the two most common openings the &quot;sidewinder&quot; and &quot;cross caterpillar&quot;, there are many other less common openings.

A much less common first move sometimes played by advanced players is to move one of the marbles in the front row one space forward and away from the centerline (the red marbles in the picture nearby show these moves). This first move leads into &quot;Squad's opening&quot; and other similar openings.

== General hints ==
===Get as far as possible===
One of the most basic strategies of the game is, of course, to get as far as possible. However, during play, it is not always the best move to go to the very end of a jump; sometimes you have to block your opponent. Although they may not like this, it is a real advantage to block them. Of course if you imagine a computer player, they will do this automatically if they think one extra move ahead!

===Keep moves near a center line===
If you split up your pieces at the wrong moment you'll find that you will be left with a lonesome piece that will take you a lot of wasted moves to get to the end. Also, there are always more pieces in the center line than near the edges. So keeping your pieces near the center line is an important advantage as you can always move your pieces.

===Get into the goal area===
If you have your pieces inside the goal area, it is also easier to feed following pieces in. The two outer edges seem to be more of an advantage. Often you may shuffle the pieces inside the goal to get more in, but don't overdo it; you have to get the external pieces in the shortest number of moves.

===The piece furthest away from goal===
This is a major help in play. You should always check your last piece because it can quite rapidly become stranded and you will lose the game. Basically, before making a move always check if you can get the last piece up.

Good luck.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why not add this recipe as a variant on the already present [[Cookbook:Biscuits]] page like has been done for brownies? [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 15:30, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Why I didn't: because of poor name choice, I though we didn't have a biscuit recipe

:Why we shouldn't: the brownie page is a mess; it should be 1 intro page pointing to 3 recipe pages

:[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:42, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Reasonable enough but more action is required then if I understand.  If the brownie page should be 1 intro page pointing to 3 recipe pages shouldn't the biscuit mess have the same solution?  Do you think we should run this idea through the [[Talk:Cookbook]] page first or just start doing things?[[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 01:47, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Given that this is just two pages, linking both directions is also reasonable. That was done for Omelet/Omelette, but would not be reasonable for Brownie. The awkward thing about the Brownie page is that history should be preserved to meet the GNU Free Documentation License requirements. It is kind of standard (though yucky) to just copy the history to the new talk page. The biscuit recipes are different enough that they should both stay I think; the usage of egg is major and the new version has a drop-biscuit variation. Maybe &quot;Egg Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Plain Biscuit&quot;? (ick) Oh, the brownie page could use a bit of really simple image manipulation (cropping). If you are the one to do this, please use jpegtran to do it losslessly -- there is a Tk interface if you wish to use a mouse and see what you are doing. BTW, I'm planning to split up the Pizza recipe so that &quot;Pizza&quot; lists the different types of crust and sauce. It's the same problem. So, do you think the biscuit problem merits an intro page or just bidirectional links? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:43, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Well, I'm probably too lazy to do anything right now so I vote with innaction.  I know, I suck, but it's the truth. :-(  [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:53, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
::::Speaking as a newcomer... it seems like having bidirectional links should work, provided not too many more recipes show up. Personally, I have a variation on &quot;Biscuit&quot;, but it's not different enough to warrant a whole new page (half whole wheat, veg. oil for the fat) - there could just be a &quot;variations&quot; section. However, having &quot;Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Biscuits&quot; is confusing, since the difference (from the titles) is totally unclear. &quot;Biscuits (simple)&quot; and &quot;Biscuits&quot;, maybe, since &quot;Biscuit&quot; is fewer ingredients? [[User:Naib|Naib]] 04:33, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

This page and the &quot;Biscuits&quot; page need to be combined. --Anon</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basics of Semiotics ==

'''Signs''' 

A general definition of semiotics is the study of signs and sign systems. The basic unit of meaning is the 'sign': anything which can represent a thing or an idea.  Human beings create meanings for the things they perceive by incorporating ideas into their interpretations of objects which can be triggered by visual cues.  The word sign itself can have multiple meanings. A sign can be anything from a literal sign such as a stop/yield road sign, to knowing that the word 'dog' is representative of an animal with four legs and a tail.

There are three basic kinds of signs: icons, indexes and symbols.  An icon is a sign that resembles its object.  

An Index is a sign that is physically connected to its object.  

A Symbol is an arbitrary representation of an object.    

'''Analogy: How a Sign 'works''''

As part of an introduction to semiotics, it may be helpful to discuss analogy: the relationship between established meaning (experience) and new stimuli through symbols (verbal or visual). Douglas R. Hofstadter, a noted author, cognitive scientist from Indiana University delivered a speech on the subject to an audience at Stanford University as part of the Standford Presidential Lecture series. [[http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/analogy.html]]
Hofstadter starts by explaining how, throughout our lives, we build our &quot;mental lexicon&quot; through what he calls chunking: (par. 18) &quot;taking 'small' concepts and putting them together into bigger and bigger ones, thus recursively building up a giant repertoire of concepts in the mind.&quot; (par. 7) 
To demonstrate first how lexicon building influences our ability to understand symbols and signs through analogy, I'll share a personal story: I have a friend who has a little girl who is just learning to speak. The other day we were on a walk in a local park together enjoying the first signs of spring. During this walk, her daughter started to fuss and I asked her mom what might be the matter. Her mom said that she wanted an &quot;s-n-a-c-k&quot;. This was a real-life demonstration of how a lexicon (in this case, of language) is gradually built. Her daughter knew the word 'snack', when vocalized, so she couldn't say it because she was out of snacks and hearing the word would make her fuss more. To communicate that to me, she spelled it; a function that her daughter had not yet developed because her lexicon was based in sounds, not strings of letters to make the word associated with that sound. Subtle examples of analogy are found in words and images we see and hear every day. Dr. Hofstadter illustrates this as a progressive process starting with single words, then compound words, then phrases, etc. (par. 19) Through what Hofstadter refers to chunking, and also, pattern matching, isomorphism and other functions associated with analogy, we achieve increasingly complex meaning with increasing abstraction from the root of that meaning. Understanding that we interpret 'signs' based on our earliest experiences—even rudimentary shapes, colors, and concepts—helps us know how to approach semiotics in a practical way.

'''Semiotic Theory '''

Semiotic theory explains the process by which meaning is found through perception and interpretation of signs.  The semiotic triangle shows a good representation of how exactly one begins to perceive signs and process the rhetoric.

[[Image:Semiotic.triangle.gif]]

This model explains the way we process a perception of something that exists in the physical world, the concept or idea that object is said to refer to, and a thought or image that is representative in the mind.

'''Semiology and its Relationship to Verbal Text'''

Within semiotics there is a debate between the amount to which the meaning of visual images can be shared and understood in themselves, or if their meaning is instead based on some prior verbal knowledge. In Roland Barthes essay Rhetoric of the Image, he argues that images, and their symbolic meanings, are always contingent upon verbal text. Barthes claims that in order to reach the shared meaning, verbal text must enforce the visual with evidence. While Barthes says that the image or the text can come first, without the text, the visual alone is too ambiguous. 

Kress and van Leeuwen oppose Barthes opinion of semiotics in their book Reading Images. They do not believe that text is unimportant but simply that visual images can accomplish the same message and meaning that text can, but perhaps in a different way.

'''Uncoded Naturalistic Representations v. Stylized Conceptual Images'''

The way that an image is either simplified or generalized can make that image more applicable to standard ideas and culturally shared notions.  A graphic picture of a house which is made standard, rather than a detailed photograph, becomes  more of an analogy of our understanding of a house rather than a specific house.  On the other hand a photograph or a fairly detailed painting is easily interpreted as a representation of something from reality and therefore this is a message without a code.  Images are depicted in specific ways, and with accompanying codes, in order to draw out certain meaning.  If an advertising campaign wants to reach the most people they may try and use a coded picture of a child, making it very standardized and lacking detail, perhaps even in black and white.  This makes the object more of a sign and a representation of a child than having the object seem like a particular person whom they don't actually know and won't be able to relate to as well.

''' Semiotic Modes '''

Semiotic modes vary by the qualities of the medium and backgrounds of each specific type of visual object.

== Social Semiotics ==


Social Semiotics is defined by Kress and van Leeuwen as 'the use of signs, symbols, and icons whose meanings are socially agreed upon and culturally-bound.' Understanding the way semiotics operates starts with understanding the nature in which visual communication is coded. It is coded by the way that we establish social and cultural codes manifested within images. We do not realize how explicitly coded visual images are because they become so ingrained in our understanding and behaviors as easily as walking, talking, waving hello, or driving on the correct side of the road. These are all things that we learn through a constant process of socialization just as we learn what visual images mean. 

Cultural visual rhetoric relies heavily on signs because of how important signs are to every individual. Culture has a great impact on one's use and interpretation of signs. All societies in their nature use signs symbols and other shared ideas and objects in order to create and establish community through commonalties. Visual signs are just another way that societies come to develop and follow a shared culture. 

Signs are intentional and motivated, but their motivations are not universal. Culture has a huge impact on these motivations, and every culture has differences in this regard. Simply put, a visual must be interpreted either by someone from the same culture as the person who created it or by someone who understands the rules and systems that typify that person’s culture. Taken out of a cultural context images and signs can mean very different things. 

Although semiotics and signs can be analyzed and unified by culturally accepted signs, the mediums and manifestations, the type of visual rhetoric be it narrative or conceptual, will all determine the individual interpretations. A picture of a tree will be seen as a tree to each person usually, but it may signify many different things. For one person they may see the tree as clean air, or to someone else history, or to someone else family origins. 

[[Image:Silhouette_of_a_Tree.svg]]

== Semiotics Landscapes ==

As noted earlier in the chapter, semiotics, in its most basic definition, is the study of signs and symbols. The word sign itself has ambiguous meanings depending on what is being analyzed. However we shall use this example again in order to understand how broad of a spectrum interpretation of both images and language is on any level of communication. It is important to understand that every individual has his or her own social history (mental lexicon) and own way (analogy pathways) of interpreting images. In many cases, interpretations of an image or sign may be similar or identical from one person to another; however, it cannot be assumed that this will be the case for every image and every person regardless of culture, history and time. 

Verbal and visual rhetoric are often intertwined when it comes to their interpretation, often-verbal rhetoric triggers some sort of visual depiction in our minds and imagination. The images that we recall when stimulated by various words various from person to person just as an image may inspire different thoughts and ideas. 


'''A Hearty Example'''

When one hears, the word ‘heart’ one is able to correlate images with possible definitions, or interpret and encode the sound to have a particular meaning. The sound for ‘heart’ [hahrt], could potentially mean, the innermost or central part of anything or the center of the total personality, especially with reference to intuition, feeling, or emotion; or in its anatomical form, a hollow, pump-like organ of blood circulation, composed mainly of rhythmically contractile smooth muscle, located in the chest between the lungs and slightly to the left and consisting of four chambers. On the other hand, perhaps hearing the sound for 'heart', you misinterpret it for the word ‘hart’, which could mean a male deer, especially an adult male red deer. Homonyms like these present a particular challenge when hearing alone without the added stability of context, or the additional clarity of their written form. All of these meanings for the verbalized sound, pronounced 'heart' are related and attached through analogy and all have a common source of high abstraction and low complexity. The simplest and most dominant analogy pathway (the path of least resistance) is the first one utilized unless further clarification dictates otherwise. We may start by visualizing a valentine's card or open-heart surgery but end up realizing, through context, that the topic is actually 'hart', an adult male red deer. 

'''Semiotic Landscape: A Defintion'''

A Semiotic Landscape is defined by Kress and Van Leeuwen as the construction of signs and symbols in a way that forms an understanding of meanings within and across cultures.  Any landscape is made up of human and social interaction and production but also the effect of the land itself.  A visual object is made up of its materials and corresponding signs as well as the context of the culture and its unique place among that culture.  

'''Landscaping in Different Cultures'''

There are many cases where visual images can mean many different things depending on the context. The rainbow for example, even within one society, means many different things. The rainbow originates from science and depicts the range of the light spectrum. In nature, the rainbow is simply colors, which exist in light. 

The rainbow came to mean luck and happiness. Seeing a rainbow in the sky holds a particular meaning. The medium of nature makes a rainbow a beautiful and often considered a lucky sighting. Rainbows are seen in many different places representing these things in themselves but taken out of its natural context rainbows have also come to symbolize that a person is or supports the homosexual lifestyle. All of these meanings are true and legitimate within the American culture. Depending on the context, that the rainbow is viewed among people will be able to take away the intended meaning. 

As mentioned previously, interpretations are dependent on the social and cultural background of the individual. Words, images and gestures can hold different meanings for whoever the interpreter is. Similar to the rainbow example, non-verbal communication, including hand gestures and facial expressions, differs accordingly in various cultures. The reason for this is that every cultural group is different; both in the way they assign meaning to 'things' and, in some cases, the meaning that is assigned. It follows then, that the mental lexicon and analogy pathway of a child raised in Europe will differ from that of a child raised in Indochina. The result of this is evident in innumerable ways of experiencing, interpreting, internalizing, and then reacting to the world around them.

==Conclusion==

Visual communication and visual images have many similarities and differences in relation to verbal. In essence verbal communication is based off of visual symbols but the way that these two modes have been defined and thought in our society have caused them to appear stratified. In order to see the connections between the modes we must bring ourselves back to the idea of shared meanings and how we interpret all information that we are presented with. Semiotics, like texts, is based on our prior knowledge of an object or idea, combined with the context it is being presented and ending in a specific meaning or sets of meanings. Semiotics operates on a daily basis and in almost every moment of our lives. Semiotics as we have said before is recognizing simply cues and incorporating them into our lives. In order to understand the way that visual images can be understood similar to verbal images, it is important to start from the building blocks and remember that visual images too have been learned and established over time. 

In essence, any physical sign can constitute visual rhetoric. According to one of the Definitions of Visual Rhetoric, “…using images to convince people instead of using words” is a staple of visual rhetoric. Employing this definition with the definition of a sign, the definition of a sign can be readjusted to say that a sign is actually simply a tool of visual rhetoricians. Therefore, if semiotics is the study of signs, then semiotics is really a study of the building blocks of visual rhetoric. In other words, semiotics is immeasurably important to the study of visual rhetoric.

Sure, you can call &quot;flavor&quot; a &quot;POV&quot;! Good idea, by the way. 
But translations are completely different matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In their text ''Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design'', Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen propose that all images can be divided into two classifications, narrative and conceptual. These classifications separate images into two categories: those images that have a component of action and those that possess a static, timeless essence. The following chapter defines narrative and conceptual representations within the discussion of [[../Definitions_of_Visual_Rhetoric|Visual Rhetoric]] and provides examples of each.

== Narrative Representations ==
The first type of classification is the narrative representation. While conceptual representations &quot;represent participants in terms of their. . . stable or timeless essence,&quot; narrative representations &quot;present unfolding actions and events, processes of change, and transitory spacial arrangements&quot; (59). That is, while conceptual representations show stable concepts, narrative representations show participants that are connected to one another through lines called vectors. In order for an image to be classified as a narrative representation, then, the participants in the image must be connected with a vector. According to Kress and Leeuwen, “When participants are connected by a vector, they are represented as doing something to or for each other. From here on we will call such vectorial patterns narrative”(56). [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Rhetorical_Vectors Vectors] represent courses or directions, and because the participants are connected by these invisible lines, the viewer understands the participants to be interacting with one another. This idea of Rhetorical Vectors relationships is the most important concept in separating narrative from conceptual representations. While narrative representations always have a vector between participants, conceptual representations never have these vectors. Despite the name, narrative representations are not always “telling” a story. Rather, the important idea is that the objects in the image are acting on and interacting with one another. 

When an object in the image is viewed as being the active participant in the image, it is called the actor. In order to be an actor, the object must be either creating or interacting with a vector to convey a sense of action. The participant that the actor is interacting with, usually passive in the action process, is known as the Goal. The Goal is that object that the actor's vectors connect with to form some sort of action or interaction. While all narrative representations show some form of action, there are different types of narrative processes to consider.

===Narrative Processes===

As previously stated, the &quot;hallmark of a narrative visual 'proposition' is the presence of a vector&quot; (59). According to Kress and Leeuwen, vectors are &quot;formed by depicted elements that form an oblique line, often a quite strong, diagonal line&quot; (59). These vectors may be formed from a number of objects, from bodies to limbs to tools. There are usually two partipants in a narrative representation. The &quot;Actor&quot; is &quot;the participant from whom or which the vector departs&quot; (59). That is, the &quot;actor&quot; is th object in the image that produces the action on the other object in the image. The passive participant in the action process is called the &quot;goal.&quot; The &quot;goal&quot; is &quot;the participant at which the vector is directed&quot; (74). Kress and Leeuwen distinguish different narrative processes by the types of vectors and the number and kinds of participants involved.

*'''Action Processes''' are those in which &quot;the Actor is the participant from which the vector emanates...or forms the vector&quot; (63). That is, in order to be considered an Action Process, the Actor must either have a vector coming out of it or actually form the vector. According to Kress and Leeuwen, when an image has only one participant, that participant can be considered the Actor. This is called a non-transactional image--there is no Goal in these images and vectors are not &quot;done to or aimed at anyone or anything&quot; (63). If there is only a vector and a Goal shown in the image, than Kress and Leeuwen call the action an Event. Lastly, when there are both an Actor and a Goal that are connected by a vector which stems from the Actor, then this process is called Transactional.

*'''Reactional Processes''' are those in which an eyeline, such as a glance, by one or more of the participants, forms a vector that connects those participants. This process differs from the Action Process in that the vectors are formed solely by the gaze of on of the objects in the image. In this case only, the participant who does the looking is called a Reactor instead of an Actor, and the passive participant is called the Phenomena, not the Goal (67). The Reactor is the participant who forms the vector with his eyes; he does the looking. Reactional Processes can be transactional and nontransactional as well (68).

===A Celestial Example===

The following examples showcase the difference between narrative and conceptual representations. The image found on the left is a photograph taken of the silhouettes of men and women gazing up into the night sky. Between these men and women is a telescope, also pointed towards the very heavens to which the people look. Vectors are formed out of the upward gazes of the men and women. Another vector is formed by the telescope itself, which points diagonally towards the sky. Because of the vectors, the picture on the left exhibits a narrative representation. [[Image:Astronomy_Amateur_3_V2.jpg|thumb|left|A Narrative Representation Shows Action Through Vectors]]

The picture on the right also shows a telescope. However, while the telescope on the left is in use, shown by its placement in the image and the vectors that it forms, the image of the telescope on the right is more of a timeless concept. The element in the image is shown &quot;symmetrically, against a neutral background&quot; (45). In short, the picture of the telescope on the right can be accurately considered a conceptual representation because there is no interaction between elements in the picture. Because of the lack of vectors to visually create action, this picture can only show the timeless concept of an astrological tool. Similarly, there is no actor present in this picture. [[Image:Astronomisches_Fernrohr_%28Moritz_Hensoldt%29.jpg|thumb|right|A Conceptual Representation Shows the Timeless Essence of an Object]]

On the left, the counter-image is a picture of a night scene in which a group of men and women  gather around a telescope while they gaze upwards towards the night sky. Unlike the conceptual representation on the right, this left-hand picture portrays an action that happens between the group of star-gazers, the telescope, and the night sky. Both pictures show the same kind of technology, but the picture on the right is vastly different than the picture on the left. Unlike the picture on the right that represents static technology, the picture on the left represents &quot;technology in action&quot; (46). The participants in the picture on the left (group of star-gazers, the telescope, and the night sky) are represented as active and interacting because of the vectors that connect them with other elements in the image. According to Kress and Leeuwen, while the right picture is &quot;static, this picture [on the left] is dynamic. Where the [right] picture is dry and conceptual, the [left] picture is dramatic&quot; (46).

== Conceptual Representations ==
The second type of representation brought up by Kress and Leeuwen is the conceptual representation. These differ from narrative representations in many ways. Not only do conceptual representations lack vectors that are a vital element of narrative representations, these images also have a component of timelessness and represent their participants in their generalized essence. They represent a static concept rather than engaging their participants in some kind of action. Conceptual representations have three distinct subcategories to further define the way visuals define their participants: Classificatory, Analytical and Symbolical. Each of these three types carries distinct assumptions about the way they represent the world.

===Classificational Processes===
Classificational processes often relate their participants together through a taxonomy. Taxonomies represent the world in terms of a hierarchical order. Its main concern is the ranking of ideas in terms of an overall generalization, whether it is their unifying origin or a higher power. They are grouped by a “kind of” relation (81). Classification processes attempt to present the participants in a way that is often without context and as objective as possible. This type of representation is striving for that timelessness mentioned above and often appears in advertising and textbooks. The three types of taxonomies that are found in conceptual representations are as follows:

* '''Covert Taxonomies''' portray a symmetrical equivalence between all of the elements in an image. Images are shown in an objective, decontextualized way to emphasize their timeless nature. 

* '''Single-Levelled Overt Taxonomies''' introduce the importance of &quot;superordinates&quot; and &quot;subordinates&quot; an an image. The superordinate and subordinate participants in an image show a higher degree of ordering than is present in a covert taxonomy, where all of the particpants are seen as equivalent. In single-levelled overt taxonomies, the participants are shown in a tree structure to indicate the hierarchal relationships. 

[[Image:Composition_of_bone.png|thumb|A Multi-Levelled Overt Taxonomy connects participants through a tree structure with more than two levels]]

* '''Multi-Levelled Overt Taxonomies''' are similar to the previous, except that a participant, &quot;Superordinate,&quot; is connected to other participants through a tree structure with more than two levels. Participants in middle levels are called &quot;Interordinates,&quot; and those at the bottom level are &quot;Subordinates.&quot;

===Analytical Process===
Moving away from the simple objectivity of the classificatory process, the analytical process sets up a part-whole relationship between its participants to strive to make them fit together. The parts are called attributes, and these attributes are part of the whole, which is termed the Carrier (89). Kress and van Leeuwen provide the examples of fashion shots, which display the parts of an &quot;outfit,&quot; and label both the Carrier (&quot;easy-wearing, inexpensive cottons&quot;) and the Possessive Attributes (Laura Ashley trenchcoat, Stuart Membery sweater.)

Another example: maps. In a map of the United States of America, the Carrier is the entire country, and the possessive attributes are the individual states, and both are labeled either inside the image or in a legend or caption. In the case of the fashion shot and the map, neither has a vector or carries a narrative process.

===Symbolic Process===
Symbolical processes move beyond classificational and analytical processes in that they do not try to find relationships between concrete objective images, but they seek to establish what the images mean. Symbolic processes take two forms, symbolic attributive and symbolic suggestive(108).

* '''Symbolic Attributive''' images are composed of two parts, the carrier and the symbolic attribute. The carrier in these instances is that which has its meaning given by the symbolic attribute and the relationship between them. 

* '''Symbolic Suggestive''' usually only have one participant, the Carrier, whose meaning is established in some other manner. These other ways of conveying meaning often establish the difference between an analytic process and a symbolic one. One example is that the colors in a symbolic suggestive image may be muted, blended or otherwise emphasized to create mood. That is to say, these images do not represent a specific moment in time, they are more concerned with create a timeless feeling, an essence of meaning.

== Conclusion ==
This chapter on narrative and conceptual representations merely scratches the surface of the work Kress and Leeuwen have done on this topic. For further information, interested readers should consult their work, ''Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design''. The idea behind this analysis is drawn from the way humans perceive, discuss, and study language (written or verbal), signs, and symbols (See: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Rhetoric/Semiotics_and_Visual_Rhetoric Semiotics and Visual Rhetoric].) Those ideas about language are then transferred and applied to the study of visuals, hence the name &quot;Grammar of Visual Design.&quot; Kress and van Leeuwen maintain that although their study of language is the backbone for finding meaning in images, the two mediums (language and images) are distinct from one another. While they find similarities between the two and attempt to create a &quot;grammar&quot; for images, they do not hold the idea that the two are one and the same, as other scholars may believe. The comparison of language and images creates a framework of discourse that allows scholars working from all perspectives to come together and find a common ground in the field of visual rhetoric.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Virtual Environments==


Many virtual environments are socially oriented. Communication in virtual environments allows for a safe environment to share ideas and cheap access to people worldwide. Virtual environments also allow foreign language learners to make native speaker friends from their homes. They can meet native speakers worldwide in a free space designed to promote discussion of a specific topic or simply socialization. 

By the same token, educators are excited by the possibilities that this new technology offers. They have a new way of encouraging students to write, and they can connect classes worldwide. Virtual Environments offer a new way of examining language and writing.

'''For EFL Learners'''


* [http://www.worlds.com/ Worlds Chat]: &quot;Through the creation of 3D Internet sites, Worlds Chat creates communities of users who form the basis for multi-user chat, e-commerce and advertising forums in a broad range of categories. Worlds 3D internet technology provides a contextual environment to online users, moving the current HTML print paradigm of the Internet, i.e., paging up and down, to a new level of spatial environments more akin to the real world. Within Worlds' immersive environments, online users can speak to each other through voice to voice telephony, standard web pages can be launched from within these 3D environments, supporting archived audio and video streams as well as live feeds. All these features offer a new value added layer to the current 2D internet experience&quot; (quoted from www.worlds.com). Furthermore, this virtual community offers some on-line classes about how to create rooms, and each room has a host to help new users. However, Worlds Chat has a weakness: poor quality audio chat.  



* [http://www.activeworlds.com/ Active Worlds]: &quot;Active Worlds, the web's most powerful virtual reality experience, lets learners visit and chat in incredible 3D worlds that are built by other users. Learners can also create fascinating 3D worlds that others can visit and chat in minutes. The Active Worlds Universe is a community of hundreds of thousands of users that chat and build 3D virtual reality environments in millions of square kilometers of virtual territory&quot; (quoted from www.activeworlds.com). 



* [http://www.thepalace.com/ The Palace]: The Palace is a vast online community of graphical interactive sites for Mac and Window users. &quot;With the Palace User Software, learners can visit a diverse range of communities such as business, training, and learning resources; entertainment and gaming centers; gathering points for special interest groups; and also personal sites where you simply can go to chat and socialize with friends and family. In addition, if learners download the Palace Server, they can even build and customize their own personal Palace site to host other people&quot; (quoted from www.thepalace.com). The weak points of this virtual community are 1) few avatars 2) environments just like pictures 3) no specific guidelines or guiders for new users 4) usually for children, so chat contains slang difficult for EFL learners.  



* [http://schmooze.hunter.cuny.edu/ schMOOze University]: schMOOze University is a small, friendly college. Learners studying English as a second or foreign language could practice English while sharing ideas and experiences with other learners and practicers of English. Students have opportunities for one-on-one and group conversations as well as access to language games such as Scrabble and Boggle, an on-line dictionary, a virtual library and a grammar maze. 



* [http://lingua.utdallas.edu/encore/ enCore] : enCore is &quot;an online virtual learning environment system built on LambdaMOO. It comes with a built in server-side client called Xpress. enCore was primarily designed for educational use, but can also be used for other purposes&quot; (quoted from lingua.utdallas.edu/encore). It is perfect for digital community building, online writing projects, online conferencing, distance education programs, or just about any educational endeavor that aims to incorporate a rich and versatile online presence. 



* [ftp://ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual_toc.html LambdaMOO]: LambdaMOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games, conferencing systems, and other collaborative software (quoted from ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual_toc.html). 



* [http://moo.du.org:8000/ Diversity University]: &quot;Diversity University MOO campuses are Internet locations for serious experimentation in network-based, interactive teaching, learning and social services&quot; (quoted from moo.du.org:8000/). 



* [http://oit.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/menu/home.ie.htm Planet Oit]: Planet Oit is a geology educational MOO created by the Geology Explorer Project at North Dakota State University.



* [http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~marinau/Zora/ Zora]: &quot;Zora is a 3D graphical multi-user environment to explore identity and values through storytelling and programming. Learners are graphically represented as an avatar and can navigate around the city. In Zora, learners can create their own spaces and can populate the city by creating objects and symbols as well as characters with stories and cherished values. They can program them with storytelling behaviors to engage in conversations with the visitors. At the same time, learners can communicate with each other in real-time&quot; (quoted from xenia.media.mit.edu/~marinau/Zora/).



* [http://www.wbs.net/forums/ WebChat Broadcasting System]: &quot;WBS has hundreds of online communities where its two million members gather to exchange ideas, get advice, and just chat&quot; (quoted from www.wbs.net/forums/). Learners can post individual community announcements; set up a free homepage; or participate in online events. The weakness of this communities is empty chat rooms despite active forums.



-------------------



'''For Virtual-environment-using Teachers and Colleagues'''
 

* [http://tappedin.org/tappedin/ Tapped in]: Tapped in is an on-line community mainly for teachers, development staff, university faculty, and researchers. It has various classes, clubs, and discussions via synchrouse chat, bulletin boards, and e-mail. Even though this community doesn't have any graphic functions, it has many strengths. First, because many members of this community are educators, chats are very valuable for deep conversation and starndard language. Second, the chat log emails the users automatically. Finally, a receptionist in the entrance helps new users.



* [http://teacherbridge.cs.vt.edu/public/TeacherBridge+Home TeacherBridge] : TeacherBridge is an innovative set of collaborative resources for educators. The system allows for very simple access and advanced interactive tools for teachers. Supported activities are &quot;1) Field work: several classes take part in monitoring local wildlife and water quality. Data can be collectively updated in TeacherBridge charts and table: 2) Online Discussion: set up chat workgroups for students to discuss any number of topics. Integrate chat windows with a text or problem to be discussed. These chat sessions can be secured and monitored by teachers: 3) Class management: easily publish assignments, activity guides, due dates, and the like: 4) Curriculum: share lesson plan ideas and collaborate on what works/what doesn't within various contexts: 5) Go Virtual: science fairs, gardens, journals, field trips, quizes/tests... 6) Online Portfolios: class projects, groups, or individual portfolios can be created and edited within TeacherBridge. 7) WebQuests-Classes/students can organize internet research with comments within TeacherBridge&quot; (quoted from teacherbridge.cs.vt.edu/public/).

'''let vs. where'''

You say that (and i quote):
The difference between &quot;let&quot; and &quot;where&quot; lies in the fact that &quot;let foo = 5 in foo + foo&quot; is an expression, but &quot;foo + foo where foo = 5&quot; is not. (Try it: an interpreter will gladly spit out the latter &quot;expression&quot;.)

However, in Hugs (windows Nov. 2003 build, Haskell98 mode), &quot; foo + foo where foo = 5 &quot; (without quotes) evaluates just as well as the let version. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying?

Hmmm.  GHCi rejects it.  It may be that Hugs has a different way of turning typed expressions into something evaluatable which lets this through.  I'll have to take out the &quot;try it in an interpreter&quot; bit.

== Eq a =&gt; ==

In Infix versus Prefix, &quot;Eq a =&gt;&quot; is used for the first time but not explained.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


Writing is a sociocultural phenomenon that reflects a community's values. According to [http://llt.msu.edu/vol4num2/ Murray] (2000), writing is “not a set of skills, whose absence or presence in individuals or communities automatically leads to particular outcomes” (p. 44). In other words, writing is not a context-free, value-neutral set of skills but a set of social or cultural practices and its participants as a community of practice” (Reder, 1994, p. 33). 

[http://www.kolar.org/vygotsky/ Vygotsky] (1978) argues that all learning is inherently social in nature. In fact, Vygotsky's theory implies that writing arises out of and retains the functions of social uses of language. A particular discourse community is characterized by the particular conventions of creating and interacting with texts. Therefore, in order to acquire writing, one needs socialization or acculturation into the distinctive conventions of the particular discourse community. 

Obviously writing practices are not only social but also mental and individual: writing involves a lot more than inscribing words. It is a linguistic process that relies not only on knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, but also on knowledge of textual organization beyond the sentence level, knowledge of genres, and knowledge of conventions of spoken and written language. It is a cognitive process that involves creating links between our knowledge and textual forms and ongoing critical assessment of the quality of those links. It is a social practice, interwoven into larger social practices, that is developed through apprenticeship and shaped by its users to conform with social needs. In sum, writing is seen as a dynamic set of linguistic, social and cognitive processes that are culturally motivated (Kern, 2000).

Furthermore, writing is now situated within computer networks, and the most profound effects of computer technology on writing arise from social interaction made possible by computer networks. Social use of computer technology, especially virtual environments such as [[wikipedia:MOO | MOO]] and [[w:WOO|WOO]], present a new opportunity to enable EFL learners to interact with native speakers in a social community for developing EFL learners' writing ability. 

Seen in this context, virtual environments on computer networks and writing are closely related. Therefore, the basic premise underlying this study is that EFL writing education can be empowered by the potential of virtual environments on computer networks. I examine in more detail the question of how activities in virtual environments enhance EFL learners' writing acquisition.

Does somebody here have the knowledge to fill this in or at least to provide a link to where I might learn more about them.  thx --[[User:SteveJM|SteveJM]] 21:04, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

It was difficult for me to comprehend this module because of its length.  Perhaps it could be split up?

----


I think we can do a lot of people a favor by cutting out the fatty portions of this document that pertain to user, computer, camera, operating system, editing system specific comments. These are supposed to be the basics right? 
(Steve: MTF charts are graphs of how well the lens channels light through itself based on the size of the aperture. The idea is that as the aperture gets smaller - the lens is using less of the glass; conversely, as the aperture gets bigger the lens is using more glass. If the lens uses too much or too little glass - aberrations appear in the transfered light. The range between &quot;too much&quot; and &quot;too little&quot; we can describe as the lens's &quot;sweet spot&quot;.) Again, MTF charts and references to advanced discussions should not be on this page. Steve, feel free to delete this once you've read it. --[[User:Lepercon|Lepercon]] 05:10, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Working on &quot;how to make an image brighter or darker...&quot; ==

I'm doing a lot of cutting and clarifying. I've taught photography to youth as young as 10 and they get the &quot;big hole&quot; &quot;small hole&quot;; &quot;long shutter&quot; &quot;quick shutter&quot; thing. Its a quick way to get people thinking about how it works. The alternative is: imagine a water pipe that you can constrict the width...

If anyone feels the cuts I'm doing as unjust, please correct me. However, since most of the sections have links to wiki pages that go on at length about the topic... brevity should be our focus. --[[User:Lepercon|Lepercon]] 06:36, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

== Camera Shake Section Incorrect ==

In the section discussing camera shake, there is no consideration given to the focal length and sensor size. For long focal lengths, shutter speeds must be faster to compensate for magnification of whatever camera shake exists. For short focal lengths, one can get away with much longer shutter speeds. That's why the rule of thumb is maximum shutter speed = 1 / focal length...</text>

== PORTAL HYPERTENSION ==
=== Definition: ===
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase in portal vein pressure above the normal level of 5 to 10 mmHG.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the resting portal venous pressure is above 10 mmHg.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most commonly due to obstruction:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Somewhere in the portal vein or its tributaries (Prehepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the portal venules and sinusoides in the liver (Hepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the Hepatic veins draining into the inferior vena cava (Post 
    Hepatic).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased blood pressure in portal veins cause oesophageal varices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commonly Liver diseases and thrombosis in the vein causes portal 
  hypertension and due to it occurs massive recurrent hematemesis and melaena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Causes:===

&lt;big&gt;Commonest Causes:&lt;/big&gt;
who puts COMMONEST? Most common
==== Prehepatic: ====
*Congenital absence or abnormality of the portal vein.&lt;/li&gt;
*Thrombosis of the portal vein. &lt;/li&gt;
*Obstruction of the Portal vein.&lt;/li&gt;
====IntraHepatic====
*Cirrhosis.
*Schistosomiasis.
====PostHepatic====
*Constrictive pericarditis.
*Tricuspid valvular incompetence.

====Other detail causes: ====
*Extrahepatic obstruction of portal vein and its tributaries
**Congenital absence or abnormality of portal vein
**Portal vein thrombosis *
***Idiopathic
***Umbilical and portal sepsis
***Malignancy
***Pancreatitis
***Hypercoagulable states
**Splenic vein thrombosis
*Hepatic venous outflow obstruction (Postsinusoidal)
**Suprahepatic
***Budd-Chiari syndrome *
***Constrictive pericarditis
***Right heart failure
***Smaller hepatic veins and venules
**Veno-occlusive disease *
**Sclerosing hyaline necrosis
*Hepatic causes
**Presinusoidal 
***Schistosomiasis *
***       Idiopathic portal hypertension
***       Primary biliray cirrhosis
***       Sarcoid
***       Myeloproliferative disease
***       Fibropolycystic disease
**   Sinusoidal
***       Cirrhosis *
***       Chronic active hepatitis *
***    Alcoholic hepatitis and Fatty liver *
*Increased hepatic blood flow (rare causes)
**       Tropical splenomegaly syndrome
**       Hematological and other conditions with massive splenomegaly
**       Hepato-portal arteriovenous fistula

===Pathogenesis:===
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The portal venous system lacks valves and hence resistance at any level 
  between the right side of heart and splanchnic vessels results in retrograde 
  transmission elevated pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased resistance can occur at 3 levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
====Presinusoidal====
    &lt;li&gt;anatomically outside the liver but at a functional level proximal to the 
    hepatic sinusoids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
====Sinusoidal====
    &lt;li&gt;Occurring within the liver parenchyma, e.g. Cirrhosis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
====Postsinusoidal====
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Occurring outside the liver at the level of the hepatic veins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/u&gt;! &lt;br&gt;
Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
Portal vein obstruction the 2nd most common cause. &lt;br&gt;
Presinusoidal portal obstruction accounts for nearly 20% of all cases and they 
are nearly always young and often a child.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

===Clinical features:===
Some Commonest features:

====ABCDE====
* A: Ascites.
* B: Bleeding (hematemesis, piles).
* C: Caput medusae.
* D: Diminished liver.
* E: Enlarged spleen.

&lt;p&gt;Major clinical manifestations include
*       Bleeding from gastroesophageal varices
*     Splenomegaly with hypersplenism 
*    Ascites
*   Acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these features are related, at least in part, to the development of 
portal-systemic collateral channels.&lt;/p&gt;

===Investigations:===

====Blood examination:====
=====Anemia. =====
*Usually MicroCytic Hypochromic.
*(Almost inevitable in Portal Hypertension)
=====Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: =====
*Due to splenomegaly and hypersplenism of hypertension
=====Coagulation defect:=====
*Due to thrombocytopenia and impaired synthesis of coagulation factors by damaged liver (Factor V, VII and X).
=====Liver function test:=====
*LFT tests may be entirely normal in the presence of established cirrhosis.
====Endoscopy: ====
*Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the mostly reliable technique.
*It shows the oesophageal varix and bleeding point.
**Oesophageal varix are seen as dilated longitudinal zigzag running.
*Excludes peptic ulcer  as a source of bleeding in a patient with documented varices
====Radiology:====
*Upper gastrointestinal Barium:
**It can  demonstrate oesophageal varices as filling defect in lower end of the oesophagus.
**Not very accurate in the diagnosis of gastric varices but can detect Peptic ulcers disease.
**Can be used when endoscopy is not available.
==== Liver Angiography:====
=====Two main advantages:=====
*Measurement of Portal pressure.
*Visualization of abnormal venous anatomy in case of portal hypertension.

NB! Anemia, Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia may also occur due to bone marrow depression occurred in Alcoholic cirrhotic

===Diagnosis:===
*H/o liver disease and other clinical features of portal hypertension – in maximum number of cases
*Rarely – portal venous pressure is measured by
**Percutaneous transhepatic skinny needle catheterization
**Transjugular cannulation of hepatic vein
**Both free and wedged hepatic venous pressure should be measured 
**WHVP will be raised in Sinusoidal and Postsinusoidal portal hypertension while it will be normal in Presinusoidal Postal hypertension
**Rarely – Mesenteric and hepatic angiography may be necessary



== Management ==
#Resuscitation.
#Diagnosis.
#Specific treatment.
#Treatment of Complications.
&lt;br&gt;
=== Resuscitation of the patient. ===
Same as Upper G.I tract bleeding.
* NB!
**In Coagulation abnormalities: Fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
***Avoid Saline.
*Regular Vitals recording with Input/Output charting.
*Careful with giving sedation in hepatic cases:
**e.g. Valium I.V
**e.g.Librium in Alcohol withdrawals.
*Purgatives and enema.
**Reducing Ammonia before Encephalopathy - good choice.
*Gastric acid secretion should be decreased.
**e.g. Cimetidine.
*If Ascites:
**Strict low-salt diet.
**Spirolactone.
**Paracentasis.
=== Diagnosis:===
* Endoscopy is the main diagnostic tool.
**Before endoscopy Lavage through Ewaled tube is good if too much bleeding.
**Peptic Ulcer bleeding should be excluded.
***NB!
****Bleeding due to gastritis in patients with portal hypertension should be managed as variceal bleeding.
=== Specific Treatment: ===
==== Vasopressin (Pitressin): ====
Controls variceal bleeding by splanchnic vasoconstriction.
*In acute bleeding:
**20 units in 100ml of 5% Dextrose I.V over 20 minutes.
**Followed by  a continuous infusion of 0.4 unit/minute.
===== Side effects: =====
*Cramping pain Abdomen.
*Myocardial Ischemia.
*Raynaud's syndrome.
====Non-Selective Beta-Blockers:====
*e.g. Propranolol.
**Prevents recurrent bleeding.
*NB!
**Non-Selective Beta-Blockers should not be used in decompensated liver disease, and if variceal bleeding occurs during treatment, the failure to mount a sympathetic nervous system response to blood volume loss may precipitate rapid circulatory collapse.
==== Endoscopic Variceal Sclerosis: ====
Revolution in variceal hemorrhage by decreasing mortality rate.
===== In acute bleeding: =====
**Intravariceal injection is preferred.
***e.g. 2.5% sodium morrhuate followed by ethanolamine oleate.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt;!
=====Complication:=====
*Retrosternal Chest pain  due to phlebitis.
*Local microperforation. Major perforation is rare.
*Pulmonary effusion with fever.
====Balloon temponade: ====
Temporary method to control bleeding.
*Should be used for Short time as possible.
*&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;!
*Oesophageal balloon should be inflated to 45mmHG if the gastric balloon does not control bleeding.
*In good risk patient: Avoiding it will be a good choice and urgent shunt operation will be a good choice.
=====Complications: =====
*Aspiration is common.
*Can produce more bleeding  by sustained pressure on ulceration of gastric and oesophageal mucosa.
*Oesophageal rupture is rare but if occurs it is FATAL.
*Transhepatic Visceral Embolisation:
**It is a temporary step in poor risk patients who continues to bleed following Pitressin therapy, sclerotherapy and tamponade.
**It Occludes the feeding vessels.
**It Causes thrombosis within oesophageal varices.
===Treatment of complication:===
*Shock:
**Barbiturates.
**Fresh blood transfusion.
*Clotting problem:
**Vitamin K.
**Fresh blood transfusion.
====Encephalopathy:====
*Continuous gastric lavage.
*Magnesium sulphate and neomycin (500mg STAT then 2 hourly) through Sangstaken tube.
*High bowel wash.
====Liver failure:====
*Plenty of Carbohydrate Per OS.
*Low Fat diet.

====Ascites:====
*Strict Low salt diet
*Diuretics.

'''Dinner''' is the largest meal of the day. In traditional farming communities, it occurs in the afternoon and is followed by [[Cookbook:Supper|supper]]. Elsewhere, dinner follows [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]] and is the last true meal of the day - this is excluding [[Cookbook:Midnight Snack|midnight snacks]] and such.

Dinner is normally a cooked meal. The primary dish nearly always contains [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] of some sort, possibly [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] or [[Cookbook:Poultry|poultry]]. Dinner is usually ended with [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]].

'''Supper''' is the last true meal of the day in traditional farming communities that do not eat [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]]. Supper comes after [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]] (which is served in the afternoon), but before [[Cookbook:Midnight Snack|midnight snacks]] and such. Since dinner is the largest meal of the day, supper is not.

'''Lunch''' is a meal served near noon or in the early afternoon. Lunch is not served in traditional farming communities that serve [[Cookbook:Supper|supper]]. Lunch comes between [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] and [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]]. Lunch is not a large meal, and is not usually a hot meal. One particularly characteristic lunch food is the [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]].

The '''midnight snack''' is a late meal eaten just before going to bed or after waking up in the middle of the night. Some people have difficulty falling asleep with an empty stomach, especially those who are not &quot;morning people&quot;. Good midnight snacks are high-fat and high-protein foods. Morning people are likely to find that this causes discomfort rather than comfort. Midnight snack foods are usually chosen to serve one person with little preparation effort. Often, leftover food is [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaved]] to reheat it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tool applications use calculators and computer applications such as word processing and spreadsheets to act as tools in the learning process.  These applications may often be the easiest to integrate into the curriculum because teachers can implement these tools without changing the structure of the lesson drasitically.  Since most teachers use tools such as word processing and spreadsheets for professional or personal pruposes, they are able to draw on their own experiences with the tools to aid students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[w:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transferring some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing the term in a 2002 whitepaper.

In the context of ATALL, RIAs represent a set of technologies that materials designers (be they practicing classroom teachers, resesarchers, or learners) can use to create ATALL-enabling on-line environments. This section of the ATALL Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used to support solitary and collaborative ATALL and research into ATALL.

=Technologies=
==Flash MX 2004==
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create graphical user interfaces ([[w:GUI|GUI]]). It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]].

GUI resources include...
*text fields (both plain text and HTML)
*buttons
*movie clips
*audio and video display and capture objects
*custom mouse pointers
*pull-down menus

===Example GUI Designs===
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by a partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This reference is written for a semi-knowledgeable UNIX user who has just come up against a problem and has been advised to use awk to solve it. For more information about awk, see [[An Awk Primer]].
==Versions==
There are three major versions of awk:
* awk or Bell Labs awk
* nawk or new awk
* gawk (GNU awk)
Both nawk and gawk will run awk programs without modification.

==Introduction==

Awk reads from a file or from its standard input, and outputs to its standard output. You will generally want to redirect that into a file, but that is not done in these examples just because it takes up space. awk does not get along with non-text files, like executables and FrameMaker files. If you need to edit those, use a binary editor like hexl-mode in emacs.

A frustrating thing about trying to learn awk is getting your program past the shell's parser. The proper way is to use single quotes around the program, like so:
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $0}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The single quotes protect almost everything from the shell. In csh or tcsh, you still have to watch out for exclamation marks, but other than that, you're safe.

Another frustrating thing about trying to learn awk is the lovely error messages:
 awk &lt;nowiki&gt;'{print $0,}'&lt;/nowiki&gt; filename
 awk: syntax error near line 1
 awk: illegal statement near line 1
gawk generally has better error messages. At least it tells you where in the line something went wrong:
 gawk &lt;nowiki&gt;'{print $0,}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 gawk: cmd. line:1: {print $0,}
 gawk: cmd. line:1:           ^ parse error
So, if you're having problems getting awk syntax correct, switch to gawk for a while.

==Some basics==
* Awk recognizes the concepts of &quot;file&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, and &quot;field&quot;.
* A file consists of records, which by default are the lines of the file. One line becomes one record.
* Awk operates on one record at a time.
* A record consists of fields, which by default are separated by any number of spaces or tabs.
* Field number 1 is accessed with $1, field 2 with $2, and so forth. $0 refers to the whole record. 

==Some examples==
Perhaps the quickest way of learning awk is to look at some sample programs. The one above will print the file in its entirety, just like cat(1). Here are some others, along with a quick description of what they do.
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $2,$1}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
will print the second field, then the first. All other fields are ignored.
 '''&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '{print $1,$2,sin($3/$2)}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
will print the first and second fields, and then the sine of the third field divided by the second. So, the second and third field had better be numbers. Awk has other built in math functions like sine; read the manpage to see which ones.
:&quot;I still say awk '{print $1}' a lot.&quot;
:the inventor of PERL, Larry Wall (lwall&amp;#64;netlabs.com)
What if you don't want to apply the program to each line of the file? Say, for example, that you only wanted to process lines that had the first field greater than the second. The following program will do that:
 &gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;awk '$1 &gt; $2 {print $1,$2,$1-$2}' filename&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The part outside the curly braces is called the &quot;pattern&quot;, and the part inside is the &quot;action&quot;. The comparison operators include the ones from C:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;== != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= ?:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
If no pattern is given, then the action applies to all lines. This fact was used in the sample programs above. If no action is given, then the entire line is printed. If &quot;print&quot; is used all by itself, the entire line is printed. Thus, the following are equivalent:
 awk '$1 &gt; $2'           filename
 awk '$1 &gt; $2{print}'    filename
 awk '$1 &gt; $2{print $0}' filename
The various fields in a line can also be treated as strings instead of numbers. To compare a field to a string, use the following method:
 &gt; awk '$1==&quot;foo&quot;{print $2}' filename

==Regular expressions==
What if you want lines in which a certain string is found? Just put a [[Regular Expressions|regular expression]] (in the manner of [[grep|egrep]](1) ) into the pattern, like so:
 &gt;awk '/foo.*bar/{print $1,$3}' filename
This will print all lines containing the word &quot;foo&quot; and then later the word &quot;bar&quot;. If you want only those lines where &quot;foo&quot; occurs in the second field, use the ~ (&quot;contains&quot;) operator:
 &gt;awk '$2~/foo/{print $3,$1}' filename
If you want lines where &quot;foo&quot; does not occur in the second field, use the negated ~ operator, !~
 &gt;awk '$2!~/foo/{print $3,$1}' filename
This operator can be read as &quot;does not contain&quot;.

==Booleans==
You can produce complicated patterns with the boolean operators from C, which are ! for &quot;not&quot;, &amp;&amp; for &quot;and&quot;, and || for &quot;or&quot;. Parentheses can be used for grouping.

==Start and End==
There are three special forms of patterns that do not fit the above descriptions. One is the start-end pair of regular expressions. For example, to print all lines between and including lines that contained &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, you would use
 &gt;awk '/foo/,/bar/' filename

==Begin and End==
The other two special forms are similar; they are the BEGIN and END patterns. Any action associated with the BEGIN pattern will happen before any line-by-line processing is done. Actions with the END pattern will happen after all lines are processed.

But how do you put more than one pattern-action pair into an awk program? There are several choices.
One is to just mash them together, like so:
  &gt; awk 'BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;} $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
         END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;}' filename
Another choice is to put the program into a file, like so:
 BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;}
 $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
 END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;}
Let's say that's in the file giant.awk. Now, run it using the &quot;-f&quot; flag to awk:
 &gt; awk -f giant.awk filename
A third choice is to create a file that calls awk all by itself. The following form will do the trick:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{print&quot;fee&quot;}
 $1==&quot;foo&quot;{print&quot;fi&quot;}
 END{print&quot;fo fum&quot;} 
If we call this file giant2.awk, we can run it by first giving it execute permissions,
 &gt; chmod u+x giant2.awk
and then just call it like so:
 &gt; ./giant2.awk filename
awk has variables that can be either real numbers or strings. For example, the following code prints a running total of the fifth column:
 &gt; awk '{print x+=$5,$0 }' filename
This can be used when looking at file sizes from an &quot;ls -l&quot;. It is also useful for balancing one's checkbook, if the amount of the check is kept in one column.

==Variables==
awk variables are initialized to either zero or the empty string the first time they are used. Which one depends on how they are used, of course.

Variables are also useful for keeping intermediate values. This example also introduces the use of semicolons for separating statements:
 &gt; awk '{d=($2-($1-4));s=($2+$1);print d/sqrt(s),d*d/s }' filename
Note that the final statement, a &quot;print&quot; in this case, does not need a semicolon. It doesn't hurt to put it in, though.
* Integer variables can be used to refer to fields. If one field contains information about which other field is important, this script will print only the important field:
 &gt; awk '{imp=$1; print $imp }' filename
* The special variable NF tells you how many fields are in this record. This script prints the first and last field from each record, regardless of how many fields there are:
 &gt; awk '{print $1,NF }' filename
* The special variable NR tells you which record this is. It is incremented each time a new record is read in. This gives a simple way of adding line numbers to a file:
 &gt; awk '{print NR,$0 }' filename
Of course, there are a myriad of other ways to put line numbers on a file using the various UNIX utilities. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
* The special variable FS (Field Separator) determines how awk will split up each record into fields. This variable can be set on the command line. For example, /etc/passwd has its fields separated by colons.
 &gt; awk -F: '{print $1,$3 }' /etc/passwd
:This variable can actually be set to any regular expression, in the manner of egrep(1). 

The various fields are also variables, and you can assign things to them. If you wanted to delete the 10th field from each line, you could do it by printing fields 1 through 9, and then from 11 on using a for-loop (see below). But, this will do it very easily:
 &gt; awk '{$10=&quot;&quot;; print }' filename
In many ways, awk is like C. The &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;do-while&quot;, and &quot;if&quot; constructs all exist. Statements can be grouped with curly braces. This script will print each field of each record on its own line.
 &gt; awk '{for(i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++) print $i }' filename
If you want to produce format that is a little better formatted than the &quot;print&quot; statement gives you, you can use &quot;printf&quot; just like in C. Here is an example that treats the first field as a string, and then does some numeric stuff
 &gt; awk '{printf(&quot;%s %03d %02d %.15g\n&quot;,$1,$2,$3,$3/$2); }' filename
Note that with printf, you need the explicit newline character.

We can use &quot;printf&quot; to print stuff without the newline, which is useful in a for loop. This script prints each record with each of its fields reversed. Ok, so it isn't very useful.
 &gt; awk '{for(i=NF;i &gt; 0;i--) printf(&quot;%s&quot;,$i); printf(&quot;\n&quot;); }' filename

==Arrays==
awk has arrays, but they are only indexed by strings. This can be very useful, but it can also be annoying. For example, we can count the frequency of words in a document (ignoring the icky part about printing them out):
 &gt; awk '{for(i=1;i &lt;=NF;i++) freq[$i]++ }' filename
The array will hold an integer value for each word that occurred in the file. Unfortunately, this treats &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, and &quot;foo,&quot; as different words. Oh well. How do we print out these frequencies? awk has a special &quot;for&quot; construct that loops over the values in an array. This script is longer than most command lines, so it will be expressed as an executable script:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 {for(i=1;i &lt;=NF;i++) freq[$i]++ }
 END{for(word in freq) print word, freq[word]  }
This loop-over-an-array seems to go in no particular order. Thus, the output from a program like this must often be piped through sort(1) in order to be useful.

Multi-dimensional arrays are implemented in an odd way. The given indices are concatenated together (with a special separator) to get one string, and it is used as the index. This program will print the word-pair frequencies:
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++ }
 END{for(words in freq) print words, freq[words]  }
Unfortunately, this will print out the separator, which is by default not a common character. You can change this by assigning something logical like a space to the variable SUBSEP using nawk or gawk (it's not allowed in plain awk).
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot;}
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{for(words in freq) print words, freq[words] }
Unfortunately (that word seems to occur a lot when talking about awk arrays), this doesn't let you refer to the indices individually. The secret to this it to use the &quot;split&quot; function, which breaks a string up into an array.
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot; }
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{ for(words in freq)
      {
         split(words,word,SUBSEP); 
         print word[1], freq[words],word[2];
      } 
    }	
When you're using an awk script in a file, you can break your program across multiple lines to make it easier to read. Comments are started the same way as in sh programming, with a #
 #!/usr/bin/awk -f
 # this program prints the frequencies of word pairs
 BEGIN{SUBSEP=&quot;&quot;} # set the index separator 
                  # to a nice character
 {for(i=1;i &lt; NF;i++) freq[$i,$(i+1)]++}
 END{ for(words in freq)
      {
 # just to show we can put a comment in here.
        split(words,word,SUBSEP); # or here
        print word[1], freq[words],word[2];
      } 
 }		
You can use awk to create text, as well as just process existing text. It is useful for quickly generating tables of function values, without the hassle of compiling a C program. For example, it can show that sin(x)/x approaches 1 as x approaches zero:
 &gt; awk '{x=1.0/NR; print x,sin(x)/x;}'
will print a new value each time it reads a new line. So, you can hit return until you have all the values you need. Alternately, if you need a set number of values, you can do
 &gt; awk 'BEGIN{for(i=1;i &lt;=30;i++){x=1.0/i;print x,sin(x)/x;}}' /dev/null
where 30 is the set number of values.

It seems twisted*, but awk can be used to generate C code that one doesn't want to type by hand. For example, this script will generate an explicit 3x3 matrix multiplication routine:
 gawk 'BEGIN{
         for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
          for(j=0;j&lt;3;j++){
            printf(&quot;d[%d][%d]=&quot;,i,j);
            for(k=0;k&lt;3;k++){
              printf(&quot;l[%d][%d]*r[%d][%d]%s&quot;,
                     i,k,k,j,(k&lt;2)?&quot;+&quot;:&quot;;\n&quot;);
            }
          }
      }'

''* ok, maybe it is twisted.''

==Grand example==
And now for a grand example:
 # This awk program collects statistics on two 
 # &quot;random variables&quot; and the relationships 
 # between them. It looks only at fields 1 and 
 # 2 by default Define the variables F and G 
 # on the command line to force it to look at
 # different fields.  For example: 
 # awk -f stat_2o1.awk F=2 G=3 stuff.dat \
 # F=3 G=5 otherstuff.dat
 # or, from standard input: 
 # awk -f stat_2o1.awk F=1 G=3
 # It ignores blank lines, lines where either 
 # one of the requested fields is empty, and 
 # lines whose first field contains a number 
 # sign. It requires only one pass through the
 # data. This script works with vanilla awk 
 # under SunOS 4.1.3.

==Options==
Command-line options aka switches of awk:
* -F ''field-separator'': Use the field-separator regular expression to separate fields.
* -f ''source-file''
* -v var=val: Set the variable to the value. Defined by POSIX; absent in the original awk.

Command-line options aka switches of GNU awk, beyond the bare-bones awk:
* -W gawk-opt
* ...
* --posix
* ...

==Oneliner examples==
Oneliner examples of awk use:
* echo abcd |awk '/b.*d/'
** Outputs lines matching a regular expression, like grep command.
* echo abcd |awk '/b.*d/ {print  $0}'
** Does the same as above, with an explicit print statement. $0 stands for the entire line.
* echo ab&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  cd |awk '/b.*d/ {print $2}'
** For lines matching a regular expression, outputs the second field. Uses a sequence of whitespace as a field separator by default. Thus, outputs &quot;cd&quot;.
* echo abcd,e |awk -F, '/b.*d/ {print $2}'
** For lines matching a regular expression, outputs the second field, using comma as the field separator due to the -F option. Thus, outputs &quot;e&quot;.
* echo abcd,e |awk '{print toupper($0)}'
** Outputs all the lines in uppercase. For lowercase, use &quot;tolower&quot;.
* echo ab cd | awk 'NF&gt;=2'
** Outputs the lines where the number of fields is 2 or more.
* echo ab cd | awk '{print NF}'
** For each line, outputs the number of fields in it.
* echo ab cd | awk 'length($2) &gt; 1'
** Outputs all lines such that the length of the 2nd field is greater than one.
* echo ab cd | awk '$2 ~ /cd/'
** Outputs all lines whose 2nd field matches the regular expression.
* echo ab cd | awk '$1 ~ /ab/ &amp;&amp; $2 ~ /cd/'
** Like above, but with two subconditions connected by &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;. Supports some other logical operators known from the C programming language.
* echo abcd | awk '{gsub(/ab/,&quot;ef&quot;);print}'
** Replacement aka substitution like in sed command; &quot;g&quot; in gsub stands for global.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> Back to [[Emulation]]
Surprisingly, emulation on macs is fairly easy. There are lots of developers working on projects for mac, and emulation is a well supported task. 

===Emulators===
The best site for mac emulation software is http://www.emulation.net 
You will want to scroll all the way to the bottom of it where they have something that looks like finder and click on the emulation icon. It will fold out to reveal the different systems. (It took me a little while to figure this out :)

====Most popular emulators====
*http://macmame.org/ - Mame for mac (plays arcade games)
*http://www.bannister.org/software/ RockNES
*http://chrisballinger.info/public/snes9x/ SNES9x
*http://stella.sourceforge.net/ -atari emulator
*http://www.daphne-emu.com/ - Plays laserdisc games including Dragons Lair and Space Ace

===Controllers===
Now, if you are doing emulation or any gaming on a mac you should pick up a usb controller. It makes gaming a lot more fun then using the keyboard and mouse. A nice cheap one that I use is the [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005USC6/qid=1114656182/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/102-0876053-5050537?v=glance&amp;s=electronics&amp;n=507846 Belkin Nostromo N45 Dual Analog USB Gamepad].

====Controller Set Up ====
Another thing that is REQUIRED if you are using a controller with a mac is [http://www.carvware.com/gamepadcompanion.html The Gamepad Companion]. It is a piece of software that will map keystrokes and mice to controllers, so if you set J to be the jumpkey for a game, you can set a button on the controller to be mapped to J, so pressing it will make your character jump. You should configure your gamepad to match the controls of [http://www.macmame.com MacMame] and then configure your other emulators to match that. The reason is that there are so many different configureations of controllers possible for mame that its best to go with the default and then bring the other emulators into the same line.

One more note on controllers, you can have any number of them plugged in at once and have each one mapped to a different set of keys, so you can play multiplayer games.

Java has the benefit of being able to be run on most platforms. This means that you can develop an program on one os, and if the JVM exists on another machine, the program can be run there. 

As a result, many emulators have been written in java that can be set up on all types of hardware.

Full list of java emulators:
*http://java-emu.emuunlim.com/projects.html

Keep in mind that many emulator projects in java are struggling. They don't have the same support and java has some extra overhead that makes programming emulators in it a little difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Features of Interaction in Virtual Environments ==


The features of interaction shown below, based on an ESL/EFL literacy researcher’s personal experience, support the potentials of virtual environments to improve not only EFL learners’writing ability but also language development. Furthermore, the features will help EFL learners know how to apply virtual environments to English writing development.      


1) '''Learners can join various authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences.'''

Virtual environments are based on written-language conversation tools such as synchronous chats, e-mails, and bulletin boards. As soon as learners enter virtual environments, they have to write in English for the purpose of communication or to deliver their opinions. In that, virtual environments enable EFL learners to engage in authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences.

  ylim5&gt; hi, there!

2) '''Learners receive direct or indirect feedback on the target language writing from their partners.'''

The feedback plays an important role in language development. However, it is not easy for EFL learners to receive feedback because they do not have many chances to use English, and there are few people who are proficient in English in the environment of the learners. Thus, virtual environments are good places for EFL learners' writing and language development because they allow EFL learners to use English. In addition, the native speakers that the learners meet in virtual environments correct EFL learners' English errors in the natural situations and in the various ways.

  A: right click on my body and you will see some options (Native speaker) 
  B: opetions? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  A: options (Native speaker) 

  I made an exam paper. (from a EFL leanrer's e-mail) 
  -&gt; Did you set an exam, or prepare an exam paper.(from the response of a native speaker)



3) '''Learners can learn about the target language society and culture as well as language.'''

Many researchers (e.g. Kern, 2000) in literacy education prove the importance of learning about target language society and culture to develop literacy ability. Virtual environments make possible that EFL learners can learn about them through various communication tools: synchronous chat, e-mail, and bulletin board.

  4 minutes of silence 
  Four RCMP officers were shot and killed after conducting a raid on a marijuana grow operation northwest of     
  Edmonton on Thursday.
  It's the single deadliest incident for Canada's national police force in 120 years. 
  At a news conference in Mayerthorpe, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Bill Sweeney said: &quot;As you can well imagine,  
  the loss of four police officers is unprecedented in recent history in Canada. . . . It's devastating.&quot; 
  He added that not since the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 have so many police officers been killed in the line 
  of duty. (From a native speaker) 



4) '''Learners experience a sense of place, a setting similar to face-to-face conversation with native speakers because learners show what they look like and express their feelings. Furthermore, interaction is much more similar to the discourse and behavior of people gathered anywhere for the purpose of socializing.''' 

  B: can I keep in touch with you? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  A: we have a meeting on this Sunday evening (Native speaker) 
  A: really??? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 

  B: nice to meet you (EFL/ESL literacy researcher)  
  A: nice dance (Native speaker)
  B: thanks (EFL/ESL literacy researcher)

  KaiteB: do your students connect internet? (Native speaker)
  WangZ: Yes, but their computer skills are not good. (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 
  KaiteB: if so, it will be not easy because you have to teach everything in detail (Native speaker) 
  WangZ: Do you have any good ideas? (EFL/ESL literacy researcher) 



5) '''Both the feeling of object ownership as learners create spaces and the permanence of the environment motivate learners to return for continued conversation and community building. it is cooperation that encourages learners to continue developing their writing ability.'''

   Virtual environments look like real life places. For example, when I go back to a virtual environment, nothing has really changed. 
   My own rooms and objects represent me, so I need to always take care of them. 
   (From interview with an EFL/ESL literacy researcher)

'''Vegemite''' is a [[Cookbook:Salt|salty]] strong-flavoured spread commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. It is similar to the [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] spread used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]], but more similar to the [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] spread used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]].

Vegemite is based on [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] and [[Cookbook:Malt|malt]] extracts. Vegemite is a good source of B vitamins including thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), and folate (B6). Vegemite also contains a relatively high proportion of sodium-chloride (table salt) -- luckily the typical serving size is quite small -- one teaspoon or 5g on a slice of bread or toast.


=== Glutamate ===

Vegemite, like many foods including tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms and meat, contains unrefined [[Cookbook:Glutamate|glutamate]][http://www.glutamate.org.au/main.html], ''not to be mistaken with [[Cookbook:MSG|Mono-sodium Glutamate (MSG)]]'' -- a salt-bound, chemically-refined form of this flavour-enhancing natural amino acid. Vegemite contains 1.4% of unbound, natural glutamate amino acid, and an unknown quantity of the bound form, which also occurs naturally in many common foods.</text>

We expect images to relay some kind of truth.  Whether it is a graph or a picture, there are certain qualities that they possess to portray the highest level of truth.  This is the modality of the image.  “Each realism has its naturalism, that is, a realism is a definition of what counts as real, a set of criteria for the real, and it will find its expression in the “right”, the best, the (most) “natural” form of representing that kind of reality, be it a photograph or a diagram.”

In their book Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design, Kress and van Leeuwen identify eight markers that help determine the modality of an image: color saturation, color differentiation, color modulation, contextualization, representation, depth, illumination, and brightness.  They define the following as,

“Color Saturation, a scale running from full color saturation to the absence of color, that is to black and white.

Color differentiation, a scale running from a maximally diversified range of colors to monochrome.

Color modulation, a scale running from fully modulated color, with for example, the use of many different shades of red, to plan, unmodulated color.”

These are the three markers that deal with color.  It is important to realize that high scales of all these will dilute the truth to the image by created a mess of colors; the message will be extremely distorted.

“Contextualization, a scale running from the absence of background to the most fully articulated and detailed background.”  

“Representation, a scale running from maximum abstraction to maximum representation of pictorial detail.”

“Depth, a scale running from the absence of depth to maximally deep perspective.”

“Illumination, a scale running from the fullest respresentation of the play of light and shade to its absence.”

“Brightness, a scale running from a maximum number of different degrees of brightness to just two degrees: black and white, or dark grey and lighter grey, or two brightness values of the same color.”

Kress and van Leeuwen basically argue that any extreme of their particular modality sub-catagories will cause the believability of an image to suffer.  For example, too much color saturation or too much brightness cause an inharent dissonance that conveys a sub-reality.  However, all their catagories have a &quot;Mid-range&quot; and this is where the believability of an image is strongest.

'''Green onions''' (also known as '''scallions''' and '''spring onions''') are usually one of various members of the onion family that do not form bulbs. Occasionally, whole immature [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]] are used in the same way. Green onions tend to be milder tasting than other onions and are typically used raw in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]].

It is commonly used in Chinese [[w:stir frying|stir frying]], by putting chopped pieces into the hot oil at first to gave the dish more taste.

===Solutions of systems of linear equations===

A solution of a system of linear equations is a set of numbers for each variable that makes every equation true.

{| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot;&gt;
 | style=&quot;background-color:#F3F3FF; border:1px solid #D6D6FF; padding:1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;H2&gt;Number of solutions for a system of linear equations&lt;/H2&gt;
A system can either have
# Zero solutions
# One solution
# Infinitely many solutions
 |}

This can be demonstrated using 2 variable sets of equations.

No solutions

[[Image:Parallel Lines.svg|thumbnail|none|200px|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3x+2y=6\\3x+2y=12\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;]]

One solution

[[Image:Intersecting Lines.svg|thumbnail|none|200px|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x-y=1\\3x+y=9\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;]]

Infinite solutions

==Why Operators?==

When we work with the Schrödinger Equation, or in any other formulation of Quantum Mechanics, exact values of properties can not be found. Instead we use operators.

The simplest way of expressing Schrödinger's Equation is
&lt;math&gt; \hat \epsilon \Psi = \frac{\hat p^2}{2m}\Psi + V(x)\Psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Showing that energy = kinetic + potential.

Now this could look deceptively simple if we didn't use operators for energy and momentum. We could simply divide by the wave function &amp;Psi;. But like most things, it's never simple. The energy operator acts on the wave function, as does the momentum operator. So we need to find the wave function in order to make any sense of this equation.

==A Look at a Few Common Operators==

Although we could theoretically come up with an infinite number of operators, in practice there are a few which are much more important than any others.
===Momentum===
The Momentum operator is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat p = -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
So the relative part of the Schrödinger Equation will become
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial x}^2} \Psi  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Energy===
Energy Operator
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So Schrödinger's now looks like 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi + V(x)\Psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As you can see this is now a differential equation, which may or may not be easily solved depending on the potential &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this is the one dimensional form of Schrödinger's Equation, it does become more complex for higher dimensions.

===Hamiltonian===
We often call the Right Hand Side of this equation the Hamiltonian Operator.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat H = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{{\partial}^2}{{\partial x}^2}  + V(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and it represents the total energy of the particle of mass m in the Potential Field V.

==Expectation Values==
In Quantum Mechanics, everything is probabilistic (e.g., the probability of finding a particle is the square of the amplitude of the wave function). 
So we often want to know the expected value of position, momentum, or anything else, and there is quite a nice method of doing this.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat K\rangle = \int _{-\infty} ^\infty \Psi^* \hat K \Psi dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, for instance, if you knew the wave function and wanted to find the expectation value of momentum you'd use the equation

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat p\rangle = \int _{-\infty} ^\infty \Psi^* \Bigg( -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Bigg) \Psi dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Dirac Notation (Bra-Ket Notation)==
To simplify notation Paul Dirac came up with a new way of writing states:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|n\rangle \equiv \Psi_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e a ket
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle n| \equiv \Psi_n^*&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e. a bra

So the expression for the expectation value of momentum can now be written as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \langle\hat p\rangle = \langle n|\hat p|n\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This notation is very widely used. It is extremely useful in finite dimensional problems, represented by matrices and state vectors. In 2D, qubits are used (most used in Quantum Information Theory), where:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|0\rangle &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt; 


and 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
are the state vectors.

For more on Dirac Notation see [[w:Bra-ket_notation|Wikipedia:Bra-ket_notation]]

==Commutators==
&quot;And you know why four minus one plus ten is fourteen minus one?
'Cause addition is commutative, right.&quot; --Tom Lehrer

Commutators are very important in Quantum Mechanics. As well as being how Heisenberg discovered the Uncertainty Principle, they are often used in particle physics. It is known that you cannot know the value of two physical values at the same time if they do not commute.

===Mathematical Definition of Commutator===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[\hat A,\hat B] = \hat A \hat B - \hat B \hat A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is equal to 0 if they commute and something else if they don't.

As you can probably see all natural numbers will commute. For instance
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[6,7] = 6*7 - 7*6 = 42 -42 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But, if we look at Momentum and Position, things start to get interesting
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
[\hat p,\hat x]\Psi &amp;=&amp; (\hat p \hat x - \hat x \hat p) \Psi \\
&amp;=&amp; - i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x \Psi) + i x \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\Psi) \\
&amp;=&amp; - i \hbar \Psi - i x \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x} + i x \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\\
&amp;=&amp; -( i \hbar)\Psi
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; [\hat p,\hat x] = -i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
This tells us a few things, one of the most important being that you can't know position and momentum precisely at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thanks for fixing the fold stuff ==

I hadn't realised that my understanding of folds was quite so broken.

I'm going to add one or two notes to your text though.  We need to explain that &quot; ' &quot; is a valid character in an identifier, and I don't think we've introduced infinite lists yet.

Paul.

== foldl' and foldl1' ==

We did not learn about libraries or modules yet, so I can't use the information about those functions. Importing seems more than Elementary or Basic Haskell. -- gerymate

== Map exercises ==

Are there any answers for the map and scan exercises (in [[Haskell/Answers to exercises]])? I looked through the answer guide using some searches (didn't read the whole thing so as not to spoil later problems), but couldn't find any keywords like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Int]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Anyway, here's what I came up with. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 05:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)


 negatel :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 negatel l = map (negate) l

 factorsl :: [Integer] -&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 factorsl [] = []
 factorsl (l:ls) = factors l : factorsl ls

 factors p = [ f | f &lt;- [1..p], p `mod` f == 0 ]

 negatell :: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; -&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Integer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 negatell [] = []
 negatell (l:ls) = map (negate) l : negatell ls

 factList :: Int -&gt; [Int]
 factList n = scanl1 (*) [1..n]

== WTF? ==

How come none of the fold examples have fold in them? Can't you give an example of fold in action? It's very confusing....I think this section needs a bit of work. It's not clear.

--[[User:90.198.153.194|90.198.153.194]] 17:11, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

== Type Signatures ==

Could we please get type signatures for the example functions used? Especially the echoes example. I was very lost when I first read it, and I still don't know what the types would be. And I believe that was the first attempt at an explanation of Lambdas. Would have been nice to know what they were back in the Pattern Matching chapter when they were first mentioned.

== Nonassociative folds? ==

I think that our examples and exercises on folds are impoverished in that the operators used are always associative (and usually even commutative). The difference between &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; is more than just the order of computation but can even affect the result. In general, only one will be correct.

Some possibilities:
* Code &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; using a fold and &lt;code&gt;( : )&lt;/code&gt;; one way will work, while the other will return the original list. (This operator is associative but of course not commutative.)
* Horner's method for evaluating polynomials; this could be extended to converting a string like &lt;code&gt;&quot;8C5a&quot;&lt;/code&gt; from hexadecimal. (This operator is not even associative.)

I can write these as exercises (and write their solutions), but maybe somebody has other or better ideas.

== Folds... ==

One of the exercises is to generate a fact-list.

My very first approach was 
&lt;code&gt;
factList n =  foldr1 (*) ( takeWhile (&lt;=n) [1..]): factList (n-1)&lt;/code&gt;

but this builds a list like [24,6,2,1]. The question would be:

#1 Since factList(n-1) is obviously appended at the very end, how to change the code to append it at the beginning?
#2 What are the risks of it?

add 1) &lt;code&gt;factList n = factList (n-1) ++ foldr1 (*) ( takeWhile (&lt;=n) [1..])&lt;/code&gt;

add 2) Instead of linear complexity, you have quadratic complexity: 
xs ++ ys takes linear time in the length of xs; (([1]++[2])++[3])++[4])++... appends to elements of length 1,2,3,etc, for a total of 1+2+3+...+n = n*(n+1)/2

Although I don't understand in details the thing with the quadratic, cause the opposite is as well a recursion and therefore the same formula applies? I have to confess that statement is from an IRC-session.

I have to admit to have no real clue where to put that kind of information (either ListProcessing, Solutions, Lists, etc.)

:A few things to point out:
:* Your original solution is already quadratic. The uses of both &lt;code&gt;takeWhile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldr1 (*)&lt;/code&gt; are linear in &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, and the solution performs those operations &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; times recursively. As a broader point, folds are meant to capture recursion patterns, so you should not need explicit recursion when you use &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and friends.
:* &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; would also make it quadratic, as explained in the answer to 2) that you mention. The recursion scheme may be in itself linear, but if the operation is also linear in the size of the input the whole thing becomes quadratic. In general it is a bad idea to reverse the order when building a list by replacing &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt;. I don't recall whether we point that out explicitly in some chapter; it would be a good thing to do so.
:* The immediate solution to the problem is to use &lt;code&gt;scanl1&lt;/code&gt;. I can't see a way to write it, or &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt;, as a simple fold without resorting to unpleasant tricks like using &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;. (Though that might just be lack of imagination from myself. I'm still puzzled :))
:* By the way, the solutions to the exercise which asks for implementations of &lt;code&gt;scanr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanl&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; indiscriminately, which isn't good. I will try and tidy them up.

== foldr on inifine lists ==

&quot;As a rule of thumb, you should use foldr on lists that might be infinite&quot;
.. and your waiting time &quot;might be infinite&quot;. Fixing that =)

: {{ping|178.201.157.19}} The text does mean that, in all seriousness :) The point is that with &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; if the result is also infinite you can extract a finite segment of it in finite time. Compare &lt;code&gt;take 10 (foldr (:) [] [1..])&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;take 10 (foldl (flip (:)) [] [1..])&lt;/code&gt;. I wonder if there is a way to make the text a little clearer without belabouring it, though. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 12:07, 28 September 2015 (UTC)</text>

These spreadsheets and worksheets are created to organize data and complete mathematical computations. Spreadsheets are made up of rows and columns that vertically and horizontally connect to make cells. A group of cells is most associated with the range of certain cells. 
A combination of spreadsheets, and/or worksheets, are called a workbook. Workbooks are commonly used in the accounting and business profession and or may also be used for personal
[[File:Spreadsheet.png|thumb|Spreadsheet]]



Spreadsheets provide a way for students to process data and report results. The word spreadsheet has become almost synonymous with mathematics.  Data is arranged on a grid, in rows and columns, and the program automatically calculates and re-calculates values. This promotes mathematics instruction because once students enter the data they must have a true understanding in order to use the correct computer command or formula to get the needed result.  Data can easily be turned into a graphic which helps with visual learning.  Teachers can use spreadsheets to calculate student marks, create schedules, or to develop examples for math lessons.  Spreadsheet activities can range from easy (shading cells to create a picture) to difficult (calculating interest and payments on a car purchase).
