Instead of images to illustrate math you can use some wikitex.   It is not perfect, but is good enough for an illustration.  If somebody wants to revert they are free to do so.[[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

:: wikitex looks better (the primary reason for using latex) than .png's but if .png must be used, make sure that final size and the original size are the same. MPR

Any good introduction to latex will tell you *not* to use &lt;tt&gt;$$...$$&lt;/tt&gt; for displayed maths

:: why do you say this? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 12:42, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:: according to this website [http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/robertsa/LaTeX/ltxenviron.html] the reason is that if an error was to occur while using the $ sign, it would give an incomprehensible message. ([[User:TKelly|TKelly]] 23:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC))

::: and many people recommend not to use $$...$$ because it interferes with other functions. See [ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf] for example.
==Refering to subequations==
Could someone write in the subequations section of the article how it is possible to refer to subequations, please? [[Special:Contributions/128.214.205.5|128.214.205.5]] ([[User talk:128.214.205.5|talk]]) 10:36, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
:Check out [[LaTeX/Labels and Cross-referencing]], where it describes this and shows examples. It doesn't show examples specifically to subequations, but the rules don't change. Using the existing example:
&lt;source lang=latex&gt;
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:first} a x + b = 0 \\
\label{eq:second} a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \\
\label{eq:third} a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

The second one is Equation \ref{eq:second}.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Math Symbol Index==
An index or table(s) of math symbols such as
[http://web.ift.uib.no/Fysisk/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/symALL.html] would be a nice addition.
:I tend to use [[w:Help:Displaying a formula]] for this. Perhaps it should be forked and included here. &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|mt]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 01:03, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

==describing ams-math==
Is it really a good idea to describe ams-math on it's own in a separate section or would it be more appropriate to describe the relevant features as the text goes along? I've added the multiline stuff about ams to the multiline equation environments already (not so much as an example but because I didn't notice the ams-math specific section). As a reference guide, were I to want to remember what I should use for multiline equations, I would look under multiline equations and not think of the ams-math section at first. This could push me to quickly get the wrong result. Thoughts? [[User:Basenga|Basenga]] 05:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== AMS-math section ==

After teaching how LaTeX works, I think we should give some good guidelines about using it properly. As an example, I don't think there is any point in using ''{math}'' and ''{displaymath}'' environments if you are using the ''amsmath'' package, since you should use the ''{equation*}'', it is more consistent with any other way of displaying math you should use.
It wouldn't make sense to say &quot;''{displaymath}'' exists but don't use it&quot;, so I suggest: we could write a &quot;Basic Mathematics&quot; page teaching all that LaTeX can do without ''amsmath'', then we make another page titled &quot;Advanced Mathematics&quot; teaching how to use all the features of ''amsmath'' and saying all the commands that is better to use when writing a document with a lot of Maths. I'm referring to ''\begin{equation*}'' instead of ''\begin{displaymath}'', or ''\text{...}'' instead of ''\mbox{...}'', etc. What do you think about it?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alejo2083]] 19:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== Removed TODO points ==

* introduce &lt;tt&gt;eqnarray&lt;/tt&gt; from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial10.html] ?

all the environments discussed to insert formulas are enough, I think I have considered any possible situation. &lt;tt&gt;eqnarray&lt;/tt&gt; is redundant if you use &lt;tt&gt;flalign&lt;/tt&gt; and all the other environments.

* show how to create large matrix from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial9/matrices.pdf] and [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial9/matrices.tex]

AMS matrix environments are enough, there is no difference between ''big'' or ''small'' matrix, LaTeX takes care of it. Andy Roberts used the &lt;tt&gt;array&lt;/tt&gt; anvironment, but it is pointless if you can use the ones of AMS.

I agree about inserting the Mathematical symbols (the only point left in the TODO list), but we'd better add them in a different page, this one is long enough. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 18:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

: By &quot;large&quot; matrix I ment a matrix with dots meaning omitted columns/rows. It's not obvious how to make these dots and you use them very often. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

::ah, you meant that. Well, there isn't any particular formatting for it, you just have to use the right symbols in the right places (such as ''\cdots''). Anyway, if it's not clear from the context, I will add an example as soon as I have some time. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 13:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:: The point is that \vdots (I don't remember exact code) hasn't been introduced in this tutorial). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I added something about it. It is already better than the original version by Andy Roberts, but I can think I can add few things more. Any suggestion is welcome :-) [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 14:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== properly scaled integral ==

I don't know if this is an issue in the latex wikipedia uses, but regular latex on Linux doesn't scale the \int symbol to fit the equation it refers to. If anyone knows how to do this, please add it to the article. Thanks. --[[Special:Contributions/64.81.59.211|64.81.59.211]] ([[User talk:64.81.59.211|talk]]) 22:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

: it's not meant to. Moreover, \int is just a symbol with no argument, so it doesn't refer to anything and couldn't be scaled according to anything. I know that other programs do scale the integral symbol to fit the argument, but it's not such a good idea: if you write several formulae, the scaled integral would look different on each formula, that's definitely not elegant. If LaTeX does it by default, it might be the best choice (otherwise it would have been implemented differently). If you want to scale the integral, you can use modifiers such as \big and \huge to do it by hand. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] ([[User talk:Alejo2083|talk]]) 10:39, 9 December 2007 (UTC)


:: The \big and \huge commands don't work on a \int sign. If you want to force an \int to take on it's normally larger size (for example whilst in-line or within an array in an equation) then place \displaystyle before the \int

: You can use, e.g., \mathlarger{\int}, which would make the symbol larger than its usual size.

== set symbols ==

Just letting whoever edits this page, the \mathbb didn't work here without amssymb loaded 

but still, thanks for the great docs :)

:I'll point it out in the document, thanks [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] ([[User talk:Alejo2083|talk]]) 16:32, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

== Negative space ==
While I'm pretty sure that negative space is there to do something, the example concerning binomial
is a bit overstretched. There is a &quot;\binom&quot; macro. Are there not a proper example for negative space?
--[[Special:Contributions/213.229.135.66|213.229.135.66]] ([[User talk:213.229.135.66|talk]]) 15:06, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
 \pmod, try it and see for yourself [[Special:Contributions/94.208.111.0|94.208.111.0]] ([[User talk:94.208.111.0|talk]]) 20:07, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

== Position of the Mathematical Symbols ==

Should the symbols be included in the text chapter or as an appendix? --[[User:Krishnavedala|ElectroKid]] ([[User talk:Krishnavedala|talk]]) 16:27, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

== align or flalign ==
Other webpages suggest using align for multiline math [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/displays.html]. What exactly is the difference between flalign and align? The [ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf documentation] doesn't say, but my testing seems to indicate that flaalign forces multicolumn displays (i.e. where more than two &amp; symbols are used per line) to be the far-left and far-right of the screen. Is that correct? If so, I think it would be more appropriate to use align as the recommended environment.-[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 16:47, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

Also, I think the extended detail should be moved to a subpage. It is rather repetitive at the moment -[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 17:38, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

I think there is a typo in the flalign examples in the sections with names that start with &quot;Several formulas, any alignment&quot;.  They read like this:
  foo = bar =
      = baz =
      = quux

But, shouldn't the equal sign either come at the end of the line or start of the next line instead of both?

== mathit ==
We should mention &lt;code&gt;\mathit{}&lt;/code&gt; [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/msg/4beffd99981d8230] somewhere.

== Split page ==

This page is becoming unwieldy, and I have created a new page called [[LaTeX/Advanced Mathematics]], and started to move some of the content over there. Any ideas on what should be kept on each page? -[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 15:56, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

==Array Example==
The begin array {l l} looks a lot like {1 1}.  Can this be fixed somehow?&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:66.167.250.209|66.167.250.209]] ([[User talk:66.167.250.209|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.167.250.209|contribs]]) 00:53, 1 March 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: It looks all right in my browser (Opera on Linux). Probably just a question of fonts. You can always [[Wikibooks:be bold|be bold]] and add or reference a note on alignment options. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:13, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

== Partial derivative symbol ==
I think &lt;code&gt;\partial&lt;/code&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/∂] should be included on this page.

== Discussion of integrals is problematic ==

The d before the integration variable is usually (most physics texts) italicized like the rest of the equation. One could use units (e.g. km) to illustrate the usage of \mathrm... [[User:Boeremoer|Boeremoer]] ([[User talk:Boeremoer|talk]]) 20:04, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

Indeed---my math texts also use normal math-mode text. --[[User:Lucasreddinger|Lucasreddinger]] ([[User talk:Lucasreddinger|talk]]) 07:04, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

Agreed. Although I know of some publications that do the \mathrm{d}, the 'house style' of the mathematics research journal that I am an editor for (and, for example, the American Math Soc journals) do not do this.

== Extend closing root ==
The closing root does not work correctly when specifying a magnitude. While this is explained in the text, the following code allows the magnitude to be specified and displayed correctly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\newcommand{\closingsqrt}[2][\ ]{
	\setbox0=\hbox{\ensuremath{\sqrt[#1]{#2\,}}}\dimen0=\ht0
	\advance\dimen0-0.2\ht0
	\setbox2=\hbox{\vrule height\ht0 depth -\dimen0}
	{\box0\lower0.5pt\box2\:}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a slightly refined version of the code presented in the roots section and adds a small space after the closing tick, which helps especially when there is a closing parenthesis touching the sqrt.  If the community agrees that this version works, then it ought to replace the code currently in the roots section.

== \Alpha, \Beta ... ==

I do believe the greek letters whitch are equal to our characters aren't made in LaTeX. If you want to use the \Alpha command, you get an error, you have to use A. I saw this by translating the page to dutch. --[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 16:01, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: This is already mentioned on the page: [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Greek_letters]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:35, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: I think he refers to section [[LaTeX/Mathematics#List_of_Mathematical_Symbols]]. It confused me as well. It is good that it is mentioned in [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Greek_letters]], but should still be corrected in section [[LaTeX/Mathematics#List_of_Mathematical_Symbols]]. -- Matthias

: I agree, this is an important error that should be corrected both in Greek Letters and in the List of Mathematical Symbols. For a reference, see ftp://ftp.di.uminho.pt/pub/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf , page 50.

== \mathrm vs. \text ==

This suggests using \text to put text in equations.  But the examples I have seen of actual math in Wikipedia (i.e., when editing the article) use \mathrm.  Are these equivalent, or if not, which should be used when? [[User:Asmeurer|Asmeurer]] ([[User talk:Asmeurer|talk]]) 04:20, 12 December 2010 (UTC)
: It's a mess. \mathrm changes the typeface and stays in mathmode and so normally should not be used in order to set text, for example it treats &quot;-&quot; as minus instead of hyphen. \text is the Latex solution, but does not work correctly in mediawiki, as it cannot display umlauts, whereas umlauts can be emulated in mathmode via the \ddot notation. \mbox works with umlauts, but for sure also has issues. 
: \mu\mathrm{-fast\;\ddot uberall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\mathrm{-fast\;\ddot uberall} &lt;/math&gt;
: \mu\mbox{-fast überall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\mbox{-fast überall}&lt;/math&gt;
: \mu\text{-fast ueberall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\text{-fast ueberall} &lt;/math&gt;
: --[[User:Erzbischof|Erzbischof]] ([[User talk:Erzbischof|talk]]) 11:16, 5 January 2011 (UTC)

== &quot;closed&quot; roots ==
The trick to make square root signs &quot;close&quot; over their contents (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Roots) _can_ be made to work with multiple roots. See: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29834/closed-square-root-symbol
Maybe this can be updated?

== \mathrm vs. \textup ==

Many times I read that &quot;symbol xyz should be typeset upright to make clear it's not an ordinary variable&quot; (e.g., for the differential d), and then the example goes on to use \mathrm.
A better approach would be to use \textup which expresses exactly what you want to have, namely upright text. In addition to clarity, the added advantage is that -- unlike \mathrm -- it doesn't change other properties of the font and would work properly in, e.g., sans-serif texts.

Unfortunately, Mediawiki doesn't seem to support \textup now (2012-06-07).

== Spacing in simple slanted fractions ==

I'd suggest adding a negative space after a numenator in a slanted fraction.
That would be
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
${}^1\!/_2$
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
{}^1\!/_2
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
versus
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
${}^1/_2$
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
{}^1/_2
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
The former one seems to me somewhat nicer (even that sfrac/nicefrac).

== Isn't the equation environment different from equation*? ==

The article barely mentions the equation environment, which I believe is a Latex environment. Yet the equation* environment is prominent even though it's an amsmath exclusive. The article should clearly distinguish between them. [[Special:Contributions/71.163.58.61|71.163.58.61]] ([[User talk:71.163.58.61|discuss]]) 23:16, 28 September 2012 (UTC)

== Colors ==

I added the [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Color|color]] section to this, but couldn't add my parts on fixing the spacing around parts of equations, because it looks like Wikibooks doesn't support things like \mathbin. Any ideas on improving this section would be helpful.
[[User:Ntypanski|Ntypanski]] ([[User talk:Ntypanski|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ntypanski|contribs]]) 23:49, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

== Limits example doesn't render as shown here on my MikTeX 2.9 ==

Under [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Operators]] an example is given for using \lim:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

but I get something like
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \mathrm{lim}_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lim}_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

unless I do
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

I'm happy to correct/update this, but just wanted to check that it's not a quirk of my setup (some unusual package perhaps).  The behvaiour is the same with and without the amsmath package, which is the only explicitly maths-related package I call.

Also this post as stackexchange implies that what I need to do is right:

--[[User:ChrisHodgesUK|ChrisHodgesUK]] ([[User talk:ChrisHodgesUK|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ChrisHodgesUK|contribs]]) 15:25, 8 August 2013 (UTC)

The answer to this might be you are in an inline formula, where the subscript is placed as subscript. To get the maths, are you using \(…\) or $…$, or \[…\] or $$…$$? If you are using one of the first two, see if \displaystyle before \lim has the same effect as \limits after it. If it does, the answer is you are using inline math, which is not displayed, and has no default underscripts but only subscripts. \limits forces the underscript. \displaystyle forces the math to be displayed rather than inline. $$…$$ \[…\] mean displayed math, so see if \lim with neither \limits nor \displaystyle in there gets the expected output. If everything goes as I predicted, your question is answered. Otherwise, try asking it on stack exchange. Btw \limits is obligatory with integrals even in displayed math.

== \mathscr ==

The \mathscr command from the mathrsfs package covers only uppercase letters. For lowercase letters, you must define a math font, otherwise the letters will not get typesetted, but just completely vanish from the output pdf. For example, you can add&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
\usepackage{unicode-math}&lt;br /&gt;
\setmathfont{XITS Math}&lt;br /&gt;
\setmathfont[version=setB,StylisticSet=1]{XITS Math}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
to the preamble. Of course, supposing you have XITS Math installed on you computer. [[User:MGorrone|MGorrone]] ([[User talk:MGorrone|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MGorrone|contribs]]) 15:00, 28 December 2013 (UTC)

:: Partially confirmed.  I downloaded the three images and [[w:diff|diff]]'ed them.  &lt;code&gt;x \in [-1,1]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x \in {[-1,1]}&lt;/code&gt; are byte-by-byte-identical.  &lt;code&gt;x \in {[{-1},1]}&lt;/code&gt; is indeed different, with the comma slightly offset to the right.  I haven't tried with DVI/PDF, but I think we can say this is not important for PNG output.  Anyways, I doubt whether this make a difference for average users.

'''Chicken Broccoli Alfredo''' works with all types of pasta and noodles and can be modified for use with a variety of sauces. It is great for family dinners and recommended to serve with [[Cookbook:Garlic bread|garlic bread]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound (450 g) boneless [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], or [[Cookbook:Half and Half|half and half]] if preferred
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|white flour]]
* ¼ cup chopped [[cookbook:onion|small onion]] or [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 1 teaspoon [[cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]], chopped
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]]
* 2 cups [[cookbook:pasta|fettuccini pasta]]
* ½ cup grated [[cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 1 tablespoon cooking [[cookbook:oil|oil]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
#Heat up oil slightly in a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] over a medium flame. 
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] chicken breasts and shallots in hot oil for 5 minutes or until golden brown.  Add lemon juice to chicken and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Remove chicken from flame. Reserve juices.  Transfer chicken into a casserole dish. 
#Melt butter in clean frying pan.  Add flour to butter and stir for about 3 minutes.  
#Slowly add half and half, stirring continuously.  Add all spices and seasonings to sauce. 
#Stir in reserved juices and keep stirring. Reduce heat and slowly stir in Parmesan cheese. 
#Keep stirring until a smooth consistency is achieved. Pour sauce over chicken in [[Cookbook:Casserole#Enameled Cast Iron|casserole dish]]. 
#Cover and [[Cookbook:Baking|bake]] for 20 minutes at 350°F (175°C).
#While chicken is cooking, prepare pasta.  When chicken is done, serve immediately.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* The thyme and oregano can be replaced by 1 teaspoon [[cookbook:za'atar|zaatar]]

The Armature Object in itself is a tool for the animator to move an object or group of vertices in a reliable way. An armature is made of bones, which can be parented to each other, or connected to each other. It was built with the idea of a skeleton in mind. And in fact, in the 3D world with animation inclusive, its considered to be the skeleton.

You can add it using the SPACEKEY in 3Dview and selecting Armature. You'll then enter into Edit Mode where you can add or move bones to build your default rig. An armature has 3 states. You can switch using the dropdown menu in the header of the 3Dview or use the TABKEY to switch between Editmode &lt;-&gt; [Objectmode|Posemode] and CTRL-TABKEY to switch between Objectmode &lt;--&gt;Posemode:
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/object|Object Mode]]: Your armature is like any other Object, you can move it around the scene, scale it, rotate it and edit options in the button window.
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/edit|Edit Mode]]: Your armature is in what we call rest position, you can modify the bones it contains.
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/pose|Pose Mode]]: Your armature is ready to be animated, each bone can be moved, scaled or rotated, constraints get applied, you can pose your character and animate the bones' behavior over time. &lt;br&gt;Take note that Pose mode is now a state of the armature you can switch on/off using CTRL-TABKEY. So when in Pose, you are still in object mode (you can select another object, contrary to the edit-mode)

Note: The following 3 pages of this tutorial contain screenshots and discuss techniques that are only available in Blender 2.40a and later. Refer to [http://www.blender.org/cms/Blender_2_40_alpha.598.0.html the Blender 2.40a release notes ] on Armature draw types and Armature envelopes.

== Login problems ==

I created an account and it said that the account was created but I have cookies disabled. I exited my browser and came back in. I made sure I have cookies enabled. When I came to the main page, I was logged in, but when I went to another page, I was logged out. I attempted to log in but it again told me I have cookies disabled. I tried on IE and Firefox. What do I do? [[User:68.211.54.128|68.211.54.128]] 20:10, 1 August 2005 (UTC) ([[User:Hermione1980|Hermione1980]])

: I guess it's possible your ISP is blocking cookies, but it seems unlikely. It's also possible that you still haven't configured your browser correctly. If you're using IE, a little warning will appear when it blocks cookies, so check for that. Other that that, there's not a lot I can do. Try your ISPs technical support number if this continues to be a problem. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm having pretty much the same problem: If I enter wikibooks from outside (using a bookmark or typing the URL in the address field), I show as logged in. But follow links within wikibooks, I usually show as not. I don't think my ISP could do that if they tried; rather I think that you have a bug in your cookie detection software. I use MS Internet Explorer 6.0; my privacy level is set to Medium; and I have explicitly set cookies on domain wikibooks.org to Always Allow. Just how do you determine if cookies are enabled? -[[User:TEB728|teb728]] 23:40, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
Oh!! I think I found it: If I stop ZoneAlarm before trying to login, I get logged in. I'll bet it has something to do with my ZA privacy settings. -[[User:TEB728|teb728]] 00:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

==ACT==
Do we have an ACT WikiBook study guide?  If so, where is it?  If not, would it be a good idea to create a new one? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 02:53, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
:I must ask, what is ACT? There are a half-dozen things with that acronym. :-) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:26, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

== Uploading image sources ==
I would like to upload image source files in [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] .odg format so contributors would not have to create an new figure but they could update the existing one. I know I could use SVG, and I will, but at the moment OOo draw is easier to use. Could someone propose extending the list of allowed files to [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] files? --[[User:Iztok.jeras|IzI]] 12:23, 31 August 2005 (UTC)
:None of the regulars of this site have the ability to make such a change. Try http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:49, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

== A slightly different approach to archiving pages ==
This page needs to be archived again.  I would like to propose a slightly different way to do this. Since the page history already contains archives, it should be unnecessary to create a new page for each archive of a discussion page. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:22, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

I tried this out on [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System/Solar_System|a WikiJunior Solar System Talk Page]].  Here's the procedure:
#Turn the current version of the page into an &quot;archived&quot; page.
##Put a message at the top of the current page -- ''this is an archive page; please do not edit.''
##Save as a minor edit. Summary: ''Designated as archive page''
##Go to '''history''', click date of most recent version. Copy the complete URL. Call this THIS_URL&amp;oldid=12345
#Create the &quot;new&quot; version of the page
##Edit the current page
##Remove the &quot;this is an archive page&quot; notice
##Create or update &quot;list of archived pages&quot; ''ex: &lt;nowiki&gt;* [THIS_URL&amp;oldid=12345 2005-09-01] --~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;''
##Create or update list of &quot;see also&quot; links
##Remove the &quot;stale&quot; discussions
##Create or update FAQ and other related pages and move information there.
##Save.  Summary: ''Archived.  Moved stuff to xx and yy and zz.''

===Pros===
Does not create a new page just for storing a &quot;static&quot; old page.
===Cons===
If someone '''did''' accidentally edit one of the &quot;archive pages&quot;, they would cause a reversion to the archived page.  
Someone else would probably catch on, though, and decide to add the newbie's text to the NEWEST version of the discussion
== [[Christianity]] -- book or wikicity?==
So far, this wikibook looks like a website containing a categorized collecion of useful links.  There is no outline or introduction to explain how the finished work will serve as a textbook.
Would [http://wikicities.org wikicities] be a more congenial home for it? --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:08, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
:There seems to be something of an edit war on that page at the moment between [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] and an anonymous user. [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] has moved the anonymous user's contributions to the page [[Christianity/Overview]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:06, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
::Neither version looks like a textbook, or like it has plans to grow into a textbook. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:47, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

I would strongly beg to differ that this has no plans to be a textbook.  IMHO this Wikibook is an outstanding example of an annotated text (the Bible in this case) which I would actually use in both theological studies classes that I teach (currently to a group of 6-year-olds, but that is another story), as well as a good source material for doing a comparison study between differing versions of the bible.  The problem is that trying to get something going like this is an incredibly difficult task, which can only get screwed up by somebody not understanding the format of the Wikibook.  I am also impressed that Atrash has tried to not push things away and get them deleted, but rather provided a more appropriate forum for such discussions and comments with the Overview section.

This has also been the subject of a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Biblical Studies/Christianity/John 2|Vote for Deletion]] already in the past, which the concensus was to keep.  

In terms of &quot;new&quot; Overview section, I think it would be hard to keep a NPOV approach, but I'm also willing to try and see what contributors would want to do first.  All of the topics listed in the Overview section would make a find addition to a general book about Christianity, especially to fellow Christians.  Certainly a discussion about faith should not be prohibited from a place like Wikibooks, and the faith-based articles on Wikipedia seem to work out in the end...although they do sometimes get rather contentious.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== Major overhaul of Wikibooks policy (again) ==

Recently there has been a lot of discussion of what does and doesn't constitute a Wikibook. Due to the confusing nature of the current definitions, a policy-tightening vote is being proposed.

Please visit [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote]] and contribute and express your opinion.

Please take note that anything that passes a vote will mean sweeping changes for many popular Wikibooks, but there will be a good warning given both before voting begins and before any move is made.

Thank you. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:30, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Yo, Garrett, you still included [[Christianity]]: The Book as non-book on Wikibooks:Policy/Vote even with some positive statements above and with the recent problem of which version was up front. The recent anonymous editor on Christianity who erased the translation/paraphrase/annotation to post the external link [http://www.wikichristian.org] evidently just lost that website, so those links may go in a few days. The anon does not seem to want to discuss sharing resources, so be it. Do you want the scholarly approach or not? One of the Google ads for keyword God/Religion on Wikicities cannot coexist with a page of the Bible (POV) Yes, Christianity is contentious, it has been that way for 2000 years, yet what is the alternative for the so-called moral majority (POV). You have said that Jimbo Wales is not “God,” but in his spirit, I quote, “keep editing wide open for everyone, but restrict the ability to post external links to people who are trusted by that community. Make it really easy for trusted users to extend the zone of trust, because you want to encourage participation.” [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 06:37, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Books on Christianity are certainly appropriate for this project, as Rob has said. But all such books will need to take a scholarly approach. For example, study guides et cetera for bible studies courses are ok. But a website to link Christians together or to serve missionary purposes no longer qualifies as a book and belongs elsewhere on the web. (And it's not like the only two choices in the world are Wikibooks or Wikicities; people are free to set up their own web servers and run mediawiki on it.) If there's been a change between the book/nonbook status of [[Christianity]] I'm sure that Garrett will remove it as an example.&lt;p&gt;(I've posted a whole list of non-books and other tangents on the [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote|talk page]]. I've even added a section of really cool books that will indeed be a loss for wikibooks, but a gain for wikicities. But it seems necessary if we are to be consitent about the policy we are stiving for. This section of my comment has nothing to do with the Christianity work, which, to repeat, is appropriate for Wikibooks provided it's scoped appropriately as a textbook, and not as a single web-resource for anything and everything Christian.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 06:59, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Yes I see. I missed all but the beginning of the above issue. But it's certainly looking like a cohesive book after all so I've removed it from the examples. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:42, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:It seems to me that there ought to be opposing oppinions and quotes on the voting page as well, to remove bias from it.  Especially since a few of them are based off only the experience of the quoted person (for example- my local library actually has a large selection of video game help guides).  Something just seems wrong to me for a voting page to be biased to one side of the issue.  The topics should be either worded neutrally, or all have counterarguments.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 19:47, September 9, 2005 (UTC)
::Voting hasn't begun yet primarily because the options haven't been determined. For the real discussion go to the [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote|talk page]]. The options currently listed was just a first draft attempt: it's a very iterative process, and we won't figure out how to get it right until we get it wrong a couple of times first. I think the library quote is from something I once said. However, given the discussion since then I think that idea is dead in the water: It would include unsavory books and exclude some good books. Before voting begins it's likely all of the options will change. Or, it's possible we'll, though reaching consensus, only be deciding to approve or disapprove a single, spelled out policy. Please do raise your concerns about the books you want either to remain on Wikibooks or to be removed from Wikibooks. For example, there was concern about &quot;no fiction&quot; wording that worried some people that their language instruction guides couldn't use characters saying example French sentences. One possible wording, which I would like to put up for vote, would clearly allow for such &quot;example fiction.&quot; [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:05, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Rendering problems 2nd time ==
The [[HSE_Primes| HSME]] book seems to be having problems. It's centre justified. To see the problem for yourselves go to [[HSE_Primes| Primes ]]. What is the problem? Can someone tell me if there's a plan to fix it? This is bloody annoying! [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:46, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:It appears that using MathML whenever possible is the problem [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:50, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
::I see no problems when using Always PNG and PNG if Simple, so I'd say that is the problem. Hm. Well it's either the browser or MediaWiki not implementing MathML correctly; either way it will take time to fix.

== Merging of Forks Action Taken ==
This is a message to all Admins and Bureaus here. As some of you know I have begun enforcing the [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]] on the [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] books. I have reviewed the policy and the history of the conflict and I have determined to take action.

User [[User:Panic2k4]] has requested that another Admin review this case. I hope several of you can take some time out of your other duties to assist us.

There is a certain danger in taking action for a policy that has not been enforced for a long time. For one, it is not fair to the contributors and those whose works are affected the most. Moving forward we must be consistent and faithful to our policies. Sending mixed signals by selectively enforcing only some policies harms the project. Thus, for this transition we must be extra dilligent in being as open as possible (as we always must be).

It was not an easy decision to give the merge ultimatum. However, I believe as a member of this community my duty is to assist, as I can, in growing the project and getting, keeping, and respecting contributors. I myself am an expert in C++ and anecdotally I can tell you I was at a loss as to which book I could contribute to. Particularly given that Programming:C_plus_plus, the book with the more professional name, had a large and confusely-worded message on the front that would lead one to believe the Programming:C_plus_plus page could not be edited at all until &quot;the merge dispute&quot; was over (even though the issue was with the talk page not being ready for edits). The resulting state so far has been one where there is a rather insular project that potential contributors are scared off from touching or fixing up, and where existing contributors leave in frustration. To develop collaborative works it is essential to reach consensus and be flexible. Allowing people to fork off works over trivial formatting issues is counter to the spirit of collaboration.

As a side note, when reviewing this case I have also noticed the use of certain templates placed on other books, both of which were created by Panic2k4. One template was determined to tell users a policy that belongs to MeatBall, and not WikiBooks. The other template was a banner for other books that I felt were redundant with our bookshelves and distracted from the important &quot;front-cover&quot; page where a book has a chance to really sell and describe itself. (The &quot;Foreword&quot; template was similarly intrusive on front pages.) I have removed almost all uses of these templates in the interest of not scaring off contributors and in allowing books to keep their own front-cover characteristics. (In the history of the pages you will see I am not the only user who has taken issue with their use.) This secondary, non-merge action on my part should also be reviewed. If I had made any mistakes in this lengthy template-removal process I would appreciate if anyone could bring it to my attention. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:47, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Question about link to a commercial site ==
Hello, I just added a link on the [[Neapolitan/sites]] resources page to a bookstore in Naples, Italy that carries the largest selection of Neapolitan related materials that I know of.  Is this kosher?  Neapolitan language materials can be quite difficult to come by.[[User:E. abu Filumena|E. abu Filumena]] 08:30, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

:As long as it doesn't look like you're encouraging use of and/or advertising for that site, sales-related links should be OK. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:16, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Beta game ==

I was wondering if I could create a guide for the Mac only MMORPG Oberin, it IS in beta and I know that you can't create Wikipedia articles about beta games. Just posting this to make sure it's ok.

-Drizzt
:A more suitable place for such a guide might be http://gameinfo.wikicities.com/. While we currently do have some game guides on wikibooks there's a chance they will all be transwikied to Wikicities in the not too distant future. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:26, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

::I hope that new Wikibook authors don't get discouraged from statements like the one above.  While game guides ''may be transwikied'' somewhere else, that discussion, much less any formal project-wide vote on the topic, has yet to take place.  Like anything else in this forum, take anything you read with a grain of salt and don't take any person's word for it that something is official policy unless it is in the policy pages.  Even then, the policy can be changed and updated.  There are over 10,000 registered users on Wikibooks, and even more than 30 admins.  If you have a vote with less than 10 votes for approval on a topic, you really havn't had &quot;concensus&quot; of the community.  Anything less is just a call for opinions to confirm an attitude of your own.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:57, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

==The Descent of Man==
I started working on a book that was already listed as a title . It was actually mistitled the Descendant of Man but I assumed it was supposed to be Darwin's book. I have summarized 7 chapters of the Descent of Man, but I don't know if I should continue. It's not on a bookshelf but can be found by clicking on &quot;by category&quot; going to the bottom of the page and clicking on science and then biology. Please tell me what I should do. I don't know how to put it on a bookshelf so someone would have to do that if you thought it should be there. [[User:M.Parshall|M.Parshall]]11 September 2005

:When you say you started working on it, do you mean it was a &quot;redlink&quot; (like your signoff name is now) or was there already content there? I can't find anything other than what you've written. I don't think there's any problem with what you've written.
:I've added it to [[Wikibooks:Science bookshelf#Life Sciences]]. If Life Sciences isn't quite right feel free to move it under the more accurate heading.
:I notice you added a link in the category, but the category system actually works the other way around. You put the category's name in brackets on the book's first page; for example putting &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Biology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; there will make it automatically show up in [[:Category:Biology]].
:I also notice you've moved this from [[Charles Darwin - The Descent of Man]] to [[The Descent of Man]]. You should use the move tab at the top of each page in future, changing links as necessary. Using the move command will keep the editing history of that page, whereas a copy-n-paste won't. But don't worry, it can be easily fixed.
:Anyway, if you have any other queries or problems don't hesitate to post them. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

== Using my own contributions elsewhere ==

I was wondering about an author's use of his own Wikibooks contributions.  Can I publish  (some of) my own contributions under a non-free, non-open license?  The idea would be this.  Someone who gets my contributed content from Wikibooks would be free to use it in the usual open license manner.  But someone who gets content from the non-free publication would face the usual restrictions for published non-open books.  Where the content is identical, the distinction becomes moot since they can ''say'' they got it from Wikibooks and there would be no way to show otherwise&amp;mdash;and who cares anyway.  Where the non-open content is a slightly modified version of the Wikibooks version, then only the Wikibooks version (or a version derived from it by someone else) could be used.  Basically, I might want to publish a non-open license book that includes some (possibly updated) material contributed to Wikibooks but includes significant other material as well&amp;mdash;and I might want to do that without having the whole work forced to be open-licensed.  I am unclear whether the GFDL or Creative Commons license allows this.  It would not allow me to do this with someone else's open license contributions.  But would it allow me to do this with my own?  The issue is, at least as far as I am concerned only relevant to content spanning several modules, not to bits and pieces.--[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 00:17, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:Nope. You relinquish such rights when you release your work under the GFDL. According to the GFDL, ALL derivative works must be under a similar free license. And so unfortunately you'd need to go through the rigamarole of putting the entire text of the GFDL somewhere in the book.
:In fact, to publish it otherwise would be illegal. Yes, that's right; technically, we could sue you if you did this. Crazy huh? :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::This is totally wrong. He has merely licensed the work. He has not transferred copyright. After licensing as GFDL, he can then license the work under any other license as well. He just can't revoke the GFDL or attempt to relicense something he doesn't own copyright to. He certainly doesn't need to worry about complying with a license which he himself has granted; his rights are far greater. You could only sue him if he used your contributions. Note that trivial stuff, like near-robotic spelling fixes, would not count because they do not contain artistic expression. (As always, this is not to be considered legal advice.) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:23, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::What came first the egg or the chicken ? that is the problem he must be able to prove that a more restrictive license was used before the GFDL (see the text below), GFDL is no exclusive but after you implement it future work falls under it--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::::No, he doesn't.  He owns the copyright on what he wrote.  That means he can relicense it at any time he so chooses.  However, anyone who got a copy of the content through a previous license does not get their copy revoked.  In other words, I can write an article here then release another version (or the same version) anywhere else I want under any license I want.  Only the version found on this site would be GFDLed.  Check out similar situation in software with dual licensed products.  Which one you use first does not matter whatsoever.  

:::::Sorry for my bad wording, were I say restrictive (= any prev. license, be it more or less restrictive) future (= derivative) the rest of your comment does agree with my statement--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:39, 13 September 2005 (UTC) 

::::The others are also right when they point out this only goes for his contributions.  Non-trivial changes to his contributions would be copyrighted by the authors, and publishing those under a different license would be copyright infringement.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:36, September 12, 2005 (UTC)

:::Albert is correct. The user allowed a specific '''copy''' of his work to be placed under the GFDL, for use in wikibooks. He still has rights to the original version of this work and any works he personally derives from his original work. IIRC, once there are contributions to his original work on wikibooks, he may not copy those changes as well without abiding by the GFDL (since those modifications are subject to it and they are not '''his''' work). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:55, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Oh, I guess I misinterpreted what he was proposing. I do wonder about what Panic's saying though; if that's true I'm basically screwed as far as my none-too-dissimilar GameFAQs publishing problem goes. Hm. :( [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Perhaps the last two paragraphs of [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-violation.html http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-violation.html] are relevant.  They would appear to support Albert and Kellen.  Or perhaps I can be sued but only by myself?  Of course, (as Gabe and Kellen pointed out), any ability to reuse my own stuff can apply only to my own original contributions and not to modifications contributed by others. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 20:06, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Hi JMRyan: I have one question, if you'd rather keep a closed license on your own work, why even release a little bit of it as GFDL in the first place? For example, you could release the &quot;first edition&quot; of some work as GFDL, and then develop a &quot;closed second edition&quot; based on that, but the &quot;GFDL second edition&quot; would have changes you could only use in a strict GFDL sense (and, for example, could not be part of the &quot;closed second edition&quot;). It seems the advantages of opening it won't ever be reaped and it might be in your best interest to keep it all closed. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:24, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::Well, I saw part of a book that need work and so I started working. It turns out that almost all of my contribution consists of adding of new modules.  Then it occurred to me that I might someday what to publish a text covering mostly the same ground.  It probably won't really happen, but the thought did occur to me.  It would ''not'' be a 'Best of My Wiki Contributions' published as a closed book.  I would more or less restart more or less from scratch, but there would be enough overlap in organization and style that there might be copywrite issues if I am not allowed to reuse my open stuff in a closed book.  Some ideas I think I might have for what might go into a closed book cut too close to original research and non-neutral POV to be appropriate for a Wikibook&amp;mdash;indeed that would be a primary purpose of the closed version. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:19, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::That makes sense. I must say that contributing to an open book is giving away a lot of capital, and really the only comfort is that other people will need to keep your work just as open if they intend to improve upon it. For your particular case you could take your GFDL contribution and add all of the non-NPOV and original research material you like. While those aren't allowed on Wikibooks, the GFDL allows for it. Thus you can leverage other's contributions for your own book. So, in your particular case you don't need to go closed. You can stay in GFDL the whole time. Another reason I thought someone might do this would be to put a first edition on WB, wait until it generates a good reputation and use, and then charge for an improved but closed second edition (that would not have any other contributions in it). In such a case, you're stuck doing all of the work, can't benefit from the community, and are really only using WB as word of mouth space. The only hitch in such a business plan is that the communities second edition might be stiff competition with your own second edition. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:49, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

==Printable version of pages vs GFDL==

When any one selects this option available in every wikipage the only reference to the location/license is...

Retrieved from &lt;wikibooks page&gt;
 This page was last modified 02:24, 13 September 2005. Content is available under GNU Free Documentation License.

Since the previsible use of the function is the intended printing of a stand alone (on independet page as it doesn't force or shows the full work) to hard copy, any reference to a direct link to the GFDL is missing or a slow mail way of obtaining one, and no reference to the authors or any &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; (section) or reference to stand alone works that the new derevative uses.

from point 6 of the GFDL as it can be reached from the footnote in any page that links to http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html 

&quot;You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.&quot;

Can this be a problem?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:57, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:A user printing out a version for their own use does ''not'' need to print out the license. Only when someone is actually distributing the document (i.e., beyond their own use) would they need to include a copy of the license. If someone is printing and binding these books for sale (as a form of distributing) or forking on their own site (another form of distribution) they'll need to include the license. The license should be someplace where someone should reasonably be able to get a hold of it. Including the license itself everywhere would be equivalent to the GNU &quot;cat&quot; command outputting the GPL each time it is run. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:11, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::There are some problems with your view:
::1) You are making assumptions...
::2) The License doesn't state that difference so it has no regard for the intended use of a copy, has to deal with ANY copy. (does it state your &quot;limited&quot; use ?)
::3) Again, and for what I do (not much, sorry) fallow in this page most people that should know the limits and impositions of the GFDL seem to have divergent opinions or personal interpretations (writers/administrators), that can lead to real pains if ever chalenged.
::4) Probably, including a limited list of do's and don'ts (that could be made into a stated policy since the license in itself can't be changed) and a link to the snail mail (GNU, were a copy can be obtained should be added to every work and also made into a policy, this is not a proposal only an hipotesys) would be a good idea, this would help writers know theyer rights and limitations even if they don't want to &quot;trace&quot; the license for every &quot;bug&quot; and is common knolege that it has some... and even more if aplied to electronic works (sutch as the present framework), I as a simple user do have problems fallowing every policy and debates, and I don't think of me as being IT chalanged, and at least for now not every person has/needs a law degree, so the wording should be made accessible to every one, and the age factor of the contributors doesn't help also.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:::THe licenese requires you to give a copy of the license upon *distribution* of the text.  Printing a copy for personal use is not distribution- you aren't giving it to anyone.  This is the same reason you can make a change to a GPLed program for personal use and not distirbute the change- the clause is a limitation on &lt;b&gt;distribution&lt;/b&gt;, not on &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt;.

:::There isn't really any ambiguity here at all, just very carefully worded legalese by some very smart people.  Just remember, distribution is not use.  You can use a GFDL text in any way you want- read it, make copies of it, draw scribbles over it, light it on fire, even alter invariant sections.  When you give copies of it away, only then does the GFDL apply.  The GFDL is a grant of distribbution rights, not a EULA.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:18, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::I think that you interpretation is correct (but only addresses part of the hipotetical problem), another point of view is that wikimedia is indeed a destribution veicule and the printed version is &quot;edited&quot; on site, and so the resulting copy is first provided on site, it's probaly equal to a user having the hole work with all the needed references to the rights and providing edited copies to a (let say) small number of other people without the license, so were is the limit of an the &quot;use&quot; and remember that there is't another evident way of getting a printer ready copy, or in most works a complete copy with all the needed section, references.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:09, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::I'm having a bit of trouble understanding your argument, so forgive me if I'm getting it wrong.  Yes, wikimedia is a distribution vehicle.  It also offers the license and everything else needed to by the license.  However, it isn't necessary for all of it to be on the same webpage, merely for it all to be available to you at no extra charge.  On printable pages, the site doesn't need to force you to print out the license as well-  it gave you a link to the license already, your printing out a copy is a &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt; of the copy you already downloaded (under fair use laws which allow time and space shifting of media, see Universal v. Sony, the Betamax case), not a new distribution.  You are free to print that out too if you want.  If you are printing out copies to distribute to other people, you need to include the license (although for small distribution eg you giving a copy to a friend or two, nobody coares.) --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:42, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::Careful... [[w:Sony_Corp._v._Universal_City_Studios]] doesn't mean what you said it means.  It means that people can make devices that have substantially non-infringing uses with regard to copyright.  It didn't speak at all to &quot;fair use&quot;.  It could be argued that a copyright holder could restrict you from printing something that you had downloaded, and you would have no &quot;fair use&quot; safe harbor. The Betamax Case is not a license to time-shift.  Only to make devices that aren't strictly for piracy.  (However, the recent [[w:MGM_v._Grokster]] case may unsettle that, making the Betamax case more or less irrelevant.) --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 22:10, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::You should probably have to read it all to understed the several problems I pointed out and the development on the several comments, I'll try to resume all without comments, but see ref. to point 6 of the license on the first post (It's getting long)...
::::::1) Printed copy should have more than a reference to the licence, like a location in slow mail to obtain a full copy, and probably not a link to the original page but to the root of the work (or acumulate them), and/or a reference to the &quot;personal use&quot; since &quot;sections&quot; of the work &quot;may&quot; not be split.
::::::2) A complete version of every work, &quot;print ready&quot; with the full license should be available in every work (trasnclusions) to a &quot;monolithic&quot; page is a solution.
::::::3) Web use or electronic use as in Wikimedia doesn't seem to have a problem since the links are on every page.
::::::4) A common and voted on interpretation of the license should be created without the &quot;wierd&quot; legal mumbo-jumbo, to make it accessible to every reader, this should be centralized and aggregate every conclusion about the use of GFDL in Wikibooks.
::::::5) A policy that resquires a link to that explanation (with the url) should be used on for intance the introduction or foreword or any author(s) section of a book, so to desmistify and clear any personal interpretations of future writers and protect derivative works (edits that add some content are derivative works, there are also at present some mirror services not all run by wikimedia that host copies of the works).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:35, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

I would like to add that I did include the GFDL in the last copy of material I printed from Wikibooks material.  You are correct that every &quot;complete&quot; version must include this text (which is quite lengthy... about 6 pages altogether even at a reduced print size).  That makes printing out a single page from here something that is very awkward.  BTW, if you &quot;save this page&quot; with Mozilla or Firefox, it downloads a copy of the GFDL with the web page as a part of the image inclusions.  I can't comment about other browsers, but I would suspect similar actions, based on the html script for these pages.  This is far from a simple web link, and no new policy needs to be done.

As far as requiring people to use the GFDL, the notice is about as clear as it can be without having the full text of the GFDL in its entirety on each and every web page.  If that is the case that we need to do that, I suggest that we hold a vote to get rid of the GFDL for Wikibooks and perhaps restart the whole project.  I'm not ready to do that, nor do I think that was the intention of the Free Software Foundation.

For printed works, it is more a &quot;buyer beware&quot; in terms of people grabbing content from Wikibooks and thinking it is free public domain stuff that they can use however they want.  If you try to make a derivitive work of this content, you need to understand the copyright nature of this stuff, and the fact that many people (including myself) claim copyright on everything that we do here.  In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation is specifically excempting themselves from copyrighting just about anything on any of its projects in order to avoid legal hassles, but you are legally liable for anything that you put down in any of these projects.  If you copy the material from these sites, you need to get permission from each and every author before it can be published.  By the nature of what we do here, that permission is automaticly granted via the GFDL, under the terms of that license, by common concent and by &quot;contract&quot; that you sign each time you press the &quot;Save Page&quot; button for adding text.

IMHO no new policies need to be written, but you are certainly welcome to do so, and submit them to the community as a proposed policy.  After it has been voted on it may become an &quot;enforced policy&quot;, of which there are relatively few here on Wikibooks at the moment.  The text of the GFDL provides more than adequate legal language regarding official policies for how links to this site are concerned, but if you think differently, write the proposed policy and see how other people would like to modify it or support it.  There are reasons for the legal &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot; of all licenses, and a &quot;simplification&quot; of the license language can often over do it.  Mainly the GFDL says &quot;You can use this stuff on the site however you want, you just have to allow others to freely use it too afterward.&quot;  As a simplification, this misses many key points, and that is why the full legal junk has to be there, together with legal commentary on the GPL and GFDL from many sources that would fill books.  Perhaps we need to start one of those books here about the GFDL?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:47, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

[[m:Wikiversity/Vote/en|Voting]] has started for a new Wikimedia sister project proposal called [[m:Wikiversity|Wikiversity]].  This is a request for anybody that is interested to cast a vote either in support or opposition to this new project proposal.

Discussion about this proposal should take place [[m:Talk:Wikiversity|on the Wikiversity discussion page]].

Hi,

We are probably going to delete [[:wikisource:Wikisource:Source code|Wikisource:Source code]]. So I propose that some of these pages to be move here in Wikibooks. Please advise which pages would you like to get in Wikibooks. I propose to discuss this on [[Wikibooks talk:Computer science bookshelf]]. Thanks, [[User:Yann|Yann]] 18:51, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

:It looks like there is some useful content there, perhaps some of which could be used in the [[Computer Science:Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]] book. Overall, though, we're a book project and don't want to just have pages and pages of code. If there's plenty of exposition in addition to the code, that would be great. (As a good guide, for each non-trivial function it would be reasonable to expect three to five paragraphs explaining what exactly it's doing. Sometimes a whole subsection of a chapter is used.)
:Why is this being removed from Wikisource? Perhaps you should make a Wikicity to hold the content for now, until there are contributors ready to turn it into a real book. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:44, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

About Ada Programming sources...

The idea is nice but I see some possible problems, since SourceForge is outside the Wikibooks how does one edit the sources, does it force a registration? using the CVS? and what about the code licenses are they all GFDL? do the authors get credited?, and that is only a solution for big sources, reference code should always be &quot;on&quot; the book, with references to were to get more complete/complex examples...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:32, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

Well you put your finger on all the soure points:
* Sourceforge allow write access only to registered project members.
* You can choose the licence - but its a software licence (we use GPL).
* Authors can be seen only from the cvs log.
* True, we only use SourceForge for &quot;working demos&quot; only and not for code sniplets.
But the advantage of providing fully compiling and fully tested examples to our readers outweight the disadvantage for us. But that might not be true for Programming:C++.

Wikimedia projects are free form, there are no hard and fast rules that claim any page under a given name must be part of the book. This free form nature gives great freedom to contributors. For example, the whole vote for deletion process on wikipedia is just people editing a file, there's no formal voting buttons or things like that. Life changes too much to encode things in the software like that. But even if there were a policy like that, the need for a style-guide would be enough evidence that the policy should change. But this is all moot, considering that (1) style guides are entirely appropriate, (2) it does not matter in any sense if they are or are not part of the book, and (3) many other books do this already.

In [[Rueda_de_Casino]] there is a table, and I want the table to be populated using the pages about the individual commands, e.g., [[Rueda_de_Casino/Abajo]], but I can't work out how to make the template for the commands: [[Template:Rueda_Command]] cause this to happen.

Any &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; or &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that I use in the template is (obviously) evaluated there and then - I can't see how to make it apply to the individual command pages.

I appreciate any help.

I've also written a new [[template:Rueda Command TR]] (table row), so each individual command page does have some duplication, but at least it's not a huge amount.  I'd love to remove that though.

Here's the relevant (and repeating) source:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;includeonly&gt;
 {{Rueda_Command_TR|title=Abajo|english=Down|summary=Walk backwards|related=[[Rueda de Casino/Una Abajo|una abajo]]}}
 &lt;/includeonly&gt; 
 &lt;noinclude&gt;
 
 {{Rueda_Command|title=Abajo|pronunciation=ah-bAH-ho, ah-bAH-yo or ah-bAH-co|english=Down|summary=Walk backwards|related=[[Rueda de Casino/Una Abajo|una abajo]]}} 
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

I've since resolved this with a little strange syntax:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{Rueda_Command&lt;includeonly&gt;_TR&lt;/includeonly&gt;|title=Abajo|english=Down|pronunciation=Ah-bAh-ho|summary=Walk backwards}}
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

This way the template Rueda_Command is used on the real page, and Rueda_Command_TR on the summary page.  It's a bit ugly, and I'm not confident that other people will do it right, so I'm still hoping for a better solution. -- [[User:Ricky clarkson|Ricky Clarkson]], 24th September 2005.

==Naming convention for categories?==
Hi there.  Is there a naming convention for categories?  I've been using quite a few categories in the [[Movie Making Manual]] and I'd like to check that they are legal.  [[:category:Movie Making Manual|Here's a link to the root category]].  And [[Movie_making_manual-how_you_can_help#Categories|here's a link to our &quot;formatting guide&quot; on categories]].  I find that categories are an excellent way to help users to navigate the Movie Making Manual because each page can be in several different categories.  For example, a page on &quot;writing for low budget movies&quot; can be in both the &quot;writing movies&quot; category and in the &quot;low budget filmmaking&quot; category.  Please tell me I'm using categories in a legal way!  I'd hate to have to re-do all the categories. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 13:20 22 Feb 2005 (GMT)

: (Copied from [[Talk:Movie_making_manual#module_naming]]): I don't think there are any conventions for categories. There's not really a lot of categorization going on here right now, so I don't think it's been seen as a real issue. The Cookbook has a lot of categories, but we have somewhat inconsistent names for them (fixing that is on my list of TODO's). I am sort of inclined to have a prefix on all the categories related to a particular book, e.g. &quot;Category:Cookbook:Vegan recipes&quot; or &quot;Category:Movie making:Cinematography&quot; because at some point I can see there being difficult overlaps when we have enough books. Who gets to own Category:Tools? or does that category just get polluted with modules from different books? Seems like the &quot;top level&quot; categories (ones w/o a prefix) should be for categorizing books as a whole, then scoped categories (w/ prefix) should be used w/in books.... but that's just me musing about it.

Yes, there is a naming convention for categories, as outlined in [[WB:NP]].  Each book ''book'' has &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:''book''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; reserved for their own internal organization purposes, with all other categories reserved for inter-book organization.  Currently, book aliasing is on a case-by-case basis, and plans are that any proposal for aliases must be put through [[WB:CCO]] or some other organizational page (ie. so we can get community consensus).  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:09, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== Technical articles on video and film cameras - WP or WB??? ==

Hello.  I am one of the contributers to the [[Movie Making Manual]].  I would like to start a section of the book to cover technical details of various video and film cameras.  These pages will contain information such as: how to operate the camera, the advantages and disadvantages of the camera, the technical specs of the camera etc.  Should these pages be put in the [[Movie Making Manual]] wikibook or in WikiPedia?  I note that a page on the Panasonic HVX200 was [[w:Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Panasonic_HVX200|recently deleted from WP]].

We already have a [[Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Capture_Mediums_and_Recording_Formats/Table_of_HD_Cameras|table listing the tech specs of several cameras]].  (Is this table legitimate WB content?  It's certainly useful and is certainly the sort of thing that text books include.)  My proposal is that the camera names would be wikilinks to more detailed pages about each individual camera.  Should these pages be in WB or WP?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:20 26 Sept 2005 GMT

:: Since uber-detailed descriptions of cameras (and comparisons) would not be considered encyclopedic from some WP viewpoints, I'd say that qualifies for inclusion here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:51, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I think it's appropriate to talk about cameras to the extent necessary to inform the reader of what they need to know and what the important differences and trade offs between technologies are. But any extra information that is just there for the sake of being extra information probably shouldn't be included. Also, it shouldn't become an Amazon-like ratings of equipment: because that then presents a non-NPOV issue. It perhaps might be sufficient to just provide the exact name/model of the camera so that readers can find it elsewhere on the web. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:12, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Great, thanks a lot for your replies... I agree with all you've said.  This brings me on to another, more technical question...  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:14 27 Sept 2005 GMT

:So, some of our cameras have no entries at all in WikiPedia.  Should I start stub-articles on WikiPedia which contain a link to our WikiBook page (like [[w:Genesis (Panavision)|this]])?  Or should I do a &lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT&lt;/nowiki&gt;?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 22:13 27 Sept 2005 GMT

::: Thanks for your reply.  Yeah, I agree: stubs are the way forwards (although, of course, fully written encyclopeadic articles would be even better!).  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:18 28 Sept 2005 GMT

== How to duplicate information between two pages ==

Is there any easy way to duplicate information between two pages?  In particular, I have written a [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] which compares several cameras.  I am planning to also give each camera its own page.  I would like to duplicate the specs from the table to the camera-specific pages.

For example, the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] lists a camera called the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Genesis|Genesis]].  I would like both the table and the camera-specific page to include specs like &quot;resolution&quot; and &quot;view finder&quot;.  What I'd really like is one page where I can declare some variables, like:

 genesis.resolution = 1920x1080
 genesis.viewfiner  = electronic

And then I'd like to be able to call these variables from both the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] and from the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Genesis|Genesis page]].  Does anyone know how I could do this, please? Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:25 27 Sept 2005 GMT

: Hmm... it looks like Ricky Clarkson [[#How_can_I_include_part_of_a_page.3F|has a solution]].  Is this &lt;includeonly&gt; syntax my best bet?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:35 27 Sept 2005 GMT

::I've never used that tag yet myself, but I've seen it enough in Wikipedia templates and such that it must work pretty well.

==Proposed name changes for the [[Movie Making Manual]]==

After several discussions with fellow wikibookians, it seems it's time for me to go through the [[Movie Making Manual]] and change the naming system.  Please can you let me know if these proposed naming systems are &quot;legal&quot;:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|
| '''Current name'''
| '''Proposed name'''
|-
| '''Page names'''
| Movie Making Manual-Page Name
| Movie Making Manual/Page Name
|-
| '''Template names'''
| MMM templateHeader
| MMM/templateHeader
|-
| '''Category names'''
| cinematography
| MMM/cinematography
|-
| '''Picture names'''
| Camera.jpg
| MMM_camera.jpg
|}

Do these proposed names look OK?  I'm asking because I've been told that I need to get community consensus on these names before preceding.  I have already setup a &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect&lt;/nowiki&gt; from [[MMM]] to [[Movie Making Manual]].

Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 21:05 GMT 29 Sept 2005

: I believe you only need consensus on the main prefix, not your book-specific formatting for each thing, but here are some comments anyhow:
:*The page and template names look fine to me. 
:*The category names should probably be in &quot;namespace&quot; format, e.g. &quot;Category:MMM:Cinematography&quot; because the categories don't have any strict hierarchy; a category can be a subcategory of many other categories, so the subpage format is a bit misleading. Of course... you could decide that your categories would only be a subcategory of one other category and then subpage notation might work.
:*Picture naming is fine, but you should consider uploading them to commons instead of here and tagging them with useful categories so that other books/WP entries/etc can make use of them where appropriate.

== Help choosing a name for a book on doing a PhD? ==

Hi,

I'd like to start a book on starting, surviving and completing a PhD.  But I'm having trouble thinking of a name.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Some candidate names:

'''Surviving a PhD'''
* Pros: Catchy
* Cons: It's a bit negative.  A PhD needn't be an unpleasant experience that needs to be &quot;survived&quot;.

'''Doing a PhD'''
* Pros: Gets to the point of the book
* Cons: Sounds a bit crap

'''The PhD'''
* Pros: Nice and short
* Cons: Sounds more like a sociological study on PhDs rather than a how-to guide

'''How to do a PhD'''
* Pros: Gets to the point
* Cons: A bit long

'''PhD How-To'''
* Pros: Gets to the point; nice and short
* Cons: Isn't it just Linux geeks who use the term &quot;how-to&quot; in this way??!!

Any feedback would be much apreciated.  I think my favorite is &quot;Doing a PhD&quot;... or maybe &quot;PhD How-To&quot;.  Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:25 30th Sept 2005

: A PhD friend of mine has voted for ''Surviving a PhD'' - [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 15:00 30th Sept 2005

:I'd go for &quot;Piling it higher and deeper: Survivng a PHD&quot;.  Basicly a vote for #1, I guess.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks for your replies so far.  Yes, I would love the book to include information on doing post-grad research.  I was thinking of a TOC something like:
::*Choosing a subject area
::*Choosing a lab
::*Getting funding
::*Doing the research
::*Writing up
::*The Viva
::*Life after the PhD
:: Please keep the ideas coming... - Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 17:33 30th Sept 2005

:::I would also add: how to read a journal or conference paper; what research isn't (e.g., if a project can't fail then it's not research); how to write a paper and get it accepted (writing and organization tips); how to collaborate with others (e.g. picking people with similar interests, or picking those with very different backgrounds). I'd also add that the best area to get into is the one where you are interested in the incremental results. Most area's &quot;big results&quot; are exciting, but that doesn't mean you'd be suited for doing research in most areas, since most research itself is incremental. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:39, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Hi. MShonle, it sounds like you have loads of great ideas!  Thanks for your feedback.  I'll report back here when I kick off the book.  What name shall we go for?  [[Surviving a PhD]]?  If so, can we use [[PhD]] as an alias for category and template names?  Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:04 GMT 2nd Oct 2005

:::::I would suggest &quot;Surviving and Thriving with Research&quot;. Most people who are in PhD programs already have a boatload of assistance and help (particularly from their advisors). So, perhaps the biggest audience of this book would be the autodidacts who want to learn about PhD programs and research in general without the help of a formal university program. Also, the wider scope tends to suggest some interesting topics. But go with any name you wish. :-) --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:11, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

:I would think something along the lines of &quot;Earning a PhD&quot; or &quot;Working Towards a PhD&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 20:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks for all the feedback.  I like the idea of broadening the scope of the book to include all research, not just the PhD (although it would be good to have a sub-section on PhDs).  Which brings us back to the original question: what to call the book?!  I like Mshonle's idea of &quot;Surviving and Thriving in Research&quot; but I worry that it's a little long.  How about just &quot;Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Working in Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Surviving Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Researcher's Manual&quot;?  (Of course, we mustn't forget that there are several typs of &quot;Researcher&quot;: there's the academic researcher we're talking about, there's the college student and there's TV researcher).

== New domain name for Wikijunior ==

At [[User:Zanimum|zanimum]]'s request, a new domain name for [[Wikijunior]] was discussed at a [[m:Wikimedia meeting agendas|Wikimedia meeting]] on September 18 (which was attended by the board, people with official positions, and local chapter reps). I asked at that whether Wikijunior should move to its own domain name. [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] said that she does not consider it the board's decision alone and suggested the Wikibooks community should decide this, thinking a new domain meant a new project. I felt the project was already approved (since it's running on Wikibooks and we have a grant for it), and said that I didn't see the move to a new domain as a huge issue. [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimmy]] clarified that the proposal is for Wikijunior be a place to put 'finished' work, with Wikibooks still being the development community, so it would be a 'view' on the work, not a new project per se. I asked whether there had been any objection to it moving, but this wasn't clear. Jimmy proposed that we notify the Wikibooks community that we're saying yes to this, but giving a week or two for people to voice objections, and if there are none then we can approve it and let the Wikibooks community work out how to proceed. 

So, if there are any objections to moving the finished Wikijunior texts to Wikijunior.org and keeping the editing processes on Wikibooks.org, please raise those, either here or on the textbook-l mailing list. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 19:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:Sounds like a great idea. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:51, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:: While I'm fully in favour of eventually creating static sites for Wikiuniversity, Albert, this all costs money. We have to keep Wikimedia afloat with the available funds, Jimmy Wales' C-SPAN interview said it will cost US$2 million this year to run the project.

Wikiuniversity hasn't pulled in a cent, and so there's no reason for the Foundation to reroute valuable funds.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

:I [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-September/002446.html posted a longer reply on Textbook-l], and I will refer to that for my objections to this proposal.  In short, I think there are many details that should be worked out before this proposal gets a green light.  Most important are the following issues:

:*How does content get &quot;flagged&quot; to be &quot;moved&quot; over to the read-only site?  Votes on content?  Admin discression?  An &quot;editorial board&quot; that can move this content over?  What about &quot;updates&quot; to the content and when does that get moved over?
:*Is the new website going to be pure HTML, or a read-only Wiki?  (both have merits with advantages/disadvantages)
:*Are we going to include the Wikijunior books in a format other than HTML?  We already have PDF and Audio book formats for some content right now.  What about other formats including printed versions?
:*Are we going to offer the content up for sale with an on-line bookstore to purchase a printed/bound copy of some of the content?  Are we going to allow educational institutions and organizations the chance to obtain for free copies provided through the Beck Foundation grant?
:*Why is information about the Beck Foundation kept so secretive?  All of the links on Meta point to some concrete manufacturer that has nothing to do with this grant or project, and all attempts to get the correct information seem to fall on deaf ears.  (That website is litterally a foundation construction company that offers jobs in the construction industry... not book publishing or educational activities of any sort.)  Is this grant from the Beck Foundation for real or is it a farce?  Where is the paperwork for the grant and who has the &quot;signatures&quot; and other contact information for the grant?
:*Is this going to keep the Wikibook format of seperate &quot;projects&quot; or is it going to be a &quot;Wikipedia-Junior&quot; collection of articles in an overall encyclopedic format?  I prefer the current book format, but [[User:Zanimum|zanimum]] seems to prefer the encyclopedic format, from what I've seen so far.
:*Who is going to maintain the content on the new site?  While Stewards and Wikibooks admins might be a good start, I think it should be more with the very active participants of the Wikijunior books themselves as a seperate community.  How are they going to be selected and are they going to be given sysop privileges on the new site?  That would mean more like developer privileges if it is going to be a more pure HTML website.
:*What is the &quot;front page&quot; format going to look like?  Right now Wikijunior is very functional and designed more for editing rather than something kids would be interested in.  Are we going to make it more &quot;kid-friendly&quot; like a video-game console?  A very different kind of &quot;skin&quot; for this project as well for the default?  Who is going to come up with this new format for the front page and subsequent navigation?
:*How are links from this new site going to link back to Wikibooks and the editable content?  Should it even link back except as a non-hyperlink reference?  How are we going to keep this &quot;kid-friendly&quot;?
:*Should this link to anywhere external to the site except maybe the Wikimedia Foundation main page and perhaps gnu.org for GFDL information?  What about cross-references and footnoted bibliographies and how should we deal with that?  If this has full cross-references hyperlinked, why make a seperate site altogether anyway?  Why not simply have a redirect with wikijunior.org go straight to Wikibooks instead?
:*What about international language versions of this project?  Who is going to maintain those and will it be all part of the same site?  Is there any content translated or worked on in other languages that would be worth including?  Surprisingly, I think Chinese may be the furthest along than any other language besides English for Wikijunior, but as I don't speak Chinese this is something I havn't been able to verify or confirm other than a bunch of words written in that language.  That does make the Chinsese P.R.C. government censors something to worry about as well and forces that issue much sooner than even what Wikinews and Wikipedia have had to face so far.  Generally I don't think Wikijunior is going to be much of an issue in that regard, but something to worry about perhaps in the future.

:Even by themselves these are each non-trivial questions, and together make me think this proposal to turn on a new domain name sponsored by or in part by the Wikimedia Foundation to be something very premature.  If you have thoughts on these issues, please respond below.  I think this may be a good idea, but a complete proposal must be put together and not be run roughshod over the current set of participants at Wikijunior.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:17, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

::Wow Rob, I never would have thought of all those points, but I see what you mean. There ''is'' still alot to be done. We've barely even begun to get the print version of [[Wikijunior Solar System|Solar System]] ready. There are only two people who have proofread Solar System modules so far ([[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] and I), and only 3 modules are completely proofread. We're going to miss the Oct. 3 deadline [[User:Danny|Danny]] gave us. This project need more time, in many areas.

:::Look: all we're doing is registering the domain for now, and it can be a redirect to Wikibooks, until we straighten the details out. Anyway, I've answered all of your questions on Meta, a more appropriate place for them. See [[m:Wikijunior/Question on the Web site]].  --  [[user:zanimum]]

I think the '''IDEA''' of creating a special place for static versions of things is a good one.  Creating that special place and experimenting with ways to get things there is a good idea.  Many of the questions [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] go to the whole idea of validation currently being discussed at meta. or is that wikipedia.  I have temporarily lost track of that one.

How are we going to know when [[Wikijunior Solar System]] is ready for publication?  The &quot;as published&quot; version should go on Wikijunior, right?  This is a similar problem.  Why not provide PDF as well as HTML?  Wiki stuff is free stuff, so anyone SHOULD be able to download the booklets.  I imagine anything else would violate the wikimedia foundations principles.  The sale price of the booklets should cover the cost of printing and distribution plus a tiny bit extra (to keep it out of the red), so that the &quot;beck foundation&quot; money can continue to support the electronic home of the books.

Creating an environment where kids can research and add VERIFIED facts is another one.
* Here's one interface for that sort of thing: http://www.answerbag.com/q_view.php/1617 (a bit automated)
* Here's another one: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1997/GlyniseFinney.shtml (completely manual, with a human gatekeeper)
In either of these approaches, there are definite guidelines.  Things seem a bit less free-wheeling than they are at wikipedia. 

I think issues about skins and front-page formats will be easier to resolve.  They can evolve.

::''[...] [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimmy]] clarified that the proposal is for Wikijunior be a place to put 'finished' work, with Wikibooks still being the development community, [...]''
:I don't believe there is any reasonable way to determine whether or not a Wikijunior 'book' can be deemed 'finished' or not, as there are always things that can be changed. Furthermore, since language slowly evolves over time, we must retain the ability to update content appropriately, for example, to use more modern metaphors. Besides, I always thought that Wikisource was the canonical place to host materials of a more 'fixed' nature.
:If the intention is to create a bunch of new wikis on the DNS names ''&lt;languagecode&gt;.wikijunior.org'', then would it not be more appropriate to actually develop the Wikijunior content there? There ought to be an easy way to tag books in some way to indicate how 'finished' they are considered to be (e.g. using the [[Image:00%.png]] [[Image:25%.png]] [[Image:50%.png]] [[Image:75%.png]] [[Image:100%.png]] icons). Further, with the departure of both Wikiversity and Wikijunior from the Wikibooks wiki, we can finally just be a single project, and not a hosting site for arbitrary Wikimedia projects. I might further suggest the previously discussed possibility of setting up an incubator wiki as per [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Meetings/August_14%2C_2005#Wikiversity the board meeting of Aug 14 2005] as an alternative to Wikicities for projects which the Foundation deems appropriate.
:If the intention is not to create a bunch of new wikis, then I'd be interested to hear what the Foundation have in mind. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:36, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

I see no reason why we can't move the content in its entirety. No book is ever finished, if that was the case we'd be moving our 100% books over to Wikisource. Just as a featured article over at Wikipedia can change beyond recognition within the month after its featuring. And if a list of only the finished books is needed, well, create an impressive-looking page just for that purpose!

Also I should point out that any texts that are transwikied will be deleted in their entirety from Wikibooks. I've already come across this problem when people were making changes to the foreign-language books both on their new wiki and on the old copies here, and that is NOT a problem we should be forced to deal with any more than we already are.

I don't believe the books should be locked from editing in any manner. No Wikisource works are locked and they're getting along fine, so I see no reason to do otherwise. And having uneditable HTML pages would be a contridiction of the project's title.

As for adminship, I'd of course like to think we can trust the current Wikijunior contributors, but I do think we need to make sure they're trustworthy candidates first. Therefore I propose that the Wikibooks admins be responsible for overseeing the voting in of the first few, and after that they can be left to their own devices and vote amongst themselves. Similarly until this change takes place it would be up to us to fight vandalism the same as it is when the project is here (only it will be easier to catch on the new tiny wiki). Of course it could be some of our admins are ''already'' Wikijunior contributors, in that case they might be able to be independent right from the get-go.

On the technological side, I hear Wikipedia is now running MediaWiki 1.6 Beta 1; does this add support for Special:Import? If not, I think that should be done BEFORE any move takes place. This is a hella big project, and being able to have capable users do a full dump of each page and then re-upload it would be infinitely superior to the current (read: crappy) copy-n-paste transwiki system.

Anyway, a week or two is far too short. Look how many weeks we've spent duking it out over the policy redefinition, and we're only just now approaching a time when we ''might'' be able to finalise things. This isn't Wikipedia, things move slowly here on Wikibooks. Perhaps too slowly, but then again it gives time for everyone to express their opinions and be satisfied with any changes.

To me, making sure the printed versions break even while still being &quot;ethical&quot; is a minor issue. Publishers mark up their prices to a horrendous degree, and bookstores jack it up even further, but we'll be bypassing both of those by printing them ourselves. Even if we put &quot;$5 from this book's purchase goes as a donation to the Wikimeda Foundation&quot; on the cover, we'll ''still'' be shoving out professional-level children's books at basically bargain-bin prices. Indeed a slightly higher price might actually help; when I see ultra-cheap things on sale my immediate thought is &quot;what's wrong with it?&quot;; I'm instantly suspicious and very reluctant to purchase without finding out exactly why; having a more, dare I say it, &quot;competitive&quot; price might make the books seem more serious.

In closing, Wikipedia has recieved high praise from web surfers and the media alike despite the fact that the vast majority of its articles are in an evidently unfinished state. I see no reason why a full transfer of Wikijunior data could not also take place, ideally pending the existence of Special:Import of course. Splitting up what should be a unified community effort into two different places, not to mention the still active Meta talk page, is a very bad thing.

==Skins &amp; Colors==
Hello. I'm new and I apologize if this has been covered before. I just started using Wikibooks. Thanks! It's a nice site. However I have a couple of suggestions:

1. I've been using Wikipedia for a while, and as WikiBooks looks *exactly* like WikiPedia -- I keep getting confused as to which site I'm on! For example I kept trying to add stubs to my new module but it kept failing -- until I realized that I was looking at WikiPedia. I looked at some of the skins you have on offer but prefer this standard layout but maybe it could be tweaked just a little bit so I know I'm not on WikiPedia.

1a. The address bar icon (I don't know it's proper name) that shows up in Firefox and IE is identicial to WikiPedia (a black 'W' on a white background). Please customize it. I've never done it but maybe http://www.chami.com/html-kit/services/favicon/ or http://www.favicon.com/ can help?

Thanks!
Sincerely, [[User:Ewlyahoocom|Ewlyahoocom]] 10:27, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:Hi Ewl, welcome! Under your user preferences you can give either (or both) of your accounts different skins. You can find it under &quot;Skin&quot; on [[Special:Preferences]]. Also, you may want to create new modules by first creating the link to it, and then clicking that new link (which should be red) to create the page. That way you'll always stay in the same site. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:47, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

::Like I said, I didn't care for any of the other skins. Can I customize this one, just tweak the colors a little bit? It isn't clear how to do that. Sorry if I'm being dense. And how do I customize my own favicon? (It's that thing that shows up as &lt;pre&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;/favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; in the html). Thanks! [[User:Ewlyahoocom|Ewlyahoocom]] 15:07, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, you can create your own user CSS at [[User:Ewlyahoocom/Monobook.css]], and then do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows) to see your changes. You'll need some basic knowledge of CSS, but if you can identify from the page's source what ID tag does what function you can then hunt for it in the global CSS (http://en.wikibooks.org/skins-1.5/monobook/main.css). You only need to copy the sections you change into your user CSS, anything you don't define can be left default. For an example of the incredible level of control you have see [[wikicities:c:radiocontrol:MediaWiki:Monobook.css|The Radio Control Wiki's Monobook.css]]. As for the favicon you can't customise that yourself, it's sourced from [[:Image:Favicon.ico]] and can't be redirected. I tried upload a new one back when you first posted about it but it refuses to let me. That's going to require a PHP-level change, so I'll try to get on #wikitech today and see if someone there has the power to do that. Anyway, hope that helps! You can now get on to customising your visual theme, and hopefully you'll see a new icon sometime soon too! :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

== Controversial wikibooks ==

I've been planning a book on my userpage but i can't find the wikibooks module that deals with controversial books (or any other wikibook section like the votes for deletion page, all the internal pages are hard to find.) If you do look up my userpage tell me if you think it would be deleted. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 21:06, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:Primarily I would say that we'd require two things: (1) that the information somehow be externally verifiable (through, say, primary and secondary sources that you reference); and (2) that the topic be specific and precise enough so that someone else will be able to contribute to the work. A follow up to both of these standards is that we don't allow original research. Original research is both unverifiable and is specific enough that only the original author could contribute, regardless if other people would like to.&lt;p&gt;BTW, the VFD page is at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]].&lt;p&gt;There's also an [http://altscience.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Alternative Science] wikicity that is currently inactive, but you can adopt it and make it active again. That would seem to be a better fit for what you are going for. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:: I think I'll just narrow the topic of the book. (I just looked at the wikicities page, i just want to deal with the psychic parts of things, they would have me doing vampires and such as well.)

:::You can think of the altscience wikicity as it's own site, just like WikiBooks. Think of each of those topics as books in their own right, and you'd just be contributing to the psychic book. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:11, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== Bot at IRC channel ==

Has anybody seen [irc://irc.freenode.org/en.wikipedia.vandalism #en.wikipedia.vandalism] at FreeNode? There's an quite useful bot helping fighting vandaism. Maybe we should install it at #wikibooks? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 15:29, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Scope of the [[Neuroscience]] book ==

Should the [[Neuroscience]] book include huge topics such as Cognitive Neuroscience, Neuroanatomy, Sleep, Neural Development and Electrophysiology or should each of these subjects be their own books (i.e. we'd have a book for Neuroanatomy, a book on Sleep etc).  Personally, I think we should have one big [[Neuroscience]] book which includes topics such as Cognitive Neuroscience and Sleep as sub-sections.  Why?  Because modern neuroscience is highly interdisciplinary and every effort should be made to stress the importance of this interdisciplinary approach to students.  For example, a chapter on Learning and Memory wouldn't be complete without a section on the neuroanatomy of the brain networks associated with memory or a discussion on the neurobiology of learning.

Some pros and cons of having a giant Neuroscience book as apposed to having each subject within its own book:

'''Pros of the Giant Neuroscience Book&amp;trade;'''
* Emphasises interdisciplinary approach
* Easy linking between sections
* Hopefully a single &quot;neuroscience community&quot; of writers will develop. In these early stages of WikiBooks, it can feel lonely developing a book.  The more we can do to focus effort on single books rather than every user starting his or her own books, the better.

'''Cons of the Giant Neuroscience Book&amp;trade;'''
* Page names will be longer, for example:
** [[Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory/Amenesia]] instead of
** [[Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory/Amenesia]]
* Linking from WikiPedia becomes a little uglier.  For example, if we were to link from the [[w:Memory|Memory]] page on WikiPedia to WikiBooks then we'd have to insert a link along the lines of: See the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory|Learning and Memory]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; section of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Neuroscience|Neuroscience WikiBook]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 13:25, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

How about a Neuroscience bookshelf containing several interrelated volumes?  It would be like the encyclopedia of Neuroscience in several volumes instead of in one fat book. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think it makes sense for a big topic like this to go both ways: Have a survey book which treats many topics, but only at the fundamentals level, and not much deeper, and then have dedicated books for all of the sub topics. It's just like how intro to anthropology might have two weeks for physical anthro, even though you could take several courses that discuss the topic more deeply. As for the long names, I would just call it [[Cognitive Neuroscience/Amenesia]] and have topics only nested to a second level (though index pages could show more stucture, such as Learning and Memory). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:13, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

::Yeah, this all sounds good.  If do have a whole bookshelf of Neuroscience books, could we use bookshelf-wide category names?  E.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:neuroscience:memory]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 23:51, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

==Name Nesting==
Are there any limits to the depth of the name nesting system?  For example, could I call a page Wikis/Editing/Formatting/Lists/Really Nice Lists/Ones With Bells and Whistles On?  Even if there aren't any limits imposed by the software, do you have any views on what makes a ''practical'' depth limit? [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 23:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
:[[WB:NP#flat]]. I think that three degrees in a page name is the maximum reasonable number and two degrees should be generally used. Consider practical reasons - it's easier to type a two-step title to address box. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 08:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
:: I agree, three sounds like a sensible max. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 11:16, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

==How do we request software features?==
Hi...

Should we consider setting up a page where we can list all the features that we feel would make our WikiBook lives easier?  Sure, MediaWiki is a great bit of software but sometimes it feels like using it to write a ''book'' is a little tougher than it should be.  For example, some features that would be nice are:

* Automated indexes
* The ability to set the name that will apear on automated category listings (i.e. a page called &quot;Movie Making Manual/Lighting&quot; will come up as &quot;Movie Making Manual/Lighting&quot; on the &quot;MMM:cinematography&quot; category page.   It would be nice if it came up as &quot;Lighting&quot;.

I'm sure you lot have loads of other ideas too.  How do you bring these ideas to the attention of the Media Wiki devs?

Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 00:33, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:Feature requests for the MediaWiki software should be made in [http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/ bugzilla.wikipedia.org]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:03, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:: OK, thanks. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 08:08, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Be warned that mediawiki devs are mostly concerned with wiki''pedia'' features and how any feature changes will affect WP. They are, therefore, very concerned with performance issues and generally &quot;over it&quot; when it comes to enhancements. Another way to get ahold of mediawiki developers is to ask questions in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net. To talk to admins/devs for other issues, you can use #wikimedia-tech. Wikibooks also has an irc channel there; #wikibooks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:09, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:MediaWiki is open source software under the GPL.  Your best bet is to either learn php and add the feature yourself (if you're a programmer), or convince a coder friend of how awesome your features are and how cool they'd be if they wrote it.  Try stroking their egos, us computer geeks have large ones.  Basicly, the current set of media wiki devs are stretched thin and focused on wikipedia, if you want new functionality its better to write it and show them working code than to ask them to do it.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:: Interesting... thanks... I don't know PHP at the moment but I've always been planing to learn it... maybe one day!  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 12:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

==Redirecting a template to another template==
How can I redirect one template to point to another?  For example, I would like to redirect the template &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM Header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I've tried putting these commands on the &quot;MMM Header&quot; page but none work:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect {{MMM:header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Any ideas would be very much apreciated.  Alternatively, can I delete &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; so I can move &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM Header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;?  Many thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 07:54, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

: You could just copy the content from [[Template:MMM Header]] to [[Template:MMM:Header]], or is there something else you're trying to achieve? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:: True, I could do that.  I was concerned about having multiple templates... but I suppose it's no big deal because soon I'll get round to changing all the pages to use the new naming convention.  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 12:01, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

==Academic References==
Hi there,

(first off, I should appologise for posting so much in the Staff Lounge!  I'll calm down soon, I promise!)

I would like to discuss the best way to reference academic papers in a science wikibook (e.g. the [[Neuroscience]] book).  Personally, my prefered way would be like this example: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16028583&amp;query_hl=2 (Grenier, 2005)].  (This is generated using this code:)

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://link/to/pubmed (Author, date)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Does anyone think this is a bad idea?

There are some WikiPedia / Meta projects focussing on citations, e.g.:

* [[m:Footnotes]]
* [[m:Wikicite]]
* [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check]]

Personally, I really dislike numbered references{{an|test}} because I like to see the author names within the text (sometimes, just sometimes, I will remember the reference... I have no chance of &quot;remembering&quot; an arbitrary numbered reference).

What are your thoughts?

Many thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 14:27, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:: Citation policies are something that should be book-specific IMO. Your format looks fine, but you might consider using some sort of citation template if you expect it to change in the future. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:04, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

::If you want APA referencing by all means feel free to copy the template over from Wikipedia. It doesn't matter what; as long as it's a widely-used referencing system using it's fine. However the advantages of the numbering system are of course that it doesn't disrupt the text, I actually had to ''cut down'' on references when using the APA style once because it took up too much room; with the numbers there's no such worry. However you do need to port over WP's APA template; that way instead of jumping to the content the link takes the reader to the bottom where they can see the work's full publication info and all that razz, and also doesn't disrupt editing flow quite so much. I also see I need to fix the CSS to hide the ref arrow, I'll do that right now. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Hi.  Thanks for your quick replies.  Please could you provide me with a link to WP's APA template?  I ran a few searches but couldn't find it!  Personally, I quite like have the in-text reference hyperlinked to PubMed, it makes it easy for the reader to find the referenced article and download it if they wish.  But I agree that a major downside to this is that it makes the editor's job a little harder.  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 11:58, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
::::Hmpf. I was sure there was one but I can't find it either! Well if you want something done right... OK, you can now define your reference like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{APA ref|So N So|1999}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and then you merely need to repeat it as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{APA note|So N So|1999}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the bottom. The second | is because a comma will break the link, so instead the template draws the comma for you. I wasn't sure whether the parenthesis should be part of the hyperlink or not; once you've tried it out inline you might want to change that. Actually, let's try it out {{APA ref|Garrett|2005}}, so we can see what it looks like.

::::: Talk, Garrett U. (2005), ''My Me Page''. Washington: Wikimedia Press LLC.

::::Wait, is that how you do APA? Bah, I forget. Anyway it works. It would be better if it filled out the whole reference automatically like [[w:Template:Web reference simple]] but that can be worked out later.

==&lt;nowiki&gt;{{/template/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; Syntax==
Hi,

I'm using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/template/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; syntax in the [[Movie Making Manual]]'s [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] in order to automatically copy selected bits of information from the camera-specific pages in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]].  For example, I have entered information about the D-20 camera in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20|D-20]] page and this same information is re-used in [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]].  However, I can only get this to work if I strictly use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I cannot use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This is bad because &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; points to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]].  Instead, I want it to point to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]] (i.e. I want to remove the &quot;Table of Cameras&quot; from MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats'''/Table of Cameras'''/D-20.)  But, for some reason, using the link &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] doesn't work.

At the moment, I'm using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; syntax in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] and then putting a &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]] page to point to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]].  But this is ugly and I'd much rather have a direct link from the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]] to the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]].

So... does anyone know how I can link directly from the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] to the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]] without having to go via the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]] page?

== Can we move on the Naming Policy? ==
Hi,

Please can we push forward with the [[WB:NP|WikiBooks Naming Convention]]?  Personally, I'd really like to be able to name my wikibooks pages with confidence and without worrying that the [[WB:NP]] may change meaning that I'll have to waste a whole tonne of time re-naming my pages.   Right now, there are more votes against the proposed [[WB:NP]] than votes for it.  So... what's the next move?  Should we discuss how to improve the present [[WB:NP]]?  I assume these discussions should be held on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Naming_policy|Page Naming talk page]].  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:28, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

:I've been more of the opinion that categories is sort of anti-Wikibooks in many ways.  The whole point of categories is to help organize content on Wikipedia by topical relevancy, and to place Wikipedia articles in a topical category for grouping and searching purposes.  This seems to work very well for Commons as well as Wikinews, where the categories are very handy for organizing the content on those projects.  Categories can also be heirarchical in nature, as you can place a category in a category as well.  This feature in particular is very useful for doing a topical search.

:On Wikibooks, however, we have an existing structure of bookshelves for topical organization of content, and then each Wikibook has its own often unique method of organization.  While there may be some use for organizing individual modules in seperate Wikibooks to a common category, it is my opinion that this is an unnecessary practice and tends to encourage the creation of modules as Wikipedia article alternatives.... something which I'm opposed to in general for Wikibook as a project.  Categories could perhaps be used to help organize the main pages of each Wikibook, but even this gets complicated.

:Mind you, I'm not against the use of Categories ''within'' a given Wikibook, and this is a tool that you can use to help author your book, but I am speaking against using general categories for individual modules where they create links to disjointed parts of many Wikibooks.  There is some talk on [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] about using categories to help organize the &quot;main page&quot; of a Wikibook for classification purposes, like the LOC catalog number or more topical organization for bookshelves.  Certainly the role of categories on Wikibooks needs further discussion, and how we are going to be using them.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:24, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

: Whiteknight, I have been using categories extensively on the [[Cookbook]]. You can find a list of all current categories at [[Special:Categories]], and there is a listing of uncategorized categories at [[Special:Uncategorizedcategories]]. You mostly have to look at wikipedia for documentation about these sorts of things in general since their policies are much more developed and usage much higher. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask here or on [[User_talk:Kellen|my talk page]].

:Rob, I agree that cross-categorization of specific pages from different books is a bit weird. I tend to think that most categories should be prefixed by bookname (ala the Pokedex) to specify their scope, and that un-prefixed categories should be wikibooks-wide and generally should only be used for cataloging books.

== [[Self Sufficiency]] ==
Just started to write Self Sufficiency
however I started in mistake is Self sufficiency note lower case s.
now writing in Self Sufficiency with big s but am not allowed to remove
other page. This page comes up when searching for self sufficiency
and could be confusing for users. could an administrator delete it please.

:Welcome. In such cases, you can either make a redirect &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[Self Sufficiency]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or insert {{tl|delete}}. Please, do not leave blank pages, they're confusing. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 11:55, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:I did the same with Programming:Visual Basic Classic/Jarithmetic Round Two Implementation.  Finger slipped when typing the capital I of Implementation.  I just viewed the page and then used the Move link on the tabstrip at the top of the page.  Seems to work. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== Page Organization ==

Is there any way to make a navigation template for a book so that you can easily go to the next and previous page.  Also is there any way to change the navigation template from the same page.

That last sentence may sound confusing.  What I am trying to do is organize my book in a number of different ways, depending on what you are looking for (for instance, you can either browse by difficulty level or by Section type).  Is there anyway to make a template which will be able to reflect both of these browsing types (when I press next page, it will look which organization type I am in and go to the appropriate page)  hope that makes sense.
-[[User:68.116.202.52|68.116.202.52]] 21:04, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

# Yes, look at [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation]]. You cerainly will find something suitable for you.
# No, there is no way to save user settings in a template. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 21:31, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== GPL code ==

I read somewhere that GPL and GFDL are incompatible. Does that mean that I cant include a bit of GPL code in a Wikibook as an code example? Maybe I can do it if I clearly say that the code is GPL and not GFDL?

:Take a look at [[Wikibooks talk:Copyrights]] where this point has been brought up before.  Also take a look at the Debian discussion on the question: http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html.  If the code is your own then you can dual license it or even make it public domain.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:You cannot change the license of a book you are writing under us, but it is possible to mark content. For example check out what [[wikicities:c:polaqu:DnD Wiki:About#OGL vs. GFDL|Polaqu]] is doing with the unfree OGL license. I'm sure something similar could be done. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:21, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

:One interesting alternative is to start a &quot;sister project&quot; to the wikibook you are working on at [http://sourceforge.net/ Source Forge].  They have free hosting of copyleft software (generally GPL, but they do allow BSD and other free software licenses as well) and a number of neat services as well including CVS access and even MySQL database services.  That way the source code for the projects that you want to be machine compatable can be &quot;distributed&quot; seperately under the GPL, as opposed to the documentation that would be here on Wikibooks.&lt;p&gt;I've also seen some people try to &quot;dual license&quot; content, where the copyright license for a particular Wikibook has another explicit licensing option.  The legal ground on that is a bit shaky as it would be harder to &quot;prove&quot; that contributors were aware of the alternative license before they started adding new content to such a dual-license Wikibook, but at least it is an option.  If the content is here on Wikibooks, it must be licensed under the GFDL, but it doesn't have to be the only licensing arrangement.  And if the content is original, you are free to do whatever you want with what you have personnally written, including republishing under a propritary license.  Companies like MySQL AB do that with their software, where they have both a &quot;free&quot; GPL'd version and a &quot;commercial&quot; version that you have to pay explicit licensing fees for.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:07, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== Bookshelf Help. ==

I can't find a suitable bookshelf for Folkstyle Wrestling.  For those of you who don't know, it is the sport of wrestling.  In fact, I don't think there is a place for any sports books.  I don't believe that games would be a place that people who wrestled would look if they wanted to find a book on it.  Should I create a new bookshelve,or is there a category that I'm missing?
-[[User:68.116.202.52|68.116.202.52]] 22:56, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
edit:  I just found physical education, which says that it includes martial arts, but still don't think that this accurately describes a sport(even though it does happen to be a martial art also)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Ripping CD audio ===
This copies the audio from a CD track to a file. With some drives (one without analog connections to the sound card) this is the only way to correctly play a file.

==== Granting permission to the user ====
First you should have read-and-write permission to the CD device. (You could become root to rip the CD, but then you would have to &quot;chown&quot; the file back to you.)

First look at your CD devices nodes. On *BSD, they are at &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cd*&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/dev/rcd*&lt;/tt&gt;. If they look like this:
 $ '''ls -l /dev/cd*'''
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,   0 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0a
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,   2 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0c
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,  16 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1a
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,  18 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1c

Here, root needs to grant read and write permission to the user. We decide to add the users to group &quot;wheel&quot;. Once they are in, we change the group of the devices and grant read and write permission to the group:
 $ '''sudo chgrp wheel /dev/cd* /dev/rcd*'''
 $ '''sudo chmod g+gw /dev/cd* /dev/rcd*'''
 $ '''ls -l /dev/cd*'''
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,   0 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0a
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,   2 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0c
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,  16 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1a
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,  18 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1c

==== Ripping tracks ====
We must insert a CD before ripping the track.

Here, for example, we rip track 2 and store it in &lt;tt&gt;song.wav&lt;/tt&gt;. Our &quot;.wav&quot; suffix is because that is the default format of '''cdparanoia'''.
With a CD in:
 $ '''cdparanoia 2 song37.wav'''

=== Eject a disc ===
Many systems provide an '''eject''' command.
 $ '''eject cd0'''

===Burn a disk===
''Scenario:'' put the contents of a directory called &lt;tt&gt;backup&lt;/tt&gt; to CD.

Here we do the actual burn (and eject) as root. The user needs to have &quot;sudo&quot; access, but not any special access to the CD device node.

Create a disk image of the CD. We will call it &lt;tt&gt;burn.iso&lt;/tt&gt;.
* -R is ISO6990 Rock Ridge support
* -r is Rock Ridge but with all files to root (usable on computers with different users)
* -hfs indicates a hybrid ISO9660/HFS disk
 $ '''mkisofs -o burn.iso -r -hfs backup'''
 $ '''chmod a-w burn.iso'''

Mount it to check for validity. (NetBSD/OpenBSD)
 $ '''sudo vnconfig /dev/svnd0c burn.iso'''
 $ '''sudo mount -r -t cd9660 /dev/svnd0a /mnt'''
 $ '''diff /mnt backup'''
 $ '''echo $?'''
 0
 $ '''sudo umount /mnt'''
 $ '''sudo vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c'''

The filesystem is good though '''file''' is misleading:
 $ '''file burn.iso'''
 burn.iso: x86 boot sector, extended partition table

Insert a blank disk.

This is a test burn to demonstrate &lt;tt&gt;'''cdrecord -v'''&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''sudo cdrecord -v -dummy dev=/dev/cd0c burn.iso'''

Some thoughts:
#慥 is one of obsolete kanjis. Actually, I couldn't read it ;) [http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000148/files/799_14972.html The same story in Aozora Bunko] avoid using the kanji. But since I'm not sure the purpose of this page...
#六つ: I thought the reading of the word is むっつ. But according to [http://jiten.www.infoseek.co.jp/Jiten?pg=jiten_top.html 大辞林(Daijirin)], both むつ and むっつ are used. Perhaps むつ is relatively formal whereas むっつ is casual.
#負う: Altough probably this is read おぶう(おぶって) in this case, we read 負う as おう these days. Daijirin separates 負う(おう) and 負ぶう(おぶう).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
One feature you're almost guaranteed to find in a UNIX-based operating system is a system of user accounts. This feature is designed for computers that are used by more than one person.

==Why Accounts?==
Picture this: a family of four shares one iMac. Fourteen-year-old Andrew imports his collection of punk rock CD's into the computer's iTunes library. All of a sudden, the music is on every other family member's iPod. Seven-year-old Alice wants to have a Barbie desktop picture, but the other family members would rather not. All of Andrew's friends are mixed in with the father Mark's business contacts in Address Book.

In other words, total chaos.

Accounts to the rescue! Each user with an account gets their very own private:

* &quot;Home Folder&quot; for storing personal documents and other files.
* Preferences and settings for Mac OS X and individual applications.
* iTunes library, iPhoto library, Address Book, iCal Calendar, Safari Bookmarks, iChat buddies, etc.

==Deciding How You Will Use Accounts==
An account is kind of like an entire &quot;version&quot; of the computer. Our family of four could create an account for each child. Andrew gets his own music collection and contacts. Alice gets her Barbie desktop picture. And everyone is happy.
 
Unfortunately, the system of accounts can be a double-edged sword. Let's say that the two parents create separate accounts. Which account will keep the family photos? Which will keep the parents' shared music collection? Things can start to get complicated.

Don't be afraid to get creative with your system of accounts. In this case, the perfect solution is to create a fifth account: &quot;Family&quot;. This account is in charge of the ''family'' address book, ''family'' music library, ''family'' photos, etc. With five accounts for the four users of the iMac, nobody gets in anyone else's hair, and yet everyone can access the files they want to.

Your solution may be different than the hypothetical family above. Come up with several different possibilities and weigh their advantages and disadvantages. Consider limits that need to be placed on users, what data needs to be easily accessible to all users, and the varying privacy needs of each user. Try to get it right the first time; creating accounts is easy, but modifying accounts is more difficult.

==Types of Accounts==
* Standard
** This should be your daily use account.
* Administrator (Super User)
** The person who manages the computer should have this account *in addition* to their own standard account.
* Root
** Most people will never need to access this type of account, but certain high-level management tasks require this level of access.

=Adding an Account=
The central control panel for the Account system is the Accounts pane of System Preferences. This pane lets you add, modify, and remove user accounts. To adjust the more serious settings in this pane, you'll need to unlock it with an administrator password. Only an administrator can mess with the account system.

The sidebar on the left lists the accounts on your Mac. Your account is at the top, and everyone else's appears underneath. To add an account, click the plus button underneath this sidebar. A sheet appears, prompting you for some information to set up the account:

*Name - Type in a name for the account.
*Short Name - If the user is ever prompted for their name and password, then they can use this name instead. Keep the short name simple and in all lowercase letters. For instance, John Doe's short name should be &quot;john&quot;.
*Password - Depending on how sensitive information in this account is, you may wish to create a password. In a family setting, passwords are usually unnecessary for most accounts, and this field can be left blank.

=Setting Up an Account=

=Fast User Switching=
Fast User Switching is a feature Apple &quot;borrowed&quot; from Windows that lets two users stay logged in at the same time. Keep in mind that having multiple users simultaneously logged in with applications running will require a large amount of memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Equations of Motion ==

Consider a particle moving in a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and centre at the origin O.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; denote the '''displacement''' of the particle. Using the '''angular displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (as measured from the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis) as a parameter, we have

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}= r \left[ \begin{matrix}\cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:CircularMotion.png]]

To obtain the '''velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle, we differentiate &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; wrt time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the chain rule, we have

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left( r \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}\cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]\right) \left( \dot{\theta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=r \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}


To determine the '''acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle, we differentiate &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; wrt &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and get

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\dot\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\dot\mathbf{r}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left( r \frac{d}{d\theta} \left\{ \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right] \right\} \right) \left( \dot{\theta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=r \dot{\theta} \left( \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix} -\cos \theta\\ -\sin \theta \end{matrix} \right] + \ddot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=-r \dot{\theta}^2 \left[ \begin{matrix} \cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right] + r \dot{\theta} \ddot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Summary ===

To simplify our expressions, we introduce the ''unit'' vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}=\left[ \begin{matrix} \cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\left[ \begin{matrix} -\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is ''perpendicular'' to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

From the above derivations, we arrive at the following:

&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
* '''Displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r} = r \dot{\theta} \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r} = -r \dot{\theta}^2 \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \ddot{\theta} \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We note the following:
* The velocity is always ''perpendicular'' to the displacement of the particle.
* The acceleration consists of a ''radial'' component directed towards the centre of the circle, and a ''transverse'' component parallel to the velocity.

=== Special Case: Uniform Circular Motion ===

If the particle moves at a ''constant speed'' in a circle, then we say that it observes '''uniform circular motion'''. For this special case, we set the angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and replace the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; with the constant angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Our equations of motion reduce to the following:

&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
* '''Displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r} = r \omega \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r} = -r \omega^2 \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We note the following:
* The velocity is always ''perpendicular'' to the displacement of the particle. Further, the speed of the particle is simply &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
* The acceleration is always directed towards the centre of the circle. Its magnitude is given by &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2=\frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Uniform Horizontal Circular Motion ==

The following diagrams describe one example of '''horizontal circular motion'''. If the particle is moving at a constant speed, then we say that it is performing ''uniform'' horizontal circular motion. To obtain the equations of motion, we apply '''Newton's Second Law''' to the resolved forces acting on the particle in the horizontal and vertical directions. 

[[Image:CircularMotion2.png|450px]]

Let us assume that the particle is moving at a ''constant speed'' around a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

First, we consider the resolved forces acting on the particle in the ''vertical'' direction. Since there is no acceleration, Newton's Second Law produces:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;T \cos \theta - mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Next, we consider the resolved forces acting on the particle in the ''horizontal'' direction. Since the particle is performing circular motion, its acceleration towards the centre of the circle is given by &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by Newton's Second Law, we have:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= ma&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;T \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= m r \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

== Vertical Circular Motion ==

The following diagrams describe one example of '''vertical circular motion'''. As before, we obtain the equations of motion by applying '''Newton's Second Law''' to the resolved forces acting on the particle in the horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, we can also use the '''Law of Conservation of Energy''' to help us relate the ''speed'' of the particle to its ''height''.

[[Image:CircularMotion3.png|450px]]

The motion of a moving car round a circular path is being propagated by the centripetal force acting on the car which is directed towards the center of the circular path.

when we look critically into the Newton's Third Law of motion, it states that in every action, there must be a reaction which is equal to it but opposite in direction. as the car is being held on the circular path by the frictional (Centripetal) force, the car in return exerts and outward pull against the direction of the Fcentri, which is called the centrifugal force.

==Introduction== 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Bassreflex-Gehäuse_(enclosure).png]]&lt;/div&gt;
Bass-reflex enclosures improve the low-frequency response of loudspeaker systems.  Bass-reflex enclosures are also called &quot;vented-box design&quot; or &quot;ported-cabinet design&quot;.  A bass-reflex enclosure includes a vent or port between the cabinet and the ambient environment.  This type of design, as one may observe by looking at contemporary loudspeaker products, is still widely used today.  Although the construction of bass-reflex enclosures is fairly simple, their design is not simple, and requires proper tuning.  This reference focuses on the technical details of bass-reflex design.  General loudspeaker information can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker here].

==Effects of the Port on the Enclosure Response==

Before discussing the bass-reflex enclosure, it is important to be familiar with the simpler sealed enclosure system performance.  As the name suggests, the sealed enclosure system attaches the loudspeaker to a sealed enclosure (except for a small air leak included to equalize the ambient pressure inside).  Ideally, the enclosure would act as an acoustical compiance element, as the air inside the enclosure is compressed and rarified.  Often, however, an acoustic material is added inside the box to reduce standing waves, dissipate heat, and other reasons. This adds a resistive element to the acoustical lumped-element model.  A non-ideal model of the effect of the enclosure actually adds an acoustical mass element to complete a series lumped-element circuit given in Figure 1.  For more on sealed enclosure design, see the [[Engineering Acoustics/Sealed Box Subwoofer Design|Sealed Box Subwoofer Design]] page.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. Sealed enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the case of a bass-reflex enclosure, a port is added to the construction.  Typically, the port is cylindrical and is flanged on the end pointing outside the enclosure.  In a bass-reflex enclosure, the amount of acoustic material used is usually much less than in the sealed enclosure case, often none at all.  This allows air to flow freely through the port.  Instead, the larger losses come from the air leakage in the enclosure.  With this setup, a lumped-element acoustical circuit has the following form.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Vented_box_ckt.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. Bass-reflex enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In this figure, &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; represents the radiation impedance of the outside environment on the loudspeaker diaphragm.  The loading on the rear of the diaphragm has changed when compared to the sealed enclosure case.  If one visualizes the movement of air within the enclosure, some of the air is compressed and rarified by the compliance of the enclosure, some leaks out of the enclosure, and some flows out of the port.  This explains the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{AL}&lt;/math&gt;.  A truly realistic model would incorporate a radiation impedance of the port in series with &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, but for now it is ignored.  Finally, &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, the acoustical mass of the enclosure, is included as discussed in the sealed enclosure case.  The formulas which calculate the enclosure parameters are listed in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_B:_Enclosure_Parameter_Formulas | Appendix B]].  

It is important to note the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.  This forms a Helmholtz resonator ([[Engineering Acoustics/Acoustics of pipes, enclosures, and cavities at low frequency#Examples of Electro-Acoustical Analogies|click here for more information]]).  Physically, the port functions as the “neck” of the resonator and the enclosure functions as the “cavity.”  In this case, the resonator is driven from the piston directly on the cavity instead of the typical Helmholtz case where it is driven at the “neck.”  However, the same resonant behavior still occurs at the enclosure resonance frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  At this frequency, the impedance seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm is large (see Figure 3 below).  Thus, the load on the loudspeaker reduces the velocity flowing through its mechanical parameters, causing an anti-resonance condition where the displacement of the diaphragm is a minimum.  Instead, the majority of the volume velocity is actually emitted by the port itself instead of the loudspeaker.  When this impedance is reflected to the electrical circuit, it is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/Z&lt;/math&gt;, thus a minimum in the impedance seen by the voice coil is small.  Figure 3 shows a plot of the impedance seen at the terminals of the loudspeaker.  In this example, &lt;math&gt;f_B&lt;/math&gt; was found to be about 40 Hz, which corresponds to the null in the voice-coil impedance.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image: Za0_Zvc_plots.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 3. Impedances seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm and voice coil.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Quantitative Analysis of Port on Enclosure==

The performance of the loudspeaker is first measured by its velocity response, which can be found directly from the equivalent circuit of the system.  As the goal of most loudspeaker designs is to improve the bass response (leaving high-frequency production to a tweeter), low frequency approximations will be made as much as possible to simplify the analysis.  First, the inductance of the voice coil, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt;, can be ignored as long as &lt;math&gt;\omega \ll R_E/L_E&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical loudspeaker, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt; is of the order of 1 mH, while &lt;math&gt;\it{R_E}&lt;/math&gt; is typically 8&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, thus an upper frequency limit is approximately 1 kHz for this approximation, which is certainly high enough for the frequency range of interest.  

Another approximation involves the radiation impedance, &lt;math&gt;\it{Z_{RAD}}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown [1] that this value is given by the following equation (in acoustical ohms):

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD} = \frac{\rho_0c}{\pi a^2}\left[\left(1 - \frac{J_1(2ka)}{ka}\right) + j\frac{H_1(2ka)}{ka}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;J_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; are types of Bessel functions.  For small values of &lt;i&gt;ka&lt;/i&gt;,

&lt;table align=center width=50% cellpadding=10&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1(2ka) \approx ka&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;H_1(2ka) \approx \frac{8(ka)^2}{3\pi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow Z_{RAD} \approx j\frac{8\rho_0\omega}{3\pi^2a} = jM_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Hence, the low-frequency impedance on the loudspeaker is represented with an acoustic mass &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt; [1].  For a simple analysis, &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{MD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{MS}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{MS}&lt;/math&gt; (the transducer parameters, or &lt;i&gt;Thiele-Small&lt;/i&gt; parameters) are converted to their acoustical equivalents.  All conversions for all parameters are given in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_A:_Equivalent_Circuit_Parameters | Appendix A]].  Then, the series masses, &lt;math&gt;M_{AD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, are lumped together to create &lt;math&gt;M_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  This new circuit is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Figure 4.  Low-Frequency Equivalent Acoustic Circuit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Unlike sealed enclosure analysis, there are multiple sources of volume velocity that radiate to the outside environment.  Hence, the diaphragm volume velocity, &lt;math&gt;U_D&lt;/math&gt;, is not analyzed but rather &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U_D + U_P + U_L&lt;/math&gt;.  This essentially draws a “bubble” around the enclosure and treats the system as a source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This “lumped” approach will only be valid for low frequencies, but previous approximations have already limited the analysis to such frequencies anyway.  It can be seen from the circuit that the volume velocity flowing &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; the enclosure, &lt;math&gt;U_B = -U_0&lt;/math&gt;, compresses the air inside the enclosure.  Thus, the circuit model of Figure 3 is valid and the relationship relating input voltage, &lt;math&gt;V_{IN}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; may be computed.

In order to make the equations easier to understand, several parameters are combined to form other parameter names.  First, &lt;math&gt;\omega_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_S&lt;/math&gt;, the enclosure and loudspeaker resonance frequencies, respectively, are:

&lt;table align=center width=40%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AP}C_{AB}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AC}C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Based on the nature of the derivation, it is convenient to define the parameters &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, the Helmholtz tuning ratio:

&lt;table align=center width=25%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega_B\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\omega_B}{\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A parameter known as the &lt;i&gt;compliance ratio&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;volume ratio&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{C_{AS}}{C_{AB}} = \frac{V_{AS}}{V_{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Other parameters are combined to form what are known as &lt;i&gt;quality factors&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;table align=center width=45%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_L = R_{AL}\sqrt{\frac{C_{AB}}{M_{AP}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_{TS} = \frac{1}{R_{AE}+R_{AS}}\sqrt{\frac{M_{AC}}{C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This notation allows for a simpler expression for the resulting transfer function [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = G(s) = \frac{(s^3/\omega_0^4)}{(s/\omega_0)^4+a_3(s/\omega_0)^3+a_2(s/\omega_0)^2+a_1(s/\omega_0)+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where

&lt;table align=center width=70%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{1}{Q_L\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{\alpha+1}{h}+h+\frac{1}{Q_L Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{1}{Q_{TS}\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_L}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Development of Low-Frequency Pressure Response==

It can be shown [2] that for &lt;math&gt;ka &lt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, a loudspeaker behaves as a spherical source.  Here, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; represents the radius of the loudspeaker.  For a 15” diameter loudspeaker in air, this low frequency limit is about 150 Hz.  For smaller loudspeakers, this limit increases.  This limit dominates the limit which ignores &lt;math&gt;L_E&lt;/math&gt;, and is consistent with the limit that models &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this limit, the loudspeaker emits a volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, as determined in the previous section.  For a simple spherical source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, the far-field pressure is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p(r) \simeq j\omega\rho_0 U_0 \frac{e^{-jkr}}{4\pi r}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;

It is possible to simply let &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; for this analysis without loss of generality because distance is only a function of the surroundings, not the loudspeaker.  Also, because the transfer function magnitude is of primary interest, the exponential term, which has a unity magnitude, is omitted.  Hence, the pressure response of the system is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0s}{4\pi}\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0Bl}{4\pi S_DR_EM_AS}H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;H(s) = sG(s)&lt;/math&gt;.  In the following sections, design methods will focus on &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + \left(a^2_3 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^6 + \left(a^2_2 + 2 - 2a_1a_3\right)\Omega^4 + \left(a^2_1 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This also implicitly ignores the constants in front of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|&lt;/math&gt; since they simply scale the response and do not affect the shape of the frequency response curve.

==Alignments==

A popular way to determine the ideal parameters has been through the use of alignments.  The concept of alignments is based upon well investigated electrical filter theory.  Filter development is a method of selecting the poles (and possibly zeros) of a transfer function to meet a particular design criterion.  The criteria are the desired properties of a magnitude-squared transfer function, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  From any of the design criteria, the poles (and possibly zeros) of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; are found, which can then be used to calculate the numerator and denominator.  This is the “optimal” transfer function, which has coefficients that are matched to the parameters of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; to compute the appropriate values that will yield a design that meets the criteria.

There are many different types of filter designs, each which have trade-offs associated with them.  However, this design approach is limited because of the structure of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, it has the structure of a fourth-order high-pass filter with all zeros at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Therefore, only those filter design methods which produce a low-pass filter with only poles will be acceptable methods to use.  From the traditional set of algorithms, only Butterworth and Chebyshev low-pass filters have only poles.  In addition, another type of filter called a quasi-Butterworth filter can also be used, which has similar properties to a Butterworth filter.  These three algorithms are fairly simple, thus they are the most popular.  When these low-pass filters are converted to high-pass filters, the &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow 1/s&lt;/math&gt; transformation produces &lt;math&gt;s^8&lt;/math&gt; in the numerator.

More details regarding filter theory and these relationships can be found in numerous resources, including [5].

==Butterworth Alignment==

The Butterworth algorithm is designed to have a &lt;i&gt;maximally flat&lt;/i&gt; pass band.  Since the slope of a function corresponds to its derivatives, a flat function will have derivatives equal to zero.  Since as flat of a pass band as possible is optimal, the ideal function will have as many derivatives equal to zero as possible at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Of course, if all derivatives were equal to zero, then the function would be a constant, which performs no filtering.  

Often, it is better to examine what is called the &lt;i&gt;loss function&lt;/i&gt;.  Loss is the reciprocal of gain, thus 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(s)|^2 = \frac{1}{|H(s)|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The loss function can be used to achieve the desired properties, then the desired gain function is recovered from the loss function.

Now, applying the desired Butterworth property of maximal pass-band flatness, the loss function is simply a polynomial with derivatives equal to zero at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  At the same time, the original polynomial must be of degree eight (yielding a fourth-order function).  However, derivatives one through seven can be equal to zero if [3]

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \Omega^8 \Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \Omega^8}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With the high-pass transformation &lt;math&gt;\Omega \rightarrow 1/\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

It is convenient to define &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \omega/\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 1 \Rightarrow |H(s)|^2 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; or -3 dB.  This definition allows the matching of coefficients for the &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; describing the loudspeaker response when &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB} = \omega_0&lt;/math&gt;.  From this matching, the following design equations are obtained [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellspacing=20&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = a_3 = \sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = 2+\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Quasi-Butterworth Alignment==

The quasi-Butterworth alignments do not have as well-defined of an algorithm when compared to the Butterworth alignment.  The name “quasi-Butterworth” comes from the fact that the transfer functions for these responses appear similar to the Butterworth ones, with (in general) the addition of terms in the denominator.  This will be illustrated below.  While there are many types of quasi-Butterworth alignments, the simplest and most popular is the 3rd order alignment (QB3).  The comparison of the QB3 magnitude-squared response against the 4th order Butterworth is shown below.   

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{QB3}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + B^2(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{B4}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Notice that the case &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the Butterworth alignment.  The reason that this QB alignment is called 3rd order is due to the fact that as &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; increases, the slope approaches 3 dec/dec instead of 4 dec/dec, as in 4th order Butterworth.  This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 5.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:QB3_gradient.GIF]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 5: 3rd-Order Quasi-Butterworth Response for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;math&gt;0.1 \leq B \leq 3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Equating the system response &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|H_{QB3}(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations guiding the design can be found [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B^2 = a^2_1 - 2a_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2^2 + 2 = 2a_1a_3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \sqrt{2a_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 &gt; 2 + \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Chebyshev Alignment==

The Chebyshev algorithm is an alternative to the Butterworth algorithm.  For the Chebyshev response, the maximally-flat passband restriction is abandoned.  Now, a &lt;i&gt;ripple&lt;/i&gt;, or fluctuation is allowed in the pass band.  This allows a steeper transition or roll-off to occur.  In this type of application, the low-frequency response of the loudspeaker can be extended beyond what can be achieved by Butterworth-type filters.  An example plot of a Chebyshev high-pass response with 0.5 dB of ripple against a Butterworth high-pass response for the same &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt; is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Butt_vs_Cheb_HP.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 6: Chebyshev vs. Butterworth High-Pass Response.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Chebyshev response is defined by [4]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \epsilon^2C^2_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;i&gt;Chebyshev polynomial&lt;/i&gt; and is defined by [4]:

&lt;table align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td valign=center rowspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega) = \big\lbrace&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cos}[\it{n}\rm{cos}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cosh}[\it{n}\rm{cosh}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Fortunately, Chebyshev polynomials satisfy a simple recursion formula [4]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(x) = 2xC_{n-1} - C_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

For more information on Chebyshev polynomials, see the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html Wolfram Mathworld: Chebyshev Polynomials] page.

When applying the high-pass transformation to the 4th order form of &lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the desired response has the form [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1+\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2C^2_4(1/\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; determines the ripple.  In particular, the magnitude of the ripple is &lt;math&gt;10\rm{log}[1+\epsilon^2]&lt;/math&gt; dB and can be chosen by the designer, similar to &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; in the quasi-Butterworth case.  Using the recursion formula for &lt;math&gt;C_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_4\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right) = 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^4 - 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Applying this equation to &lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt; [1],

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8}{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8 + \frac{1}{4}\Omega^6 + \frac{5}{4}\Omega^4 - 2\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = \frac{\omega_{3dB}}{2}\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2\sqrt{2+\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Thus, the design equations become [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \omega_n\sqrt[8]{\frac{64\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \rm{tanh}\left[\frac{1}{4}\rm{sinh}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{k^4 + 6k^2 + 1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{k\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt[4]{D}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{1 + k^2(1+\sqrt{2})}{\sqrt{D}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{a_1}{\sqrt{D}}\left[1 - \frac{1 - k^2}{2\sqrt{2}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Choosing the Correct Alignment ==

With all the equations that have already been presented, the question naturally arises, “Which one should I choose?”  Notice that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are not simply related to the parameters of the system response.  Certain combinations of parameters may indeed invalidate one or more of the alignments because they cannot realize the necessary coefficients.  With this in mind, general guidelines have been developed to guide the selection of the appropriate alignment.  This is very useful if one is designing an enclosure to suit a particular transducer that cannot be changed.  

The general guideline for the Butterworth alignment focuses on &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the three coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are a function of &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, fixing one of these parameters yields three equations that uniquely determine the other three.  In the case where a particular transducer is already given, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is essentially fixed.  If the desired parameters of the enclosure are already known, then &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; is a better starting point.  

In the case that the rigid requirements of the Butterworth alignment cannot be satisfied, the quasi-Butterworth alignment is often applied when &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is not large enough..  The addition of another parameter, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, allows more flexibility in the design.

For &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; values that are too large for the Butterworth alignment, the Chebyshev alignment is typically chosen.  However, the steep transition of the Chebyshev alignment may also be utilized to attempt to extend the bass response of the loudspeaker in the case where the transducer properties can be changed.

In addition to these three popular alignments, research continues in the area of developing new algorithms that can manipulate the low-frequency response of the bass-reflex enclosure.  For example, a 5th order quasi-Butterworth alignment has been developed [6]; its advantages include improved low frequency extension, and much reduced driver excursion at low frequencies and typically bi-amping or tri-amping, while its disadvatages include somewhat difficult mathematics and electronic complication (electronic crossovers are typically required).  Another example [7] applies root-locus techniques to achieve results.  In the modern age of high-powered computing, other researchers have focused their efforts in creating computerized optimization algorithms that can be modified to achieve a flatter response with sharp roll-off or introduce quasi-ripples which provide a boost in sub-bass frequencies [8].

Suppose you have a floating point number, for example the output of a mouse area, and you want to round this number to the lower integer bound. One way to do this is to Modulo/Divide the number by 1.

  Input -&gt; Modulo.A   Modulo.Div -&gt; RoundedNumber
  1     -&gt; Modulo.B

It is often useful to add a StepFilter on the output if you only want to trigger on changing values.

In Core, you can round a number by building a macro with a float input and an integer output. If you want to round to the upper number, you can add 1 first. If you want to round to the upper number for fractional values bigger than 0.5, add 0.5 first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Converting a gate signal, for example a midi gate or the mouse button output of a mouse area, to a trigger signal can be used to trigger an envelope, to store a value into a snap value, etc...

This can be achieved using a stepfilter with a threshold of 0.

  GateValue -&gt; StpFlt.In  StpFlt.Out -&gt; TriggerSignal
               StpFlt.Tol

Another way to achieve this is to use a Separator combined with a stepfilter. This can be useful to separate the two-levels of the gate signal into separate signals.

  GateValue -&gt; Separator.In   Separator.Hi -&gt; HighValueTrigger
               Separator.Thld Separator.Lo -&gt; LowValueTrigger

== Frequency Analysis ==

Noise, like any other signal, can be analyzed using the Fourier Transform and frequency-domain techniques. Some of the basic techniques used on noise (some of which are particular to random signals) are discussed in this section. 

Gaussian white noise, one of the most common types of noise used in analysis, has a &quot;flat spectrum&quot;. That is, the amplitude of the noise is the same at all frequencies. 

== Stationary vs Ergodic Functions ==

== Power Spectral Density (PSD) of Gaussian White Noise ==

White noise has a level magnitude spectrum, and if we square it, it will also have a level [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_spectrum Power Spectral Density] (PSD) function. The value of this power magnitude is known by the variable ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. We will use this quantity later.

== Wiener Khintchine Einstein Theorem ==

Using the duality property of the Fourier Transform, the Wiener-Khintchine-Einstein Theorem gives us an easy way to find the PSD for a given signal.

if we have a signal ''f(t)'', with autocorrelation ''R&lt;sub&gt;ff&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we can find the PSD, ''S&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{xx} = \mathcal{F}(R_{ff})&lt;/math&gt;

Where the previous method for obtaining the PSD was to take the Fourier transform of the signal ''f(t)'', and then squaring it.

== Bandwidth ==

The bandwidth of a random function.

=== Noise-Equivalent Bandwidth ===

=== Band limited Systems ===

=== Narrow band Systems ===

== Windowing ==

Many random signals are infinite signals, in that they don't have a beginning or an end. To this effect, the only way to really analyze the random signal is take a small chunk of the random signal, called a '''sample'''.

Let us say that we have a long random signal, and we only want to analyze a sample. So we take the part that we want, and destroy the part that we don't want. Effectively, what we have done is to multiply the signal with a rectangular pulse. Therefore, the frequency spectrum of our sampled signal will contain frequency components of the noise ''and the rectangular pulse''. It turns out that multiplying a signal by a rectangular pulse is rarely the best way to sample a random signal. It also turns out that there are a number of other '''windows''' that can be used instead, to get a good sample of noise, while at the same time introducing very few extraneous frequency components.

Remember duality? multiplication in the time domain (multiplying by your windowing function) becomes ''convolution in the frequency domain.'' Effectively, we've taken a very simple problem (getting a sample of information), and created a very difficult problem, the deconvolution of the resultant frequency spectrum. There are a number of different windows that we can use.
=== Triangular Window ===

=== Hamming Window ===</text>

== Terminology ==

When it comes to filters, there is a large amount of terminology that we need to discuss first, so the rest of the chapters in this section will make sense.

;Order (Filter Order) : The order of a filter is an integer number, that defines how complex the filter is. In common filters, the order of the filter is the number of &quot;stages&quot; of the filter. Higher order filters perform better, but they have a higher delay, and they cost more.

;Pass Band : In a general sense, the passband is the frequency range of the filter that allows information to pass. The passband is usually defined in the specifications of the filter. For instance, we could define that we want our passband to extend from 0 to 1000 Hz, and we want the amplitude in the entire passband to be higher than -1 db.

;Transition Band : The transition band is the area of the filter between the passband and the stopband. Higher-order filters have a thinner transition band

;Stop Band : The stop band of a filter is the frequency range where the signal is attenuated. Stop band performance is often defined in the specification for the filter. For instance, we might say that we want to attenuate all frequencies above 5000 Hz, and we want to attenuate them all by -40 db or more

;Cut-off Frequency: The cut-off frequency of a filter is the frequency at which the filter &quot;breaks&quot;, and changes (between pass band and transition band, or transition band and passband, for instance). The cut-off of a filter ''always has an attenuation of -3db''. The -3 db point is the frequency that is cut in power by exactly 1/2.

== Lowpass ==

Lowpass filters allow low frequency components to pass through, while attenuating high frequency components. 

Lowpass filters are some of the most important and most common filters, and much of our analysis is going to be focused on them. Also, transformations exist that can be used to convert the mathematical model of a lowpass filter into a model of a highpass, bandpass, or bandstop filter. This means that we typically design lowpass filters and then transform them into the appropriate type.

=== Example: Telephone System ===

{{TextBox|As an example of a lowpass filter, consider a typical telephone line. Telephone signals are '''bandlimited''', which means that a filter is used to prevent certain frequency components from passing through the telephone network. Typically, the range for a phone conversation is 10Hz to 3˙000Hz. This means that the phone line will typically incorporate a lowpass filter that attenuates all frequency components above 3˙000Hz.
This range has been chosen because it includes all the information humans need for clearly understanding one another, so the effects of this filtering are not damaging to a conversation.
Comparatively, CD recordings comprise most of the human hearing and their frequency components range up to 20˙000Hz or 20kHz.}}

== Highpass ==

Highpass filters allow high frequency components to pass through, while attenuating low frequency components.

=== Example: DSL Modems ===

{{TextBox|Consider DSL modems, which are high-speed data communication devices that transmit over the existing telephone network. DSL signals operate in the high frequency ranges, above the 3000Hz limit for voice conversations. In order to separate the DSL data signal from the regular voice signal, the signal must be sent into two different filters: a lowpass filter to amplify the voice for the telephone signal, and a highpass filter to amplify the DSL data signal.}}

== Bandpass ==

A bandpass filter allows a single band of frequency information to pass the filter, but will attenuate all frequencies above the band and below the band.

A good example of a bandpass filter is an FM radio tuner. In order to focus on one radio station, a filter must be used to attenuate the stations at both higher and lower frequencies.

== Bandstop ==

A bandstop filter will allow high frequencies and low frequencies to pass through the filter, but will attenuate all frequencies that lay within a certain band.

== Gain/Delay equalizers ==

Filters that cannot be classified into one of the above categories, are called gain or delay equalizers. They are mainly used to equalize the gain/phase in certain parts of the frequency spectrum as needed. More discussion on these kinds of advanced topics will be in [[Signal Processing]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Information drawn exclusively from ''How Sex Changed'' by Joanne Meyerowitz'''

''Individuals with ambiguous sex/gender/sexuality identities have always been present in human societies – they are a genetically assured occurrence and thus we must strive to create at least semi-normalized roles for them. Also, many cultures are not as uncomfortable with sexual/gender ambiguity as Americans are today. There are many examples from the historical/ anthropological record of different cultures tolerating and embracing these people as specially endowed by the creator with specific roles to play in society. But how do we determine today who is male, who is female, and why do we care? Can humans actually change or alter sex, and if so, does this mean that ideas about sex may be much less self-evident than we conventionally treat it.''

The Latin etymology (root) of the prefix “ trans ” (as to clarify meanings and not confuse ourselves) exemplifies ideas such as across, beyond, through, so as to change or transfer material or meanings...

'''Some early attempts to sort out ideas of sex/gender used these organizational schemes, which may be helpful:'''

Primary features – genitals and internal reproductive organs

Secondary features – breasts, body hair, and other physical changes occurring after puberty

Tertiary features – sexual drives and desires towards one particular sex, or both

Quaternary features – socially gendered behaviors – preferences, mannerisms, cloths, occupation

'''Why should we care about the tiny segment of the population that is considered transsexual/transgendered?''' 

•  Extrapolated medical statistics suggest that the total number of people with ambiguous genitalia is comparable to the number of Jews worldwide or about 12 million

•  Transgenderism is at the cutting edge of the debate on the meaning of sex, sexuality, and gender – some political/cultural/social cornerstones of our society based on traditionally static behavior

•  Is sex/gender/sexuality more a biological given of male vs. female or always involving some mix of the two?

• It isn't just about the hundreds of thousands “out” transsexuals in America today, but exactly what their plight, their attempts re-negotiate sex/gender, and society's responses can teach us… (nature/nurture debate)

•  Social and biological researchers are so interested in transsexuals for much the same reasons that they are similarly interested in twin studies (mirror twins especially) – they are rare and get at base human processes

•  To understand the “normal” processes of human sex/gender/sexuality development and differentiation, they look for a gross deviation from the norm and attempt to relate it back to answering the core questions

•  Transsexuals necessarily deliberate management of gender illuminates processes in “normally” gendered acts

•  The term transgender Includes transvestite (cross-dressers), intersexed persons (hermaphrodites), transsexuals, drag queens, “gender benders”, and often butch lesbians and effeminate gay men as well

•  These people have serious problems negotiating social life where there sexual and gendered identity does not fall into a very narrowly defined set of characteristics (often still binary)

•  Thus, they are at risk for a multitude of personal problems over the life course due to anomie (normlessness)

•  They may have trouble being accepted in their family, in interpersonal relationships, in schools, in intimate relationships, and are often discriminated against in professional occupations and legal appeals for civil rights

•  Their health is also more precarious due to higher rates of STDs, AIDS, violence, and illicit drug use

'''Historical Ideas and Trends regarding Transsexuality'''

•  Unlike much of today's medical advances, patients with a “ fierce and demanding drive” to alter their biological sex (“I feel like I've been trapped in a man's/woman's body my whole life), not doctors or pharmaceutical R&amp;D, were the driving force behind the demand for sex-change technologies

•  Transsexuals who wanted sex change but didn't have enough money or didn't live in a time when such medical procedures were performed often turned in desperation to “quacks” or did it themselves (at home!)

•  Transsexuals suffered great abuse at the hands of disgusted police officers, judges, and psychologists

•  The first highly publicized cases in America popped up in the 1950s, but were almost all male-to-female

•  There was an WWII GI from the Bronx , NYC named Christine Jorgensen who traveled to Copenhagen , Denmark in 1952 for two major surgeries to alter her genitals and have massive estrogen therapy

•  “He” came home as a conventionally beautiful “blonde bombshell” whose newfound celebrity got her an regular act at a flashy Manhattan nightclub for the a decade plus, then later autobiography and movie deals

•  The idea that biological sex cannot be wholly constituted by chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia about sex has been increasingly redefined more as a matter of personal choice, psychological disposition

•  Quite a few nations including politically moderate England and Australia have allowed transsexuals to change their biological sex on their birth certificates and thus given greater leeway with civil rights

•  However, transsexuals are often seen as the greatest subversionist threat to the traditional the gender order

•  In fact, there continue to be serious disagreements between transsexuals and the gay community at large and various feminist organizations who sometimes think their agendas might not be mutually beneficial

•  Change will be hard to come by, keep in mind that we still cannot talk about someone in the English language without using appropriate gender pronouns (he, she, her, his) and/or great semantic discomfort

'''Statistics point to disproportionately more male-to-female (MTF) than female-to-male (FTM) sex changes, why?'''

•  This would seem to be especially counterintuitive - why would men want to become part of what is socially considered the weaker sex? No reproductive potential, lower pay, more risk of violence from men, etc.

•  An “embryonic hypothesis” = female is the base sex for early human embryo development – for babies to become fully male, there must be a additionally significant dose of testosterone involved later in development - if the dose is only marginally large enough, there may always be the tendency to revert to base female

•  Older sexologists believed that since male homosexuality seems more common that female homosexuality, extremely effeminate homosexual males' desire for “real” (i.e., heterosexual) men manifests into a desire to become a “quasi-real” woman. To them, “I've been trapped in a man's body my whole life” is just a story.

•  Men are socially more powerful and thus have the power (and masculine drive for control) to actually get up the “courage” (pun = balls) and the money (and possibly job stability) required for the surgery

•  Men also have been known to be more exhibitionist and also use their sex change as a way to parlay themselves into deviant theatrical/talent show drag queen venues

•  Also, MTF transsexuals have received far more publicity in the popular press in the last 50 years than their FTM counterparts, so perhaps this increased visibility has led to more male viewer with similar inclinations taking the plunge into transsexual behaviors

[[Principles of Sociology/Social Science in Higher Education]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Two Steps Back&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/275.ram]... Ten years ago, when he was still a reporter for NPR's All Things Considered, host Ira Glass did a year-long series on a Chicago public school where things were getting better. Test scores were rising. Students were motivated. Last year, changes at the school dismantled some of the programs that had made for the school's success. And one of the best teachers in the school is thinking about quitting. We devote the whole hour to this story, about the rise and fall of school reform.
Prologue. When Ira heard that Cathy La Luz, the best public school teacher he'd met during all his years of education reporting, was considering leaving her job, he went to see her in her classroom. (6 minutes)
Act One. 1994. Washington Irving Elementary School became a model of school reform in Chicago a decade ago. The school did it without adding a ton more money. It wasn't a magnet school or charter school. Their strategy: get the kids to enjoy reading and writing; get them glasses if they need them; give teachers control of their classrooms. Scores climbed. Teachers like Cathy were happy. Students actually liked coming to school. We hear excerpts from Ira's 1994 All Things Considered series about the school. (21 minutes)
Act Two. 2004. We continue with the story of Irving Elementary, and hear what's happened to make Cathy La Luz think about quitting. In just nine months, the reforms that had made the school a model began to unravel. Well-meaning directives from the central school board undermined what the school was trying to do. And the new principal didn't quite understand why the teachers were balking at seemingly small things, like writing up lesson plans. The climate in the school changes. The principal is oblivious. The head of the Chicago schools, Arne Duncan, says he'll look into the problems. Cathy's skeptical. (28 minutes)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Based on John Scanzoni's 2005 book &quot;Universities as if Students Mattered: Social Science on the Creative Edge&quot;'''

'''Some Questions You Should Ponder:'''

1. Given what we think we know about likely future social, technological and economic trends, if we were to create a college or university from scratch today to reflect those changes, what would it look like?

2. How much do you know about the workings of your primary educational institution?

3. How did we get to the point where many, if not most students spend years in higher education not because they love learning, but because they feel intense social pressure to do so in order to be a “success”?

4. How much do you learn in school that you couldn't learn more effectively through hands-on experience?

5. Which group do you think is better at tolerating boredom and following rules: students or professors?

'''Underdeveloped Educational Processes'''

•  Most college courses are based on the ingestion-regurgitation (IR) method, that is, the experts (professors and texts) provide the students with information and students are then judged by how proficiently they reproduce this info in various evaluation contexts (essays, multiple guess, etc.)

•  Research has shown that when utilizing this method, students remember perhaps a quarter of this information when retested in the near future. Not only does this represent mediocre educational performance, but it provides a very monotonous context for learning in general.

•  Furthermore, this method of teaching was originally designed for colleges whose mission it was to “stock the students” minds with the widest possible base of knowledge. This represents the old ways of “culturing” the children of aristocrats, not the application-based learning valued today.

•  Though students and professors alike may be interested in doing things to “make life better” for others, there is not yet a system in place for allowing them to do much in concert to achieve these ambitions. There still remain stark divisions between teaching, research, and “doing good works.”

•  The skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis have always been the hallmarks of good education, but are more so now that job insecurity demands more broad-based learning capacity

'''Conflicting Research and Teaching Objectives'''

•  The “best” universities in the country are judged by research success, not teaching excellence.

•  The most prized departments in a research university (like ours) are physical sciences that consistently produce the components for technological innovation that can be brought to market.

•  Professors advance in their career and achieve tenure (job security) by performing exceptional research work that brings in outside funding. Their teaching activities are but secondary concerns.

•  The vast majority of professors have no formal training in educational theory or practice and thus tend to reproduce the status quo in teaching, which has at this point been reified over generations.

•  With this model in place, the teaching obligations of most professors (if they can't evade them) are at best a burden on their overall careers, so their classes are normally organized with as many labor-saving mechanisms as possible. This ends up looking very mechanized (powerpoint) and IR focused. The emphasis remains on instruction efficiency and not how students actually learn best.

'''Accountability and Entrepreneurship in Higher Education'''

•  State governments have begun to tire of funding such large numbers of university institutions and their students, especially since there are few reliable methods in place to judge the performance of professors and students in the realm of education and preparation for the job market.

•  In Florida, the majority of undergraduate students enrolled in state universities are funded by state scholarships, meaning that that the university system runs not off citizens directly paying tuition for their kids, but from money gained from property taxes (the rich) and lottery profits (the poor).

•  States have begun to try to reduce this burden by encouraging more professors to demonstrate performance by fund their own research initiatives – changing their overall professional designation from that of hired hands for the state to independently contractors i.e. entrepreneurs

•  The state hopes that the innovations developed from increased university research will spur economic activity within the state, thus generating larger tax revenues that justify their job pay

•  These changes devalue teaching further due to the greater pressure on professors to “produce”

•  Some have promoted the growing trend of cyber-credentialing or distance-learning as an option to cut down on overhead for educating a vast number of students. This is mostly an extension of the same efficiency paradigm. The use of high technology does not guarantee high quality education.

'''How the Social Sciences Fell Behind'''

•  Social science in the US was originally begun as an attempt to mirror what the natural sciences had done in improving human well being through technological advancement. The University of Chicago sought to develop social innovations that would help the immense problems stemming from poverty in a largely immigrant city around the turn of the century.

•  Many social scientists of the day were more interested in reform than science. Some blamed the poor for character flaws that caused their situation. Others believed that the public didn't know enough about bad living conditions, and that once they were “enlightened”, things would change.

•  However, their efforts eventually offended many of the powerful men profiting from these poor conditions. Eventually, social science was forced back from this obligation to the betterment of humanity and into a more detached role as an analyst/commentator on the state of the social world.

•  Today, while arts and humanities (history, philosophy, English, etc.) departments are under greatest threat from the new entrepreneur model, the social sciences too face significant challenges because both politicians and the public understand that the hard sciences have been the ones most often fulfilling their mandate to produce innovations that improve human lives.

•  Furthermore, unlike natural scientists, who often collaborate on interdisciplinary research projects with faculty from other departments within the university, academics from the social sciences have more frequently remained mired in their respective disciplinary obscurity.

'''The Coming Credentialing Crisis'''

•  The sheer number of college degrees handed out around the country has been increasing at breakneck speed for a few decades now. It is inevitable that as more individuals acquire such degrees, the less valuable each one becomes. Grade inflation had sped this process further along.

•  Employers need ways to effectively distinguish amongst qualified (credentialed) job candidates. This task cannot be adequately accomplished through assessing GPA and standardized test scores.

•  At present, employers base much of their hiring on the ranked prestige of specific educational institutions. However, these rankings are based mostly on research, not teaching.

•  Many hiring decisions are based on the prestige of the educational institution that students attend, regardless of what quality of education they received there. With the cost of a college degree rising nationwide, these decisions will mostly reflect the socio economic standing of individuals.

•  While they will for some time at least rely on these more unreliable and antiquated methods, the job market of today often requires that candidates present evidence their actual skills and abilities.

'''A Way Out and Over'''

•  Make research based learning the standard – skills can only be reliably cultivated in one way – make students pose a question and then help them launch into the process of trying to answer it – we learn by thinking hard about what actions we are taking to try resolve a specific problem

•  This Discovery Based Learning (DBL) is superior to Learning by Telling and Testing (LTT) and for this reason has been utilized in graduate education for some time now – the only problem is that it currently seems too expensive in large-scale undergraduate education.

•  A different approach that takes seriously both accountability to students and performance of the social sciences' historical mandate to help humanity take possession of society could integrate the two by forming goal-oriented teams to tackle specific problems in the context of higher education.

•  Specific modules would be formed within colleges and universities to develop and test innovative strategies to address social problems or shortcomings worthy of public attention. They would be led by professors and graduate students that specialize in these issues and have developed skills necessary to help undergraduates acquire knowledge and skills necessary to fully participate.

•  An action research model would help utilize both the expertise of the professor and the interested effort of undergraduates to collaborate with folks in the local community to research tough social problems and produce meaningful and empowering social innovations to help the situation.

'''Potential Challenges to a New Model'''

    * The system of tenure is still based mostly on research productivity. Although tenure is an outdated concept, is very attractive for professors' job security and will be resistant to this new model.
    * Could introductory classes be designed to reflect the DBL model or are they totally outmoded?
    * How could the worth of professors as “coaches” in DBL teams be assessed outside the productivity of a specific action research project?
    * How could portions of the population over the age of 25 be integrated for continuing education?

[[Principles of Sociology/Roma Issues]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Lincoln's Second Inaugural&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/68.ram]... we begin with perhaps the most moving, poetic inaugural speech in American history, and look at its legacy today. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln wondered aloud why God saw fit to send the slaughter of the Civil War to the United States. His conclusion: that slavery was a kind of original sin for the United States, for both North and South, and all Americans had to do penance for it.
Prologue. Ira reads briefly from Lincoln's Second Inaugural address, which describes slavery as America's Original Sin of sorts.
Act One. Jack Hitt on the confederate flag over the South Carolina Statehouse.
Act Two. Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. Some stunning parallels between the political strategies of the two leaders, by John Matisonn.
Act Three. Good Blacks, Bad Blacks. Writer Malcolm Gladwell reads from a story that he first wrote for the New Yorker magazine, about his cousins, who immigrated to from Jamaican 12 years ago
Act Four. Good Whites, Bad Whites. A documentary by Cecilia Vaisman, Christina Egloff, with Jay Allison, about a white woman named Carolyn Wren Shannon who grew up hating blacks in a Catholic neighborhood, and how her attitudes change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Race and Ethnicity – The Gypsy (Roma) Phenomena'''

''Social science research has effectively redefined the significance of race - previously based in biological terms - to that of a social construction contingent on the dynamics of particular societies in particular historical eras. However, the ethnicity component that has always played a large role in racial explanations has been much slower to change. While in public society today, one would have a hard time defending explanations of a specific groups' behavior patterns based on racial disposition, ethnicity, or the shared cultural heritage of a particular group, still serves as a popular and largely unexamined explanatory mechanism. Instead of focusing on the often divisive issues of race and ethnicity ever present when discussing the plight of ethnic minorities in American society, it may be more enlightening to examine the similarities between situations and social context of racial/ethnic minorities in other nations.'' 

'''Current World Population Dynamics:''' 13 million Roma worldwide (close to worldwide Jewish population)

- ¾ of the 8 million European Gypsies live in Eastern Europe where they are around 10% of the total pop

- The Roma Diaspora began in India and has now established significant populations all over the world

- These Roma populations do not conform to any one unified group in cultural, political, or ethnic terms

- Roma overall have very high fertility rates compared to the majority populations around them

'''Social Situation of Roma:'''

- Roma lag far behind the majority populations around them in terms of all standard of living indicators

- Roma are generally feared and despised by the majority populations around them, irregardless of specific location, mostly because the rules governing their society are generally very misunderstood by outsiders

- Roma speak a Sanskrit based tongue called Romani, which no one outside their ranks really understands

- Their language and cultural belief systems keep them mostly unintegrated in larger societal institutions

'''Roma history :'''

- They are believed to be a nomadic lower caste from NW India that specialized in music, animal trading, and metal work that were either captured in warfare or sold as slaves after the Islamic invasions in 1000AD

- From there they were able to migrate throughout the Near East, Northern Africa , and Eastern Europe

- In the kingdoms that comprise present day Romania , they were legally enslaved until the mid 1800s

- One million Gypsies were killed in the Holocaust, but they fared much better than the Jews because their history had made them very unassimilated and adept at evading the authorities

- Most Roma fell under the rule of Eastern European communist governments following the end of WWII, who settled the gypsies on collective farms and in factory towns in a program the called “the great halt”

- After the fall of communism in 1989, their were numerous attacks on Roma communities that amounted to government condoned genocide on a people that had never really been assimilated in these societies

- The communists had instead isolated and deracinated many Roma who now had no sense of coherent culture or community in nations where they were by far the poorest and most hated ethnic groups

'''Roma Culture and Customs :'''

- Roma define themselves and other Roma not by group physical attributes, but by knowledge (or lack thereof) of the Romani language and the codes of conduct prescribed by Roma tradition

- Roma culture has a very premodern and traditional division between clean and unclean in all life arenas

- For example, all non Roma are called Gadje, or peasants, and considered very unclean, thus all interactions with gadje outside of economic exploitation bring along fear of contamination

- There are strong gender roles in Roma society – men control secular matters and women control spiritual matters – also, women have the power to pollute men and thus must be controlled by strict behavior codes

- Roma are stratified at three social levels, nation, tribe, and community – there are only a few different nations, many tribes, and many collected communities of unrelated families within the tribes

- There are complex marriage patterns within Roma society that are used to prevent inbreeding while stabilizing networks of power based relationships within and between the tribes

- In Roma families and communities, men have all the decision making power while women are kept subservient and constantly toiling in domestic labor until menopause, after which they become equals

- Roma have very different codes of cleanliness – children often appear very dirty and the yards of their houses are especially cluttered with garbage – but personal hygiene rituals are actually incredibly elaborate

'''How Roma and their Way of Life Survive :'''

- Roma are what are termed “middlemen minorities” in sociology – they make a living by catering to the specific needs of the majority population – in European history, Jews most prominently played this role

- Traditional Roma will not socialize or have sexual relations with gadje under normal circumstances

- The Roma have adjusted their “religion” to fit whatever specific region they reside within

- Roma have had certain historical trades that they have specialized in – horse trading, music, copper metallurgy, bear training, fortune telling, small craft manufacture, theatre performance, begging, etc.

- These trades have largely been decimated by the historical process of industrialization, so gypsies have found other ways of making a living including auto trading and repair, off market commerce, and welfare

- Roma cannot make ethically make money from one another, but there is no such ethical code concerning economic relations with gadje, who they see fit to swindle and steal from at any and all times

- Because of these tenuous relationships with gadje, gypsies have never been able to stay in one place very long… so their nomadic lifestyle is a necessity when one cannot sustainably exist in one place for very long

- Roma communities are very close and are responsible for taking care of group economic needs – so that no individual can hold onto known liquid assets for very long and thus must buy cars and furniture instead

- Furthermore, Roma are communitarian, so family honor and well being of the community is paramount

- The laws of conduct within these communities are very specifically delineated so that there is a traditionally endorsed behavior for almost every conceivable situation encountered in life

- Roma culture offers what the outside world cannot provide - belonging - the worst sanction is banishment

'''Why the Roma are an Important Example to Understand:'''

- It is imperative that we acknowledge the cultural traits of specific groups are not a natural occurrence, but products of specific interaction dynamics between majority/minority groups that make them most workable

- If one does not understand their historical and present circumstances of a group, they cannot explain their behavior and thus must invent self-serving means to explain their “strange self-defeating behavior”

- Roma have been subject to the same kind of persecution that many ethnic minority groups have faced throughout history – slavery, bonded labor servitude, segregation, discrimination, genocide, stereotyping

- Social and economic displacement courtesy of the dominant society has followed them everywhere – if no one allowed them to settle anywhere under decent conditions, why wouldn't they keep perpetually moving

- Gypsy stereotypes justify the majority/minority power relationships = lazy thieves, dirty and diseased, cannibals, baby snatchers, devil worshipers, spies for foreign powers, assassins, etc.

- Often, minority groups capitalize on stereotypical beliefs to present a certain kind of image to outsiders that could help them profit – exoticized Gypsy fortune tellers present a certain kind of occult mystique

- The degree of difference that Roma communities exemplify is a test of civil society – How can societies cope with truly different groups that are unwilling to assimilate or compromise their values?

'''Europeans keep asking... What to do with the Gypsies…'''

- One might hope that today's societies would have more of a place for Roma culture… their historical opposition to settled agriculture is now moot, Gypsies are notably good at free market commerce, and as a whole, the world has become more accepting of multiculturalism ideals

- Still, the Roma people have big problems – high unemployment, low literacy, low life expectancy

- Gypsies trying to get to Western Europe have not been well received and often their statelss predicament has not been recognized – thus they remain displaced people with no real chance in life

- Roma culture does not blend in well with modernization – they dislike gadje doctors (sometimes they sterilize Roma women), gadje schools (track Roma children into lowest classes), and the gadje legal systems that try to stop their child marriage and dowry systems, nomadic lifestyle, and business ventures

- Furthermore, Roma are unlikely to be able to organize their own institutions or their own de facto territories (like the Kurds perhaps) very well, because their social structure doesn't promote collaboration

- Outside the confines of family and community, Roma leaders counter productively infight for personal aggrandizement, collaborating with gadje officials in the process and further tarnishing the Roma image

- Can “gypsy problems” be redefined from focusing on disparate social problems to a unified ethnic issue?

- In Romania today, gypsies account for about 20% of the total population. They are openly despised and discriminated against. The kinds of human rights violations that define the Romanian peoples relationship with Roma are a major issue, perhaps a core one holding them back from EU integration… can gypsies organize cross nationally to take advantage of this situation and garner some real political clout in the process?

[[Principles of Sociology/Gender Stratification]] 

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Three Women and the Sex Industry&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/55.ram] A few months ago, radio producer Sandy Tolan was supposed to do a documentary about strippers with an aspiring writer--and stripper--named Susan. A few days before they were to begin working together, she disappeared, presumed dead. Sandy interviewed her friends and family, to make an unusual and powerful documentary about who she was, and about the world she inhabited. Following that is a story by therapist Lauren Slater about a case she had of a tough man, obsessed with porn, and how he changed.
Prologue. Ira with Sarah, who did phone sex and nude dancing
Act One. Sandy Tolan documentary on Susan Walsh

      <text xml:space="preserve">''I am of the opinion that a prime measurement of the goodness of a society must be how much of their population's potential they utilize. In more modern societies, it is thought that task specialization (what Durkheim called organic solidarity) replaced the need for an expansion of the general knowledge base of most members of societies. Nowadays, in the so-called post-modern or information age, it isn't so much knowing how to fix cars and household appliances that is so crucial, but understanding other people's behavior patterns and means of justification that proves useful. We still have a lot of leftover barriers from the days of mechanical solidarity along the lines of race, class, and gender especially. These barriers restrict our development as individuals insomuch as they constrain our choices throughout our lives. Our key task is to discuss how socially gendered systems of meaning are constructed, maintained, and changed.''

Interesting Thoughts and Examples:

Why might sorority row be located where it is today? Conversely, what about fraternity row? 
(I ask this of my freshman students at the University of Florida and almost none can reason it out... frat row is next to the law school and sorority row is next to the education college)

What do you think the two professions are in which average women's earnings outpace men's?

 
Gender Polarization refers to the tendency to construct more homogenized, mutually exclusive ideal types of male/female characteristics rather than embracing the naturally occurring diversity within the gender spectrum. This also refers to the ways we initially stereotype the ways we think others relate to the world.
 

Stratification on the basis of sex/gender channel males and females into very different and often unequal life situations. However, resistance to this system is often mitigated by the process of enculturation, whereby individuals encountering hegemonic gendered discourses and institutions gradually internalize socially acceptable standards of behavior and are rewarded for constructing identities consistent with them.

 
Androcentrism refers to the idea that our society is male-centered, that is, hegemonic notions of masculinity are what most individuals must live up to in order to access positions of high status and prestige.
 

Throughout history, men in positions of power have argued that gender stratification is inherent in societies due to biological essentialism (sociobiology). Others have used religious texts as justification. The same lines of argument were long used to oppress all racial/ethnic groups outside of Nordic Europeans, but it seems that with gender, this reasoning has not been so fully discredited and still curries public favor.

•  Gendered conservation of energy was used to justify women's exclusion from education and voting because proponents argued that women would use up their “vital energy” on intellectual pursuits, thus leaving insufficient quantities for the optimal development of reproductive faculties.

•  Darwin concluded that males of a particular species are always more highly evolved than the females because males' selection relies on more competition with sexual rivals.

•  Evidence that men are innately more active and dynamic can be found in the behavior of sperm, while evidence that females are innately passive can be found in the behavior of the egg.

 

When thinking about how biology influences behavior, as it doubtlessly does, we have three choices:

   1. Exaggerate biological dispositions
   2. Try to change biological limitations through other innovations (technological, social)
   3. Accept biological limitations and adapt within them

 

We have made significant strides in minimizing #1 and expanding #2, but the third option still seems to be our cultural default. The real flaw in this reasoning lies in the notion that common sense folk knowledge or science as it's currently practiced (tools and ethics) can really apprehend “human nature”, especially gender

 

Since it seems that more and more we're settling on option #2, we should look at how people attempt to alter the cultural environment and corresponding social systems of meaning corresponding with gender…

 

We've witnessed in the Western world and in much of the non-Western world a political movement over the last 150 years that has transformed women from an almost totally disenfranchised and disempowered population whose social relevance only extended as far as their father/husband to full fledged equal citizens

 

Still, gross inequities remain. Most all of these cannot be effectively chalked up to biology. With the opportunities for women seemingly expanded to such a large degree, it seems strange that persistent social patterns that disadvantage women remain. Equally as strange has been men's role change stagnation. Why?

 

Possible explanations: 1. Entrenched cultural scripts… example = linguistic sexism

•  Think of some popular slang to describe intercourse… and what do you find?

•  500 synonyms for prostitute and 1000 sexually derogatory words/phrases to describe women

•  10 times as many slang terms for stupid/superficial women as for similar men

•  “girls and guys” not “boys and girls” – women often described as irresponsible, immature, small

•  women professionals are often linguistic derivatives of masculine nouns – men get male nurse

•  formal distinctions based marriage status are only used for women – Ms. is best perceived

•  he, his, and man are still used as our generic descriptors – men and women respond differently

Does language merely represent our past values and prejudices or does it actively reinforce it? Social psychologists have shown that people given a position paper to read enough times will begin to adjust their own attitudes towards that position, regardless of initial disposition, this is how “brainwashing” is done…

 

2. Workplace androcentrism and power

•  women are underpaid and underemployed relative to men – hence the higher poverty

•  the more women in a specific profession, the more its prestige declines

•  model behavior for success in the professional/corporate workplace is traditionally unfeminine – women must vanquish their femininity lest they be seen as weak or sexually conniving, but then face the stigma of being labeled “manly” - demanding too much and stepping out of their “place”

•  the subordination of all other life activities to the service of workplace achievement requires that someone else take care of your other essential life activities for you (food, children, cleaning) – in effect, a wife – however, few men will take a position and look after their wives' affairs

•  women know how to work in teams, but not in teams that don't want token players on them.

•  Minorities have great difficulties exercising power because they need approval from the majority

•  Women must also negotiate disproportionate burdens at home while in fulfilling their female role over the life course – “the double shift”

 

3. Ineffective tactics of the feminist movement

•  Why do you think most American adults don't favor women using collective action to better their social position? Is it because they truly fear gender equity at a visceral level, or because they fear particular representations of feminism? Where are their public relations advisors?

•  Like most movements that seem to achieve success in their early days (1960s) – certain subgroups with more extreme agendas (for better or worse) branched off – deflecting public attention off their core mainstream goals (mentioned in book) and socialist and radical versions emerged

•  Furthermore, the rhetoric wasn't well tuned from the beginning – in retrospect, why name a movement that advocates equality for men and women feminism – we can see the early justifications, but today most uninformed people interpret the term as a female power grab…

•  How do feminist organizations go about attempting to persuade men, the assumed principle opposition to the feminist agenda, of the righteousness of their political vision?

•  Feminists have had a lot of trouble reconciling different cultural beliefs as well, especially along religion lines, but along class and racial ones as well

•  What is the feminist vision today and what group is responsible for disseminating it to the public at large? How could it be improved to advance the interests of women in America ?

 

4. Men and Masculinities

•  Men haven't been paid nearly as much attention to over the last 50 years or so and their change movements have been even more hokey and ineffective than women's – Christian revival of family values (the “Promise Keepers”) and wilderness retreats to revive the “wild man within” (read Robert Bly's Iron John)

•  Men haven't changed their behaviors and attitudes nearly as fast as women – as is usually the case with a group in power responding to a challenge to that power – its only now in the last decade or so that some men have begun to soften their masculine displays, hence the metrosexual emergence

•  Why would men in their current mindset relinquish power, especially when they think it comes directly at the expense of their manhood?

Filter design mostly bases on a limited set of widely used transfer functions.
Optimization methods allow to design other types of filters, but the functions listed here have been studied extensively, and designs for these filters (including circuit designs to implement them) are readily available.
The filter functions [[#Comparison|presented here]] are of lowpass type, and [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Transforms|transformation methods]] allow to obtain other common filter types such as highpass, bandpass or bandstop.

== Butterworth Filters ==

[[Image:Butterworth Filter Orders.svg|thumb|350px|right|Plot of the amplitude response of the normalized Butterworth lowpass transfer function, for orders 1 to 5]]
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter Butterworth filter function] has been designed to provide a maximally flat amplitude response.
This is obtained by the fact that all the derivatives up to the filter order minus one are zero at DC.
The amplitude response has no ripple in the passband.
It is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;A(j\omega) = |H(j\omega)| = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{1+\omega^{2n}} }&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that whilst the amplitude response is very smooth, the step response shows noticeable overshoots. They are due to the phase response which is not linear or, in other words, to the group delay which is not constant.

The amplitude response plot shows that the slope is 20''n''&amp;nbsp;dB/decade, where ''n'' is the filter order.
This is the general case for all-pole lowpass filters.
Zeros in the transfer function can accentuate the slope close to their frequency, thus masking this general rule for zero-pole lowpass filters.

The plot also shows that whatever the order of the filter, all the amplitudes cross the same point at &lt;math&gt;A(\omega = 1) = \frac {1}\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to approximatively -3&amp;nbsp;db.
This -3&amp;nbsp;db reference is often used to specify the cutoff frequency of other kinds of filters.

Butterworth filters don't have a particularly steep drop-off but, together with [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Chebyshev_Type_I|Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;I]] filters, they are of all-pole kind.
This particularity results in reduced hardware (or software, depending on the implementation method), which means that for a similar complexity, higher order Butterworth filters can be implemented, compared to functions with a steeper drop-off such as [[#Elliptic_Filters|elliptic filters]].

=== Zeroes of the Butterworth function ===

[[File:Butterworth poles 4.svg|right|thumb|150 px|Poles of a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth filter]]
The normalized Butterworth function is indirectly defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;H(s) \cdot H(-s) = \frac{1}{1+\omega^{2n}}&lt;/math&gt;

This functions has zeros regularly placed on the unit circle.
Knowing that a stable filter has all of its poles on the left half s-plane, it is clear that the left half poles on the unit circle belong to &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, whilst the right half poles on the right belong to &lt;math&gt;H(-s)&lt;/math&gt;.

The normalized Butterworth function has a cutoff frequency at &lt;math&gt;f_c = \omega_c / (2 \pi) = 1/ (2 \pi) [Hz]&lt;/math&gt;.
A different cutoff frequency is achieved by [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Transforms#Lowpass_to_Lowpass|scaling]] the circle radius to &lt;math&gt;\omega_c = 2 \pi f_c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Butterworth Transfer Function ===

The transfer function of a Butterworth filter is of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{den(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be written as a function of the poles:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{k}{\prod_{i=1}^N (s-p_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

With this, the denominator ploynom is found from the values of the poles.

== Chebyshev Filters ==

In comparison to Butterworth filters, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_filter Chebyshev filters] have a supplemental parameter: a ripple in amplitude.
This ripple, which could be considered as non ideal, has the tremendous advantage to allow a steeper roll-off between passband and stopband.

The ripple can happen in the passband, which is the case for Type I Chebyshev filters, or in the stopband for Type II filters.

=== Chebyshev Polynomials ===

[[File:Chebyshev Polynomials of the 1st Kind (n=0-5, x=(-1,1)).svg|thumb|300px|Chebyshev polynomials in the domain {{nowrap|&amp;minus;1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1}}]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials Chebyshev Polynomials] have the property to remain in the range &lt;math&gt;-1 &lt; T_n(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; for an input in the range &amp;minus;1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1 and then rapidly grow outside this range.
This characteristic is a good prerequisite for devising transfer functions with limited oscillations in a given frequency range and steep roll-offs at its borders.

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined by the recurrence relation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T_0(x) &amp; = 1 \\
T_1(x) &amp; = x \\
T_{n+1}(x) &amp; = 2x \cdot T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are:

:&lt;math&gt; T_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_4(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;

=== Chebyshev Type I ===

[[File:Chebyshev Type I Filter Response (4th Order).svg|thumb|350px|Frequency response of a fourth-order type I Chebyshev filter]]
Chebyshev type I filters show a ripple in the passband. 
The [[Signals_and_Systems/Frequency_Response#Amplitude_Response|amplitude response]] as a function of angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of the ''n''th-order low-pass filter is:

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(\omega) = \left | H_n(j \omega) \right | = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2 T_n^2\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the ripple factor, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cutoff frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;T_n()&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Chebyshev Polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial]] of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between 0 and 1 so the filter gain will alternate between maxima at ''G'' = 1 and minima at &lt;math&gt;G=1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt;. At the cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; the gain again has the value &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt; but continues to drop into the stop band as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at −3 [[decibel|dB]] is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.

=== Chebyshev Type II ===

[[Image:ChebyshevII response.png|thumb|350px|Frequency response of a fifth-order type II Chebyshev filter]]
Chebyshev Type II filters have ripples in the stopband.
The amplitude response is:

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(\omega,\omega_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \frac{1} {\varepsilon^2 T_n ^2 \left ( \omega_0 / \omega \right )}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the stopband, the gain will always be smaller than

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Also known as inverse Chebyshev, this filter function is less common because it does not roll-off as fast as type I, and requires more components.
Indeed, the transfer function exhibits not only poles but also zeros.

== Elliptic Filters ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauer_filter Elliptic filters], also called Cauer filters, suffer from a ripple effect like Chebyshev filters. However, unlike the type 1 and Type 2 Chebyshev filters, Elliptic filters have ripples in both the passband and the stopband. To counteract this limitation, Elliptic filters have a very aggressive rolloff, which often more than makes up for the ripples.

== Comparison ==

The following image shows a comparison between 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth, Chebyshev and elliptic filter amplitude responses.

[[Image:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]

== Bessel Filters ==

== Filter Design ==

Using what we've learned so far about filters, this chapter will discuss filter design, and will show how to make decisions as to the type of filter (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic), and will help to show how to set parameters to achieve a set of specifications.</text>

== Merge ==

Apparently there is another embedded systems book out there that i wasnt aware of when i created this book. I've seen the other book, and agree wholeheartedly that the two books should merge in one way or another. The current request is that the other book be merged into this book, and I agree with that because the [[Embedded Systems]] book has a shorter name (which is easier for writing links), and already has a much more extensive table of contents that will eventually be filled in. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:23, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

I would be happy to link here from the [[Software Engineers Handbook]] instead of having a separate chapter there.  What do I need to do to have it happen? [[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 00:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

== C++ ==

Why C and not C++?

you can get a 32 bit embedded processor for $3-4 nowadays.  There's no reason to not use a programming language suitable for complex embedded projects.

C++ for embedded systems could be its own chapter, as there are a few tricks to getting the footprint small.

''That sounds wonderful. Would you mind clueing the rest of us in on the name of this wonderful processor? I'm astonished that Digikey sells the Texas Instruments TMS320 floating-point DSP for $20 in ones. But a 32 bit processor for under $5 ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 11:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)''

An example of such cheap 32-bit processor is the LPC2103 from Philips.  Cost is $4.7 in Qty of one and $2.92 in Qty of 100.  Priced April 9, 2006.

: ''Wow, that is great. Thank you so much, Jean-Samuel, for informing me that I *can* get a 32 bit embedded processor, which are much easier to program, for about the same price as a 8 bit processor. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:57, 1 October 2007 (UTC)''

Well, C is more &quot;controllable&quot; than C++ (not only the footprint) but the perfect examples would be in ASM not C.

PS: You can also get an SUV but can you afford the gasoline :)

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

Well, Its definitely a good idea to include the &quot;C++ for Embedded Systems&quot; Chapter towards the end. I suggested C because I have been working in C :o)
And yes, the examples will mostly be in ASM and C, as appropriate. Later on we can add examples in C++ in the seperate chapter.

I also plan to add a chapter on UML for Real-time Systems Design. Ill prepare notes on it as I myself learn the techniques. 

--[[User:Siddord|Siddord]] 10:58, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:When I set up the original outline for this book, I wanted very strongly to keep it language-neutral. However, C and Assembly are simply more popular choices for use in embedded systems. You have to keep in mind that C is a very simple language (much simpler then C++), and this is a benefit to small companies with small microprocessors that need to write their own compiler. Also, a number of companies have produced systems using C derivatives, such as &quot;Dynamic C&quot; for use in the Z-World RabbitCores. C++, because of it's built-in need for dynamic memory allocation, and the complexities of function overloading, operator overloading, and templates is generally not a common choice for use in embedded systems, nor is it considered when a company needs to write it's own, proprietary compiler for a specific microcontroller. Another popular language that is used in embedded systems is BASIC, so if people want to talk about that, i think that would be a good idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)


:In my expierience C++ is used for complex GUIs (e.g. in navigation systems) or for control engineering purposes. All low level drivers (Communication Stack, OS, perpherals) are written in C. I never saw someone writing a flash or eeprom driver in C++. Direct hardware access is generally written in C. --[[User:Hudsontng|Hudsontng]] 22:59, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

=== I'd like to lend a hand ===

Hello everyone;

I'm involved in embedded systems too and would like to
lend a hand.

I first came across Wikipedia some time ago when I was
looking for some mathematics definitions.  I was very
impressed by the professionalism of what I found.

Maybe its premature to ask, as I will be digging into
the documention, but I saw a comment suggesting that
its desirable to register as a writer.  How might I
do that, please?

Jonathan

Logged in, will have to delete my anonymous comment

Hello there Jonathan,

Well the reference to &quot;get registered to become a writer&quot; is about creating a login on Wikibooks, nothing more, just to be easier to talk to you and trace your edits (also, you will get your own &quot;page&quot; and sandbox to test stuff out, etc...)

As for Wikipedia take notice that this is not Wikipedia but Wikibooks almost the same but not quite :), here we create books not encyclopedic articles...

===Wikibooks:Naming policy===

Some one posted a warning on the [[Talk:Programming in C -/- -/-]] about the naming policies on Wikibooks:

''Prehaps you should read the Wikibooks:Naming policy. The current name is running under WB:NP#Historical_conventions. So if at all a new name should be somthing like:''

    * Cpp Programming
    * How-To programm in C plus plus
    * Programming in C -/- -/-

''Ohterwise you end up being not a book but only chapter in a very very big Programming book.''

This book seems also to be in need of a new name... and the &quot;chapters&quot; seem to be lose (with no book name)
 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

=== (embeddable) Databases information chapter/content ===

I have had to do some researching on (embeddable) Databases, some content on that topic would be a great contribution to the overall book. 

example: References to [[http://sqlite.org/ SQLite]] and other solutions, some content could be used from wikipedia.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:02, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== Development stages ==

I suggest that TOC uses {{tl|stage short}}. It's a bit confusing now, because there's no red links, but some chapters are blank. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)


:Yeah, i was going to get around to doing that eventually. maybe the time is now (especially if this book is garnering CoM attention). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:39, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== PIC Projects ==

I have a number of PIC projects planned for the next few months, and once i get them rolling, I'm going to introduce a number of pages in an &quot;Examples&quot; chapter or something. I am going to order a number of 8051 also, and i will post projects involving them. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:39, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

I am looking forward to it.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== chapter names ==

The [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy#Flat]] recommends the &quot;flat&quot; naming convention for new books.

Does anyone have any objections to flattening this book?
If not, I'm going to move
* [[Embedded Systems/Embedded System Basics/Fixed-Point Arithmetic]] to [[Embedded Systems/Fixed-Point Arithmetic]]
* [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller/PIC Programming]] to [[Embedded Systems/PIC Programming]]
* [[Embedded Systems/Assembly Language/Mixed C and Assembly Programming/Inline Assembly]] to [[Embedded Systems/Inline Assembly]]
* [[Embedded Systems/Assembly Language/Mixed C and Assembly Programming/Calling Conventions]] to [[Embedded Systems/Calling Conventions]]
* etc.
(Feel free to suggest better names).

Also, as [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] suggests, I'll try to rename any &quot;loose&quot; chapters as I find them, so they begin with &quot;Embedded Systems/&quot;. (Although [[User:Whiteknight]] keeps beating me to it). Then there are exactly 2 levels of hierarchy, seperated by a single slash: ''book name'', slash, ''chapter name''.

However, feel free to organize the table of contents on the [[Embedded Systems]] page with as many levels of heirarchy as anyone wants.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:I guess i have no problem with flattening it out, although I don't see a huge need to. If you are willing to burn the elbow grease, then by all means. I didnt realize that it was official policy to prefer the flat scheme over the hierarchical scheme (so maybe i should pay more attention to naming policy). --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 17:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:I started flattening out most of the chapter names. I've merged some stub pages together also. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:37, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== New to Embededd need help ==

Hello to all the great people there,
I'm very new to this field but as i was intrested in C and C++ i decided to move here. So i need your help.

I have been working on AVR-Atmega16 microcontroller with C. When i read the datasheet(350 pages) of this micro-c,i was confused. There was to much stuff. kindly tell me what i have to choose from that.

As i am in this arena i want u to kindly tell me what exactly happens in a live embedded project. It will very kind of you if you explain me every step.

Thanks, Vivek

:Well, this book is designed to discuss all the issues of embedded systems, but this talk page is hardly the place to give a complete run-through. If you have an account here let me know your user name, and I can work to get you going in the right direction. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 14:39, 5 December 2005 (UTC)



== references to paper books ==
moved to [[Embedded Systems/Resources#Books]]

== FPGA Programming Section ==

This entire section was poorly laid out, and is in need of repairs. I am planning an outline for a new book called &quot;Programmable Logic Design&quot;, that I hope to implement within the next couple weeks (depending on my work schedule), and I think that would be a better place for this material. If anybody wants to work to clean up the FPGA section, feel free, but if it doesn't get fixed, I think we should move all that material into the new book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

:Moved. I've posted a link to the other book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== rename from &quot;RTOS&quot; to &quot;embedded OS&quot; ==

I am surprised that none of the OSes listed in the &quot;Common RTOS&quot; section (Palm OS, Windows CE, MS-DOS or DOS Clones) qualify as a RTOS, at least according to my understanding of the term RTOS.

I think we should we rename that section something more accurate.
What would be a good name? &quot;embedded OS&quot;?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 09:20, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with you, although I tend to come to the opposite conclusion. Instead of renaming the section, I would prefer deleting it entirely. We could replace it instead with information about true Real-Time OS's, and not just small blurbs about common commercial embedded OSs. Barring that, I might like to create a separate book about RTOS entirely, in which case we could certainly rename the section here as you propose and leave a real discussion about RTOS for a more focused book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:55, 10 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Embedded Technology is now in its prime and the wealth of knowledge available is mindblowing. However, most embedded systems engineers have a common complaint. There are no comprehensive resources available over the internet which deal with the various design and implementation issues of this technology. Intellectual property regulations of many corporations are partly to blame for this and also the tendency to keep technical know-how within a restricted group of researchers.

Before embarking on the rest of this book, it is important first to cover exactly what embedded systems are, and how they are used. This wikibook will attempt to cover a large number of topics, some of which apply only to embedded systems, but some of which will apply to nearly all computers (embedded or otherwise). As such, there is a chance that some of the material from this book will overlap with material from other wikibooks that are focused on topics such as low-level computing, assembly language, computer architecture, etc. But we will first start with the basics, and attempt to answer some questions before the book actually begins.

== What is an Embedded Computer? ==

The first question that needs to be asked, is &quot;What exactly is an embedded computer?&quot; An embedded computer is frequently a computer that is implemented for a particular purpose. In contrast, an average PC computer usually serves a number of purposes: checking email, surfing the internet, listening to music, word processing, etc... However, embedded systems usually only have a single task, or a very small number of related tasks that they are programmed to perform.

Every home has several examples of embedded computers. Any appliance that has a digital clock, for instance, has a small embedded micro-controller that performs no other task than to display the clock. Modern cars have embedded computers onboard that control such things as ignition timing and anti-lock brakes using input from a number of different sensors. 

Embedded computers rarely have a generic interface, however. Even if embedded systems have a keypad and an LCD display, they are rarely capable of using many different types of input or output. An example of an embedded system with I/O capability is a security alarm with an LCD status display, and a keypad for entering a password. 

In general, an Embedded System:
It is a combination of hardware and software that performs a specific task.

* ''Is a system built to perform its duty, completely or partially independent of human intervention.''
* ''Is specially designed to perform a few tasks in the most efficient way.''
* ''Interacts with physical elements in our environment, e.g. controlling and driving a motor, sensing temperature, etc.''

An embedded system can be defined as a control system or computer system designed to perform a specific task. Common examples of embedded systems include MP3 players, navigation systems on aircraft and intruder alarm systems. An embedded system can also be defined as a single purpose computer.

Most embedded systems are time critical applications meaning that the embedded system is working in an environment where timing is very important: the results of an operation are only relevant if they take place in a specific time frame. An autopilot in an aircraft is a time critical embedded system.  If the autopilot detects that the plane for some reason is going into a stall then it should take steps to correct this within milliseconds or there would be catastrophic results.

== What are Embedded Systems Used For? ==

Embedded systems are considered when the cost of implementing a product designed in software on a microprocessor and some small amount of hardware, is cheaper, more reliable, or better for some other reason than a discrete hardware design.  It is possible for one small and relatively cheap microprocessor to replace dozens or even hundreds of hardware logic gates, timing circuits, input buffers, output drivers, etc.  It also happens that one generic embedded system with a standard input and output configuration can be made to perform in a completely different manner simply by changing the software.

The uses of embedded systems are virtually limitless, because every day new products are introduced to the market that utilize embedded computers in novel ways. In recent years, hardware such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, and FPGA chips have become much cheaper. So when implementing a new form of control, it's wiser to just buy the generic chip and write your own custom software for it. Producing a custom-made chip to handle a particular task or set of tasks costs far more time and money. Many embedded computers even come with extensive libraries, so that &quot;writing your own software&quot; becomes a very trivial task indeed. 

From an implementation viewpoint, there is a major difference between a computer and an embedded system. Embedded systems are often required to provide '''''Real-Time response'''''. A '''''Real-Time system''''' is defined as a system whose correctness depends on the timeliness of its response. Examples of such systems are flight control systems of an aircraft, sensor systems in nuclear reactors and power plants. For these systems, delay in response is a fatal error. A more relaxed version of '''''Real-Time Systems''''', is the one where timely response with small delays is acceptable. Example of such a system would be the Scheduling Display System on the railway platforms. In technical terminology, '''''Real-Time Systems''''' can be classified as:

* '''''Hard Real-Time Systems''''' - systems with severe constraints on the timeliness of the response.
* '''''Soft Real-Time Systems''''' - systems which tolerate small variations in response times.
* '''''Hybrid Real-Time Systems''''' - systems which exhibit both hard and soft constraints on its performance.

== What are Some Downfalls of Embedded Computers? ==

Embedded computers may be economical, but they are often prone to some very specific problems. A PC computer may ship with a glitch in the software, and once discovered, a software patch can often be shipped out to fix the problem. An embedded system, however, is frequently programmed once, and the software cannot be patched. Even if it is possible to patch faulty software on an embedded system, the process is frequently far too complicated for the user.

Another problem with embedded computers is that they are often installed in systems for which unreliability is not an option. For instance, the computer controlling the brakes in your car cannot be allowed to fail under any condition. The targeting computer in a missile is not allowed to fail and accidentally target friendly units. As such, many of the programming techniques used when throwing together production software cannot be used in embedded systems. Reliability must be guaranteed before the chip leaves the factory. This means that every embedded system needs to be tested and analyzed extensively.

An embedded system will have very few resources when compared to full blown computing systems like a desktop computer. The memory capacity and processing power in an embedded system is limited. It is more challenging to develop an embedded system when compared to developing an application for a desktop system as we are developing a program for a very constricted environment. Some embedded systems run a scaled down version of operating system called an RTOS (real time operating system).

== Why Study Embedded Systems? ==

Embedded systems are playing important roles in our lives every day, even though they might not necessarily be visible. Some of the embedded systems we use every day control the menu system on television, the timer in a microwave oven, a cellphone, an MP3 player or any other device with some amount of intelligence built-in. In fact, recent poll data shows that embedded computer systems currently outnumber humans in the USA.
Embedded systems is a rapidly growing industry where growth opportunities are numerous.

==Who is This Book For? ==

This book is designed to accompany a course of study in computer engineering. However, this book will also be useful to any reader who is interested in computers, because this book can form the starting point for a &quot;bottom up&quot; learning initiative on computers. It is fundamentally easier to study small, limited, simple computers than it is to start studying the big PC behemoths that we use on a daily basis. Many topics covered in this book will be software topics as well, so this book will be the most helpful to people with at least some background in programming (especially C and Assembly languages). Having a prior knowledge of semiconductors and electric circuits will be beneficial, but will not be required.

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will focus primarily on embedded systems, but the reader needs to understand 2 simple facts:

# This book cannot proceed far without a general discussion of microprocessor architecture
# Many of the concepts discussed in this book apply equally well, if not better, to Desktop computers than to embedded computers.

In the general interests of completeness, this book will cover a number of topics that have general relevance to all computers in general. Many of the lessons in this book will even be better applied by a desktop computer programmer than by an embedded systems engineer. It might be more fair to say that this book is more about &quot;Low Level Computing&quot; than &quot;Embedded Systems&quot;.

This book will, of course, cover many embedded systems topics that are irrelevant when programming desktop computers,
such as cross-compilers, Real-Time Operating Systems, EEPROM storage, code compression, bit-banging serial ports, umbilical development, etc.

== Where to Go From Here ==

After reading this book, there are a number of potential fields of study to continue learning.

* For people interested in operating systems, and hardware-software interfacing, read the [[Operating System Design]] wikibook.
* For people interested in C programming or Assembly Programming, see the [[Programming:C]] and [[X86 Assembly]] wikibooks, respectively.
* For people interested in digital control systems, there will eventually be a book on that topic here ( [[Programmable Logic]] )
* For people interested in digital signal processing, there will eventually be a book on that subject.
* For people interested in a further study of more advanced computer systems, there will eventually be books on computer hardware and microprocessors here. ( [[Microprocessor Design]] )
* For people interested in an even lower-level understanding of electronics, see [[Digital Circuits]].
* [[Wikiversity: School of Very Small Information Systems]] is a course that includes using Java running on a FPGA.
* For people interested in designing motion control systems, that is, computer-controlled machines such as robots, machine tools, cars, buses, airplanes, ships, satellites, telescopes, etc., see [[Embedded Control Systems Design]].

== Which Programming Languages Will This Book Use? ==

We try to make this wikibook ''language neutral''. It is not fair to focus on one language, when all embedded computers can't be programmed in that language.

However, it is nice to have functional example code in some real language.
Also, it is useful to point out some features of popular programming languages that are especially important for embedded systems.

* ANSI C programming language: Many microprocessors and microcontrollers can be programmed in C, and a number of C cross-compilers exist for that purpose. C is perhaps the most frequently used language for new embedded system development. The &quot;const&quot; and the &quot;volatile&quot; keywords, rarely used in desktop app programming, become very important in [[Embedded Systems/C Programming]].
* Originally developed by the department of defense for real-time operating systems and embedded systems, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29 Ada] was designed with multiprocessor support and strong compile-time checks to ensure the quality and integrity of developed systems -- Many microcontrollers can be programmed with Ada as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNAT GNAT] Ada compiler it is part of the often ported [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection GNU Compiler Collection], though documentation is often not as available as other more popular languages such as C.
* Assembly language: There are many different microcontroller families, each with their own assembly language with its own unique quirks. This book will cover some basics of assembly language common to most microcontrollers. Unlike desktop app programming, embedded system programs generally must set up an &quot;interrupt vector table&quot;.
* This book will discuss (at least briefly) some techniques for multi-language programming (specifically C and assembly).
* There are some instances where microcontrollers are better programmed in a different language ([[w:BASIC|BASIC]] and [[w:Forth|Forth]] come to mind)
* Some controllers are even programmed in their own proprietary languages (PIC Basic, and [http://imaginetools.com/support/downloads/ Dynamic C] for instance).
* Some extremely well-known languages, such as C++ and Java, are rarely used in embedded systems, because C++ and Java compilers are simply unavailable for popular microcontrollers. However, this book may occasionally describe how to implement C++ and Java features in an environment that doesn't natively support them.
* Python compilers are available for some popular microcontrollers. Pyastra[http://pyastra.sourceforge.net/] compiles for all Microchip PIC12, PIC14 and PIC16 microcontrollers. PyMite[http://pymite.python-hosting.com/wiki/] compiles for &quot;any device in the AVR family that has at least 64 KiB program memory and 4 KiB RAM&quot;. PyMite also targets (some) ARM microcontrollers. Notice that these embedded Python compilers typically can only compile a subset of the Python language for these devices.

Effectively programming an embedded system, and implementing it reliably requires the engineer to know many of the details of the system architecture. Section 1 of the [[Embedded Systems]] book will cover some of the basics of microprocessor architecture. This information might not apply to all embedded computers, and much of it may apply to computers in general. This book can only cover some basic concepts, because the actual embedded computers available on the market are changing every day, and it is the engineer's responsibility to find out what capabilities and limitations their particular systems have.

As manufacturers continue to pack more and more transistors onto a single chip, more and more of the stuff that was once &quot;peripheral logic&quot; has been integrated on the same chip as the CPU.
A ''microcontroller'' includes most or all the electronics needed in an embedded system in a single integrated circuit (&quot;chip&quot;).
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/CD00003980.pdf &quot;Microcontrollers made easy&quot;] ST AN887
&lt;/ref&gt;
* CPU
* I/O ports
* RAM - contains temporary data
* ROM - contains program and constant data -- the firmware. Starting in 1993, many microcontrollers use Flash memory instead of true ROM to hold the firmware, but many engineers still refer to the Flash memory that holds the firmware as &quot;ROM&quot; to differentiate it from &quot;RAM&quot;.
* Timers -- we discuss these later at [[Embedded Systems/Programmable Controllers#Timers|Timers]].
* Serial interface -- often a USART -- we discuss these later at [[Embedded Systems/Serial and Parallel IO |IO]]
* EEPROM - contains &quot;permanent&quot; data
* Analog-to-digital converter
* Specialized functions

This list is roughly in order of integration.
The earliest microcontrollers contained only the CPU and I/O ports; modern microprocessors typically contain the CPU, some I/O ports, and cache RAM; the cost of a microcontroller dropped dramatically once the CPU, I/O, RAM, and ROM could all be squeezed onto the same chip, because such a microcontroller no longer needs &quot;address pins&quot;; etc.
The most highly integrated microcontrollers include all these parts on one chip.

Embedded systems programming is not like normal PC programming.  In many ways, programming for an embedded system is like programming a PC 15 years ago.  The hardware for the system is usually chosen to make the device as cheap as possible.  Spending an extra dollar a unit in order to make things easier to program can cost millions.  Hiring a programmer for an extra month is cheap in comparison.  This means the programmer must make do with slow processors and low memory, while at the same time battling a need for efficiency not seen in most PC applications.  Below is a list of issues specific to the embedded field.

==Tools==

Embedded development makes up a small fraction of total programming.  There's also a large number of embedded architectures, unlike the PC world where 1 instruction set rules, and the Unix world where there's only 3 or 4 major ones.  This means that the tools are more expensive.  It also means that they're lower featured, and less developed.  On a major embedded project, at some point you will almost always find a compiler bug of some sort.

Debugging tools are another issue.  Since you can't always run general programs on your embedded processor, you can't always run a debugger on it.  This makes fixing your program difficult.  Special hardware such as JTAG ports can overcome this issue in part.  However, if you stop on a breakpoint when your system is controlling real world hardware (such as a motor), permanent equipment damage can occur.  As a result, people doing embedded programming quickly become masters at using serial IO channels and error message style debugging.

==Resources==

To save costs, embedded systems frequently have the cheapest processors that can do the job.  This means your programs need to be written as efficiently as possible.  When dealing with large data sets, issues like memory cache misses that never matter in PC programming can hurt you.  Luckily, this won't happen too often-  use reasonably efficient algorithms to start, and optimize only when necessary.  Of course, normal profilers won't work well, due to the same reason debuggers don't work well.  So more intuition and an understanding of your software and hardware architecture is necessary to optimize effectively.

Memory is also an issue.  For the same cost savings reasons, embedded systems usually have the least memory they can get away with.  That means their algorithms must be memory efficient (unlike in PC programs, you will frequently sacrifice processor time for memory, rather than the reverse).  It also means you can't afford to  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak leak memory].  Embedded applications generally use deterministic memory techniques and avoid the default &quot;''new''&quot; and &quot;''malloc''&quot; functions, so that leaks can be found and eliminated more easily.

Other resources programmers expect may not even exist.  For example, most embedded processors do not have hardware [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_unit FPUs] (Floating-Point Processing Unit).  These resources either need to be emulated in software, or avoided altogether.

==Real Time Issues==

Embedded systems frequently control hardware, and must be able to respond to them in real time.  Failure to do so could cause inaccuracy in measurements, or even damage hardware such as motors.  This is made even more difficult by the lack of resources available.  Almost all embedded systems need to be able to prioritize some tasks over others, and to be able to put off/skip low priority tasks such as UI in favor of high priority tasks like hardware control.

== Fixed-Point Arithmetic ==


Many embedded projects enforce a no floating point rule on their programmers.

Fixed-point arithmetic and other alternatives are often better than floating point arithmetic.

We discuss those advantages and go into more

The chapters in this section will discuss some of the basics in microprocessor architecture. They will discuss how many features of a microprocessor are implemented, and will attempt to point out some of the pitfalls (speed decreases and bottlenecks, specifically) that each feature represents to the system.

== Memory Bus ==

In a computer, a processor is connected to the RAM by a data bus. The data bus is a series of wires running in parallel to each other that can send data to the memory, and read data back from the memory. In addition, the processor must send the address of the memory to be accessed to the RAM module, so that the correct information can be manipulated.

=== Multiplexed Address/Data Bus ===

In old microprocessors, and in some low-end versions today, the memory bus is a single bus that will carry both the address of the data to be accessed, and then will carry the value of the data. Putting both signals on the same bus, at different times is a technique known as &quot;time division multiplexing&quot;, or just '''multiplexing''' for short. The effect of a multiplexed memory bus is that reading or writing to memory actually takes twice as long: half the time to send the address to the RAM module, and half the time to access the data at that address. This means that on a multiplexed bus, moving data to and from the memory is a very expensive (in terms of time) process, and therefore memory read/write operations should be minimized.  It also makes it important to ensure algorithms which work on large datasets are cache efficient.

=== Demultiplexed Bus ===

The opposite of a multiplexed bus is a '''demultiplexed bus'''. A demultiplexed bus has the address on one set of wires, and the data on another set. This scheme is twice as fast as a multiplexed system, and therefore memory read/write operations can occur much faster.

=== Bus Speed ===

In modern high speed microprocessors, the internal CPU clock may move much faster than the clock that synchronizes the rest of the microprocessor system. This means that operations that need to access resources outside the processor (the RAM for instance) are restricted to the speed of the bus, and cannot go as fast as possible. In these situations, microprocessors have 2 options: They can wait for the memory access to complete (slow), or they can perform other tasks while they are waiting for the memory access to complete (faster). Old microprocessors and low-end microprocessors will always take the first option (so again, limit the number of memory access operations), while newer, and high-end microprocessors will often take the second option.

== I/O Bus ==

Any computer, be it a large PC or a small embedded computer, is useless if it has no means to interact with the outside world. I/O communications for an embedded computer frequently happen over a bus called the '''I/O Bus'''. Like the memory bus, the I/O bus frequently multiplexes the input and output signals over the same bus. Also, the I/O bus is moving at a slower speed than the processor is, so a large numbers of I/O operations can cause a severe performance bottleneck. 
It is very important for measurable purposes for the entire system. 
It is not uncommon for different IO methods to have separate buses.  Unfortunately, it is also not uncommon for the electrical engineers designing the hardware to cheat and use a bus for more than 1 purpose.  Doing so can save the need for extra transistors in the layout, and save cost.  For example, a project may use the USB bus to talk to some LEDs that are physically close by.  These different devices may have very different speeds of communication.  When programming IO bus control, make sure to take this into account.

In some systems, memory mapped IO is used.  In this scheme, the hardware reads its IO from predefined memory addresses instead of over a special bus.  This means you'll have simpler software, but it also means main memory will get more access requests.

===Programming the IO Bus===

{{mergeto|Embedded Systems/IO Programming}}

When programming IO bus controls, there are 5 major variations on how to handle it-  the main thread poll, the multithread poll, the interrupt method, the interrupt+thread method, and using a DMA controller.

===Main thread poll===

In this method, whenever you have output ready to be sent, you check if the bus is free and send it.  Depending on how the bus works, sending it can take a large amount of time, during which you may not be able to do anything else.  Input works similarly-  every so often you check the bus to see if input exists.  

Pros:

* Simple to understand

Cons:  

* Very inefficient, especially if you need to push the data manually over the bus (instead of via DMA)
* If you need to push data manually, you are not doing anything else, which may lead to problem with real time hardware
* Depending on polling frequency and input frequency, you could lose data by not handling it fast enough

In general, this system should only be used if IO only occurs at infrequent intervals, or if you can put it off when there are more important things to do.  If your system supports multithreading or interrupts, you should use other techniques instead.

===Multithread polling===

In this method, we spawn off a special thread to poll.  If there is no IO when it polls, it puts itself back to sleep for a predefined amount of time.  If there is IO, it deals with it on the IO thread, allowing the main thread to do whatever is needed.

Pros:

* Does not put off the main thread
* Allows you to define the importance of IO by changing the priority of the thread

Cons:

* Still somewhat inefficient
* If IO occurs frequently, your polling interval may be too small for you to sleep sufficiently, starving other threads
* If your thread is too low in priority or there are too many threads for the OS to wake the thread in a timely fashion, data can be lost.
* Requires an OS capable of threading

This technique is good if your system supports threading, but does not support interrupts or has run out of interrupts.  It does not work well when frequent IO is expected-  the OS may not properly sleep the thread if the interval is too small, and you will be adding the overhead of 2 context switches per poll.

=== Interrupt architecture ===

''(The interrupt architecture uses interrupts, which we discuss in more detail in chapter [[Embedded Systems/Interrupts]]).''

In this method, the bus fires off an interrupt to the processor whenever IO is ready.  The processor then jumps to a special function, dropping whatever else it was doing.  The special function (called an interrupt handler, or interrupt service routine) takes care of all IO, then goes back to whatever it was doing.

Pros:

* Very efficient
* Very simple, requires only 1 function

Cons:

* If dealing with IO takes a long time, you can starve other things.  This is especially dangerous if your handler masks interrupts, which can cause you to miss hardware interrupts from real time hardware.
* If your handler takes so long that more input is ready before you handle existing input, data can be lost.

This technique is great as long as dealing with the IO is a short process, such as when you just need to set up DMA.  If its a long process, use multithreaded polling or interrupts with threads.

===Interrupts and threads===
: ''We discuss this technique in more detail in [[Embedded Systems/Interrupts]]''

In this technique, you use an interrupt to detect when IO is ready.  Instead of dealing with the IO directly, the interrupt signals a thread that IO is ready and lets that thread deal with it.  Signalling the thread is usually done via semaphore-  the semaphore is initialized to the taken state.  The IO thread tries to take the semaphore, which fails and the OS puts it to sleep.  When IO is ready, the interrupt is fired and releases the semaphore.  The thread then wakes up, and handles the IO before trying to take the semaphore and being put back to sleep.

The routine the interrupt vector points at is the &quot;first level interrupt handler&quot;.
The thread that the OS later wakes up to handle the rest of the work is the &quot;second level interrupt handler&quot;.

Pros:

* minimum latency -- instead of all other interrupts being disabled until that interrupt is completely handled, interrupts are turned back on (at the end of the first level interrupt handler) as soon as possible.
* Does not put off the main thread
* Allows you to define the importance of IO by changing the priority of the thread
* Very efficient-  only makes context changes when needed and does not poll.
* Very clean solution architecturally, allows you to be very flexible in how you handle IO.
* The second level interrupt handler can wait for a lock to be released ([[Embedded Systems/Locks and Critical Sections]]).

Cons:

* Requires an OS capable of threading
* Most complex solution


This solution is the most flexible, and one of the most efficient.  It also minimizes the risk of starving more important tasks.  Its probably the most common method used today.

===DMA (Direct Memory Access) Controller===

In some specialised situations, such as where a set of data must be transferred to a communications IO device, a DMA controller may be present that can automatically detect when the IO device is ready for more data, and transfer that data. This technique may be used in conjunction with many of the other techniques, for instance an interrupt may be used when the data transfer is complete.

Pros:

* This provides the best performance, since the I/O can happen in parallel with other code execution

Cons:

* Only applicable to a limited range of problems
* Not all systems have DMA controllers. This is especially true of the more basic 8-bit microcontrollers.
* Parallel nature may complicate a system</text>

The original 8086 processor shipped with a number of peripheral chips that each performed different tasks. Among these chips were programmable Interrupt controllers, programmable timers, and programmable I/O chips that could handle many of the tasks of the original computer, to take some of the computational strain off the 8086. In new versions of Intel chips (486, Pentium, etc.) many of the peripheral chips have been integrated into the processor, in an attempt to speed up the entire computer. However, much of the functionality remains, even in today's high-end computer systems.

== Timers ==
Timers are incredibly useful for performing a number of different operations. For instance, many multi-threaded operating systems operate by setting a timer, and then switching to a different thread every time the timer is triggered. Programmable timer chips can often be programmed to provide a variety of different timing functions, to take the burden off the microprocessor.

{{Wikipedia|real-time clock}}
Another common application of a timer is to keep track of the time in human units of hours and minutes, and often years, months, and days.
Often this real-time clock (RTC) has a battery to keep it running even in systems that are usually plugged into line power.
Such a timer can save power in two ways:
* When we want to know what time it is -- for example, when a digital camera time-stamps a picture it just took -- the system can read it from the real-time clock. Other ways of figuring out the time require more energy.
* When a system needs to do something periodically -- for example, measure the outside temperature every 10 seconds, and transmit it wirelessly to an indoor display -- the system can turn off power to everything except the real-time clock, and then wait for the clock to wake it up.

{{Wikipedia|Intel 8253}}
You can see some of the 8086 compatible timer chips like 8253/54 also they are the same have three independent timers internally but 8254 can work with higher frequencies and is used to generate interrupt like Memory refresh interrupt ,Time of day TOD interrupt and the last one is used to generate the speaker frequencies.

Practically all microcontrollers sold today include integrated timer &quot;peripherals&quot; on the same chip.
Most embedded systems either (a) have no external timer chip at all, using only the internal timers, (b) an external real-time clock, or (c) attempt to be PC compatible with a &quot;southbridge&quot; chip that emulates both the 8253-compatible timers and the real-time clock.

== Interrupt Controllers ==
The original 8086 processor had only a single pin used for signaling an interrupt, so a programmable interrupt controller would handle most of the messy details of calling the interrupt. Also, a programmable interrupt controller could be used to monitor an input port for instance, and triggering an interrupt routine when input is received.

== Direct Memory Access ==
Since memory read/write operations take longer than other operations for the microprocessor, one should avoid moving large blocks of memory. Luckily, the original 8086 came with a programmable direct memory access controller (DMA) for use in automatically copying and moving segments of memory. DMAs could also be used for implementing memory-mapped I/O, by being programmed to automatically move memory data to and from an output port.

DMA memory copies can also greatly enhance system performance by allowing the CPU to execute code in parallel with a DMA controller automatically performing the memory copy.

== Peripheral Interface Controllers ==
Peripheral interface controllers take a number of different forms. Each different type of port has a different controller that the microprocessor will interface with to send the output on that port. For instance there are controllers for parallel ports and more modern USB ports. These controllers are used for controlling settings on output such as timing, and setting different modes on the output/input port.

Floating point numbers are ....

Like all information, floating point numbers are represented by bits.

{{Wikipedia|Floating_point}}
Early computers used a variety of floating-point number formats. Each one required slightly different subroutines to add, subtract, and do other operations on them.

Because some computer applications use floating point numbers a lot,
Intel standardized on one particular format, and designed floating-point hardware that calculated much more quickly than the software subroutines.
The 80186 shipped with a floating-point co-processor dubbed the 80187. The 80187 was a floating point math unit that handled the floating point arithmetic functions. In newer processors, the floating point unit (FPU) has been integrated directly into the microprocessor.
&lt;!-- What is so special about the 80187, compared to ... say ... the 8087 ? --&gt;

Many small embedded systems, however, do not have an FPU (internal or external).
Therefore, they manipulate floating-point numbers, when necessary, the old way.
They use software subroutines, often called a &quot;floating point emulation library&quot;.

However, floating-point numbers are not necessary in many embedded systems.
Many embedded system programmers try to eliminate floating point numbers from their programs,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1445369/avoiding-floating-point-arithmetic Avoiding floating point arithmetic on the iPhone]
&lt;/ref&gt;
instead using [[Floating Point/Fixed-Point Numbers|fixed-point arithmetic]].
Such programs use less space (fixed-point subroutine libraries are far smaller than floating-point libraries, especially when just one or two routines are put into the system).
On microprocessors without a floating-point unit, the fixed-point version of a program usually runs faster than floating-point version.
However, these embedded system programmers must figure out exactly how much accuracy a particular application needs, and make sure their fixed-point routines maintain at least that much accuracy.

== Math Routines ==
''(Is there a better place in this wikibook for this discussion? It doesn't even mention floating point.)''

Low-end embedded microcontrollers typically don't even have integer multiply in their instruction set.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Ashby.
[https://web.archive.org/web/20060513120408/http://archive.chipcenter.com/eexpert/rashby/rashby059.html &quot;Simplifying Formulas&quot;].
2006.
quote:
&quot;we still need to find ways to simplify complex problems before we can put them into our 50-cent micros. Hardware multiplication is rarely seen below $1.50 ... That leaves us with the target of reducing everything down to addition, subtraction, shifting bits, and comparisons.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
So on low-end CPUs, you must use routines that synthesize basic math operators (multiply, divide, square root, etc.) from even simpler steps.
Practically all microprocessors have such routines, posted on the internet by their manufacturer or other users
([http://archive.chipcenter.com/eexpert/rashby/rashby002.html &quot;Multiplication and Division Made Easy&quot;] by Robert Ashby, [http://massmind.org/techref/method/math/muldiv.htm &quot;Novel Methods of Integer Multiplication and Division&quot;], [http://massmind.org/techref/method/bits.htm &quot;efficient bit twiddling methods&quot;], etc.).

Following the advice known as [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast &quot;Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast&quot;] and [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItSmallMakeItFast &quot;Make It Work Make It Small Make It Fast&quot;],
many people pick one or two number resolutions that are adequate for the largest and most precise kind of data handled in a program, and use that resolution for everything.
For desktop machines, often 32-bit integers and 64 bit &quot;double precision floating point&quot; numbers are more than adequate.
For embedded systems, often 24-bit integers and 24-bit &quot;fixed point&quot; numbers are more than adequate.
If the software fits in the microcontroller, and is plenty fast enough, it is a waste of valuable human time to try to &quot;optimize&quot; it further.

Alas, sometimes the software does not fit in the microcontroller.
* If you run out of RAM, sometimes you only need 2 bytes or 1 byte or 4 bits or 1 bit to store a particular variable.
* If you run out of time, sometimes you can add lower-precision math routines that quickly calculate the results needed for that inner loop, even though other parts of the code may need higher-precision math routines.
* If you run out of ROM, sometimes you can trade time for ROM space. Rather than a collection of sets of math routines, each one customized to a slightly different width, you can use a single set of math routines that can handle the maximum possible width. If you have some variables less than that width (to save RAM), then you typically sign-extend variables into a full-size register or global buffer, do full-width calculations there, and then truncate and store the result to the small size.

== Fixed-Point Arithmetic ==

{{Wikipediapar||Fixed-point arithmetic}}

Some embedded microprocessors may have an [[Embedded Systems/Floating Point Unit|external unit for performing floating point arithmetic]](FPU), but most low-end embedded systems have no FPU.
Most C compilers will provide software floating point support, but this is significantly slower than a hardware FPU.
As a result, many embedded projects enforce a no floating point rule on their programmers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in strong contrast to PCs, where the FPU has been integrated into all the major microprocessors, and programmers take fast floating point number calculations for granted.
Many DSPs also do not have an FPU and require fixed-point arithmetic to obtain acceptable performance.&lt;ref&gt;
Boris Lerner.
[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1275364 &quot;Fixed vs. floating point: a surprisingly hard choice&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

A common technique used to avoid the need for floating point numbers is to change the magnitude of data stored in your variables so you can utilize fixed point mathematics.
For example, if you are adding inches and only need to be accurate to the hundredth of an inch, you could store the data as hundredths rather than inches.
This allows you to use normal fixed point arithmetic.
This technique works so long as you know the magnitude of data you are adding ahead of time, and know the accuracy to which you need to store your data.

== FFT ==

People use many tricks and techniques to speed up Fourier transform calculation. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is the biggest speedup, but there are several other tricks on top of that that each can give another factor of two improvement.&lt;ref&gt;

DTMF decoders often use the Goertzel algorithm because, when only a few frequencies need to be analyzed, it is much faster than the FFT algorithm.

In many instances, especially in transmission, it is important to include some amount of error-checking information, so that incorrect information can be determined and discarded. One of the most simple method of error-checking is called '''parity'''. Parity can be broken up into Even Parity, and Odd Parity schemes. A parity check consists of a single bit that is set, depending on a certain condition.

== Even Parity ==

In an even parity scheme, the parity bit is set if an odd number of bits in the data are set to 1 (to make the total number of 1 bits even). For instance, 01001100 would generate an even parity bit, while 11001100 would not generate one.

== Odd Parity ==

The opposite of Even parity, odd parity generates a parity bit if there are an even number of high-bits in the data (to create an odd number of 1's). 

== Limitations of Parity ==

Simple 1-bit parity is only able to detect a single bit error, or an error in an odd number of bits. If an even number of bits (2, 4, 6, 8) are transmitted in error, the parity check will not catch the mistake

However, chances of getting 2 errors in 1 transmission is much much smaller than getting only 1 error in 1 transmission. so parity checks serve as a cheap and easy way to check for errors.

== More advanced error detection ==

ECC codes are often used for the same reasons as parity bits. These codes use more bits, however they allow multi bit error detection, and also correction of single bit errors.

CRC checks are usually used at the end of data blocks. These are carefully designed to give a very high probability of detecting corruption of the data block, no matter how many bit errors are in the block.

&lt;!-- Can this section be expanded? What are ECC codes and CRC checks? --&gt;

This book will demonstrate techniques for programming embedded systems in assembly language.

== x86 Assembly Review ==

{{main|X86 Assembly}}

The x86 microprocessor has (at least):

;4 general purpose registers : AX, BX, CX, and DX. AX is the fast accumulator.
;4 segment registers : CS (code section), DS (data section), ES (extra section), SS (stack section).
;5 pointer registers : SI (source index), DI (destination index), IP (instruction pointer), SP (stack pointer), BP (base pointer).
;1 flag register : Flags ('7' flags like Zero flag, Carry flag)

Unlike &quot;memory-mapped&quot; processors, the x86 has special &quot;I/O&quot; instructions (inp, outp) intended to talk to I/O hardware.

== ARM assembly review ==

{{main|Embedded Systems/ARM Microprocessors}}

At any one time, 17 registers can be accessed: R0 to R14 (which have identical hardware), R15, and the status register CPSR.

(To reduce [[w:latency|latency]] on interrupt handling, these registers and the SPSR &quot;saved program status register&quot; are &quot;shadowed&quot; during interrupts. Including those shadows, the typical ARM processor has a total of 37 registers).

The standard C calling convention for ARM is:&lt;ref&gt;
The [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042b/IHI0042B_aapcs.pdf &quot;Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

* R15: PC: program counter
* R14: LR: link register (holds return address for most recent subroutine call)
* R13: SP: stack pointer (for nested subroutine calls)
* R12-R4: long-term variables: used by a subroutine only if it restores the original values before it returns
* R3-R0: scratch-pad variables and subroutine-call parameters and subroutine-return results.

I/O hardware is typically &quot;memory mapped&quot;.

== Motorola/Freescale HCS12 (Star 12) Review ==

;16-bit accumulator register: D, accessible as two 8-bit registers: A (high) and B (low)
;2 16-bit index registers: X, Y
;16-bit stack pointer register: SP
;16-bit program counter: PC
;8-bit condition code register: CC

The HCS12 is based on the older 68HC11 and the instruction sets are very similar.
The HCS12 is a &quot;Big Endian&quot; processor: multi-byte values are stored from most significant byte to least significant byte in increasing memory addresses.

== Word Length ==

Modern desktop PCs are almost all 32 bit machines, and the next generation of processors is going to be fully 64 bit. This is all well and good for the average programmer, but what do you do when you are in an embedded situation with a microcontroller the size of your finger nail that is capable of only 4 bit arithmetic? 32 bits may be the norm in the desktop market, but there is no gold standard in embedded chips: more bits take up more space and costs more money. In essence, it is the job of a good embedded systems engineer to find the smallest, cheapest microcontroller that does the job that needs to get done. Consider the following table:

:{| border=1 cellpadding=3px
 |-
 | bits || biggest unsigned number || biggest signed number || smallest signed number*
 |-
 | 4 || 15 || 7 || -8
 |-
 | 8 || 255 || 127 || -128
 |-
 | 16 || 65,535 || 32,767 || -37,768
 |}
::&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2's compliment format

Even the 16 bit processor is a far cry from the 4 billion integer range of a standard 32 bit processor. Let's say that we have a 4 bit microcontroller with 4 available internal registers (4 bit each), and 256 bytes of onboard programmable memory. This processor cannot handle anything but the most simple tasks! What if we need to manipulate an 8-bit number on this little microprocessor? for instance, what if we want to make a digital clock with it? the 4 bit microprocessor is going to need to handle numbers up to and including 59 (the number of minutes displayed before the next hour). This is going to require more than the 4 bits alotted, in fact it is going to require at least 6 bits of space. What we need to do then, is come up with a way to treat 2 separate small registers as if they are a single large register. This chapter will talk about that subject a little bit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== All about Mri ==
Hello, My name is Mri. In case you do not know, a Mri is an alien speicies created and portrayed in the book: &quot;The Faded Sun&quot;, by C.J. Cherryh. I did not create the mri, so I don't take any credit, I do really like the mri though. They are my favorite species.

I am american of Mexican Descent and live in Texas. I am Liberal Catholic(Gasp!), and like to question everything that I am told. @w@ I also, believe that Mexican food is God's gift to gringos everywhere. Viva el Gringo!

My hobbies include tinkering with my computer, which is SlackWare Linux distro, Writing my own novels to read, video games, reading manga, and cooking! I like cooking. I don't have any kids, but I hope to someday... just not know. I don't think I could handle kids now. ;)

Yeah...so... Thank You for reading.

Signed:
-Mri

Wikibooks has opened a discussion about whether to keep this book. The book is empty except for a section &quot;Reasons for the making of this book&quot;. If you want, you can post to the current discussion at '''[[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]'''.

After reading the &quot;Reasons&quot;, it seems to me that Wikibooks is not the best place for this book. If you still want to write it, I or other Wikibookians might be able to find a better wiki for you. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:54, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

: You did not respond. Four users (including myself) voted to delete [[On the subject of philosophy]], and zero users voted to keep it, so I will now delete it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:42, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mri. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mri~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

=Introduction=
Through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI's), an '''XLink''' allows elements to be inserted into XML documents that create links between resources such as documents, images, files and other pages. An XLink is similar in concept to an HTML hyperlink, but is more powerful and flexible.

This chapter will be a general overview of the XLink syntax. It will also provide exposure to some of  XLink's basic concepts. For the full XLink specification, see the latest version of the standard at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink

=XLink=
XLinks create a linking relationship between two or more resources. They allow for any XML element, image, text or markup files to be specified in the link. 

By using a method similiar to the centralized formatting of XSL stylesheets, XLinks allow a document's hyperlinks to be isolated and centralized in a separate document. As a linked document's addresses changes, the XLink remains functional. 

The use of XLink requires the declaration of the [http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink/ XLink namespace]. This namespace provides the global attributes for type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from and to. The following example would make the prefix xlink available within the tourGuide element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tourGuide
  xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/tourGuide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=XLink global attributes=

The following table outlines the attributes that can be used with the xlink namespace. The global attributes are type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from, and to. The table also includes descriptions of how the attributes can be used.


'''Exhibit 1: Table of global attributes'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10 border=5&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;font size=3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attributes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;font size=3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description and Valid Values&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;type&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Describes the meaning of an item&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple - basic format similar to html linkage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extended - more complex than simple types with multi functional format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resource - provides local resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locator - provides remote resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arc - provides the ability to traverse from one resource to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;title - readable name or explanation of link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;href&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Location of resource&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value is URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;role&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Description of XLink's content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value is URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describes the element whose role it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;arcrole&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Description of XLink's content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value is URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe the relationship between the two sides of the arc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;title&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Name displayed, usually short description of link&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;show&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Describes behavior of the browser once the XLink has been actuated and loaded&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new - load in a new window or frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace - load in same window or frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embed - replace the current item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other - look for information elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none - not specified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;actuate&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Specifies when resource is retrieved or link processing occurs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;onRequest - when user requests the link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;onLoad - when page is loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other - looks for information elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none - not specified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;b&gt;label, from &amp; to&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Specifies link direction
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about operating systems concepts as they have evolved through the history of operating systems implementations. Politics and implementation details are irrelevant. Emphasis is given to technically successful designs, aesthetic operating systems, and not on commercial success. In fact, mere commercial success isn't sufficient to make an operating system noteworthy. It also emphasizes working implementations over mere projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The puzzle as stated doesn't quite state how a &quot;tie&quot; is possible, unless you can refuse to draw.  If we assume you -must- draw 1 or 2 matches on your turn, then:

* 1 match   left - Draw 1 and win (winning state)
* 2 matches left - Draw 2 and win (winning state)
* 3 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in such a state that (s)he will win (losing state)
* 4 matches left - Drawing 1 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 5 matches left - Drawing 2 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 6 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in a winning state (losing state)
* 7 matches left - Drawing 1 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 8 matches left - Drawing 2 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 9 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in a winning state (losing state)


Basically, if there are 3n matches, you're in a losing state, because no matter what you choose, your opponent can leave you in a state 3(n-1) by choosing the opposite (IE 1 + 2 == 3 or 2 + 1 == 3). When n = 1, this 3(n-1) = 3(0) = 0 and your opponent wins because (s)he has drawn the last match.  If there are 3n+1 or 3n+2 matches, you choose 1 or 2 respectively, and always leave your opponent 3m matches and you will win, and by the same logic you will win.

So basically, if you both play perfectly, the first player can only win if  n Matches mod 3 is nonzero.  

Alternatively, if you can refuse to draw a match (possibly intended by the question) you would always draw n mod 3 matches - if it's a multiple of 3 you refuse to draw, otherwise you draw leave a multiple of 3 matches.

[[Image:Wells_Hellenic_races.png|thumb|260px|right|While somewhat inaccurate, this map drawn by H.G. Wells shows the migration patterns of the ancient Greeks and other related tribes.]]The Ancient Greeks divided themselves into three tribes; the Aeolians, Ionians, and Dorians. The Mycenaeans (referred to as Argives, Achaeans, and Danaans by Homer in the ''Iliad'') were Aeolians and Ionians. Sometime around 1100 BCE, the Dorians, who lived north of the other two tribes, began to raid the Mycenaeans. Entire cities were destroyed, and Mycenae itself fell and was plundered by the invaders. Not only were the citadels of Mycenaean Greece destroyed, but civilization itself would collapse in the region.

==Changes under the Dorians==
===Economics===
Many theories exist about the cause of the Mycenaeans' collapse. Ecological disasters may have undermined the economy of the agrarian-based Mycenaeans, allowing the Dorians to supplant their society. The Dorians quickly developed trade relations throughout the Mediterranean to replace the old economy. The region of Attica (which included Athens) would rise to dominate the region due to its prominence as a trade center. The change was not immediate, however, as Athens, like the rest of Greece, would need a long recovery from the Mycenaean collapse. These new contacts with outside civilizations would have drastic consequences for the future of Greece.

===Language===
[[Image:Ancient greek dialects-en.svg|left|thumb|270px|Distribution of Ancient Greek dialects by around 400 BCE, closely corresponding to ethnic divisions between tribes. The Dorians are represented by the brown regions, while the Ionains are purple and Aeolians are yellow.]]The most significant immediate change for Greece during this time period was the end of writing. No written records exist for this time period, and writings from subsequent time periods are completely different from those of the Mycenaeans, leading historians to believe that writing was completely forgotten during the Dark Ages. The Dorians spoke a dialect different from that of the Mycenaeans, and due to the absence of a writing system, very few records remain of their language. All modern Greek dialects are descended from Attic Greek (&quot;Classical&quot; Greek), with one exception: the endangered Tsakonian dialect, which is a descendant of Doric, and therefore of considerable interest to linguists.

The Dorians would undoubtedly come into contact with the Phoenicians, a powerful seafaring people from the nearby Levant. The Greeks adopted the Phoenecian concept of an alphabet, and through trade would spread this throughout the Mediterranean. This alphabet was the first to include vowels, replacing the syllabic script of Mycenaean Linear B. The word ''alphabet'' itself comes from the names of the first two letters of this new writing system: ''Alpha'' (Αα) and ''Beta'' (Ββ).

Due to the lack of a writing system, poets (also known as bards) would have recited the long stories orally and passed them down over the years. Homer's epics could very well be versions of stories first composed, but not written, during the Dark Ages.

===Weaponry===
[[Image:Greek_hoplite.png|thumb|right|A Greek ''hoplite''.]]The Dorians were a warlike people, and thrust Greece into the Iron Age. Weapons were no longer made of bronze but instead, iron. Weapons became cheaper to make, more durable, and more effective in combat. This functionality replaced the ornate beauty of the craftsmanship of the old Mycenaean weapons. The ''hoplite'' was the name of the Ancient Greek infantryman who fought in phalanxes. Cavalry was the preserve of the Greek aristocracy due to the status attached to horse ownership. The cuirass, greaves and crested helmet not only offered protection but also presented a formidable display of height and strength to the enemy.

===Politics===
During the Dark Ages, the ''polis'' (plural ''poleis''), or city-state, would begin to develop. Cities dominated the surrounding landscape, and became independent units. The Dorians did not &quot;conquer&quot; the area in the sense of adding the territory to their domain, as the mountains of the region prevented the continuous contact necessary for a single nation to exist. Each city-state was naturally defended by the surrounding mountains, and each constantly expanded at the expense of its neighbors.

Soon after the invasions, monarchies were established in most, if not all, of the poleis. While the monarch held religious as well as political authority, he did not, however, wield complete control of his government. Many city states came to be dominated by the aristocracy. ''Tyrants'' first appeared during this time period. A tyrant was an aristocrat who gained enough power and influence to control the polis. They were backed by a personal hoplite army independent of the city-state, and set up autocratic (though not necessarily &quot;tyrannical&quot;, in the modern sense) governments.

==='''Hellenic''' identity===
Despite the mountains separating Greece from unification, the independent poleis did develop commonalities in culture, language, religion, and government. It was during this time period that Greeks began to identify themselves and each other as ''Hellenes''. In spite of the rivalries among the poleis, they shared the same language, the same style of dress, and the same décor, and these traits served to unite them as one and the same: they were all Hellenes.

Contributing to this sense of loose unity were the Olympic Games, begun in 776 BCE. These featured athletes from the various poleis who competed against one another as a religious ritual. Athletes may have competed for personal glory and fame, but the games were first and foremost in honor of Zeus, king of the gods. Olympia featured a temple which contained a 12-meter high statue of Zeus made of ivory and gold. This massive sculpture, created by the famous Phidias, was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. These games would cease in 393 CE, when they were banned under Roman Emperor Theodosius I in an effort to stamp out paganism.

[[Principles of Sociology/Sickness and Wealth]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Scenes from a Transplant&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/103.ram]... An NPR reporter leaves her 3 year old son and heads to Omaha--for cancer treatment--a last chance to save her life. After years of covering stories about medicine, Rebecca Perl enters the hospital as a patient. She moves from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. What she sees and what she learns. This piece, which was produced by Dan Collison, received the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) in the summer of '99. It got a perfect score, with one judge saying it was the best documentary he'd ever heard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sickness and Wealth'''

''The strangest thing about human beings is their shortsightedness. In terms of health, many would contend that if people understood the kind of pain, discomfort, and loss of life their daily behaviors were likely to eventually cause them, they would stop. The beauty of social epidemiology (the study of social distribution and social determinants of disease) is that we are increasingly able to offer the population good information about behavior and disease correlates. However, even with our expanded knowledge and information distribution systems through mass media, people in both the richest and poorest countries continue to die prematurely from completely preventable diseases. The first question is of course WHY??? but the main question (and perhaps the big money question) is what individuals and policy makers can do to alter these trends.''

'''Wealth Difference''' – There is a difference in the severity of health problems on a global scale. People in the world's poorest nations die on average a full two decades earlier than the US and other rich nations. In Haiti , before the recent coup, the government's health budget only allotted $1.75 per person per year. Why so low? The main reason is that Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere. The other key reason though, is that their state health programs were scaled back in the 1990s to qualify the nation for development loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. These Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) seek to scale back state social programs of all sorts in order to allow more free market competition that they believe will generate wealth and a healthy and independent national economy that won't need more loans in the future.

'''Human Rights?''' – Is proper medical treatment a human right? The United Nations has said so… but the slippery point is how much medical treatment. There was a time when there was only one form of accepted treatment for a particular disease. Now, there are many approaches with varying success rates and more importantly, varying costs. So how would a human rights stance on health reconcile this growing inequality in treatment methods? Does everyone have a right to the best care available, or just some basic level? Despite the advances in AIDS treatments over the last 15 years, 95% of those infected with the disease don't have access to even the cheapest antiretrovirals because they can't afford them. Even in emergencies, many people in poor places must pay before receiving treatment. Many are “held hostage” till their family can scrape together the money. How can it be that in the &quot;Third World&quot;, publicly available drinking water is usually unsafe for human consumption, but that Coca Cola is universally available at affordable prices? Well, because the potential profits demand the market supply it... but that seems sick to most of us.

'''Diseases of Leisure and Anxiety''' – In the developing world, but in the United States especially, one need only look at the leading causes of death to see that much of our modern health problems stem from poor lifestyle habits. Smoking, overeating poor foods, and alcoholism pretty much top off the list. These coupled an overall lack of exercise produce very high levels of disease for older Americans. For the younger crowd, mental disorders are much more common. While the exact reasons behind our very high rate of mental disturbance are not really known, they are normally associated with the advent of modern societies and their busy, detached citizens. We believe that all these diseases are easily preventable, but as of yet have not found consistent avenues to get prevention methods adopted on a broad scale. One reason may be that an ounce of prevention may be very worthwhile, but the pound of cure is much more profitable.

'''Insurance Problems''' – In the United States , 1 in 6 people don't have health insurance. Many more are under insured. We are the only industrialized nation without a universal health care program. However, our privatized system offers some of the best treatments available in the entire world. Unluckily, many of those who need these advanced treatments most won't be able to afford them. Instead, they will get what Medicaid or Medicare agrees to cover. While our socialized medicine programs are smaller than most rich nations, they still cover about a third of medical expenditures in the country.

'''Socialized Medicine Elsewhere''' – Historically, in most places, steep economic downturn has meant a steep drop in life expectancy – Russia (the former USSR ) is perhaps the best example. However, an interesting example of a poor country with great healthcare is Cuba . Despite crushing poverty and a lack of advanced medical tools due to the continued US embargo, Cuba has a life expectancy matching the US and many other rich nations at 78 years ( Japan is at 82). Nearby Haiti has a life expectancy of 53 years, a quarter century less. How can this be? It should make us wonder why other poor countries cannot organize a similar national medical program. If the problem is not wealth, but organization, perhaps there is something to be learned here. Instead of trying to teach poor nations economic discipline through SAPs dismantling their socialized health programs, perhaps they could be remodeled like Cuba – this doesn't require communism or global isolation.

'''The Medical Industry''' – Companies develop treatments primarily to make money, although helping sick people feel better is a nice bonus. The problem lies in how companies go about marketing their product in such a way that the maximum number of patients think they need the treatment. The aggressive promotion of prescription drugs on television over the last decade is a wonderful example. Drug companies want patients to think of themselves as consumers and doctors as customer service representatives. Thus, patients are encouraged to seek out particular treatments although they likely do not understand the risks involved or the alternatives available. It is up to doctors to provide complete product information to the best of their ability. Unluckily, much of that information has been produced by the companies themselves or by groups with ties to the companies. This conflict of interest pits science against business. Furthermore, elective procedures have basically become the norm in American medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In wonder if &quot;Why Write a Descriptive Essay?&quot; could be rewritten to better approach the subject from a student's perspective. It also might serve the article better by narrowing the focus to descriptive essays, rather than discuss description generally. Perhaps there could be an emphasis on how concrete descriptions increase an essay's persuasive ability. 

In the subject, &quot;Abstract Descriptions Versus Concrete Descriptions&quot;, better examples might be created that demonstrate how specificity and vivacity are gained through concrete descriptions. Perhaps this could be done by pairing each of the abstract descriptions with a better description of the same object that uses concrete language. 

And the sensory descriptions might be rewritten to be better examples of their sense. Some, such as &quot;flowers in spring&quot; (smell), &quot;sandpaper&quot; (touch), &quot;falling off water skis&quot; (touch), or &quot;lutefisk or lefsa during the holidays&quot; (taste), may not be the clearest examples of using a specific sense to provide a description.

A section about using/avoiding cliches may also be useful to students.

-- Mindy (November 18, 2008) This section jumps right into genre. This should either be changed or explained better.

--[[User:JonathanP|JonathanP]] 22:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC) I'm trying to figure out what to change on this Description page.  The suggestion below is from almost a year ago and seems outdated.  The TODO list states, &quot;We need a sample descriptive essay here to really make this chapter complete. I'd also like to get those questions in a better format (maybe using the built-in list features.&quot;  Should I still make a sample essay even though the page basically has one (the Minnesota environment piece)?  Also, what questions is the TODO list referring to?  The ones under &quot;Genre Analysis, Genre and Composition&quot; seem fine to me.  I can still change them, though.

--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 00:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC) We need to format the images on this page a bit better. See example in the oral presentations section.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Operating System?==

A computer operating system is the software and/or firmware which manages the hardware of the computer and provides those resources, through an API, to application programs.It can also be defined as a program (set of logical instructions) which is responsible for controling the hardware functionality of a computer or related programmable electronic device.(Martin Muduva 2014).

By taking care of the hardware's needs and restrictions for the application program, the application program, and the application programmer, are freed from the additional work load and extra knowledge that is needed to deal with the hardware.  This makes it easier to write application programs for that computer.  It also makes it easier to keep a file system intact and working since all the changes to the file system go through the Operating system and are not done by each application programmer themselves. (Tischeritz and Bernstein). 
The first computers didn't have operating systems, and could only run one program at a time. The first electronic computing circuits were little more than separate functions and didn't really need even a programming language to be tested. In about 1945 computers such as the Eniac were built that took up 4 square blocks of space and had about the same power as a 4 function calculator you might get on a keychain today. Programming of these behemoths was done by plugboards that fitted onto something a lot like a telephone switchboard. Since they were experimental engines running on vacuum tubes at that time and maintenance was an issue, little productivity was practical, and only a few people knew how to run them. Programming was done in each individual machines own machine language, and so operating systems weren't required. By the 1950's the invention of the punch card machine made it easier to read in a small program, but all the operating of the system required was the pushing of a few buttons, one to load the cards into memory and another to run the program. 

In the mid 1950's, transistors made the computer circuit solid state, which eliminated the need to constantly patrol the innards of the computer to find burned out tubes and clean bugs out of the electrical contacts. The first solid state computers took up large air-conditioned computer rooms with racks of components and were used primarily by Governments to do processing of tables such as ballistic tables needed to aim military weapons. This resulted in a need for more control of the time spent per operation, which saw the separation of the maintenance and operations group from the programmers. At first, programmers wrote out their program on paper, then punched it into cards which the operators would load in sequence into the machine, one stack of cards at a time. Later a Job Control Language was designed that allowed the programmer to declare job information itself as part of their stack of cards, and it became possible to run a program called a monitor that read in the stack and stored it on a tape called the input tape. The input tape could then be run on a separate computer, the &quot;Main Frame&quot;, and spool its output to a second tape called the output tape, which would be later mounted on the printer to output the response to the program. The batch monitor was the closest thing to an operating system that this early form of computer had. It's job was to read information from the cards and set up the job, automatically freeing up an operator. Also at about this time, Fortran was invented, and a &quot;compiler&quot; spool could be loaded on the mainframe to allow the programmers to write in a human readable form, while the computer operated still in machine language.

By 1965 the first operating system like programs were beginning to show up, like the Fortran Monitoring System, which had to deal with loading three types of programs, the Fortran Program, the Compiler, and the Machine language program that was the result of complication. This necessitated that the program be able to tell in some manner which type of file it was reading on the tape. A similar system, IBSYS was IBM's operating system for the 7094. Loading the operating system required that a tape containing the operating system be loaded first in order to start the operating system. Early operating systems did not have the bootstrap mechanism which all modern operating systems use to initialize the computer, so start up of a computer was a long and involved process.

By the early 1960's it became obvious that computer companies were having to support two completely different types of computers, 1401 like character based computers, and word-oriented 7094 like scientific computers. Maintenance and training on these completely different systems was problematic so IBM invented System/360 and created a range of products that used this common architecture. The IBM 360 was the first computer line to use small scale integrated circuits, and thus offered a major cut in price over earlier solid state machines. This radically expanded the market and the power of the machines.

OS360 was written to act as the operating system on all of the System360 machines from the smallest input processor to the largest number cruncher type processor. It was made up of literally thousands of lines of code written by hundreds of programmers, and maintenance was problematic since almost every time a bug was fixed a new one would be generated. Despite the impossibility to maintain such a massive monolithic program it was a distinct improvement on previous second generation operating systems, and became quite popular.

One of the concepts that it popularized was the idea of multi-computing, where instead of waiting for a single job, the computer could be running multiple jobs simultaneously. This eliminated waiting periods while the operators mounted the tapes, since the computer could be processing a different program while it waited. One problem with combining business computer operating systems with number crunching system operating systems, was that the size of the jobs involved required different strategies. Business jobs were simple, and required less time per job, and as a result mounting and unmounting tapes took up 80 to 90 percent of the processing time. While a large number cruncher was still expensive enough that small jobs were not economical so mounting tapes was more like 10 percent of the job, and not a significant problem. One way of getting around this was to partition the memory, so that each job could have its own partition. This went along with the Multi-programming concept, because it meant that more than one job could run at the same time on the same computer without interfering with the memory of other jobs.

Along with this concept came the idea of running the card reader from one partition, the number crunching in another, and the output to the printer from a third, eliminating the satellite 1401 type computers, and reducing the wear and tear on tapes from mounting stress. While third generation units were good for large runs they were essentially still batch systems and as programs began to become more complex, managing the card stacks for a program became unwieldy. This paved the way for timesharing systems where each user had his own terminal, and they shared a central mainframe.

Timesharing didn't become popular until late in the third generation when the hardware for protection mechanisms became widespread. At that time, the idea of a Computing Utility began to be worked on, the idea being that a single mainframe would supply timesharing opportunities to the whole Boston Area. Out of this concept the first 4th generation operating system MULTICS was born.
Of course the idea was based on the small scale integration, and the development of LSI and then Later VLSI (Very large scale Integration) eventually replaced whole rooms of computers with a small desktop unit. As a result of LSI (Large Scale Integration) it became possible to build a whole computer system on a single rack. These Mini-computers began to compete with IBM for smaller businesses, and because their financing terms were not as pecuniary their ability to compete made them replacements for the small and midsized system360 components. It was not surprising by the 80's to find that a timesharing system used mini-computers as their front ends to handle terminal multiplexing and had a mainframe as the main computing mechanism.

In the 1970's Ken Thompson designed UNIX as a stripped down one user version of MULTICS based on a PDP-7 Minicomputer. Since he published the source code, it became a popular operating system and
was used extensively by Universities and small businesses. By the 1990's it was so popular that more software was being written for it, by outsiders than was written by ATT, the then license holder for it. Legal battles between ATT and Universities as to who owned the rights to the new software involved in Unix V5 resulted in two things, the sale of the operating system to SCO and the development of an alternative kernel by Linus Torvalds that could run the by then public domain software produced by the universities because it met the POSIX standard which had been developed by IEEE.

It was this defiant rewrite of an operating system kernal that created the Open software movement that has powered the internet revolution. Most operating systems today have gained by the work of the Open Software Movement because their internet software's sophistication, depends on ideas pioneered and spread through free software.

For most purposes today, an operating system is best defined as the software that comes on an operating system install CD or DVD. This definition works well for users and operating system vendors. It has even been argued in court.

A definition of an operating system now might look like the following:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; background-color: #DDEEFF&quot;&gt;
; A System : A set of principles and concepts and all of the components which obey these principles.
; An Operating System : A system of software which manages the hardware resources of the system to provide a base for its users' programmatic computing needs.
&lt;/div&gt;

By programmatic we mean that the software is used primarily by programs, as opposed to interactively by the user directly.

So C++ for example is ''not'' an operating system since it fails to provide many critical functions of computation. Without execution of programs, scheduling of processes, and many other functions provided to C++ by system software it would be impossible for C++ to run on top of bare hardware. Basic, Lisp, Smalltalk, and Java in contrast can sometimes be considered operating systems. Although routinely hosted on top of other OSes, they have sometimes been run directly on top of exotic special-purpose hardware.

Moving onto principles, UNIX for example has as its principles &quot;everything is a file, referred to by a descriptor&quot; and &quot;programs act as filters&quot;. All of the little programs and utilities that obey these principles are an integral part of the operating system whereas the X Window System, which does not obey these principles, is not.

In contrast, Plan 9, a derivative of Unix, has as its principle &quot;everything is a filesystem&quot; and many more functions are part of the operating system in Plan 9 than in Unix. In particular, Plan 9's windowing system is an integral part of the operating system.

==A note on consistency==

While an operating system is a set of principles and the software that obeys them, it is often the case that parts of the operating system disobey the principles. This is the case when the principles aren't expressed clearly and/or they are inadequate.

In the case of Unix and Plan 9, processes are neither filestreams nor filesystems. It is impossible, for example, to duplicate a process by copying it. So we see that the principles &quot;everything is a filestream / filesystem&quot; are inadequate. Note that just because something is a filter doesn't prevent it from being a filestream; the concept of filestreams is simply inadequate.

The result of inadequate principles is that development proceeds at random, following the path of least resistance. The end result of such development cannot be characterized by any design principles at all, and has abrogated any principles the system began with. This explains both modern Unix and C++. Such systems are only perceived to be cohesive in that their incoherence is sharply distinguished from other systems.

==How to distinguish different operating systems?==

For academic purposes, a good test of the differences between two operating systems is ease of porting software. If two operating systems are such that porting software from one to another is difficult because the concepts are different, then the OSes are relatively unalike. At the other extreme, if two platforms are such that no effort is required to &quot;port&quot; from one to another, then the two are relatively similar. Because there are legal reasons why we can't call two different products produced by different manufacturers the same, we call them Compatible.

Usually two systems that are compatible are so because they follow a single protocol called a standard. Organizations like IEEE, and ISO, publish these standards, and different companies can build their project to the standard even though they have proprietary elements at a lower level.
For instance Linux and Unix share the IEEE POSIX standard so they are compatible at the interface level that standard defines.

By '''this''' definition, many common operating systems can be lumped together and considered to be similar or Compatible. OS/2 and Windows are similar. UNIX and BSD are Similar, Linux is Compatible.

The minimum distance between two distinct operating systems is probably that between Plan 9 and Unix. Despite their differences, both were created by the same person to achieve the exact same goals. And despite the time interval between Unix and Plan 9, it is obvious that the designers felt that many of the UNIX design decisions were still good. This all goes to show that Plan 9 and Unix are as close as two operating systems can ever get while remaining distinct.

Note that this test of the distinctiveness of operating systems has an analog used in biology to establish the distinctness of species. Biology recognizes species as distinct when they can no longer freely interbreed. For our purposes, operating systems are distinct when they can no longer freely share code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Operating systems research has slowed for two reasons. First, we now must concern ourselves with compatibility. Second, the excitement and low hanging fruit of the early years is behind us. Many pioneers who participated in that early excitement have declared that OS research is now dead, but it does carry on to this day. Many old research topics still have room for improvement. Modern research includes:

===Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan (Dec.2005)===
&quot;The Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) has proposed a plan to help Georgia’s coastal communities move toward sustainable management of their groundwater supply, while still meeting the water needs of the rapidly growing region.
The draft [http://www.gadnr.org/cws/Documents/saltwater_management_plan.pdf Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan for Managing Saltwater Intrusion] (December 2005) is based on the scientific findings of a seven-year study of groundwater use in the 24-county coastal area. The study, called the [Sound Science Initiative], addresses the concern that pumping of groundwater in the region is allowing saltwater to seep into the Floridan aquifer, the principal source of drinking water.&quot;[http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/news/Coastal_Water_Plan_News_Release_120505.pdf] &quot;The Plan replaces the [http://www.ganet.org/dnr/environ/techguide_files/wrb/interim.htm Interim Strategy for Managing Salt Water Intrusion in the Upper Floridan Aquifer of Southeast Georgia], and sets forth how EPD will conduct ground and surface water withdrawal permitting, and management and permitting of wastewater discharges.&quot;[http://www.gadnr.org/cws/Documents/saltwater_management_plan.pdf] 

&quot;The draft plan addresses water management issues in three geographical areas:
*'''Chatham, Bryan, Liberty and portions of Effingham counties''' - the use of Floridan aquifer water will be restricted to total amounts already permitted for the area, with the goal of reducing water withdrawals through time. Under the proposed plan, requests from municipalities in Chatham and Effingham counties that seek additional water from the Floridan aquifer will be considered, with the condition that they honor existing agreements to also tie into Savannah’s surface water pipelines.
*'''Glynn County''' - no more Upper Floridan wells will be allowed in a small area underlying Brunswick due to an existing saltwater plume in the aquifer.
*'''The other 19 counties in the coastal region''' - applications for additional upper Floridan water will be considered for all uses. 
However, in all 24 counties, permit holders will need to meet new requirements for water conservation and reuse.&quot;[http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/news/Coastal_Water_Plan_News_Release_120505.pdf Source]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Prospecting for customers''' is the first step to real selling, and must always be a [[w:salesperson|salesperson]]’s top priority. [[w:Customer|Customer]]s come and go, and a salesperson must continually replace a certain percentage of existing customers who will inevitably fade away. The entire object of any prospecting must be to find [[w:sales lead|sales lead]]s that can eventually be translated into sales [[w:turnover|turnover]]. Effective prospecting, however, requires a systematic [[w:methodology|methodology]], as well as personal [[w:self-discipline|self-discipline]], without which, the reliance on luck, or on the [[w:law of averages]], will only result in a great deal of wasteful  time and effort.

The average salesperson, unless he is quite unusual, will always have a natural [[w:negativity|negativity]] toward approaching anyone new. Yet, it cannot be over-emphasized that, however good his [[w:negotiation|negotiating]] or closing skills, he will always fail in his selling if he does not have available, a regular supply of new prospects. The salesperson must therefore overcome the [[w:inertia|inertia]] to talk to someone new. The essential rule is to prospect all the time, and not just when he appears to have run out of potential people on whom to call.

==Identifying the target market==
Long before a salesperson even goes out into the market to sell his product, he  must spend what might seem to be a disproportionate amount of time, analyzing what his potential market is, so that when he starts prospecting, he is at least looking in the most likely places where those customers will be found.

A salesperson must understand his products thoroughly, and ensure that there is a match between product benefits and customer needs, failing which, there will be little point in prospecting for customers. 

Where the potential market is very wide, there are significant advantages to be gained by limiting to just one or two specialized market segments, for the following reasons:
* A salesperson simply does not have the time to make everyone his customer. If he then has to decide which segment of the market to target, he  must choose the easiest one to close a sales.
* There may well be some products in a salesperson’s product range that match up better to one industry or market segment than another. If he can tailor his products to secure a unique selling proposition (USP) in that particular market segment, he will not need to compete with those who do not have it.
* By focusing on a particular industry, a salesperson can gradually acquire technical knowledge of his customer’s industry, thus enabling him to develop empathy and talk on equal terms with his customers.
* Existing customers are more likely to recommend prospects to a salesperson if the salesperson has already established his credibility in the industry. 
* It is far easier to target advertisement|advertisingefforts if they are concentrated in a narrow plain. Also, he can more easily meet the people who will make his best contacts by attending the annual exhibitions and functions that this industry will invariably organize.

To identify which particular market segment to aim for, a salesperson should begin by analyzing the profile of his existing customers, and secure a picture of what his &quot;ideal customer&quot; should look like. The profile should include their psycho-demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, their jobs, and their interests, since all will, in one way or another, control where or when they buy. If viable, the salesperson should also consider using mailshots and advertisement|advertising to evaluate his potential market.

== Identifying potential customers==
Having decided on a specific market, the salesperson should try to limit his prospecting to remain within that market. The ideal customer (i.e. the one who buys as soon as the salesperson talks to him) is probably non-existent, but the closer a salesperson's prospect matches that ideal customer, the fewer sales objections will be placed in his way. It therefore makes sense to ensure that his prospects at least resemble the specification as accurately as they can. This means identifying the potential of a prospect at the very outset. In particular, the salesperson should know the requirements that a potential customer has set for his future, the priorities that he has decided, and in all probability, his financial resources. Failing to analyze a prospect is the main reason for a great deal of wasted prospecting time spent on a customer who should have been promptly discarded, after due research. 

Preliminary research always saves time. Good prospecting is not necessarily dismissing those whose business appear to be static, but it is certainly the ability to select and concentrate one's efforts where one is more likely to secure immediate success.

===Gathering information from printed materials===
A salesperson should read all he can about his market, using information that is readily and freely available in libraries, reference books, trade directories, newspapers and magazines. It is vital to be well informed about the specific market and those in it. The smaller local newspapers are full of names, addresses, and occupations of many people in the community, who could use his services. 

If the salesperson were cold-calling, he would need the first 15 minutes of any meeting to glean all this information, while in a newspaper it is waiting there for him to absorb before his call. If he relies solely on chance to find those who have recently acquired new appointments, new authority or increased incomes, he will merely be one of the many cold-callers with whom he has to compete. By having prior knowledge of that change, he should be there ahead of the rest.

===Developing information network===
The salesperson should develop a system of using other people to provide him with information which can then be usefully followed up: 
* '''Previous business contacts:''' If he has previously worked for another company, he has a whole hierarchy of personnel who he can contact, most of whom will be only too ready to assist if they are aware that he is not in competition, nor detrimental, to their own business. If he is a financial advisor, he can even offer his new services to them. A salesperson should use his contacts to make other contacts, and he will certainly find this a great deal easier than making every new prospect a cold call.

* '''Contacts in personal life:''' The list of people with whom he deals through his home can be equally fruitful. From the opening moment, when he first looked at his new house, he probably may have dealt with builders, estate agents, solicitors, decorators, plumbers, removal companies, and many others, all of whom may have been pleased to do business with him, and might well be prepared to do business in return. Even if they do not follow on to do positive business, they may well pass him on to someone who will, and regardless of that possibility, they will certainly be easier to approach than someone who has not met him before. Why make it difficult for himself by talking to someone he does not know, when he has not tried talking to those who would at least recognize him. And, once he is in that new home, the list of suppliers, from the newsagent through the milkman to the grocery stores, starts all over again, from which he can use them.
* '''Social contact:''' In his social life, the salesperson will need to be systematic and professional with those he knows, not promoting his selling, but ensuring that everyone knows what he does and that they are able to trust his judgement when they are looking for the kind of advice that he has on offer. At social meetings, he must avoid talking about business even if he is actually asked to do so, but should merely confine any mention of business to the exchange of cards or telephone numbers so that he can make a professional approach later. Allowing himself to talk business at such gatherings ensure that he will:
** become unpopular for doing so;
** be doing it in the wrong environment to get his message across; and 
** be unable to pursue business later in a better environment, since he has used his sales approach already. 
The rule must be to restrict his selling only to those occasions when he can be sure of doing it professionally, and in his own chosen environment. Doing it whenever he finds himself at a cocktail party or a social evening, and he should not be at all surprised if he no longer finds himself on the invitation list.
* '''Personal observation:''' The salesperson should be observant when he is out and about. The information is often there for him to see in the multitude of shop fronts that lined the streets. With luck, the telephone number will also be displayed. He should take a pocket tape recorder with him in the car, and have it alongside while driving. Such recorders are inexpensive and the cost can easily be recouped by converting just one of the contacts he acquires into a sale. It is more practical than a pen and paper, and because it is easy, he will use it far more readily than any other method.

Even in the reception areas of large office blocks, the salesperson will not only be able to find a great deal of information about the companies that operate there, but he may often find a receptionist or a concierge who will only be too happy to tell all he knows about the people who work there. 

===Recording information===
Any worthwhile evaluation of a prospect will generate a great deal of information and understanding of the prospect. Whatever information is secured, the salesperson should record it even if he does not plan to follow it up immediately. The information will probably be of value later and, even if it is not, it will have cost very little to retain it. Any other method must rely on a good memory, and there are few of us who could boast to have that at their disposal.

==Thinning out the prospects==
While a great deal of selling effort fails because the prospect cannot be convinced of the suitability of the proposal, a still larger number of sales fail because the prospect was not really a prospect in the first place, and very little real work had been done by the salesperson  to filter out the good prospect from the bad before the selling operation began.

* '''Does your product really meet the buyers' needs?'''
A salesman's product must be relevant to his prospect. If no one's requirements seem to match with what he is selling, then he is either moving in the wrong circles (not impossible), or selling the wrong product. A man without children cannot be convinced of the viability of an insurance scheme to cover the costs of child education. A hermit has no need to cover against the security of his dependants. The unfortunate truth is that many sales are attempted to prospects who could be eliminated as possibilities by a little research. 

* '''Has your prospect the finance to buy?'''
The salesman must establish on the outset whether the prospects can afford to buy. He should worry later about whether he can convince them to part with it, but if they do not have the funds in the first place, he is certainly digging dead ground. The information required can generally be established very early in a sales interview through a simple trial close such as, &quot;''If I can convince you that..., would you be prepared to consider…..?'''&quot; You are not asking for a decision, and the prospect, in answering, is merely saying, &quot;''You have not convinced me yet, but if you can, I would be prepared etc...''&quot; Failing to establish this initial willingness (or ability) to invest will end up with endless discussions which earn little profit.

* '''Is your prospect the real decision maker?'''
This comes back to basic selling where it is vital to know who the decision-maker is, so as to save a great deal of time in having to redo yet another sales presentation. It is sometimes necessary to disbelieve someone who says that he is the decision maker. This applies as much to companies as to families, and it is possible that someone who does not have the authority may well be reluctant to say so, possibly to pre-screen the salesperson first, before allowing him to meet the actual decision-maker. In a household, even simple decisions are not always made by the obvious partner.

As a policy, while a salesperson should always ignore the less promising prospects until the end of the operation, he should also ensure that he retains the information on them so that it is easily available later on. It is not impossible that in a year’s time, he can make a new approach based on the possibility that by that time, either the prospect's potential, or indeed the salesperson's offer, may have changed. What may seem a poor prospect today may be one that the salesperson can well afford to spend time on at a later date. If a salesperson merely works  through in a rigid format on long, unselective lists, with little regard for their comparative importance, he will find himself with inadequate time to follow up high prospect leads, simply because he is giving the hard work cases equal priority with the others.

==Methods of Personal Selling==
* Making use of social contacts
* Using existing contacts to make others
* Cold calls
* Prospecting through telephone
* Mailshots
* e-business

===Making use of social contacts===
A salesperson must adapt his personal lifestyle to his selling career, so that what he does outside his business life contributes to selling. He needs to cultivate friends who are influential themselves, since they are the ones who will be in the best position to help him. It helps to join the same club as the prospects, and if that means joining more clubs than he would otherwise wish to, then this is the price that he has to pay for being a salesperson. After all, if he is dealing with someone who is a member of a club, or association, then having sold to him, it is easier to sell to another member of the same association. People do tend to lean on the experience of others, and the same rules that can ruin his reputation if he sells unethically, will help him do the reverse if unbiased third parties were to vouch for his Product (business)|products and his integrity. Memberships are likely to generate good returns for the salesperson who is prepared to regard anyone he meets as a potential user of his service. Working at the social round often means &quot;belonging&quot; to groups.

====Always sell to friends before strangers====
It is always easier to sell to friends than to people whom you do not know. Most people, however, are of the opinion that a salesperson should not sell to friends, since this is the quickest way of losing friends. In reality, it is bad selling that prompts this kind of remark. Assuming a salesperson's product or service is of value, it must make sense to share it with others in his social circle who, if there is something to be gained, will certainly not resent his approaching them in the first place. There are several businesses, particularly financial planning, where selling to friends represent a high proportion of turnover, and it would be difficult to imagine this particular aspect of selling, without the friendship that goes with it. The argument against it is that somehow, the salesperson is making use of people, but if the product is good, the salesperson is in fact helping his friends to make an influenced decision, based on trust, instead of the uninformed decision, he makes without it. This kind of advisory selling often enhance Interpersonal relationship|personal relationships, especially when it is mutually beneficial.

====Move among the people where your business is likely to be====
Once a salesperson has established his own circle, he can then make his entry into their circles, and move among the people where his business is likely to be, always bearing in mind that the people who invite him may have an ulterior motive in getting him into their circles of friends. He should also have a good commercial reason for accepting the invitation, and in the end, everyone benefits from the association. A salesperson only has a limited amount of time at his disposal, and it is essential that he guides his social life into securing a range of contacts who will introduce him to the others who may be of value to him. 

====Work at being in the mainstream of a busy social life====
The place where a salesperson belongs, and where he spends his &quot;free time&quot; are the places where he ought to be looking for, and securing his business. After all, the potential of his social circle must be one of the reasons why he cultivates it in the first place. The basic principle when endeavoring to sell in any social circle is to have total optimism that it would not be difficult to achieve what he is planning to do. After all, there is only one alternative to trying to sell to friends, and that is trying to sell to strangers. Logic alone would tell which is the easier of the two options. Right through the selling game, the fear of rejection can be very overwhelming, but the salesperson who wins is the one who believes that there is a prospect somewhere in the environment where he is at that time, and who has the confidence to look for that prospect. This means developing his imagination so that he can swiftly recognize the indicators, showing where his customers are likely to be.

It is also essential that the social circle that a salesperson moves in is not comprised too much of like-minded people, as he will probably achieve more by moving among the wealthy and influential. During the time that he is moving among salespersons, he should not forget about the prospect names that he is able to pick up from others. Often, salespeople from another industry can be mutually useful, by providing leads and information that they are unable to make use of themselves. They will, of course, expect the same from the salesperson. In his private life, a salesperson does have many prospects whom he never even thinks of as prospects. Every retailer whom he deals with, every business that enjoys his patronage, even the local authorities to whom he pays his dues, the teachers at school where he sends his children, may all well have a use for his service, and will be more approachable as he knows and deals with them already. It may well be possible to turn the table around, so that the business is reciprocated.

===Using existing contacts to make others===
Referrals are special introductions from one customer or prospect to another, and give the salesperson an edge in his initial discussion. The alternative is calling everywhere cold, and that is making hard work, when hard work is not necessary. A reference that a common friend recommends a call to the prospect immediately offers a jumping-off point which starts the conversation off on a more personal basis, and connects it with a person, the prospect can relate with. It gives the salesperson an advantage over a competitor who arrives with nothing in his hand. Once the initial contact is made, the referrer becomes less important. 

Referrals are the easiest way of passing on from one prospect to another. However, it is essential for the salesperson to qualify the referrals as far as is possible, and that he secures as much useful information as he can from the people who are supplying them. After all, the salesperson is going to require the information some time, and the friend who gives him the name of a new contact will probably have all the right information already at his fingertip.

====Methods of getting referrals====
A salesperson, however, must not think that referrals will just come on its own. They will rarely be offered, unless asked for, and they are also unlikely to be refused, if asked. The easiest method of getting referrals is from the people whom the salesperson meets from day to day. A prospect may or may not offer the salesperson any business, but he can certainly suggest a friend who might use his services. If the person is already a satisfied customer, he will probably agree to the salesperson using his name to secure an introduction to a friend, backing it with the knowledge that he believes the salesperson’s offer is worth recommending. If the prospect does not buy from the salesperson, he will feel that in his apology for not doing so, he is offering the salesperson something  by giving a referral. Either way, the salesperson is throwing his best chance if he fails to ask for a referral who may well buy.

Referrals need not of course, just come from existing customers, and the salesperson will need to make use of many other people. Many will inevitably be encouraged to supply information to the salesperson, if it is a two-way service, so whenever the salesperson has information which might be useful to someone else, he should make sure that it is passed on. By recommending business to someone, the salesperson has gained someone in the field who will think of him, when a similar chance occurs to return the favor. Relationships with anyone else, either in the salesperson's industry or outside of it, can prove to be of enormous value in his own prospecting for customers.

It is essential to work on the principle of referrals with everyone a salesperson meets. There should be no such thing as a &quot;wasted&quot; call, since every prospecting call which does not produce real business should be able to produce at least one possible prospect for tomorrow. The salesperson should make it a daily habit to always ask everyone he sees. The worst reply that he will get is a &quot;no&quot;, and rarely will someone admit that he knows no one who might have use for the salesman's services.

When asking for referrals, the salesperson should never make it too general by saying, &quot;Is there someone else who might be interested in my service?&quot; This almost certainly guarantees a negative answer as the question is far too wide to secure a considered reply, and, as a result, he will get the easiest answer that his prospect can give him. However, if the salesperson is specific, and tries to channel his prospect's mind into thinking of a useful reply, he will phrase his question in a way such as:
* &quot;Mr Burton, I am sure that we have now put your production line on a more effective footing. Is there any other engineering company within your group which you think might be able to benefit in the same way?&quot; 
* &quot;Is there another bank manager in this housing estate who also has a family, and might have the same insurance requirements as yourself?&quot;

With personal friends, the salesperson can even be more open in your approach, saying in effect, &quot;I need some more business. Please can you help me with your advice?&quot; People will react properly if they are asked in the right way, so long as the salesperson is straight enough to tell them why he is asking, and how he intends to use the information. Fail to be honest with his friends, and the next time the salesperson asks, he may find them resentful that he has used information which they were not aware was going to be used commercially. The salesperson will probably have to encourage their sympathy to produce the names of people who will be of real interest to him. By doing so, he will ensure that they do not simply supply him with two or three names of people who really do not have a need, and in so doing, they then feel that they have done him a favor. It is better that they be encouraged to give him one cast-iron referral, rather than six casual possibles. The salesperson should not forget that referrals can always be introduced independently by himself, where he knows that the two persons are well-acquainted. &quot;As I was saying last week to Mr Maxwell, I believe you are a friend of his&quot;, establishes a link between two people, even though the link may not be as strong as a direct recommendation from one to the other. It cannot be overemphasized in selling that everything that can introduce a rapport of any kind between the salesperson and his prospect will make his presentation that much easier.

====Thanking the referrers====
Lastly, the often neglected part of using referrals is to make use as often as the salesperson can of the contact who gave him the recommendations in the first place. He should always go back to the person who gave him the referral:
* First, the person will be pleased that the salesperson takes the time, and the rare step of thanking him for the initial information. 
* Secondly, the person will be pleased that the salesperson actually acted on his advice by contacting the suggested prospect.
* Thirdly, the person may well encourage his proposal to the third party by directly contacting him himself.
* Lastly, if the person knows one good prospect, he probably knows more, and the salesperson will possibly get a further contact to pursue. 

Illogical though it is, the second name might well be a better one than the first, since the person is now aware that the salesperson is prepared to follow up on his suggestions, and he might, as a result, be encouraged to think in greater depth of names that might be useful to the salesperson. The salesperson should secure no more than one or two prospect names each time, as this will give better assurance that they will be of reasonable quality.

===Cold calls===
While cold-calling may not be the most effective of selling approaches, there will be times when it is the only option available, simply because the salesperson does not have enough appointments through other methods. The object of a cold call is NOT to sell, but to prospect and to decide whether an appointment is worthwhile. The salesperson must never be led into making a sales presentation, even if requested by the prospect, as he must not blow his chance of giving a proper sales presentation. 

During the initial approach, whether by telephone or otherwise, the following information must be collected as early as possible:
* Does the customer need the product?
* Can the customer afford the product?
* For companies: What is the customer's buying procedure?
* Who has the full authority to make the purchase (name and position)?
* When is the best time to meet up with the prospect?
If the answers to the first two questions are in the negative, there is no point in proceeding further. Tact must always be exercised in seeking information.

Often, it is not possible to talk to the right person in the case of companies, as the way is usually blocked by a receptionist or secretary who will try to filter the sales call. The salesperson should assert his own authority, and make anyone who blocks his way aware that he considers himself to be on an equal footing to their boss as he has some benefits to offer to the company. While being tactful, the salesperson must never make any subordinate think that they are doing him a favor by arranging an appointment; after all, it is their job to do so.

If the salesperson is unable to meet the right person, he should leave a message that he has called, indicating briefly what it is that he wishes to talk about. It is far easier for the salesperson to talk to someone who is aware that he has called previously. His message will also notify the prospect that he is persistent, and that if the prospect were to reject his second call, he can expect a third call. As a rigid rule, the salesperson should never leave his telephone number, and expect the prospect to call back.

Whether on telephone or otherwise, the salesperson should always endeavor to get his message across as quickly as possible. Statistically, if he is unable to do so within 30 seconds, he will probably never get a chance to do so at all. 

====Guidelines for cold-calling====
The following pointers must always be borne in mind to avoid the pitfalls of call-calling:
* '''Work to a rigid timetable:''' The operation must be regarded as a rigid discipline in telephone prospecting. Two hours is probably as long as any salesperson can remain enthusiastic and effective. As with any other kind of prospecting, calls should be recorded so that results can be analyzed. By making a record of where a specific approach has worked, the salesperson can make sure that he uses that approach regularly as part of his presentation.
* '''Ensure you know WHY you are calling:''' This will almost always be not to sell, nor even to elaborate on the service provided, but to get information and to make appointments.
* '''Do not try to sell unannounced:''' The salesperson should forget about trying to sell anything with a cold-call. People nowadays resent the unannounced intrusion into their premises.
* '''Learn from failed calls:''' A salesperson should regard rejection as a feedback that his selection procedure was wrong to begin with. If he regards rejection negatively, he will eventually join the ranks of those salespeople who dismisses cold-calling. Most objections are raised are usually not valid, and more than before, the salesperson needs to meet up with the prospect to find out the real reason. 
* '''Use one call to generate another:''' Wherever possible, the salesperson should use the call as a method of referral to generate introduction to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Critical Definitions ===
An '''actor''' is something that may perform an action. This commonly will be a user, a process, a thread, or similar.

An '''actee''' or '''object''' is something that may be manipulated by an actor. It may be a file, registry key, relational database entry, hardware device, or similar. Generally, this is data. Actors can generally serve as objects too; one process (serving as actor) may kill another process (serving as object).

An '''action''' or '''right''' is something that an actor may do to an object. Example actions include reading and writing.

=== Overview ===
Security systems generally implement a useful subset of a 3-dimensional matrix with dimensions of actor, object, and action. Implementing the full matrix is never done for both performance and usability reasons.

Mainstream operating system security is primarily based on access control lists. For each object, we can maintain a list of actors which may manipulate it.

Capability-based systems, not to be confused with systems that refer to special administrative abilities as capabilities, flip things around the other way. For each actor, they maintain a list of objects upon which the actor may act.

Mainstream operating system security is discretionary. That is, an object owner may decide who else has access to the object.

Mandatory access control is non-discretionary. A set of rules acts to enforce security, setting up permissions that users are unable to override. This stops insiders from being effective spies, selling designs to the competition, sharing medical records with the press, running spyware, and making many types of user errors.

None of the above methods excludes any other of the above methods. DG/UX had capabilities, discretionary ACLs, and mandatory access control. Linux provides discretionary ACLs and several choices for mandatory access control. File descriptors, available on all UNIX-like systems, can serve as capabilities.

=== Protection ===

The first security attempts were protection schemes, which controlled the access of programs to sensitive areas like the 0 page, where the software interrupts for the operating system calls were usually stored for efficient calling, or the operating system areas, where the operating system code was kept while it was running. This capability was required for time-sharing because neophyte programmers sometimes overwrote the operating system shutting down the whole computer because they didn't understand the addressing system. CPU's like the Z80 began to be designed to set aside &quot;System&quot; areas so that they couldn't be overwritten by mistake.

One way of doing this was to create a separate name space for the system and control access to it.
Often the documentation of how to access the protected mode was scant, or missing from popular books, as an attempt to secure it by obscurity. This turned out to be relatively useless since it meant that an underground market for information was created, and only the crackers knew for sure how they were breaking into the operating systems.

Some CPU's set up complex software interrupts as gateways between the protected mode memory and the user areas. Each user area had its own software interrupt area, that did a system call to the protected system area because the interrupt area was within the user space, the interrupt vectors could be overwritten with impunity, without affecting any other programs use of the operating system. This was a useful mechanism because peripheral drivers tended to supply their own interrupt service routines for specific peripherals.

An application like Windows could create a virtualized version of itself, and modify the interrupts within that one virtual version, without affecting the rest of the operating system. This is usually what the difference is, between 286 and 386 protective mode, the Virtual copy of windows with the ability to modify its own interrupt vectors and not affect the rest of the machine. Up until the 386 protected mode, all programs shared the same interrupt vectors and one programs mishandling or malware sabotage of the interrupts could trigger the collapse of the whole system.

=== Access Control Lists ===
Traditional UNIX access control is a type of discretionary ACL. The many possible actions are grouped into four categories: read, write, execute, and special operations normally reserved for an object owner. The list of actors associated with each object is rather restricted, simplifying both the implementation and the user experience. There are three actors listed: owner, group, and other. An actor gets the permissions of the first of those that it qualifies as. The owner always gets special operations that the others do not get. The group is an indirect reference to a list of actors specified elsewhere, and thus is a form of compression. The &quot;other&quot; is just that, all other actors. Through the creation of groups, traditional UNIX access control can provide a great deal of power. The creation of groups is normally limited however, often being an administrative action that requires human approval.

The action categories may be more or less fine-grained. Netware uses read, write, create, erase, modify, file scan, access control, and supervisor. A system may split the normal &quot;write&quot; category into overwrite and append. A system may lack an &quot;execute&quot; category, instead simply requiring read access to execute a file.

Many systems allow for somewhat arbitrary lists of actors to be associated with each object. This includes Windows, modern UNIX-like systems including Linux, and Netware. The list might support a dozen entries or a few hundred entries, as determined to be a good compromise between performance and control.

An interesting innovation in ACLs has been hierarchical actors. For example, the VSTa OS used decimal, dot-delimited actor identifiers. In this scheme, a userid is a series of decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 1.85.23.323.888) and if a user possesses a userid which corresponds to the object's userid up to its end, then the user owns the object. So for example, a user possessing userid 1.85.23 would own any object assigned to 1.85.23.323.888 whereas the object itself (whether another user or program) wouldn't be able to access other objects owned by 1.85.23. This scheme allows for the dynamic creation of a hierarchy of users and subusers. A weaker form of this, compatible with the vast body of POSIX software, can be had by providing a mechanism for users of a UNIX-like system to create and control groups.

=== Capabilities ===

Capabilities are unforgeable references to objects that let their holder access a well-defined subset of operations defined on that object.

There are many different things which may serve as capabilities. There are human-readable capabilities called &quot;passwords&quot; which people make use of. There are flat, low-level, centralized capabilities implemented by experimental OS kernels. There are tickets granted by Kerberos servers. There are UNIX-style file descriptors, which may be passed from process to process to provide access.

Operating systems such as KeyKOS and EROS have used flat, low-level and highly centralized capabilities, leaving the implementation of human-useful capabilities to higher level layers.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''flat'' because they can't be interrogated. You can't ask such a capability about, say, when it was created or how many times it's been accessed. Neither do such capabilities possess internal state which can be mutated. Typically, one can create a new downgraded capability from a capability one possesses, but one can't downgrade or change in any way the original capability itself. These capabilities aren't objects but primitive data types.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''low-level'' because they do not offer high-level security abstractions. In KeyKOS, capabilities were exactly of two types, read and read+write, though KeyKOS capabilities could contain additional information to implement service levels and other such. Capabilities in such schemes do not naturally aggregate other capabilities (a very simple and highly useful security abstraction), one must artificially create an object in between whose sole job is to aggregate them. Note that certain security abstractions (like dynamic permission inheritance) are practically unimplementable on top of a low-level system.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''centralized'' because the kernel, and only the kernel, manages all capabilities. Rather than every module exporting its own capabilities, the only capabilities there are in the kernel. This is actually a consequence of using low-level capabilities. If capabilities were sufficiently high-level as to provide message-passing services, then it would be feasible to force every module to use secondary capabilities that all route through a single protected kernel capability. Instead, each module (called a Domain) in KeyKOS had access to a maximum of exactly 16 capabilities in special slots protected by the kernel and accessible only through special calls.

=== Mandatory Access Control ===
Tradational mandatory access control or '''MAC''' is modeled on the scheme used by the U.S. government for handling classified information. More specifically, this is ''mandatory sensitivity control'', or '''MSEN'''. There are levels of security such as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CLASSIFIED, and UNCLASSIFIED. There are categories based on need-to-know or special program access. An actor with SECRET access is prohibited from reading TOP SECRET data, but might be permitted to write to it. (there may be an additional discretionary ACL which prevents this though) One may be able to read from lower security levels and write to higher security levels. There may be a concept of contamination, allowing an actor with SECRET access to write UNCLASSIFIED data as long as no CLASSIFIED or SECRET data has been read.

Mandatory integrity control ('''MINT''') works the other way, preventing pristine objects from being contaminated with junk. In this case, all actors are permitted to read the most trusted data. An actor that tries to execute something downloaded from an untrusted source will either be stopped or will lose the ability to write to more trusted objects.

More modern systems combine the functions of MSEN and MINT into a state-transition model with roles. As actors do things, their state may change. In a UNIX-like system with role-based access control, the execution of a new executable is a particularly important point at which state transitions happen. Role-based security is particularly useful for enforcing privacy regulations such as HIPPA (U.S. medical info law) and the EU privacy laws. Two popular implementations of this are SE Linux and RSBAC, both available for Linux.

=== Cryptographic Access Control ===

The advent of International Networking spread the security concerns outside the usual realm of the operating system, to the data that was moving to and from the system over the network. The ability to mimmic a valid data packet meant that data could be changed enroute simply by rerouting the valid packet, and replacing it with an invalid packet. As a result, security had to be spread not only to the local system, but also to all critical correspondence between systems. At first such mechanisms were implemented by sending digests of the original data as part of the datastream, under the assumption that a changed packet would not fit the original digest. However it was found that digests were not cryptographically secure and could be fooled into thinking that data was valid when it wasn't. As well, sending data in clear meant that someone in an intervening system could read the packet with a packet sniffer, and learn what the information was. 

The idea when this was determined became to cryptographically protect the data, which would at least it was hoped slow down the reading of the mail, and cryptographically secure the digest, so that it couldn't be fooled as easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Namespaces are one of the most crucial and pervasive concepts in operating systems, and languages. Namespaces have internal properties and external properties. The internal properties define how objects within the namespace relate to each other. The external properties define how namespaces relate to (e.g., are composed with) each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Human-computer interaction ==

'''Human-computer interaction'''(HCI) deals with how people interact with computers to accomplish tasks. In this chapter we look at how interaction with computers has evolved.

=== Punch Cards ===

The Hollerith Punch Card was based on the concept of a Jaquard Loom, where patterns in the cloth were defined by cards with holes in them that triggered the heddles on the loom to change whether the warp was in front of or behind the weft. What Jaquard did with steam looms, Hollerith was able to do with electricity, thus making it possible for an operator to punch in text lines at a punch card unit, and have them converted into electrical signals at the card reader.

=== Commands ===

Computers began being connected to teletype machines in the 1950s. Teletype machines allowed users to perform tasks by typing in commands rather than using punch cards to input instructions. Soon afterwards, text-based monitors called &quot;terminals&quot; followed replacing printers as a means of communicating information. Today computers continue to emulate the teletype machine, while adding new functionality and features, in what is called a command-line interface (CLI).

=== WIMP ===
{{wikipedia|WIMP (computing)}}

WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointer) was invented for Smalltalk in the late 1970s. Since that time, it has steadily colonized modern operating systems. Unfortunately, nearly all implementations of WIMP are broken variants without the full programmable power of CLIs. Some simple CLI concepts that could be easily added to WIMP include pipes, scripts and graphical location history. If these were incorporated, CLIs could be done away with.{{fact}}

===Beyond WIMP===

Despite the decrepitude of WIMP, there has been no meaningful advance in mainstream OS' HCI since 1980.{{fact}} That's decades of stagnation punctuated by minor innovations like virtual desktops and context menus. The latest triviality to hit the market is the ever so gradual replacement of icons by object miniatures. Fortunately, despite the total incompetence{{fact}} of mainstream OS designers, research in HCI has managed to sustain a snail's pace.

====Voice Recognition====

The hardware exists, ready to be used, but operating systems don't take advantage of it. Voice recognition is the single most under-utilized opportunity in HCI.

Voice recognition suffers from a multitude of problems. Many environments are noisy, making recognition inaccurate and thus hazardous. Constant use of voice recognition can make people lose their voice. Voice recognition has privacy and annoyance problems. Imagine overhearing your boss say &quot;Open personal. Copy barnyard-porn to CD-ROM. Delete barnyard-porn. Close personal.&quot; while you are trying to concentrate on your work.

Some of these problems can be partially avoided. For example, the user might say &quot;Copy ''this'' to ''that''&quot;, where ''this'' and ''that'' are the objects pointed to by the mouse at that particular point in time. The problem of voice overuse may be reduced by reducing the usage of voice recognition, letting voice be a supplementary input mode instead of a primary input mode.

====Natural Language Interaction====

The heritage to this idea can go as far back as the very early MUD program ADVENT or even ELIZA, a psychotherapist simulation that has evolved into ALICE and other natural language processors.  The voice recognition software would really be built on top of this technology, although there would have to be other semantic rules to add with spoken instead of written language recognition.

This sort of interface is already implemented with websites like &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot; and &quot;WikiAnswers&quot; and other similar search tools where you ask the computer for information using a normal natural language question rather than some sort of structured query statement like SQL.  This does eliminate the privacy issues but does require some more sophisticated AI research in order to succeed.

An interesting aspect of this HCI model is that it is usually conceived as a throwback to the CLI, it is imperative. Ironically enough, it is voice recognition that is strictly imperative and language processing that is supposed to move beyond this narrow interaction model. In any case, natural language interaction has been an eventual goal of many early operating system designers and even computer programming language designers.

This HCI model was explored in part by the Science Fiction author Frederick Pohl in his Gateway series of novels where the protagonist is married to a software engineer who does her programming using a modified natural language interface.

The primary issues involving this approach is that the raw database of semantic information to be able to process effectively most natural language queries needs to be quite large.  In some ways even larger by an order of magnitude than many current GUI operating systems.  A natural language software development environment will still have to have some sort of formalized structure to avoid ambiguous or even contradictory semantic meanings.  It is also easier to write SQRT(SIN(X^3)/PI*7.55) than to describe a function as &quot;The square root of the quantity sine of ex cubed which is then divided by the quantity Pi times seven point five five&quot;.  Even here the semantic issues involved can mess up the equation but at least can be a starting point to see what natural language programming languages would be like.

====Zoomable Interfaces====
{{wikipedia | zooming user interface}}

Any interface will have a default resolution, probably linked to the screen resolution and size. However a significant portion of the population have problems with their eyesight, and need larger characters in order to read. The idea of a zoomable interface, is that the interface is not limited to the default resolution, and can be zoomed in, to enhance the size, or zoomed out to get an overview.

This concept is also useful with multi-screen implementations of an operating system. The ability to zoom out to take a look at the multi-screen view, and zoom back in to see a single screen view, would be quite useful in complex user environment like workstations, and Architectural programs where you might want to place different elevations on different screens, and page back and forth between them to see how changes affect the other elevations.

====3D====

Despite its potential, 3D has never been used as anything more than a gimmick outside of, say, very specialized HCIs for biochemists.  There are several issues that hold this interface concept back including a lack of a powerful model that is unique to a 3D environment such as the desktop model in a 2D environment.  Most 3D environments are merely extensions of this desktop model, and have a very decided &quot;gimick&quot; quality to them that fails to justify the increased computing resources necessary to provide this sort of environment.  

There are very few true 3D devices that computers can manipulate on a real-time basis, which also limits this direction.  While you can get a true 3D hologram like you see in the movies, these display systems can cost in some cases over millions of dollars to set up and deploy and are very fragile at the moment, subject to frequent break downs.  Mainly used for military and as gimicks for places where they can justify the costs like Disneyland, and even in these places they are just a demonstration device that has very limited practical use, with only a hint for what they may eventually become.  For most people who use a 3D device environment, it is almost always on a normal 2D computer screen, which is sometimes called 2.5D to acknowledge that it is more than merely a pure 2-dimensional display, but that it hasn't achieved a full third dimension.

A notable model that seems to have caught quite a bit of interest was originally described in the book [[w:Snow Crash|Snow Crash]] by [[w:Neal Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]].  While this book covers many things, the &quot;Metaverse&quot; is a multi-user 3D environment that uses avatars to do social interaction through a virtual reality environment.  This book spawned the development of [[w:VRML|VRML]], which borrowed heavily from even earlier 3D rendering formats.

Perhaps remarkable was the virtual world known as [[w:Active Worlds|Alpha World]], which enjoyed a huge burst of popularity during the mid 1990's, but financial problems plagued the company that was hosting the servers running all of the background information.  Alpha World acknowledged its roots from the Metaverse including its use of avatars and some of the environments that appeared within Alpha World, including some buildings that were originally described in Snow Crash.  A notable feature of Alpha World is that users could &quot;claim&quot; real estate and build features and landmarks within the world, denying access in some cases to users they did not like.  Maping out the various user projects make the appearance of Alpha World look very similar to Urban sprawl in modern cities throughout the world, from a far view.  Alpha World is still technically under development, but the original development team that created it in the first place has long since left and the software ownership has changed hands several times.

The most likely use of 3D technology from a user standpoint is going to be acting within virtual worlds like the Metaverse, or in ''Multi-Player Roleplaying Games'' like ''Everquest'' or ''World of Warcraft''.  While possible to manipulate computer data directly through these sort of environments, there doesn't seem to be a compelling interest to develop a compiler that must have software developed in that nature.

====Direct Manipulation====
{{wikipedia | direct manipulation}}
Direct Manipulation, is a term coined in 1983 by Ben Schneiderman to cover the idea that interfaces should echo normal experience so that the interface is intuitively obvious to the user. His interest was in the design of the GUI, but this term has spread to mean any interface that is meant to be more intuitive than a WIMP GUI. There are a great number of different ways in which this type of interfacing can be implemented, and it includes a great number of subtopics because of that variety. Among other topics is the idea that an interface should give feedback to the user, like the real thing, so the steering wheel for instance should fight the user on a fast turn, and the brake pedal should indicate whether or not the brakes have locked, or throb with anti-lock device like realism. Another idea is that you should use a rod, for golphing or tennis instead of a mouse or joystick the Wii gamebox has introduced such a system. A further example is the accellerometer in a phone, that allows the user to control games by tilting the phone.

==== Direct Access to Hardware ====

''Moved to [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Storage: Addressing Schemes#Direct Access to Hardware]]''

====User Choice: Manual Placement====

People like to customize their computer systems. As a technician working on other computers can attest, sometimes it is difficult to find your bearings in a computer that has been over-customized. Familiar programs can take on new and confusing characteristics, with the result that you might not recognize them when you first sit down at someone else's computer.

Allowing the user to place their graphics components wherever they want, creates opportunities for the user to accidentally change the placement of the graphics components without knowing how they did it, and thus how to change them back. An operating system designer must carefully consider how they will implement manual placement. An example of how this can go wrong, is the drag and drop mechanism that was developed for WIMP. If every graphics element can be moved, then we get interesting effects like dragging a tool bar from the top of the screen to the side of the screen, and having it vertically aligned instead of horizontally aligned.

Many users don't understand drag and drop technology, and often hold the button on their mouse down, while they are moving it, thus dragging something they didn't mean to drag, or alternately, have to lift the mouse off the table in order to extend it's range, and accidentally drop the object in a location other than one that can be interpreted as being a valid placement location. For instance what configuration should a tool bar have, if it is placed halfway down the page?

Further, it is often possible to move something in the foreground and have it affect the placement of objects in the background, like for instance using two windows, and manipulating them vertically so that you can drag and drop between windows, sometimes scrambles the placement of icons on the desktop of Windows. In order to deal with effects like occluding one icon with another, it is often necessary to use a technique like snap to grid, that places the elements according to a grid vertex. However long icon names have been known to occlude other icons, which makes cropping the icon names useful, but eliminates information needed to understand what the icon does. Which then requires some sort of hover mechanism in order to expand the full filename without actually selecting the icon. Because of these considerations either every graphics component should be user adjustable, or careful consideration of the extremes of adjustment must be considered to decide which graphics elements will be snap to grid, which will have only valid locations accepted, and which will have complete flexibility to be placed wherever the user wants.

==== Brain Interface ====

Although this type of input is still somewhat experimental, and the standards for it have not been set, The use of &lt;ref&gt;Teuvo Kohonen,''Self-Organizing Maps'' Springer (2001) ISBN 3540679219&lt;/ref&gt;Self-Organizing Maps to interface between an implant and a robotic arm, suggests that it should be possible, at some future point in time, to manage a pointing device, as if it were a part of the human body, While this is not yet mind-reading, it could offer an interface for people like paraplegics that do not have the use of normal pointing devices.

[[Principles of Sociology/New Agers and Fundamentalism]]

''This American Life'' presents... a story called &quot;Pray&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/77.ram]... Can the secular world and the religious world understand each other? We ask that question while visiting Colorado Springs, CO, where Pastor Ted Haggard at the New Life Church has put in place a project to pray in front of the home of every person in the city, systematically, block by block and house by house. He's also helped organize a 24-hour-365-day-per-year &quot;prayer shield&quot; over the city, all night prayer vigils, and more.
Prologue. Mary and Manfred Rauer have been married 22 years. He's a devout Christian, goes to church every week, reads the Bible every day, was head of his congregation. She's an atheist. They're happy. But there are things they don't understand about each other. How big is the gap of misunderstanding between religious people and secular people? They provide a case study. (6 minutes)
Act One. Exodus. Alix Spiegel in Colorado Springs, where a massive prayer project is underway to pray for every person, business and school. When she arrives, she finds the Christians speak a kind of Christian jargon she does not understand. When she goes to her local contact to discuss it, and to find more sympathetic people to profile, he says that he believes the secular world can never understand what the religious community in Colorado Springs is doing. Alix Spiegel believed the prayers were simply a gesture of goodwill by people toward their neighbors, but soon she finds that in fact, they are something very different. Something medieval. 
Act Two. Kings. Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City, with a story about whether it's possible to be a good person if you're not a Christian

Comments:
* I don't think this book is ready for this award. Take a look at Lessons: there's no content. This book is much just a loose collection of vocabulary and grammar rules. I don't think I will learn Japanese from it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:13, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
: actually, there are some lessons, they are just a little hard bit to find... in fact, the book is living through something like 3rd or 4th reorganization, and each time the legacy is restructurized so that it is not so easy to find it. I believe the wikibook is going to grow fast in near future. It also has some great contributors, so will see... Although, I have to agree that this book is not completely written yet, and has long road ahead, but give it a chance... I think that nomination may also bring some new contributors to it --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 02:55, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
:: According to your opinion, it should be candidate for Collaboration of the Month, not Book of the Month. First award is intended to gather Wikibookian interest, not second. If you move your votes to COTM, I will vote for it.
:: BTW, it's a bit odd that from five people voting for this book, three have less than 5 edits. Of course, these votes are as valid as any other, but I don't think that BOTM should be chosen in such way. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
::: Well then I'll add my vote, as I've got a lot of edits to the book, and it's my fault the lessons are so sparse. As Lastguru said, we're in the process of reorganizing/rewriting the book (particularly Lessons) and have as such taken out much material that was there before. What we have now is a pretty solid consensus on how to proceed, a strong basis for the lessons, significant interest, and IMHO quite a bit of talent and experience. Watch the book in the coming weeks. If it doesn't get it this month, it won't be long.--[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 14:32, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
: Well, this book seems to be winning for BotM, but I agree it should probably be in CotM. Perhaps we can scrap it for December and put it up for CotM for January? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 20:12, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

*Anything on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Top_10_active&amp;oldid=121634 Top active] list should be ineligible. It's unfortunate that the [[Wikibooks:Top_active_SQL_query]] has not been run since March, but the Cookbook was normally in 1st place or 2nd place. I think the whole point of the Collaboration of the Month is to get people working on books that are sorely in need of contributers. Voting for something at or near the top of the most active list seems to defeat the purpose. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:00, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
*I have to agree with Albert, there are other books that need this &quot;shot in the arm&quot; more than the Cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 16:04, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
*Agree, it's closer to BOTM than COTM. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Enyo: It seems like you're working on a book on Ancient Greece.  Can I ask you to shift your attentions to [[Ancient History]] as a whole, and the [[Ancient History/Greece]] section in particular?  I'm a history teacher in middle school, and I'd like to work with you on building this as a general textbook for at least ninth grade.  What do you think? Oh, and are there others whose talents we could enlist that I don't know about yet? [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 15:48, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Enyo. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Enyo~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Standard for Boolean Symbols? ==

I teach a digital logic class at a community college and am interested in contributing to this book. I wondered, though, about the logic symbols used in Boolean expressions. While the symbols used in this text for AND, OR, and NOT are mathematically correct, several reference books I have on my shelf (along with the one I use in class) tend to use just common symbols found on a standard keyboard.

Could I suggest that we use the algebraic multiply for AND. Thus, to write &quot;a AND b&quot; we would write &quot;ab&quot; - just as multiply in algebra.

To write OR the algebraic &quot;plus&quot; is used. Thus, &quot;a OR b&quot; is &quot;a + b&quot;.

Finally, a simple apostrophy is used for negation. Thus &quot;a NOT OR b&quot; would be &quot;a' + b&quot;.

While this may not match some texts (and there seems to be a lot of variety on this standard), it is much easier to type Boolean terms on a standard keyboard using these symbols rather than the &quot;V&quot;, overbar, and other symbols.
*I've been through the page and changed to a style using just the AND = A·B, OR = A+B notation, rather than a mixture. The section on the two different notations stands, so readers will be warned about the other style. IMO, that style is more suitable for discrete mathematics and pure logic. We will be dealing with the practical implications, and thngs like sum-of-product are easier to understand in the times/add form (why do you think it is called sum-of-product rather that disjuntion of conjuction?)
:While this page always uses the centre-dot to denote the multiplcation to keep it all unambiguous, after this page, I expect to use nothing, so A·B→AB.
:As for negation, I quite like the overbar, as it extends to the whole expression being negated, and I find the apostrophe to look untidy (along with the exclamation mark). It also concerns me that a prime (usually written with just an apostrophe) is often used to denote things like &quot;next state&quot;, and we don't want to tangle up the meanings. Remember there is always the ¬ symbol, which is designed for that use! [[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] ([[User talk:Inductiveload|talk]]) 15:29, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

The C programming language is perhaps the most popular programming language for programming embedded systems.
(Earlier [[Embedded Systems/Embedded Systems Introduction#Which Programming Languages Will This Book Use?]] we mentioned other popular programming languages).

Most C programmers are spoiled because they program in environments where not only is there a standard library implementation, but there are frequently a number of other libraries available for use. The cold fact is, that in embedded systems, there rarely are many of the libraries that programmers have grown used to, but occasionally an embedded system might not have a complete standard library, if there is a standard library at all. Few embedded systems have capability for dynamic linking, so if standard library functions are to be available at all, they often need to be directly linked into the executable. Oftentimes, because of space concerns, it is not possible to link in an entire library file, and programmers are often forced to &quot;brew their own&quot; standard c library implementations if they want to use them at all. While some libraries are bulky and not well suited for use on microcontrollers, many development systems still include the standard libraries which are the most common for C programmers.  

C remains a very popular language for micro-controller developers due to the code efficiency and reduced overhead and development time.  C offers low-level control and is considered more readable than assembly.  Many free C compilers are available for a wide variety of development platforms.  The compilers are part of an IDEs with ICD support, breakpoints, single-stepping and an assembly window.  The performance of C compilers has improved considerably in recent years, and they are claimed to be more or less as good as assembly, depending on who you ask.  Most tools now offer options for customizing the compiler optimization.  Additionally, using C increases portability, since C code can be compiled for different types of processors.

== Example ==
An example of using C to change a bit is below

Clearing Bits
  PORTH &amp;=  0xF5;  // Changes bits 1 and 3 to zeros using C
  PORTH &amp;= ~0x0A; // Same as above but using inverting the bit mask - easier to see which bits are cleared

Setting Bits
  PORTH |= 0x0A;  // Set bits 1 and 3 to one using the OR  

In assembly this would be

Clearing Bits
  BCLR PORTH,$0A ;Changes bits 1 and 3 to zeros using 68HC12 ASM

Setting Bits
  BSET PORTH,$0A ;Changes bits 1 and 3 to ones using 68HC12 ASM

== Special Features ==
The C language is standardized, and there are a certain number of operators available that everybody knows and loves. However, many microprocessors have capabilities that are either beyond what C can do, or are faster than the way C does it. For instance, the 8051 and PIC microcontrollers both have assembly instructions for setting and checking individual bits in a byte. C can affect bits individually using clunky structures known as &quot;bit fields&quot;, but bit field implementations are rarely as fast as the bit-at-a-time operations on some microprocessors.

== Bit Fields ==
Bit fields are a topic that few C programmers have any experience with, although it has been a standardized part of the language for some time now. Bit fields allow the programmer to access memory in unaligned sections, or even in sections ''smaller than a byte''. Let us create an example:

 struct _bitfield {
    flagA : 1;
    flagB : 1;
    nybbA : 4;
    byteA : 8;
 }

The colon separates the name of the field from its size ''in bits, not bytes''. Suddenly it becomes very important to know what numbers can fit inside fields of what length. For instance, the flagA and flagB fields are both 1 bit, so they can only hold boolean values (1 or 0). the nybbA field can hold 4 bits, for a maximum value of 15 (one hexadecimal digit).

fields in a bitfield can be addressed exactly like regular structures. For instance, the following statements are all valid:

 struct _bitfield field;
 field.flagA = 1;
 field.flagB = 0;
 field.nybbA = 0x0A;
 field.byteA = 255;

The individual fields in a bit field do not take storage types, because you are manually defining how many bits each field takes. 
''See also [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/macxhelp/v6v81/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.vacpp6m.doc/language/ref/clrc03defbitf.htm &quot;Declaring and Using Bit Fields in Structures&quot;]; [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.2/gcc/Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation &quot;Allowable bit-field types&quot;].

However, the fields in a bitfield may be qualified with the keywords &quot;signed&quot; or &quot;unsigned&quot;, although &quot;signed&quot; is implied, if neither is specified.

If a 1-bit field is marked as signed, it has values of +1 and 0.
''Allow me to quote from [[c2:BitField]]:''
''A signed 1-bit bit-field that can contain 1 is a bug in the compiler.''

It is important to note that different compilers may order the fields differently in a bitfield, so the programmer should never attempt to access the bitfield as an integer object. Without trial and error testing on your individual compiler, it is impossible to know what order the fields in your bitfield will be in.

Also bitfields are aligned, like any other data object on a given machine, to a certain boundary.
&lt;!--
For instance, on a 32 bit machine, the following bitfield:

 struct _bitfield2 {
    fieldA : 10;
    fieldB : 24;
 }

takes up a total of 34bits, and will therefore occupy 8 bytes of memory!. It therefore makes good sense to try and pad your bitfields up to a multiple of the default data size, so memory isn't needlessly wasted.

::: if I &quot;pad&quot; my bitfields, that padding wastes exactly the same amount of memory -- so it *doesn't* make sense.
--&gt;


The C language supports setting up a structure that exactly matches the byte and bit-level layout of a memory-mapped I/O device.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== const ==
A &quot;const&quot; in a variable declaration is a promise by the programmer who wrote it that the program will not alter the variable's value.

There are 2 slightly different reasons &quot;const&quot; is used in embedded systems.

One reason is the same as in desktop applications:

Often a structure, array, or string is passed to a function using a pointer.
When that argument is described as &quot;const&quot;, such as when a header file says
    void print_string( char const * the_string );
, it is a promise by the programmer who wrote that function that the function will not modify any items in the structure, array, or string.
(If that header file is properly #included in the file that implements that function, then the compiler will check that promise when that implementation is compiled, and give an error if that promise is violated).

On a desktop application, such a program would compile to exactly the same executable if all the &quot;const&quot; declarations were deleted from the source code -- but then the compiler would not check the promises.

When some other programmer has an important piece of data he wants to pass to that function, he can be sure simply by reading the header file that function will not modify those items. Without that &quot;const&quot;, he would either have to go through the source code of the function implementation to make sure his data isn't modified (and worry about the possibility that the next update to that implementation might modify that data), or else make a temporary copy of the data to pass to that function, keeping the original version unmodified.

=== storing data in ROM ===
Another reason to use &quot;const&quot; is specific to embedded systems:

On many embedded systems, there is much more program Flash (or ROM) than RAM.
A &quot;.c&quot; file that uses a definition such as
    char * months[] = {
        &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;,
        &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;,
        &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,
        &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;,
    };
forces the compiler to store all those strings in program Flash, then on boot-up, to copy those values to a location in RAM.
That wastes precious RAM if, as is often the case, the program never actually modifies those strings.
By modifying the declaration to
    char const * const months[] = { ... };
, we inform the compiler that we promise to never modify those strings (or their order in the array), and so the compiler is free to store all those strings in program Flash, and fetch the original value from Flash whenever it is needed.
That saves RAM for variables that really do change.

(Some compilers, if you use definitions such as
    static char * months[] = { ... };
, are smart enough to work out for themselves whether or not that the program ever actually modifies those strings. If the program does modify those strings, then of course the compiler must put them in RAM. But if not, the compiler is free to store those strings only once, in program Flash).

=== storing data in ROM on a Princeton architecture microcontrollers ===
Princeton architecture microcontrollers use exactly the same instructions to access RAM as program Flash.

C compilers for such architectures typically put all data declared as &quot;const&quot; into program Flash.
Functions neither know nor care whether they are dealing with data from RAM or program Flash; the same &quot;read&quot; instructions work correctly whether the function is given a pointer to RAM or a pointer to program Flash.

=== storing data in ROM on a Harvard architecture microcontrollers ===
   
Unfortunately, Harvard architecture microcontrollers use completely different instructions to access RAM than program Flash.(Often they also have yet another set of instructions to access EEPROM, and another to access external memory chips).
This makes it difficult to write a subroutine ( such as puts() ) that can be called from one part of the program to print out a constant string (such as &quot;November&quot;) from ROM, and called from another part of the program to print out a variable string in RAM.

Unfortunately, different C compilers (even for the same chip) require different, incompatible techniques for a C programmer to tell a C compiler to put data in ROM.
There are at least 3 ways for a C programmer to tell a C compiler to put data in ROM.

(1) Some people claim that using the &quot;const&quot; modifier to indicate that some data is intended to be stored in ROM is an abuse of notation. 
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/pgmspace.html#pgmspace_const &quot;Data in Program Space: A Note On const&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such people typically propose using some non-standard attribute or storage specifier, such as &quot;PROGMEM&quot; or &quot;rom&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sourceboost.com/Products/BoostC/Docs/boostc.pdf &quot;BoostC C Compiler for PICmicro Reference Manual&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;,
on variable definitions and function parameters, to indicate a &quot;typed pointer&quot; of type &quot;value resides in program Flash, not RAM&quot;.
Unfortunately, different compilers have different, incompatible ways of specifying that data may be placed in ROM.
Typically such people use function libraries with 2 versions of each function that deals with strings (etc.);
one version is used for strings in RAM, the other version is used for strings in ROM.
This technique uses the minimum amount of RAM, but it usually requires more ROM than other techniques.

(2) Some function libraries assume the data is in RAM.
When a programmer wants to call such functions with data that is actually in ROM, the programmer must make sure the data is first temporarily copied to a buffer in RAM, and then call that function with the address of that buffer.
This technique uses the minimum amount of ROM to hold the library, but it uses more ROM and RAM than the other techniques at every function call that involves data in ROM.

(3) Some function libraries use functions that can handle being called from one place with a string in RAM, and from other places with a string in ROM. This typically requires &quot;fat pointers&quot; aka &quot;generic pointers&quot; that have extra bits that indicate whether the pointer is pointing to something in RAM or ROM. Every time such a library uses a pointer, the executing code checks those bits to see whether to execute the &quot;read from RAM&quot; or &quot;read from ROM&quot; instructions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== volatile ==

A &quot;volatile&quot; in a variable declaration tells us and the compiler that the value of that variable may change at any time, by some means outside the normal flow of this section of code.  These changes may be caused by hardware i.e. a peripheral, another processor in a multiprocessor system, or an interrupt service routine.

The &quot;volatile&quot; keyword tells the compiler not to make certain optimizations that only work with &quot;normal&quot; variables stored in RAM or ROM that are completely under the control of this C program.

The entire point of embedded programming is its communications with the outside world -- and both input and output devices require the &quot;volatile&quot; keyword.

There are at least 3 types of optimizations that &quot;volatile&quot; turns off:
* &quot;read&quot; optimizations -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that once the program reads a variable into a register, it doesn't need to re-read that variable every time the source code mentions it, but can use the cached value in the register. This works great with normal values in ROM and RAM, but fails miserably with input peripherals. The outside world, and internal timers and counters, frequently change, making the cached value stale and irrelevant.

* &quot;write&quot; optimizations -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that it doesn't matter what order writes occur to different variables, and that only the last write to a particular variable really matters. This works great with normal values in RAM, but fails miserably with typical output peripherals. Sending &quot;turn left 90, go forward 10, turn left 90, go forward 10&quot; out the serial port is completely different than &quot;optimizing&quot; it to send &quot;0&quot; out the serial port.

* instruction reordering -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that they can reorder instructions. The compiler may decide to change the order in which variables are assigned to make better use of registers. This may fail miserably with IO peripherals where you, for example, write to one location to acquire a sample, then read that sample from a different location. Reordering these instructions would mean the old/stale/undefined sample is 'read', then the peripheral is told to acquire a new sample (which is ignored).

Depending on your hardware and compiler capabilities, other optimizations (SIMD, loop unrolling, parallelizing, pipelining) may also be affected.

== const volatile ==
Many people don't understand the combination of &quot;const&quot; and &quot;volatile&quot;.
As we discussed earlier in [[Embedded Systems/Memory]], embedded systems have many kinds of memory.

Many input peripherals -- such as free-running timers and keypad interfaces -- must be declared &quot;const volatile&quot;, because they both (a) change value outside by means outside this C program, and also (b) this C program should not write values to them (it makes no sense to write a value to a 10-key keypad).

== compiled and interactive ==

The vast majority of the time, when people write code in C, they run that code through C compiler on some personal computer to get a native executable.
People working with embedded systems then download that native executable to the embedded system, and run it.

However, a few people working with embedded systems do things a little differently.
* Some use a C interpreter such as &lt;!-- was http://code.google.com/p/picoc/ --&gt; [https://github.com/zsaleeba/picoc PicoC] or [[Wikipedia: Interactive C]] or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/eic/ Extensible Interactive C (EiC)]. They download the C source code to the embedded system, then they run the interpreter in the embedded system itself.
* Some people have the luxury of working with &quot;large&quot; embedded systems that can run a standard C compiler (it runs the standard GCC on Linux or BSD; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: DJGPP]] port of GCC on FreeDos; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: MinGW]] port of GCC on Windows; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: Tiny C Compiler]] on Linux or Windows; or some other C compiler). They download the C source code to the embedded system, then they run the compiler in the embedded system itself.

== C compilers for embedded systems ==

Perhaps the biggest difference between C compilers for embedded systems and C compilers for desktop computers is the distinction between the &quot;platform&quot; and the &quot;target&quot;.
The &quot;platform&quot; is where the C compiler runs -- perhaps a laptop running Linux or a desktop running Windows.
The &quot;target&quot; is where the executable code generated by the C compiler will run -- the CPU in the embedded system, often without any underlying operating system.


The GCC compiler is{{fact}} the most popular C compiler for embedded systems.
GCC was originally developed for 32-bit Princeton architecture CPUs.
So it was relatively easily ported to target
ARM core microcontrollers such as XScale and Atmel AT91RM9200;
Atmel AVR32 AP7 family;
MIPS core microcontrollers such as the Microchip PIC32; and
Freescale 68k/ColdFire processors.

The people who write compilers have also (with more difficulty) ported GCC to target
the Texas Instruments MSP430 16-bit MCUs;
the Microchip PIC24 and dsPIC 16-bit Microcontrollers;
the 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontrollers;
the 8-bit Freescale 68HC11 microcontrollers.

Other microcontrollers are very different from a 32-bit Princeton architecture CPU.
Many compiler writers have decided it would be better to develop an independent C compiler rather than try to force the round peg of GCC into the square hole of 8-bit Harvard architecture microcontroller targets:

SDCC - Small Device C Compiler for the Intel 8051, Maxim 80DS390, Zilog Z80, Motorola 68HC08, Microchip PIC16, Microchip PIC18 http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

There are some highly respected companies that sell commercial C compilers. You can find such a commercial C compiler for practically every microcontroller, including the above-listed microcontrollers.
Popular microcontrollers not already listed (i.e., microcontrollers for which the only known C compiler is a commercial C compiler) include
the Cypress M8C MCUs;
Microchip PIC10 and Microchip PIC12 MCUs;
etc.

Wikibooks ''is'', despite what others may say, at a turning point. It is on the verge of actually becoming great. However, before any of this can happen, certain [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] should be in place. Why these were never enforced is a mystery, and complete failure at the beginning of Wikibooks. Some of the missing policies are as follows (If the link goes blue, that does not mean it is enforced. It is probably still a proposed policy... Go express your support!):

== Missing Wikibooks policies ==
Some of the ''ideas'' these policies are based on are present, but they need their own policy.
*[[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]
*[[Wikibooks:Cite sources]]
*[[Wikibooks:No original research]] - Please see [[/Quicksand|my sandbox]] for an adapted start to the No original research policy. Any comments or tweaks are encouraged.
*[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
*[[Wikibooks:No legal threats]]
*[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Editing policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Image use policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Protected page]]
*[[Wikibooks:Talk page]]
*[[Wikibooks:Title pages]]
*[[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Banning policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Three-revert rule]]
*[[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]]
*[[Wikibooks:Civility]]
*[[Wikibooks:Don't disrupt Wikibooks to illustrate a point]]
*[[Wikibooks:Sock puppet]]
*[[Wikibooks:Undeletion policy]]
*[[Wikibooks:Consensus]]
*[[Wikibooks:Module size]]
*[[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]]

*And while not exactly a missing policy, [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] is very needed. Shouldn't this be in place before we actually need it too badly?

== Incomplete policies (my opinion) ==
*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]

== Personal stuff ==

I have spent a lot of time over at the English Wikipedia. Normally the best way to contact me is over there at my talk page. Please see [[:Wikipedia:User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] for my Wikipedia user page and connected talk page.

''I think this user page is extremely boring. Feel free to change it and make it beautiful, I encourage it. Just don't omit too much of the info already here. Thanks.''

I originally just created this account to reserve my name. However, I fell in with the [[Wikijunior]] crowd and just love it. I think it could be a very wonderful resource for children. I have spent most of my time at Wikibooks trying to do work with the [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] project. Something that could be very interesting, in my opinion.

Ummm... other than that, please see me at Wikipedia to know me better.

==Could there possibly be some effort to have all these organisations club together to create an all-in-one website on the disorder, and teach the organisations how to mirror the all-in-one website source==

==More importantly could experts create a survival guide, teaching what one should learn to be able to in an order==

i.e. one should learn how to do this first, then this, and maybe &quot;but you should read this short section first&quot;
there is far too much information to cope with, reading all this makes me suicidal, i have no way of putting it into order. it's far easier to learn to be an arsehole, go to martial arts classes, and scare people who mess with me. i'm not even kidding, far more confidence/self-esteem that way. Never found any problems with NTs in a martial arts class, except maybe the instructors, but there's not much they can do without risking losing income, or is there?
But of course, if one follows this path, don't advertise that you do martial arts, unless you have to, as NTs might turn up with a gun :D

==Needs warnings section, links not working==

There should be some warning section where the reader is told things like not to go with everyone, etc.
Some links are either dead or not linking directly to the other guides.

==Thoughts regarding whether the book should remain at wikibooks ==
Does this article belong here at all, or should it be at [http://academia.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Academica Wikicity]? [[User:Gerrit|Gerrit]] 17:29, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
:It belongs here! [[User:Gerrit|Gerrit]] 15:47, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:I think it belongs too, but maybe it's welcome on both wikibooks and academica wikicity, but if it is in both places then there would be 2 different versions of the book. I'm not sure whether it would be good or bad. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 22:57, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[w:Perspective (cognitive)|POV]] (Point Of View) ==

&quot;Non-autistic people seem to make a game of judging each other by how close they get to 100% (see section on confidence). This may be at least part of the reason that it is difficult to get explanations out of non-autistic people. &quot;

This is aspergers cognicentrism. I know, I have aspergers. The reason
why people aren't answering your questions is;
A; They lack motivation
B; They don't understand your question
C; Your question has violated some taboo or social boundary
D; Your question has made assumptions which they don't share
E; Your question forces an intellectual attitude regarding a topic
which the person has only regarded casually.

I'd have to say, please don't remove this wikibook, I could probably
use it as source material for a quick game of analysis.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

:My perspective of this is that it is true that life seems to be a social status game which is described in the confidence section for non-autistic people, which does not seem to be true for most autistic spectrum people.

:Therefore, considering that status may come from knowing and using certain &quot;social tricks&quot;, what I'm saying is that answering reasonable questions may represent giving information to the competition for a non-autistic person.

:That said, I believe points A thru E are valid in and of themselves, but when they don't apply, it is still difficult to get useful information out of people, and there is obviously some reason for it.

:Out of interest, what do you mean by &quot;game of analysis&quot;? I feel that this is a put down. Is there something constructive you can add in the way of feedback? [[User:203.214.22.24|203.214.22.24]] 12:06, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I'd agree. Aspies in general are more interested in their own intellectual stimulus than the outside world period, and so they aren't very interested in the game of socialization, pack psychology, and so forth. As a side issue, most aspies have some difficulty even comprehending that game, because it is so different a set of motivations and intentions than those aspies are generally operating from. This can be a spiraling problem, because aspies are the certain cure for Groupthink, but thus end up the targets of Status Quo preservers. People assume we are playing the same game they are and using tricks inside of that game. Instead, we are just observing things outside of the box. [[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:50, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I am very interested in game theory and psychology precisely because it enabled me eventually to generate a close approximation for my own purposes to the social game. I think that it is also sometimes true that people are playing the social game, and that is why they balk at aspie -outside of the box- questions and observations. However, MORE OFTEN, the case is the opposite; the person would freely give information, they just don't understand where the aspie is coming from. There are a variety of problems that are being mixed here together accidentally. Each has different causations and different solutions. The best and most important thing to remember as an aspie is to not get stuck in the &quot;US-VS-THEM&quot; destructive spiral. &quot;Assume good faith&quot;. (Until good evidence prooves that the person isn't acting in good faith.)

:::I am glad that you asked that question, because I am thinking of making an annotated version of the book to expand on its themes and add clarity from the perspective of Psychology. I am not trying to put the book down, but I am identifying problems in its reasoning process. Constructive energy is more expensive than deconstructive energy, and I apologize.  The &quot;Game of Analysis&quot; would have to be taken in context, and I can't remember off the top of my head which way I used it. There are several different Games of Analysis I might have been refering to. The first and most obvious is that Game which Aspies must play in making sense of the strange world. The next is the game a logician must play in making sense of an Aspie. The root problem here is that Aspies and most people THINK in very different ways. Cognitive styles end up generating cognitive biases. The third game is sorting the difference between the first two; Trying to make sense of different cognitive styles. ah, i read my comment, and i meant it in the third way. :) [[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

::::Thankyou for this.  :-)  I'm a little frustrated these days that this book doesn't seem to have enough basics to attract other contributors, and I can't work out how to change that.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 01:57, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::::::203.214.22.24, please tell me an example of where you would like the basics page. (for example between 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 or at the beginning).

[[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 08:23, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::::At the moment I'm toying with the idea of breaking the book into sections.  The first one would be &quot;basics&quot; and would include all the sections up to but not including the sections about confidence and the social status game.  The next section would be theory about how the non-autistic mind works and would be an expanded version of the section about confidence.  The remaining sections would be about all the side issues that comprise the rest of the book.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 14:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== People who have comments regarding the article ==

=== VFD comment - Please Don't Delete ===

I find the writing by Marc Segar very helpful.  I just want to add that a man is not supposed to bent down while in a public shower because it means that he is gay and he wants to have sex.  Not knowing this can cause tension or misunderstanding between teamates.  I think that this is what Marc Segar is trying to do.  He does not teach you to conform.  He teaches you to protect yourself in the world where most people don't judge you from the inside, but they judge you by your action and unwritten social rules and will tease you if you are vulnerable.  We all know from our heart that the world is not a &quot;happy&quot; place.  Notice that Marc teaches that non-austistic people sometimes making fun of other groups to boost their own ego.  Marc teaches autistic people to protect themself  but not to use the unwritten rule to pick on someone wittier or funnier or pick on someone more shy and quieter.  

I don't know if I am autistic or not, but I have trouble picking up unwritten social rules.  I suspect that I do not have parents, teachers, or counselors that talk to me about this.  I did talk to a few conselors, but they were more damaging than helpful.  I discussed to them about my trouble forming relationship with friends.  Even though I insisted that there are things that I did wrong that people don't like, the conselors kept telling me that I was paranoid and insecure.  Then they go on and lecture to me what a good friendship is.  I even gave them some examples and asking them what I did wrong, all they did was laugh.  I intuitively understand they they knew what the problem was but they didn't want to tell me that I had violated the unwritten rule.  Why?  because they are just like everyone else, they want to see me suffer to boost their own ego.  

Also, I heard so many people proudly say that, &quot;I don't believe in normal.&quot;  My reponse to that would be &quot;It's because you have not experience anything else but normal.&quot;  It is okay to be different, but you just need to protect yourself and that is what Marc Segar teaches in his work.

After reading Marc Segar's book, I felt like finding a flowing river in the middle of the desert.  I read somewhere that Marc is dead, but his work may be the eternal fountain of your for millions suffering.

Please don' get rid of this book. My Son is a person on the Autistic Spectrum and I was desperately worried about how to help him understand social rules etc that even I don't fully understand and this book seems to me more precious than gold and I want it to be available to him when he is old enough to read it.

== Reorganising the book into wiki chapters ==

Some chapters are very large, and as the book is now it's about 100 kilobytes, making editing very difficult for me , and probably for others. I suggest we put the really great (in size) chapters in separate &quot;wiki chapters&quot; which make it easier to edit. You will still see all chapters but you won't load the whole book while coming to the main page, since you might also not be interested in everything but only some parts, and when you edit you will edit parts not the whole book at once. What do you say? [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 19:36, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

This is not a reply but more info added to my original message. There is a guideline on wikipedia about article sizes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 08:46, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I agree.  I've often wondered how to break this book into chapters technically, and where the best places to break it are.  As for actual editing, there's a FireFox addon called &quot;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125 it's all text]&quot; that will put an &quot;edit&quot; tab on every textbox and allow you to launch an actual editor on the content.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 06:35, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

Issues that bother me greatly are that the &quot;printable version&quot; link in the toolbox doesn't actually link the separated chapters into the printable document and that there is absolutely no way to find documents that somehow become unlinked with the rest of the book.  It's almost as if MediaWiki has been used for WikiBooks without consideration as to whether it is useful for the task.  I'm running into all sorts of insane problems dealing with its interface.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 07:46, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Descriptions for wiki chapters ===
I've thought whether we could make small descriptions regarding separate chapters, so people can get more information what the chapter is about. We could maybe set it to at most 2 sentences. What do you say? [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 09:02, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

Again, I agree.  I'm a bit of a techhead rather than a writer and at this point I'm just working on content rather than presentation and organisation, so at this point I'm happy to let you or anyone else organise things the way you want.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 06:43, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

== Braking the book in subchapters(MediaWiki) ==
Warning: this is an edited reply, purpose to clear out confusion.
 (Undo revision 858809 by Logictheo What's wrong with it being a 
 template? Do I have to change the way my book is written because 
 MediaWiki is a piece of crap?)
is explained by CrazyEddy why the page is being brought back to a previous version.
You deleted the subpages, and made templates with the same names. Why? I must revert history because of that. If you still wish to revert it, please say why here...because in this way this discussion can lead to some good results. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 16:14, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:I don't fully understand what you just wrote.  I didn't actually delete any sub-pages.  I used the &quot;{{}}&quot; notation instead of the &quot;[[]]&quot; notation because the &quot;{{}}&quot; notation will insert the sub-document INTO the current document whereas &quot;[[]]&quot; simply inserts a link.  The book may be too large to edit, but it is DESIGNED to be small and is by no means too large to load in a browser therefore I would like all the elements to be on one printable page.
:Now, what exactly is the issue with templates that you have to revert history?  I understand that using &quot;{{}}&quot; converts something to a template, but I don't understand exactly what, or what the issue with templates is.  If mediawiki is doing something with documents with &quot;{{}}&quot;'s in them then surely there's another way to achieve the last paragraph, but if you don't mind, I'd prefer to have the document laid out the right way rather than pander to MediaWiki's bugs.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 16:36, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
:One thing I would like to add is that breaking the book into sub-documents is a good idea, and I'd like to thank you for doing that.  I've been looking for a way to do this for a long time.  The way it stands right now, everything is included on one page for viewing, but the actual page is broken into separate documents, and until I can find a way to have a single printable page, I'd simply rather not break the book into interlinked documents if that's OK with you?  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 17:17, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

::Well, we could make a separate page which is called &quot;printable version&quot;, what do you say? I'm hesitating to make transclusion(yes that's a page on wikipedia I've found regarding the &quot;{}&quot; symbols). It might confuse regular users who have no technical understanding, and just want to add content. I'll do it, and if you object, reply. Even if you agree reply anyway if you like. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 18:18, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Making a printable version is an ideal solution to me.  Also, I'm reading [[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion]] and I see nothing there indicating that using &quot;{{}}&quot; is bad.  What exactly is wrong with it?  Can you point me to any page that talks about that?

:::I must say that I've put a hell of a lot of work into this book and that have copyright on 95% of the content.  If this issue is not sorted out I'm inclined to remove it from WikiBooks.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 19:03, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

== Regarding Marc Segar's Death ==

I saw the note that staying in the non-autistic world may have caused Segar to kill himself, but I am unable to fine an article that supports this. The only item I can find is a French Wikipedia article that says he died in a car accident. Does anyone have a reference of his suicide?

-------------------------------------------------
My name is Emma Segar; I'm Marc's sister.  I'm posting this on a few forums where Marc is mentioned, to clear up any confusion around his life, his guide and his death.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Marc and his work.  My e-mail is purplepooka@blueyonder.co.uk

This has been a difficult thing for any of his family to come forward and talk about.  Obviously it is upsetting for us, and I think we've also felt for some time that it wasn't really necessary, or appropriate, to make public announcements about Marc on the internet.  However, ten years on, finding Marc's name in unexpected places all over the net, from blogs and autism forums to Hollywood film proposals, I'm beginning to realise that, whether we like it or not, public interest in Marc is now a fact, and I would rather put up the facts from our perspective and an e-mail address for questions than keep stumbling across guesses and speculations.

Marc's death:
Marc's death was a suicide, not a car accident.  He drove out to the M1 in the middle of the night, parked at a services and walked onto the motorway.  He was suffering from depression, but not panic attacks as has been suggested, and I believe that he was thinking clearly and knew what he was doing at the time.  He had written a very brief note on his computer, which he hadn't shown to anybody or left anywhere it could be accidentally found.  It wasn't a cry for help, just a confirmation of intent. 
 
There was no one particular event that brought it on, but many contributing factors.  We have been through the process of blaming his (mild) drug use, his difficulties in maintaining friendships, the stresses of his work, and of course we have blamed ourselves for not seeing it coming.  I still believe that the greatest influence on his decision was the pressure that he put on himself to overcome the barriers of Asperger's Syndrome, and his difficulty in putting those barriers into perspective with his many achievements.

Marc's Guide:
The Guide itself wasn't an enduring obsession but a passing interest, which he updated a few times and then dismissed as too incomplete to be useful.  He began work on another guide to help with conversations, which was full of lists of band members, football teams, films and TV programmes, so that readers would know what NTs were talking about when they discussed these things.  He gave this up when he realised how quickly it would become outdated, not to mention the enormity of the task of writing what was essentially a bluffer's guide to everything.

His view of the non-autistic world, despite his wide experience, extensive research and personal disregard for the conventional, remained irredeemably cut and dried.  I remember arguing with him about the first draft of the Guide.  I thought it gave the impression that it was somehow wrong or bad to be autistic, and that he should include a passage to the effect that readers didn't have to follow these rules if they didn't want to - it was just background information to help them make a personal choice.  He said that those who read it all had to live in this world, and the world wasn't going to change, so there was no choice.  I think he changed his mind later, after meeting more people with Asperger's Syndrome, but he never quite made the leap of extending the validity of that choice to himself.

I wish that Aspies For Freedom and all of these blogs had been around then.  There was really very little at the time in the way of information or organisations run by and for Aspies, and perhaps a group of that kind might have persuaded him that he could lead the life he wanted to without having to put himself in such intensely stressful situations.  I believe that he would have had a lot to say on these forums, and the most difficult thing about posting this is to see him being talked about here, instead of seeing him talk here.  Even those who knew him best can't begin to speak for him, but I know he would have had a great deal to say.

== Copyright uncertainty of the book - (95% ok. 5% uncertain) ==

Hi,

from a previous dicussion CrazyEddy mentions that he has copyright on 95% of the work.

&gt; I must say that I've put a hell of a lot of work into this book
&gt; and that have copyright on 95% of the content. 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt; CrazyEddy 19:03, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

Who or which people hold copyright on 5% of the original work? Did/do they agree to Wikibook's license &quot;Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL&quot;? I had this uncertainty after you mentioned that you have copyright over 95% of the work, so I wondered about the 5% and if this work (95%) was based on a non-free work. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] ([[User talk:Logictheo|talk]]) 08:22, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

:My understanding on this is that a free license is still copyrighted by it's author, since this is the only way it can be held under such a license, and that although the work can't retrospectively be unlicensed, it can be re-licensed by its copyright holder for future works.

:That said, I don't intend to relicense it.  My main concern is that the work does have to be as readable as possible to a wide range of autistic spectrum people with a wide mix of intellectual abilities.  The structure of the book is important.  The questions section at the beginning needs to stay there for example, and not be melded into the conversations section.

:The fact that people keep re-arranging, renaming and splitting off sections is deeply confusing for me because I cannot get a grip on all the changes happening without manually searching for all the individual sections and putting them on my watch list.

:You need to decide if you want this book to achieve its stated purpose as best as possible or become another wikimedia work of art.  You cannot have both.  Or at least, I can't see a way.  This is an important decision, because there are remarkably few effective self help guides out there for autistic spectrum people.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 13:01, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

:Also, I basically started writing this book HERE, on WikiBooks, based on notes I'd previously written which are now far less developed than this page.  You can look at the list of contributors over the years in the history.  I forgot to log in a few times while I was writing, but I basically came from the same IP blocks over that time.  Does that answer the original question?  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 16:40, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Thank you for the clarification, CrazyEddy. I hope this will help Logictheo and others [[m:Avoid copyright paranoia]].
:: It looks like this book is like most books at Wikibooks -- and most published books -- there's one person who writes over half of the book, and a bunch of other people that interject a bit of material here or there, attempt to improve the arrangement of parts, and fix typos.
:: I agree that arbitrary and frequent re-arranging, renaming and splitting is confusing.
:: On the other hand, if we freeze the current arrangement of the book, then it will be impossible to make any further improvements.
:: I hope we find a middle way. A way that allows people to gradually make this book better and better, but avoids unnecessary confusion. By &quot;better&quot;, I mean &quot;more useful for the target audience&quot;, not &quot;looks prettier&quot;. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:32, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
:::I keep hoping that it will continue on its development.
:::I still have things to contribute to it too, but its ground has been too unstable to walk on for me.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 16:28, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I'd be happy if the book were split into new works.  :-)  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 19:16, 28 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== C and Assembly ==

Many programmers are more comfortable writing in C, and for good reason: C is a mid-level language (in comparison to Assembly, which is a low-level language), and spares the programmers some of the details of the actual implementation.

However, there are some low-level tasks that either can be better implemented in assembly, or can ''only'' be implemented in assembly language. Also, it is frequently useful for the programmer to look at the assembly output of the C compiler, and hand-edit, or ''hand optimize'' the assembly code in ways that the compiler cannot.  Assembly is also useful for time-critical or real-time processes, because unlike with high-level languages, there is no ambiguity about how the code will be compiled.  The timing can be strictly controlled, which is useful for writing simple device drivers.  This section will look at multiple techniques for mixing C and Assembly program development.

== Inline Assembly ==

One of the most common methods for using assembly code fragments in a C programming project is to use a technique called '''inline assembly'''. Inline assembly is invoked in different compilers in different ways. Also, the assembly language syntax used in the inline assembly depends entirely on the assembly engine used by the C compiler. Microsoft C++, for instance, only accepts inline assembly commands in MASM syntax, while GNU GCC only accepts inline assembly in GAS syntax (also known as AT&amp;T syntax). This page will discuss some of the basics of mixed-language programming in some common compilers.

=== Microsoft C Compiler ===
=== Turbo C Compiler ===
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;conio.h&gt;

int main()
{
     printf(&quot; Hello world&quot;);
}

=== GNU GCC Compiler ===

=== Borland C Compiler ===

== Linked Assembly ==

When an assembly source file is assembled by an assembler, and a C source file is compiled by a C compiler, those two '''object files''' can be linked together by a '''linker''' to form the final executable. The beauty of this approach is that the assembly files can be written using any syntax and assembler that the programmer is comfortable with. Also, if a change needs to be made in the assembly code, all of that code exists in a separate file, that the programmer can easily access. The only disadvanges of mixing assembly and C in this way are that a)both the assembler and the compiler need to be run, and b) those files need to be manually linked together by the programmer. These extra steps are comparatively easy, although it does mean that the programmer needs to learn the command-line syntax of the compiler, the assembler, and the linker.

=== Inline Assembly vs. Linked Assembly ===

'''Advantages of inline assembly:'''

Short assembly routines can be embedded directly in C function in a C code file. The mixed-language file then can be completely compiled with a single command to the C compiler (as opposed to compiling the assembly code with an assembler, compiling the C code with the C Compiler, and then linking them together).
This method is fast and easy.
If the in-line assembly is embedded in a function, then the programmer doesn't need to worry about [[#Calling_Conventions]], even when changing compiler switches to a different calling convention.

'''Advantages of linked assembly:'''

If a new microprocessor is selected, all the assembly commands are isolated in a &quot;.asm&quot; file. The programmer can update just that one file -- there is no need to change any of the &quot;.c&quot; files (if they are portably written).

== Calling Conventions ==

{{Wikipediapar||Application binary interface}}
{{Wikipediapar||Calling convention}}

When writing separate C and Assembly modules, and linking them with your linker, it is important to remember that a number of high-level C constructs are very precisely defined, and need to be handled correctly by the assembly portions of your program. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to mixed-language programming is the issue of function calling conventions. C functions are all implemented according to a particular convention that is selected by the programmer (if you have never &quot;selected&quot; a particular calling convention, it's because your compiler has a default setting). This page will go through some of the common calling conventions that the programmer might run into, and will describe how to implement these in assembly language.

Code compiled with one compiler won't work right when linked to code compiled with a different calling convention.
If the code is in C or another high-level language (or assembly language embedded in-line to a C function), it's a minor hassle -- the programmer needs to pick which compiler / optimization switches she wants to use ''today'', and recompile every part of the program that way.
Converting assembly language code to use a different calling convention takes more manual effort and is more bug-prone.

Unfortunately, calling conventions are often different from one compiler to the next -- even on the same CPU.
Occasionally the calling convention changes from one version of a compiler to the next, or even from the same compiler when given different &quot;optimization&quot; switches.

Unfortunately, many times the calling convention used by a particular version of a particular compiler is inadequately documented.
So assembly-language programmers are forced to use reverse engineering techniques to figure out the exact details they need to know in order to call functions written in C, and in order to accept calls from functions written in C.

The typical process is:&lt;ref&gt;
ARM Technical Support Knowledge Articles:
[infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka8926.html &quot;CALLING ASSEMBLY ROUTINES FROM C&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* write a &quot;.c&quot; file with stubs ''... details??? ...'' ... exactly the same number and type of inputs and outputs that you want the assembly-language function to have.
* Compile that file with the appropriate switches to give a mixed assembly-language-with-c-in-comments file (typically a &quot;.cod&quot; file). (If your compiler can't produce an assembly language file, there is the tedious option of disassembling the binary &quot;.obj&quot; machine-code file).
* Copy that &quot;.cod&quot; file to a &quot;.asm&quot; file. (Sometimes you need to strip out the compiled hex numbers and comment out other lines to turn it into something the assembler can handle).
* Test the calling convention -- compile the &quot;.asm&quot; file to an &quot;.obj&quot; file, and link it (instead of the stub &quot;.c&quot; file) to the rest of the program. Test to see that &quot;calls&quot; work properly.
* Fill in your &quot;.asm&quot; file -- the &quot;.asm&quot; file should now include the appropriate header and footer on each function to properly implement the calling convention. Comment out the stub code in the middle of the function and fill out the function with your assembly language implementation.
* Test. Typically a programmer single-steps through each instruction in the new code, making sure it does what they wanted it to do.

=== Parameter Passing ===

: Normally, parameters are passed between functions (either written in C or in Assembly) via the stack. For example, if a function foo1() calls a function foo2() with 2 parameters (say characters x and y), then before the control jumps to the starting of foo2(), two bytes (normal size of a character in most of the systems) are filled with the values that need to be passed. Once control jumps to the new function foo2(), and you use the values (passed as parameters) in the function, they are retrieved from the stack and used. 

There are two parameter passing techniques in use,
: 1. Pass by Value
: 2. Pass by Reference

Parameter passing techniques can also use
: right-to-left (C-style)
: left-to-right (Pascal style)

On processors with lots of registers (such as the ARM and the Sparc), the standard calling convention puts *all* the parameters (and even the return address) in registers.

{{Wikipediapar||Re-entrant}}

On processors with inadequate numbers of registers (such as the 80x86 and the M8C), all calling conventions are forced to put at least some parameters on the stack or elsewhere in RAM.

Some calling conventions allow &quot;re-entrant code&quot;.

=== Pass by Value ===

With pass-by-value, a copy of the actual value (the literal content) is passed.
For example, if you have a function that accepts two characters like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;void foo(char x, char y)&lt;/b&gt;{
        x = x + 1;
        y = y + 2;
        putchar(x);
        putchar(y);
    }&lt;/code&gt;
and you invoke this function as follows&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
    char a,b;
    a='A';
    b='B';
    &lt;b&gt;foo(a,b);&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
then the program pushes a copy of the ASCII values of 'A' and 'B' (65 and 66 respectively) onto the stack before the function foo is called. You can see that there is no mention of variables 'a' or 'b' in the function foo(). So, any changes that you make to those two values in foo will not affect the values of a and b in the calling function.

=== Pass by Reference ===
: Imagine a situation where you have to pass a large amount of data to a function and apply the modifications, done in that function, to the original variables. An example of such a situation might be a function that converts a string with lower case alphabets to upper case. It would be an unwise decision to pass the entire string (particularly if it is a big one) to the function, and when the conversion is complete, pass the entire result back to the calling function. Here we pass the address of the variable to the function. This has two advantages, one, you don't have to pass huge data, therby saving execution time and two, you can work on the data right away so that by the end of the function, the data in the calling function is already modified.

: But remember, any change you make to the variable passed by reference will result in the original variable getting modified. If that's not what you wanted, then you must manually copy the variable before calling the function.

=== 80x86 / Pentium ===

Prior to the current generation of 32bit and 64 bit based processors, the 80x86 architecture used a complex segmented memory model ( also refereed to as real mode). For most purposes this will not not be encountered unless writing exceptionally low level code to interface directly with hardware or peripheral chips.

Modern code is typically written to support the 'protected mode' in which the memory space can for most purposes be considered to be flat.

The information below related to calling conventions in the protected mode.

=== CDECL ===

In the CDECL calling convention the following holds:
*Arguments are passed on the stack in Right-to-Left order, and return values are passed in eax.
*The ''calling'' function cleans the stack. This allows CDECL functions to have ''variable-length argument lists'' (aka variadic functions). For this reason the number of arguments is not appended to the name of the function by the compiler, and the assembler and the linker are therefore unable to determine if an incorrect number of arguments is used.

{{Wikipedia|Variadic_function}}
Variadic functions usually have special entry code, generated by the va_start(), va_arg() C pseudo-functions.

Consider the following C instructions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_cdecl int MyFunction1(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the following function call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 x = MyFunction1(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

These would produce the following assembly listings, respectively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:_MyFunction1
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
mov edx, [ebp + 12]
add eax, edx
pop ebp
ret
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push 3
push 2
call _MyFunction1
add esp, 8
&lt;/source&gt;

When translated to assembly code, CDECL functions are almost always prepended with an underscore (that's why all previous examples have used &quot;_&quot; in the assembly code).

=== STDCALL ===

STDCALL, also known as &quot;WINAPI&quot; (and a few other names, depending on where you are reading it) is used almost exclusively by Microsoft as the standard calling convention for the Win32 API. Since STDCALL is strictly defined by Microsoft, all compilers that implement it do it the same way.

*STDCALL passes arguments right-to-left, and returns the value in eax. (The Microsoft documentation erroneously claims that arguments are passed left-to-right, but this is not the case.)
*The called function cleans the stack, unlike CDECL. This means that STDCALL doesn't allow variable-length argument lists. 

Consider the following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_stdcall int MyFunction2(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the calling instruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 x = MyFunction2(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

These will produce the following respective assembly code fragments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:_MyFunction@8
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
mov edx, [ebp + 12]
add eax, edx
pop ebp
ret 8
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push 3
push 2
call _MyFunction@8
&lt;/source&gt;

There are a few important points to note here:

#In the function body, the ''ret'' instruction has an (optional) argument that indicates how many bytes to pop off the stack when the function returns.
#STDCALL functions are name-decorated with a leading underscore, followed by an @, and then the number (in bytes) of arguments passed on the stack. This number will always be a multiple of 4, on a 32-bit aligned machine.

=== FASTCALL ===

The FASTCALL calling convention is not completely standard across all compilers, so it should be used with caution. In FASTCALL, the first 2 or 3 32-bit (or smaller) arguments are passed in registers, with the most commonly used registers being edx, eax, and ecx. Additional arguments, or arguments larger than 4-bytes are passed on the stack, often in Right-to-Left order (similar to CDECL). The calling function most frequently is responsible for cleaning the stack, if needed. 

Because of the ambiguities, it is recommended that FASTCALL be used only in situations with 1, 2, or 3 32-bit arguments, where speed is essential.

The following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_fastcall int MyFunction3(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the following C function call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
x = MyFunction3(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

Will produce the following assembly code fragments for the called, and the calling functions, respectively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:@MyFunction3@8
push ebp
mov ebp, esp ;many compilers create a stack frame even if it isn't used
add eax, edx ;a is in eax, b is in edx
pop ebp
ret
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
;the calling function
mov eax, 2
mov edx, 3
call @MyFunction3@8
&lt;/source&gt;
The name decoration for FASTCALL prepends an @ to the function name, and follows the function name with @x, where x is the number (in bytes) of arguments passed to the function. 

Many compilers still produce a stack frame for FASTCALL functions, especially in situations where the FASTCALL function itself calls another subroutine. However, if a FASTCALL function doesn't need a stack frame, optimizing compilers are free to omit it.

What registers are used by the C compiler?

==== Data types====
char is 8 bits, int is 16 bits, long is 32 bits, long long is 64 bits, float and double are 32 bits (this is the only supported floating point format), pointers are 16 bits (function pointers are word addresses, to allow addressing the whole 128K program memory space on the ATmega devices with &gt; 64 KB of flash ROM). There is a -mint8 option (see Options for the C compiler avr-gcc) to make int 8 bits, but that is not supported by avr-libc and violates C standards (int must be at least 16 bits). It may be removed in a future release.

====Call-used registers (r18-r27, r30-r31)====
May be allocated by GNU GCC for local data. You may use them freely in assembler subroutines. Calling C subroutines can clobber any of them - the caller is responsible for saving and restoring.

====Call-saved registers (r2-r17, r28-r29) ====
May be allocated by GNU GCC for local data. Calling C subroutines leaves them unchanged. Assembler subroutines are responsible for saving and restoring these registers, if changed. r29:r28 (Y pointer) is used as a frame pointer (points to local data on stack) if necessary. The requirement for the callee to save/preserve the contents of these registers even applies in situations where the compiler assigns them for argument passing.

====Fixed registers (r0, r1) ====
Never allocated by GNU GCC for local data, but often used for fixed purposes: 

r0 - temporary register, can be clobbered by any C code (except interrupt handlers which save it), may be used to remember something for a while within one piece of assembler code

r1 - assumed to be always zero in any C code, may be used to remember something for a while within one piece of assembler code, but must then be cleared after use (clr r1). This includes any use of the [f]mul[s[u]] instructions, which return their result in r1:r0. Interrupt handlers save and clear r1 on entry, and restore r1 on exit (in case it was non-zero).

====Function call conventions ====
Arguments - allocated left to right, r25 to r8. All arguments are aligned to start in even-numbered registers (odd-sized arguments, including char, have one free register above them). This allows making better use of the movw instruction on the enhanced core. 

If too many, those that don't fit are passed on the stack.

Return values: 8-bit in r24 (not r25!), 16-bit in r25:r24, up to 32 bits in r22-r25, up to 64 bits in r18-r25. 8-bit return values are zero/sign-extended to 16 bits by the caller (unsigned char is more efficient than signed char - just clr r25). Arguments to functions with variable argument lists (printf etc.) are all passed on stack, and char is extended to int.

Warning: There was no such alignment before 2000-07-01, including the old patches for gcc-2.95.2. Check your old assembler subroutines, and adjust them accordingly.

=== Microchip PIC ===

Unfortunately, [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/microchip/pages.htm several different (incompatible) calling conventions are used in writing programs for the Microchip PIC].

And several &quot;features&quot; of the PIC architecture
make most subroutine calls require several instructions -- much more verbose than the single instruction on many other processors.

The calling convention must deal with:
* The &quot;paged&quot; flash program memory architecture
* limitations on the hardware stack (perhaps by simulating a stack in software)
* the &quot;paged&quot; RAM data memory architecture
* making sure a subroutine call by an interrupt routine doesn't scramble information needed after the interrupt returns to the main loop.

=== 68HC11 ===

=== Sparc ===

The Sparc has special hardware that supports a nice calling convention:

A &quot;register window&quot; ...

|previous=Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/index
|previousText=previous module:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Armature Object&quot;
}}

== The Armature Object == 
Armature Object is like any other object type:

*It has a center, a position, a rotation and a scale factor.
*It can be edited.
*It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects.
*All animation you do in object mode is only working on the object, not the armature's contents like bones.
&lt;br&gt;
Try it now: add an armature to your scene: SPACEKEY --&gt; Add --&gt; Armature.
[[Image:Blender-2.62-Adding-an-Armature-1.jpg|thumb|none|alt=adding an Armature|How to add an armature bone in Blender 2.62]]&lt;br&gt;
Or you can press the Shift + A keys, and select single bone from the armature menu.
[[Image:Blender-2.62-Adding-an-Armature-2.jpg|thumb|none|alt=Adding an Armature|How to add an armature bone in Blender 2.62]]
When you add a new armature, you'll enter editmode automatically. To switch between modes, use the TABKEY or the dropdown menu in the Header of the 3Dview window (This might not be the case with blender 2.49b, you won't enter edit mode in that version):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Armature 3D Header.jpg|thumb|none|alt=Adding an Armature|Modes that relate to Armature bones]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== The Edit Panel When in Object Mode ==
This is how the edit panel looks after you have added a new armature and switched to object mode (TABKEY):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Armature_button_obj.jpg]]

*Link and Materials panel:
**The AR: field let you rename your armature Datablock. The dropdown is a quick way to select which Armature datablock you want to connect to this armature. You can keep more than one version for the same character. Useful when you have a special move to achieve in a shot, you can turn on an armature for a special purpose.
**The F button is an option to assign a Fake user to the Armature. Again if you have more than one armature for your character, it's a good idea to turn the Fake on, because if your armature datablock is not used (linked) it's not going to be saved in your .blend files. You can always do batch Fake-assignment of armatures by opening the Datablock browser (SHIFT-F4KEY), go in Armature datablock, select all the armatures you want to keep, and Press the FKEY.
**The OB: field is just to Rename your armature Object to something more cool and useful than Armature... Armature.001...

*Armature panel:
**Editing Options:
***X-Axis Mirror Edit: Not really useful now, it's more of an editmode option. This feature tells Blender you want to replicate all of your bones on one part of the Armature to the other. It's a clean way to just do half the job ;). The axis of mirroring is X so left&lt;--&gt;right in frontview (NUMPAD_1KEY) and the center is the center of the armature object. We will see this feature in detail in the next page.
***X-Ray: This option will let you see the armature through anything in the scene, solid or not. It's useful to see where your bones are in your character so you can select them.
***Automatic IK is a Posemode option. It lets you pose a chain of bones as if the bone you were holding was an ik target. More info in Posemode page.
**Display Options: These options give you the chance to visualise your bones in various ways. Also note that there is some specific options and features regarding the display mode you're in.
***Octahedron: This is the default view. Nothing exciting except you have a good idea of the rolling of the bones.[[Image:Octahedron_bone.jpg]]
***Stick: This display mode is really useful when you have a lot of bones in your view. It lets you &quot;unclutter&quot; the screen a bit. It draws the bones as tiny sticks.[[File:Stick bone.jpg]]
***B-Bones: It's more a feature than a display mode. This is only useful to visualise the effect you get when you activate the B-bones (Bézier-Bones). Each bone acts like a curve handle and lets you get extremely curvy poses. This will be exposed in the following pages.[[Image:Bbones.jpg]]
***Envelope: Again it's more a feature than a display mode. But in this case the visualisation will be useful to tweak your rig later. Envelope lets you easily tell which part of your character this bone will animate and it's visually possible to change the zone of influence exclusively in this display mode. The zone is only visible in Editmode or Posemode though.[[Image:Env_bone.jpg]]
***Draw Axes: To draw the axes on each bone of the armature when you are in Editmode or Posemode. Useful when you want to know where you are and which axis to use in a constraint for example. Mental note: Y is up, Z is depth and X is side, contrary to object for which Z is up, Y is depth and X is side.[[Image:Axis_drawing.jpg]]
***Draw names: This lets you see names of bones whatever the mode you are in. It's useful again to edit your armature, create parent dependencies or add constraints. [[Image:Name_drawing.jpg]]
***Ghost: This option lets you see a ghost of the armature in frames behind and over the current time. This is only working when you have an action linked to the armature, as we will see later.
***Step (Armature_button_obj.jpg needs update): This option lets you choose the frames interval between ghost instances.
**Deform options:
***Vertex Groups &amp; Envelope: These two toggles let you choose if you want the armature to deform your character using the Vertex Groups and/or the Envelopes. We will see that later.
***Rest position: This will bring the character back to factory default (item as Editmode), and no actions will be applied to the armature so you can easily edit it in the middle of an animation.
***Delay Deform: This was useful before as the old system was ''very'' slow. What it does is when you do a manipulation to the rig, it waits until you finish to update the view. Can still be useful though.

{{wikipedia|Real-time operating system}}

A '''Real-Time Operating System''' (RTOS) is a computing environment that reacts to input within a specific time period. A real-time deadline can be so small that system reaction appears instantaneous. The term [[w:Real-time_computing|real-time computing]] has also been used, however, to describe &quot;slow real-time&quot; output that has a longer, but fixed, time limit.

Learning the difference between real-time and standard operating systems is as easy as imagining yourself in a computer game. Each of the actions you take in the game is like a program running in that environment. A game that has a real-time operating system for its environment can feel like an extension of your body because you can count on a specific &quot;lag time:&quot; the time between your request for action and the computer's noticeable execution of your request. A standard operating system, however, may feel disjointed because the lag time is unreliable. To achieve time reliability, real-time programs and their [[w:Operating system|operating system]] environment must prioritize deadline actualization before anything else. In the gaming example, this might result in dropped frames or lower visual quality when reaction time and visual effects conflict.


== Methods ==
An operating system is considered real-time if it invariably enables its programs to perform tasks within specific time constraints, usually those expected by the user. To meet this definition, some or all of the following methods are employed:
* The RTOS performs few tasks, thus ensuring that the tasks will always be executed before the deadline
* The RTOS drops or reduces certain functions when they cannot be executed within the time constraints (&quot;load shedding&quot;)
* The RTOS monitors input consistently and in a timely manner
* The RTOS monitors resources and can interrupt background processes as needed to ensure real-time execution
* The RTOS anticipates potential requests and frees enough of the system to allow timely reaction to the user's request
* The RTOS keeps track of how much of each resource (CPU time per timeslice, RAM, communications bandwidth, etc.) might possibly be used in the worst-case by the currently-running tasks, and refuses to accept a new task unless it &quot;fits&quot; in the remaining un-allocated resources.

Chapters in this section will discuss how an RTOS works, some general methods for working with an RTOS, and [[Embedded Systems/Common RTOS | a few popular RTOSes]]. Finally, in some later chapters, we will discuss how to write your own RTOS

== Objectives ==

An RTOS must respond in a timely manner to changes, but that does not necessarily mean that an RTOS can handle a large throughput of data. In fact in an RTOS, small response times are valued much higher than computing power, or data speed. Sometimes an RTOS will even need to drop data to ensure that it meets its strict deadlines. In essence, that provides us with a perfect definition: '''an RTOS is an operating system designed to meet strict deadlines.''' Beyond that definition, there are few requirements as to what an RTOS must be, or what features it must have. Some RTOS implementations are very complete and very robust, while other implementations are very simple, and suited for only one particular purpose.

An RTOS may be either event-driven or time-sharing. An '''event-driven RTOS''' is a system that changes state only in response to an incoming event. A '''time-sharing RTOS''' is a system that changes state as a function of time

== The Fundamentals ==
To most people, embedded systems are not recognizable as computers. Instead, they are hidden inside everyday objects that surround us and help us in our lives. Embedded systems typically do not interface with the outside world through familiar personal computer interface devices such as a mouse, keyboard and graphic user interface. Instead, they interface with the outside world through unusual interfaces such as sensors, actuators and specialized communication links. Real-time and embedded systems operate in constrained environments in which computer memory and processing power are limited. They often need to provide their services within strict time deadlines to their users and to the surrounding world. It is these memory, speed and timing constraints that dictate the use of real-time operating systems in embedded software.

== Real-Time Kernel ==

The heart of a real-time OS (and the heart of every OS, for that matter) is the '''kernel'''. A kernel is the central core of an operating system, and it takes care of all the OS jobs:

#Booting
#Task Scheduling
#Standard Function Libraries

Now, we will talk about booting and bootloaders later, and we will also devote several chapters to task scheduling. So we should mention at least one thing about standard function libraries: In an embedded system, there is rarely enough memory (if any) to maintain a large function library. If functions are going to be included, they must be small, and important. 

In an embedded system, frequently the kernel will boot the system, initialize the ports and the global data items. Then, it will start the scheduler and instantiate any hardware timers that need to be started. After all that, the Kernel basically gets dumped out of memory (except for the library functions, if any), and the scheduler will start running the child tasks.

== Basic Kernel Services ==
In the discussion below, we will focus on the &quot;kernel&quot; – the part of an operating system that provides the most basic services to application software running on a processor. The &quot;kernel&quot; of a real-time operating system (&quot;RTOS&quot;) provides an &quot;abstraction layer&quot; that hides from application software the hardware details of the processor (or set of processors) upon which the application software will run.

      <comment>/* Addressable Areas */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

On an Embedded System, memory is at a premium. Some chips, particularly embedded VLSI chips, and low-end microprocessors may only have a small amount of RAM &quot;on board&quot; (built directly into the chip), and therefore their memory is not expandable. Other embedded systems have a certain amount of memory, and have no means to expand. In addition to RAM, some embedded systems have some non-volatile memory, in the form of miniature magnetic disks, FLASH memory expansions, or even various 3rd-party memory card expansions. Keep in mind however, that a memory upgrade on an embedded system may cost more than the entire system itself. An embedded systems programmer, therefore, needs to be very much aware of the memory available, and the memory needed to complete a task. 


Memory is frequently broken up into a number of different regions that are set aside for particular purposes.


== Addressable Areas ==

There are typically 4 distinct addressable areas, each one implemented with a different technology:

* Program memory (which holds the programs you write), often called ROM (although most developers prefer to use chips that actually implement this with Flash). While your program is running, it is impossible to change any of the data in program memory. But at least when the power comes back on, it's all still there.
* RAM, which holds the variables and stack. (Initial values for variables are copied from ROM). Forgets everything when power is lost.
* EEPROM. Used kind of like the hard drive in a personal computer, to store settings that might change occasionally, and that need to be remembered next time it starts up.
* I/O. This is really the entire point of a microcontroller.

Many popular microcontrollers (including the 8051, the Atmel AVR, the Microchip PIC, the Cypress PSoC) have a &quot;[[w:Harvard architecture|Harvard architecture]]&quot;,
meaning that programs can only execute out of &quot;ROM&quot;. You can copy bytes from ROM (or elsewhere) into RAM, but it's physically impossible to jump or call such &quot;code&quot; in RAM.
This is exactly the opposite of the situation on desktop computers, where the code you write cannot be executed until after it is copied into RAM.

A few popular microcontrollers (such as the 68HC11 and 68HC12 and ...) have a unified address space (a &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot;). You can jump or call code anywhere (although jumping to an address in I/O space is almost certainly not what you really wanted to do).

== Paging and Banking ==

Often software applications grow and grow.
Ancient processors (such as the 8085 used on the Mars rover Sojourner) with 16 bit address registers can directly access a maximum of 65 536 locations -- however, systems using these processors often have much more physical RAM and ROM than that. They use &quot;paging&quot; hardware that swaps in and out &quot;banks&quot; of memory into the directly accessible space.
Early Microchip PIC processors had 2 completely separate set of &quot;banking registers&quot;, one for swapping in different banks of program ROM, the other for swapping in different banks of RAM.

== Memory Management ==

All too often, programs written for embedded systems grow and grow until they exceed the available program space.
There are a variety of techniques&lt;ref&gt;
[[Data Compression#executable software compression]]
&lt;/ref&gt; for dealing with the out-of-memory problem:
* re-compile with the &quot;-Os&quot; (optimize for size) option
* find and comment-out &quot;dead code&quot;
* &quot;refactor&quot; repeated sections into a common subroutine
* trade RAM space for program space.
* put a small interpreter in &quot;internal program memory&quot; that loads and interprets &quot;instructions&quot;.
** use &quot;instructions&quot; -- perhaps p-code or threaded code -- that are more compact than directly coding it in assembly language. Or
** place these &quot;instructions&quot; can be placed in EEPROM or external serial Flash that couldn't otherwise be used as program memory. Or
** Both. This technique is often used in &quot;stamp&quot; style CPU modules.
* add more memory (perhaps using a paging or banking scheme)

Most CPUs used in desktop machines have a &quot;memory management unit&quot; (MMU).
The MMU handles virtual memory, protects regions of memory used by the OS from untrusted programs, and ...

Most embedded systems do not have a MMU.
We discuss the two versions of Linux that can run on a system that does not have a MMU in [[Embedded Systems/Linux]].

== x86 Memory Layout ==

=== Reserved Memory ===
Reserved memory is memory which is reserved for some purpose like additional software installation and startup.

=== Restricted Memory ===

=== General-Purpose Memory ===

== Segmented Memory == 

Old X86 processors were only 16 bit processors, and if a flat memory scheme was used, those processors would only be able to support 65 Kilobytes of memory. The system engineers behind the old 8086 and 80286 processors came up with the idea to segment memory, and use a combination of segment pointers and offset pointers to access an effective 20 bit address range, for a maximum of 1 megabyte of addressable memory.

Address = (Segment register * 16) + pointer register

New 32 bit processors allow for 4 Gigabytes of addressable memory space, and therefore the segmented memory model was all but abandoned in current 32 bit machines (although the segment registers are still used to implement paging schemes).

== Memory-Mapped I/O ==

Memory-Mapped I/O is a mechanism by which the processor performs I/O access by using memory access techniques. This is often put into effect because the memory bus is frequently much faster than the I/O bus. Another reason that memory mapped I/O might be used is that the architecture in use does not have a separate I/O bus.

In memory mapped IO, certain range of CPU's address space is kept aside for the external peripherals. These locations can be accessed using the same instructions as used for other memory accesses. But instead, the read/writes to these addresses are interpreted as access to device rather than a location on the main memory.

A CPU may expect a particular device at a fixed location or can dynamically assign a space for it.

The way this works is that memory interfaces are often designed as a bus (a shared communications resource), where many devices are attached. These devices are usually arranged as master and slave devices, where a master device can send and receive data from any of the slave devices. A typical system would have:
* A CPU as the master
* One or more RAM and/or ROM devices for program code and data storage
* Peripheral devices for interfacing with the outside world. Examples of these might be a UART (serial communications), Display device or Input device

The first way is via Ethernet. This uses the 10/100/1000base-T hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets.

The second way is via Wireless. This uses the 802.11 hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets.

The third and least common today is via analog phone lines using a modem to modulate digital bits to analog datastreams. This uses the modem as the hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets linked with the PPP connection protocol.

The other ways include variations of these protocols and hardware. Such as a Cable/DSL modem connected through 10base-T ethernet to a consumer router/firewall, and translated with NAT to either/both 802.11 and/or ethernet. What this reduces down to is that the direct link from your computer to the closest Internet related device will be, ~98% of the time, an ethernet cable or an 802.11 wireless uplink.

Also included in various hardware connections are IrDA, Bluetooth, Firewire (IEEE 1394/iLINK), and several others. These are not any more &quot;advanced,&quot; but are simply not main-stream.

This page will list some places where the reader can buy some of the hardware discussed in this book. Some of the embedded systems can be purchased for relatively cheap (some PIC microcontrollers will cost 5$ or less), and therefore the reader can purchase them for cheap and play around with them. Some of the embedded computers are relatively expensive, but these ones are very useful for home projects, because larger expensive boards will be more versatile, and will have more gadgets and gizmos to play with.

*[http://www.jkmicro.com/ JK Microsystems] This company has a number of good, solid embedded computers, many of which are i386 compatible. Many of these computers come with DOS preloaded, but an RTOS called &quot;eRTOS&quot; is available for free. Many of these computers come with ethernet extensions, so they can be used to perform simple web-based tasks (IRC bot, or simple web server, for instance).

*[http://www.embeddedx86.com/ Technologic Inc.] This company offers many moderate to high-end microprocessors with a number of available add-ons including PCMCIA cards (for things like wireless internet cards). Many of these systems are pre-loaded with a linux distro called &quot;TS-Linux&quot;

*[http://www.zworld.com/ ZWorld] This webpage offers a number of embedded systems and development kits. The flagship model is called the &quot;Rabbit Core&quot;, and is a very fast and flexible microprocessor. These core units can be incorporated into a number of different &quot;single board computers&quot;, for maximum flexibility. RabbitCore processors are programming in a proprietary language called &quot;Dynamic C&quot;, which is similar to standard C.

*[http://www.rentron.com Rentron] This webpage is basically a large catalogue for a number of different components including microcontrollers, microprocessors, transmitters, receivers, encoders, decoders, etc..

*http://www.atmel.com This company sells a large number of different types of components, including ARM chips, an 8051-compatible chip, and a proprietary 8-bit microprocessor called the &quot;Atmel AVR&quot;, and a 4-bit microprocessor called the &quot;MARC4&quot;. Also sells a number of DSP modules, and controllers.

*[http://www.embeddedplanet.com Embedded Planet] This company offers numerous fully customizable PowerPC, XScale, ARM and MIPS based embedded computers with multiple bootloader and operating system choices.

{{mergefrom|Embedded Systems/Microprocessor Architectures}}

An embedded system is useless if it cannot communicate with the outside world. To this effect, embedded systems need to employ I/O mechanisms to both receive outside data, and transmit commands back to the outside world. Few Computer Science courses will even mention I/O programming, although it is a central feature of embedded systems programming. This chapter then will serve as a crash course on I/O programming, both for those with a background in C, and also for those without it.

== Dos.h ==

The Dos.h header file commonly included in many C distributions, especially on DOS and Windows systems. This file contains information on a number of different routines, but most importantly it contains prototypes for the inp( ) and outp( ) functions that can be used to provide port output directly from a C program. Many embedded systems however, will not have a Dos.h header file in their library, nor will they have any precompiled C routines to handle port input and output. The purpose of this chapter then, is to teach the reader how to &quot;brew their own&quot; input and output routines.

== The &amp;lt;iohw.h&amp;gt; interface ==

Some C compiler distributions include the &amp;lt;iohw.h&amp;gt; interface.
It allows relatively portable hardware device driver code to be written.
It is used to implement the standard C++ &lt;hardware&gt; interface.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://web.archive.org/web/20040608203404/http://www.research.att.com/~bs/performanceTR.pdf &quot;Technical Report on C++ Performance&quot;]
by Dave Abrahams et. al. 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

== x86 Output Routines ==

The x86 instruction set contains 2 instructions: '''in''' and '''out''' both functions take 2 arguments, a port number, and then another parameter to receive the data from or to send the data to (depending on which command you use).

we can define 2 functions in assembly, using the CDECL calling convention, that we can link with our C programs, and call from our C programms to handle port output and input.

== Synchronous and Asynchronous ==

Data can be transmitted either synchronously or asynchronously. '''synchronous''' transmissions are transmissions that are sent with a clock signal. This way the receiver knows exactly where each bit begins and ends. This way, there is less susceptibility to noise and '''jitter'''. Also, synchronous transmissions frequently require extensive hand-shakeing between the transmitter and receiver, to ensure that all timing mechanisms are synchronized together. Conversely, '''asynchronous''' transmissions are sent without a clock signal, and often without much hand-shaking.

= Truth =

== Truth in a model ==

We have defined satisfaction in a model with a variable assignment.  We have expressed formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; being satisfied by model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can also say that a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied my model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (not limited to a specific variable assignment) if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with every variable assignment.  Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ \mbox{for every}\ \mathrm{s}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If no free variables occur in &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (thatis, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence), then &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Variable assignments allow us to deal with free variables when doing the semantic analysis of a formula.  For two variable assignments, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, satisfaction by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s_1}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; differs from satisfaction by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s_2}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; only if the formula has free variables.  But sentences do not have free variables.  Thus a model satisfies a sentence with at least one variable assignment if and only if it satisfies the sentence with every variable assignment.  The following two definitions are equivalent:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there  is a variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; such that

:: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The latter is just a notational variant of:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== A finite model ===

==== ''The example model'' ====

On the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Satisfaction|previous page]], we looked at the following model and variable assignment.

For the model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}|\ =\ \{1,\, 2,\, 3\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(c^0_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that:} \quad \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 0) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\ =\ 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 2) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 0) = 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 1)\ =\ 0,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 2) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 0) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 1) = 2,\ \mbox{and}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 2) = 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F^2_0})\ =\ \{&lt;\!0,\ 1\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!1,\ 2\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!2,\ 1\!&gt;\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For the variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(z_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example results'' ====

We noted the following results:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, f(a, b))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(f(a, b), a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(b, a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We also noted above that for sentences (though not for formulae in general), a model satisfies the sentence with at least one variable assignment if and only if it satisfies the sentence with every variable assignment.  Thus the results just listed hold for every variable assignment, not just &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying our definition of truth, we get:

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \mbox{are True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, f(a, b))\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(4) \quad \mathrm{F}(f(a, b), a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(5) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(6) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(b, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(7) \quad \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is false in }\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;(8) \quad \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is true in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to the goals (1)&amp;ndash;(8) of the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Satisfaction|previous page]].  We have now achieved those goals.

=== An infinite model ===

==== ''The example model'' ====

On [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]], we also considered an infinite model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M_2}}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}_2| = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(c^0_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(u, v) = u + v\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(\mathrm{F^2_0})\ =\ \{&lt;\!x,\ y\!&gt;:\ x &lt; y\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We can reuse the same variable assignment from above, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(z_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example of extended varable assignment ====
On the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]], we listed the following goals for our defintions.

:&lt;math&gt;f(a, b)\ \mbox{resolves to}\ 1\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This does not require our definition of truth or the definition of satisfaction; it is simply requires evaluating the exended variable assignment.  We have for any &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on defined on &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(a, b))
\ =\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f)\,(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a),\, I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ 0 + 1\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example results without quantifiers'' ====

We also listed the following goal on the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]].

:&lt;math&gt;(9) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ \mbox{are True in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(10) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \mbox{are False in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

First we note that:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(b),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(c)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(c),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 0 &lt; 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 1 &lt; 2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 2 \not&lt; 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!0,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 0 \not&lt; 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Because the formulae of (9) and (10) are sentences,

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of truth, we find the goals of (9) and (10) achieved.  The sentences of (9) are true and those of (10) are false.

==== ''Example results with quantifiers'' ====

In addition, we listed the following goal on the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]].

:&lt;math&gt;(11) \quad \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ \mbox{is true in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(12) \quad \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ \mbox{is false in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Corresponding to (11):

: &lt;math&gt;(13) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if, for each ''i'' a member of the domain, the following is true of at least one ''j'' a member of the domain:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, i, x\!:\, j]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^2_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; was assigned the ''less then'' relation.  Thus the preceeding holds if and only if, for every member of the domain, there is a larger member of the domain.  Given that the domain is &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, 2, ...\},\,\!&lt;/math&gt; this is obviously true.  Thus, (13) is true.  Given that the formula of (11) and (12) is a sentence, we find the goal expressed as (11) to be met.

Corresponding to (12):

: &lt;math&gt;(14) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if, for each ''i'' a member of the domain, the following is true of at least one ''j'' a member of the domain:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, i, x\!:\, j]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This holds if and only if, for every member of the domain, there is a smaller member of the domain.  But there is no member of the domain smaller than 0.  Thus (14) is false.  The formula of (12) and (14) fails to be satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The formula of (12) and (14) is a sentence, so it fails to be satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with ''any'' variable assignment.  The formula (a sentence) of (12) and (14) is false, and so the goal of (12) is met.</text>

=Reading=
The Toltecs (or Toltec or Tolteca) were a [[Wikipedia:Pre-Columbian|PreColumbian]] [[Wikipedia:Native American (Americas)|Native American]] people who dominated much of central [[Wikipedia:Mexico|Mexico]] between the 10th and 12th century AD. Their language,  [[Wikipedia:Nahuatl|Nahuatl]], was also spoken by the [[Wikipedia:Aztec|Aztecs]]. 

'''Origins'''

The Toltecs originated as a militaristic nomadic people, and they or their ancestors may have sacked the city of [[Wikipedia:Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan]] (ca. 750).  After they established a more settled existence, the Toltec fused the many small states in Central Mexico into an empire ruled from their capital, [[Wikipedia:Tula, Mexico|Tula]] (also known as Tol&amp;aacute;n). They were accomplished temple builders.  Their influence spread through much of [[Wikipedia:Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]] in the post-Classic era.  The Toltec influence on the Maya of [[Wikipedia:Yucatan|Yucat&amp;aacute;n]] is heavy, especially evident at the city of [[Wikipedia:Chichen Itza|Chichen Itza]]. Their pottery has been found as far south as Costa Rica.

'''Religous Beliefs'''

Some writers have alleged that the Toltecs introduced the cult of [[Wikipedia:Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcoatl]], the plumed serpent. This is certainly not so, as this deity was commonly depicted throughout [[Wikipedia:Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]] for centuries earlier, going back to Olmec times. In Toltec (and later Aztec) mythology Quetzalcoatl was a rival of [[Wikipedia:Tezcatlipoca|Tezcatlipoca]], the first god who is known to have demanded human hearts as sacrifice. Thus the Toltecs seem to have introduced the habit of mass human sacrifice as later practiced by the Aztecs.

'''Legend and Archiology'''

The Toltec empire is believed to have been destroyed around 1200 CE by the nomadic warriors of the [[Wikipedia:Chichimecs|Chichimecs]]. The ruling family of the Aztecs claimed to descend from Toltec ancestry via the sacred city of [[Wikipedia:Colhuacan|Colhuac&amp;aacute;n]].  

In his writings Miguel Le&amp;oacute;n Portilla explains that in Nauha legend, the Toltec were the originators of all civilization, so Toltec was synonymous with artist, or artisan, and their city &quot;Tollan&quot; was described as full of wonders.  When the Aztecs rewrote their history, they tried to show they were related to the Toltecs. Unfortunately this means that much of the tradition of the Toltecs is legend, and difficult to prove. Stories say that after the fall of Tula some of the Toltec retreated to Cholula, which did not fall until centuries later when it was burned by Hern�n Cort�s and the Spanish conquistadores.

We know very little of the Toltec rulers.  They were believed to by god-like, and depending on which account of Toltec history you read, they are portrayed as more god-like or more human.  In keeping with this theme, many took the names of their patron dieties and the stories of their lives mirror the lives of their namesakes.  Some of the Toltec rulers are said to have included:

* Chalchiuh Tlatonac &amp;ndash; first Toltec king, founder of Tula
* Mixcoatl or Mixcoatl Totepeuh
* Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl, son of Mixcoatl, the most famous Toltec ruler
* Huemac &amp;ndash; the last Toltec king, died in exile c. 1100 (?), some 6 years after the fall of Tula

'''Tula'''

In  1941, the ''Sociedad Mexicana de Antropolog�a'' confirmed that Tula was the capital of the Toltec, as had long been tradition and suggested by archeologists since the 19th century.  Some scholars, including [[Laurette S�journ�]], regret the decision, claiming that several seasons of excavation only revealed a minor city, not enough to justify the legend of the Toltecs. The site of Tula actually shows it to have been a large city in its prime, although the ceremonial art and architecture visible there today is less impressive than that at other Mesoamerican sites.  It should be understood, however, that some chronicles from the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores and later confuse the Toltec with other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations and sometimes tend to attribute all achievements of the centuries before the rise of the Aztec to the Toltec.

'''Toltec Influence on Modern Culture'''

During the late twentieth century, some Mexican shamans, including Don Miguel Ruiz, who claim to be descendants of the Toltec and inheritors of their spiritual powers, began writing and teaching for a worldwide audience, causing a renewed interest in the Toltec. Another such author is Victor Sanchez who was inspired by the writings of Carlos Castaneda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nouns == 
A noun is the part of speech that can fit into specific morphological and syntactic frames: A noun takes inflection suffixes for plural, singular possessive and plural possessive cases (-s;-'s;-s'). A noun appears after a determiner. Nouns refer to persons, places, things, states, or qualities. 

Nouns appear:
after adjectives,
after articles,
as a subject of a sentence,
as an object of a preposition,
as a direct object of a transitive verb, and
as an indirect object of transitive verb.

There are different kinds of nouns in terms of their grammatical function. These can be classified into different categories: 

''Count nouns'' refers to discrete number of things that are countable. They can take the plural forms and can be preceded by articles. Examples: book, house, car.

''Non count'' also known as ''mass noun'' and refers to things and objects that are indiscreet. Examples: rice, oil, weather.           

''Common nouns'' are any person, place, or thing. Common nouns are not capitalized. Examples: a city, the policeman, that desk.

''Proper nouns'' are the name of a specific person, place or thing.  Proper nouns are capitalized. Personal names are the best examples of proper nouns. Examples: Nicolas, Idaho, Daily News.

''Collective nouns'' are used to name groups. Even when a collective noun is in the singular form, it can be used to refer to a group. Example: team, herd, jury

''Concrete nouns'' words that represent objects one can see, hear, touch, smell or taste.
''Abstract nouns'' are anything one cannot see, hear touch, smell or taste.
   

 
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of nouns are: Tom, table, classroom, desk, bottle, door, conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

===Determiners===
Determiners are used as modifiers of a noun phrase or words that occur before a noun. Determiners can be classified as articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, possessive noun and possessive pronouns.

Determiners form a closed class of words that number (exclusive of ordinals) about 50 in English and include: the teacher, a college, a bit of honey, that person, those people, whatever purpose, either way, your choice.

Articles: a, an, the.

Demonstratives: this, that, these, those, which, etc. (when used with noun phrases). 

Possessives: my, our, your, her, his, its, their, whose, and possessive nouns (John's, the teacher's). 

Quantifiers: all, few, many, several, some, every, each, any, no etc. 

Cardinal Numbers: one, two, fifty, etc. 

Ordinals: first, second, last, next, etc.

===Articles===
There is also a special class of determiners called articles.  These are the words &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; and sometimes proceed nouns or other words that come before a noun. 

A Definite Article (English the) is used before singular and plural nouns that refer to a particular member of a group. (The cat on the mat is black.) 
 
An Indefinite Article (English a, an) is used before singular nouns that refer to any member of a group. (A cat is a mammal.) 
 
A Partitive Article indicates an indefinite quantity of a mass noun; there is no partitive article in English, though the words some or any often have that function. An example is French du / de la / des, as in Voulez-vous du café ? (&quot;Do you want some coffee?&quot; or &quot;Do you want coffee?&quot;) 
 
A Zero Article is the absence of an article (e.g. English indefinite plural), used in some languages in contrast with the presence of one. Linguists hypothesize the absence as a zero article based on the X-bar theory. 

The words &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; are called indefinite articles, because they do not identify a particular person, place, or thing.  &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; is called a definite article, because it does specify a particular person, place, or thing.

===Using &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;===
Determining which word to use, either &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;, is based on the first sound of the word that follows it.  When a word starts with a consonant '''sound''', use &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; before it.  When the word begins with a vowel '''sound''', use &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; before it. Be careful, sometimes the first letter of the word is not the first sound of the word (see ''hour'' and ''unicorn'' below).
*&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; show
**&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; amazing show
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; octopus
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; huge octopus
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; hour
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; house
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; apple
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; red apple
*&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; unicorn
**&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; angry unicorn

===Singular and Plural===
In order to show whether a noun is singular or plural, change the noun's spelling. A noun will take the plural inflection '-s' for most words in English. But, there might be irregular plural nouns as well. Some of the examples of irregular nouns are given below:
*boy/boys
*child/children
*woman/women
*man/men
*syllabus/syllabi
*ox/oxen
*deer/deer
If you are unsure how to change a word into the plural form, check your dictionary.

===Possession===
Nouns also undergo a morphological change to express possession (ownership) by using an apostrophe followed by the letter &quot;s&quot; ('s). This can denote 'singular' or 'plural' possessive. Possession is having some degree of control over something else. Generally, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply ownership). Like ownership, the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law. Languages have several means to indicate possession.

'''
EXAMPLES:'''
*girl/girl's   (singular)
*children/children's (plural)
*man/man's (singular)
*woman/woman's (singular)

---If a singular noun does not end in s, add 's

The delivery boy's truck was blocking the driveway.

Bob Dole's concession speech was stoic and dignified. 

The student's attempts to solve the problem were rewarded.


---If a singular common noun ends in s, add 's—unless the next word begins with s. If the next word begins with s, add an apostrophe only. (This includes words with s and sh sounds.)

The boss's temper was legendary among his employees.

The boss' sister was even meaner.

The witness's version of the story has several inconsistencies.

The witness' story did not match the events recorded on tape.


---If a singular proper noun ends in s, add an apostrophe.

Chris' exam scores were higher than any other students.
--Usually singular proper nouns will be names like Chris, and Alyssa.

== Pronouns ==

A pronoun is a word that often replaces a noun phrase, other pronouns, or other words functioning as a noun in a sentence. The word or group of words that a pronoun replaces or refers to is called the antecedent of the pronoun

Example #1 The dog is old. ''It'' walks slowly.
In this sentence, the word ''it'' replaces ''the dog''.

Example #2 Wow, that boy can throw a football. ''He'' must have thrown it 60 yards.
In this sentence, the word ''he'' replaces ''that boy''.


There are several types of pronouns: personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, intensive and reflexive pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns and indefinite pronouns.

'''Personal Pronouns''' are those that refer to specific people or things.  Examples: I, he, she, we, us, they.
  After they finished shopping ''they'' put the groceries in the trunk. 

'''Possessive Pronouns''' indicate ownership.  Examples: My, mine, your, our, theirs.
   My brother bought ''his'' car.

'''Intensive and Reflexive Pronouns'''
Intensive pronouns emphasize a noun or another pronoun. 
  The President ''himself'' called to congratulate me.

Reflexive pronouns look the same as intensive pronouns but serve a different function.  They name a receiver of an action.  
  We shopped ''ourselves'' to death.

'''Relative Pronouns''' introduce subordinate clauses and function as adjectives.  
  The man ''who'' yelled at us to get off his lawn did not even own the property!

'''Interrogative Pronouns''' introduce questions.  
 ''Who'' was that? ''Who'' will help me? ''Which'' do you prefer?) 

'''Demonstrative Pronouns''' point out specific persons, places, things or ideas such as  that, those, this, these. 
 ''This'' is my dog.

'''Indefinite Pronouns''' refer to non-specific people or things.  Examples: All, both, any, few, everyone, each, nobody, some, several, neither.

  ''Several'' people cheered after the solo. 

Pronouns most often replace a noun but can sometimes function as a determiner.  These are called pronoun/determiners because they are in the form of a pronoun but function as an determiner.  

 ''This'' material was new to me.  ''This'' functions as a pronoun/adjective.


'''Pronoun Problems'''

Pronouns can cause many problems for writers.  Here are some tips to help you.

- Make sure the pronoun and its antecedent (the noun or pronoun to which the pronoun refers) agree.  They must both be singular or plural.

Examples: My ''dog'' finished her ''food''.  (Both are singular)
The ''dogs'' fought for ''their'' food.  (Both are plural)


-Collective nouns should be used as singular unless they are obviously plural.

Example:  The ''jury'' gave ''its'' verdict. 


-Compound antecedents connected by ''and'' should be used as plural.

Example: ''Jack and Jill'' ''are'' getting married. 

-Some antecedents that are indefinite and morphologically singular (''anyone'', ''each'', ''everyone'', ''nobody'', ''somebody'') can take ''they''.

Examples: 
And everyone to rest themselves betake - Shakespeare, ''The Rape of Lucrece,'' 1549
I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly - Jane Austen, ''Mansfield Park,'' 1814
... the detachment and sympathy of someone approaching their own death - Alan Moorehead, ''The Blue Nile,'' 1962

-Make sure the antecedent is clear.  

Example: When she set the picture on the glass table, ''it'' broke.  

By using ''it'' after two nouns, the reference is unclear.  Which item broke?  The picture or the table?  When reading your writing, ask yourself these questions.  If you are unclear as to which noun is the antecedent, it will be unclear for the reader as well. 


-Deciding whether to use we or us

If you are unsure as to which pronoun to use, try omitting the antecedent.

Example: ''We/Us'' workers would like to have more breaks.  It makes much mores sense to say ''We would'' instead of ''Us would''.

== Verbs ==
A verb is the main word in the predicate of a sentence. It expresses an action, describes an occurrence, or establishes a state of being.  Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice.  It may also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject object, etc.)

'''an action would be''': Josh &lt;i&gt;threw&lt;/i&gt; the ball.&lt;br&gt;      Jason &lt;i&gt;kicked&lt;/i&gt; the football.

'''an occurrence would be''': a hush &lt;i&gt;descended&lt;/i&gt; on the crowd.&lt;br&gt;      a feeling &lt;i&gt;warmed&lt;/i&gt; his heart.

'''a state of being would be''': Jill &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; serious.&lt;br&gt;         The house &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; on the hill.

===Principal Parts===
The principal parts of verbs are the different forms that verbs take depending on how they are used in a sentence. For example, take the verb escape.

'''base form''': to escape&lt;br&gt;
'''past tense''': escaped&lt;br&gt;
'''present participle''': am escaping&lt;br&gt;
'''past participle''': escaped&lt;br&gt;

===Subject-Verb Agreement===
Verbs need to agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural) and in person (first, second, or third). Find the verb and ask &quot;who or what&quot; is doing the action of that verb. 

To make verbs agree with compound subjects, follow this example:

A pencil, a backpack, and a notebook '''was''' issued to each student.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

A pencil, a backpack, and a notebook '''were''' issued to each student.


----

Verbs will never agree with nouns that are in prepositional phrases. To make verbs agree with their subjects, follow this example:

The direction of the three plays '''are''' the topic of my talk.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

The direction of the three plays '''is''' the topic of my talk.

The subject of my talk is ''direction,'' not ''plays''.


----

In the English language, verbs usually follow subjects. But when this order is reversed, the writer must make the verb agree with the subject, not with a noun that happens to precede it. For example:

Beside the house '''stands''' sheds filled with tools.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

Beside the house '''stand''' sheds filled with tools.

Because the subject is ''sheds''; it is plural, so the verb must be ''stand''.

'''===Verb Tenses==='''

Tenses in a verb help to show when the action expressed by a verb takes place. The three simple tenses are the present tense, past tense, and future tense. Verbs also take ''aspect.'' Aspect refers to progression or completion of an action. The 'aspect' affixes are denoted by '-en' and '-ing,'which forms non finite participle forms.
'''
---Present Tense'''
Present tense expresses an unchanging, repeated, or reoccurring action or situation that exists only now. It can also represent a widespread truth.

  Examples: The mountains are tall and white. Unchanging action 
  Every year, the school council elects new members.  Recurring action 
  Pb is the chemical symbol for lead.  Widespread truth 

'''---Past Tense'''
Past tense expresses an action or situation that was started and finished in the past. Most past tense verbs end in -ed. The irregular verbs have special past tense forms which must be memorized.

  Examples: W.W.II ended in 1945.  Regular -ed past 
  Ernest Hemingway wrote &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; Irregular form 

'''---Future Tense'''
Future tense expresses an action or situation that will occur in the future. This tense is formed by using will/shall with the simple form of the verb.

  Examples: The speaker of the House will finish her term in May of 2012.
  The future tense can also be expressed by using am, is, or are with going to.
  The surgeon is going to perform the first bypass in Minnesota.
  We can also use the present tense form with an adverb or adverbial phrase to show future time.
  The president speaks tomorrow. (Tomorrow is a future time adverb.)

'''---Aspect:''' Refers to the nature of the action described by the verb. There are three aspects: indefinite (or simple), complete (or perfect), continuing (or progressive).

The three indefinite tenses, or simple tenses, describe an action but do not state whether the action is finished:

the simple past (&quot;I went&quot;) 
the simple present (&quot;I go&quot;) 
the simple future (&quot;I will go&quot;) 

             '''Progressive''': He is ''reading'' a book
             '''Perfect'''    : Mary has taken her work seriously

The simple tenses locate an action only within the three basic time frames that we've recognized, present, past, and future. There are also three complex aspects of time that can be expressed:
    Progressive forms: express ''continuing'' actions. 
    Perfect forms: express actions ''completed before'' 
        another action or time in the present, past, or future
    Perfect progressive forms: express actions that 
        ''continue up to some point'' in the present, past or future.

'''===Transitive and Intransitive Verbs==='''
Transitive verbs help to carry out the action of a specific subject, and are followed by a noun phrase. A transitive verb must be followed by a direct object.

 
      For Example:
            He          ran              to school.
          (Subject) (did something)    (object-where?)
            She cuts her hair every month.
            The dog runs around the tree.

Intransitive verbs do not take any object, but they do express the actions that don't require the subject to do something to something else. The intransitive verbs can stand alone in a sentence.

     For Example:
            Katie ran.
              -The intransitive verb ''ran'' is a complete
               action by itself and doesn't need an object
               to complete the action.
            Jack fell on the steps in the entryway.
'''
===Linking Verbs==='''
Linking Verbs link the relationship between the subject 
and the rest of the sentence. This type of verb explains the 
connection between the subject and it's complement. 

The most common linking verb is &quot;to be.&quot; The ''linking verb'' forms the main verb in a sentence and is also known as the copula.

  Example: The tea is hot.
           There are many books on the shelf.
In the above sentences, ''is'' and ''are'' serve as the linking verbs as well as the main verbs in the sentences.

             Common Linking Verbs:
                appear            become
                seem              taste 
                continue          remain

A ''true'' linking verbs are any form of be {am, is, as, were, are being, might, etc.} The true linking verbs act as the main verb in a sentence.

example: The work was very tiring.

In this sentence, ''was'' function as the linking verb which is also the main verb in the sentence. This type of sentences cannot be transformed into passive sentences because the verbs do not have a direct object (non-transitive verbs).

In your writing you can also input verbs with multiple personalities.
such as appear, feel, remain, smell.

==  Adjectives == 
Adjectives modify or limit the meaning of nouns or pronouns, usually by describing, quantifying, or identifying those words and is often described as determiners. An adjective answers the question ''what kind'', ''which one'', ''how many'' or ''how much''. 

A ''describing'' adjective would be... Josh threw the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; ball.&lt;br&gt;
A ''quantifying'' adjective would be... We caught &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; sunfish last weekend.&lt;br&gt;
A ''identifying'' adjective would be... Carol tried hard to win &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; race.&lt;br&gt;

The most widely recognized adjectives are those words, such as big, old, and tired that actually describe people, places, or things. These words can themselves be modified with adverbs, as in the phrase very big.

&lt;br&gt;
Besides being used to modify a meaning, adjectives can be used to compare items.

a comparative adjective would be: This year's graduating class was 
&lt;i&gt;smaller&lt;/i&gt; than last year's class. &lt;br&gt;
another comparative adjective would be: This year's offensive line 
was the &lt;i&gt;smallest&lt;/i&gt; in the past few decades. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Finally, adjectives can be pronouns.  Pronouns used as adjectives usually show ownership.

A pronoun used as an adjective would be: Shelia bought &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; first car yesterday.
Another pronoun used as an adjective would be: The Smith's saw ''their'' dreams crumble when they were denied a mortgage.

==  Adjectival Phrase  ==
An adjectival phrase is a phrase with an adjective as its head (e.g. full of toys). In English, an adjectival phrase may occur as a post-modifier to a noun (a bin full of toys), or as a predicate to a verb (the bin is full of toys and clothes).

==  Adverbs ==
Adverbs are modifiers or descriptive words, phrases, or clauses that bring detail to your sentences. An adverb answers the question ''where'', ''when'', ''how'' or ''to what extent''. They modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire clauses. Once you figure out what word you want to modify, you are able to choose which modifier you need. Many adverbs end in -ly except for always, never, very and well. The most commonly used adverb is ''not''.

===Difference between adverbs and adjectives===
Adjectives and adverbs answer different questions.
An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun and answers these questions:
*Which: the latest magazine arrived.
*What kind: a huge difference remained.
*How many: the three books were different.

An adverb modifies a verb an answers these questions:
*When: tomorrow, the storm will quit.
*How often: students change majors frequently.
*Where: the class is held here today.

When choosing between an adjective and adverb, determine the word being modified and then figure out its part of speech.

===Forming adverbs===
Often adverbs are formed from adjectives, but some are not derived from other words such as again, almost, always, never, here, there, now, often, seldom, well.  The adverbs that are derived from adjectives can be formed by adding the suffix -ly to the ending.
*beautifully
*strangely
*cleverly
*respectfully

Remember that an -ly does not make the word an adverb.  Some adjectives also end in -ly such as friendly and lovely.

===Placement===
The location of the adverb in a sentence can change the rhythm and emphasis dramatically.
*Formerly, Star Wars was just three movies.
*Star Wars was formerly just three movies.

== Conjunctions ==
con‧junc‧tion Pronunciation Key -[kuhn-juhngk-shuhn]

Conjunctions join words, phrases or clauses within a sentence.  They illustrate a relationship between the elements that are being joined.  

'''Coordinating Conjunctions''' ''for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so'' are coordinating conjunctions. These are conjunctions of two grammatically equal elements such as two nouns or two clauses.  This can also be remembered through the acronym FANBOYS.

Example: I like apples ''and'' oranges.


'''Correlative Conjunctions''' come in pairs such as ''either...or'', ''neither...nor'', ''not only...but also''. These conjunctions also connect two equal grammatical elements. 

Example: I will have ''either'' pasta ''or'' pizza for dinner.  


'''Subordinating Conjunctions'''  ''After, although, as if, because, even though, once, in order that, and rather than'' are some common subordinating conjunctions.  These are conjunctions that introduce a subordinate clause and illustrate a relationship with the rest of the sentence.

Example: Although I would rather party tonight, I will go to the library instead.


'''Conjunctive Adverbs''' are used to show a relationship between two independent clauses (complete sentences). Some examples are ''accordingly'', ''furthermore'', ''therefore'', ''however''. 

Example: I always brush my teeth''; therefore,'' I have no cavities.

== Prepositions ==

Prepositions are words that come before a noun or pronoun that form a phrase that modifies another phrase within the sentence.  This phrase, the prepositional phrase, usually functions as an adjective or adverb and often indicates a position or place.  

'''Some examples of prepositions:'''

about, above, after, along, among, as, before, behind, below, beside, between, by, despite, during, for, in, into, like, of, onto, opposite, over, past, regarding, since, and with.

Example: He brought his furniture into the apartment.

'''Some common compound prepositions:'''

according to, except for, in front of, next to, as well as, instead of, due to, in spite of, because of, and with regard to

'''Prepositional Phrases''' begin with a preposition and most often end with a noun.  The noun is known as the object of the preposition.  There are several different types of prepositional phrases classified by the type of word it modifies.  


'''Adjective prepositional phrases''' most often modify the noun directly before the prepositional phrase.  These usually answer the questions ''which one?'' or ''what kind of?''.
  
Example:  The thoughts of the professor were closed minded.  ''of the professor'' is the prepositional phrase which modifies ''thoughts''.  What kind of thoughts?  Those of the professor.  


'''Adverbial prepositional phrases''' modify a verb within the sentence.  These usually answer the questions ''When? Where? How? Why? Under what conditions?''  and ''To what degree?''  

Example:  You cannot judge a book ''by its cover''.   The prepositional phrase, by its cover, modifies the verb ''judge''.  How can you not judge a book?  By its cover.

== Interjections == 
inter·jection 
---The word &quot;interjection&quot; literally means &quot;thrown in between&quot; from the Latin inter (&quot;between&quot;) and iacere (&quot;throw&quot;).

The part of speech that usually expresses emotion and is capable of standing alone. This uses an exclamation marker (!), also known as the exclamation point. Even when interjections are a part of a sentence, they don't directly relate to the grammar of that sentence. Interjections take on more than one of the following usages:

-sudden outburst
-a form of salutation
-to emphasize in the imperative mood

Words belonging to this part of speech, such as:
            Ugh! or Wow! Oh! Hey! Ow!


[[Category:Rhetoric and Composition]]

== Active vs. Passive Voice ==

A shift between active voice and passive voice is confusing to readers and
should be avoided at all times. If you do shift voice, justify it and have 
a reason for it. 

Voice refers to the verb's ability to show whether a subject receives or acts 
the action received by the verb. When using the active voice, the subject 
performs the action. 

  For Example:
     The boy ran straight home at dinner time
        &lt;The boy---the subject, did the action----he ran.

In writing, active voice is more dramatic and often users fewer words than
passive voice in English.  There will be introduced more in the &quot;active and passive&quot; section later.

==Types of Sentences==

In English there are three main types of sentences. They function according to the usage and pragmatics. They are also referred to as moods, in English. The fourth type of sentence might be termed as ''interrogative.''

&lt;b&gt;Indicative&lt;b&gt;  The indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood use the indicative. It is the most commonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: &quot;Paul is reading books.&quot; or &quot;Paul reads books.&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Imperative&lt;b&gt;  The imperative mood expresses commands, direct requests, and prohibitions. In many circumstances, directly using the imperative mood seems blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: &quot;Read that book, Paul!&quot;
 
&lt;b&gt;Subjunctive&lt;b&gt;  The subjunctive mood has several uses in independent clauses. Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). Example: &quot; God bless America.&quot;

==Tag Question==
 A type of question where a pronoun is attached to the end of the declarative clause, where the pronoun agrees with number and gender of the subject in the declarative clause. 

Tag questions are used for the purpose of emphasis. 

'''When using tag questions there are four things to watch for:'''

'''1.''' What kind of verb is it?

'''2.''' What tense is the verb?

'''3.''' Is the sentence affirmative or negative?

'''4.''' Do you change the pronoun?

'''Some additional things to look for when using tag verbs are:'''

'''~'''Copy the auxiliary after the end of the declarative clause

'''~'''Insert a &quot;do&quot; support where the auxiliary is missing (Note that the &quot;do&quot; support agrees in number and tense.)

'''~'''If the declarative clause is negative, then the tag should be positive.

'''~'''If the declarative clause is positive, then the tag should be negative.


   For Example:
      ~   '''We are meeting at 7 o'clock, aren't we?'''         
         The tag question would be &quot;aren't we&quot; to make an emphasis on the first part of the sentence.
      ~   '''He won't drive in the storm, will he? '''
         The tag question in this example is &quot;will he&quot;

==Wh-Question==

There can be nine types of Wh questions based on the sentence structure.The &quot;Wh&quot; words that forms the questions are:

Who (or Whom) ?-----Person

What?--------------Object/Idea/Action

Whose?-------------Possession

Which?-------------Specific subject

When?--------------Time

Where?-------------Place

Why?---------------Reason

How?---------------Manner


The Wh word can function as the subject, object or possessive determiner of the interrogative clause.

  For example: 
   Who gave John permission to watch movies? (subject) 
   From whom did John get permission to watch movies? (object)
   Whose book did John read yesterday? (possessive determiner)

'''There are few generalizations which can be noted here:'''

#If the 'Wh' is the subject then the structure of the sentence remains intact
#If the 'Wh' is not the subject then auxiliary inversion is required to form the question

'''To form questions with 'Wh' word?'''

#Begin with the 'Wh' word
#If the 'Wh' word is the subject then no change in the structure is required
#If 'Wh' word is not the subject then subject-auxiliary inversion is required
#If the auxiliary is missing, then appropriate &quot;do&quot; support is to be added to form the question
#The &quot;do&quot; support should match in tense and number and it will change the verb to bare infinitive.


The grammar used with 'Wh' questions depends on if the topic being asked about is the ''subject'' or ''predicate'' of a sentence. When using the subject pattern, you will need to input the person or thing being asked about with the appropriate 'Wh' word for that sentence.

  For example:
 '''Jack is playing with Jill'''
 a. Who is playing with Jill? ('Wh' word is the subject -- somebody is doing the action of playing)
 b. To whom is Jack playing music? ('Wh' word is the object -- somebody is receiving the action of Jack's playing)

==Clauses==

A clause is a group of words with a subject and a predicate. A sentence containing a single clause is called '''uniclausal''' and a sentence with more than one clause is called '''multiclausal.''' Clauses having one finite verb, as in '''uniclausal''' or minimum of one finite verb construction in a '''multiclausal''' structure is called '''finite clauses.''' A clause having a non-finite verb is called a '''non finite clause'''.

An '''independent clause''' is part of sentence that can function as a stand-alone structure. A '''dependent clause''' on the other hand cannot function by itself and needs an independent clause to complete its meaning.

A third type of clause is known as '''matrix clause''', which function as an independent clause but requires a complement clause to complete the meaning.


'''Subordinate Clause'''

Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent clauses. They begin with a subordinate conjunction or a relative pronoun and contain both a subject and a verb. Some common subordinate conjunctions are: although, since, before, because, after, if, whenever, which, and when. 
example: Although it was dark outside, Jill went to play basketball.

'''Relative Clause'''

A relative clause functions as a modifier and works as an adjective. It has four main features:

  1. contains a subject and a verb
  2. begins with a relative pronoun-who, whom, that, 
     which, whose or a relative adverb-why, when, where
  3. functions as an adjective
  4. can be restrictive or non-restrictive

Example of a restrictive relative clause:
Participants in this marathon who are high school students need to bring permission slips signed by their parents.

Example of non-restrictive relative clause:
Participants in this marathon, who come from all over the city, must sign in by 8AM.
  
1.A restrictive relative clause would change the meaning if deleted, so commas aren't needed. (In the example above, the clause restricts the people who need to bring permission slips to only the high school students.)

2.A non-restrictive relative clause is just extra information about the subject and may be omitted without changing the meaning.

'''Complement Clause'''

A complement clause is a notional sentence or predication that's an 
argument of a predicate

example: I know that it is raining hard.

There are three types of complement clauses: ordinary, noun, and adjective

'''Noun Clauses'''

Noun clauses can function as a subject, subject complements, objects of prepositions, or direct objects. So a noun clause cannot stand apart but is always contained within a clause.  A few examples of noun clauses that usually will begin with a relative pronoun are: that, whomever, whose, which, and whoever. Here the construction of the clause occurs directly after the noun phrase.

    For Example:
  He asked ''when she went to the library.''
  The italicized section is an example of a direct object function.

  He was looking for ''whichever car was the best find.'' 
  In this example, the section in italics is an object of a preposition.

For instance, in the first example for the independent clause isn't just ''he asked'' but ''he asked when she went to the library.''
      

'''Adjective Clauses'''

Adjective clauses modify nouns and pronouns in other clauses. 

A adjective clause always begins with a relative pronoun (that, who, whom, whose, which) or a relative adverb (where, when, why). 

     For Example:
   The test, ''which took an hour'', earned me an A for the class. 
   Have you seen the desk ''where Kelsi sat''?
   -The parts in italics are the adjective clauses for the nouns ''test'' and ''desk.''

'''Adverb Clauses'''

Adverb clauses modify a verb, an adjective or an adverb. 

Adverb clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions: when, because, than, where, before, after

     For Example:
   Hitchcock paved the way for directors ''when he created a new filmmaking style.''
  (when... modifies the verb)   
   Hitchcock was important ''because he proved that horror doesn't need gore.'' 
  (because...  modifies the adjective)
   
   

'''Ordinary Clauses'''

An ordinary clause functions like a complement clause using ''that'' as the most common word to form the structure.
For example: ''That the earth is flat'' was a common misperception.

The italicized portion suggests an ordinary complement clause in the subject position.

==Partitive==

Partitive construction helps to modify count and non-count nouns.It denotes a part of a whole. The partitive noun phrase agrees in number and tense according to its appearance in the subject place.It takes the following structure:

NP (count)+of+ NP.

example: ''A pair of shoes'' is what I need. (the partitive is in italics)
          ''A lot of work'' is required before this project is over. (the partitive is in
           italics)

==Collective==

This is a usage which is based on the semantic and pragmatic use of the language. A variation could be noted in Standard American English (SAE) and British English (BE).

examples: The home team has routed the visitors. (SAE)
          The home team have routed the visitors. (BE)

===Phrasal Verb===

A ''phrasal verb'' is a phrase construction which is made up of a verb and an adverbial particle or a preposition. It is also understood as an idiomatic construction where the meaning is different from the sum of its parts. It can be either '''prepositional''' (non separable) or '''particle verbs''' (separable).

prepositional: The parents ''called on'' the teacher.

particle verb: He ''looked'' the number ''up.''</text>

I've taken the contents from the BeOS manual. I'll chop and change it when I get some time. Anyone got any suggestions?

== Looks good ==

Well,  I think it's good enough for those willing to start working on. Especially the beginning part that covers running Haiku on virtual machines.

== Introduction ==

I took the liberty to write a draft of the introduction. Excuse me the obvious Haiku love that's shining through the text, though. :)
--[[User:W-ber|W-ber]] 18:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

You know, I'd very much like to spend more time on this collaboration project. The ideal setup for me would be that the infamous Someone Else outlined what each chapter should contain (more than just titles), collected the facts, and then either listed them or wrote a draft text. I could then edit, extend, provide examples, screenshots, and other stuff. I don't live and breath in the BeOS land, sadly, so I don't feel confident enough in teaching others how to do things.
--[[User:W-ber|W-ber]] 18:53, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Sorry about not being around - my interest in Linux was restored :) Anyone who wants to take the book over may.

The table of contents are based on the ([http://www.tunetrackersystems.com/bedocs/documentation/User's%20Guide/ BeOS 5 User's Manual]), so that should give you an idea of what each chapter was to contain.

Again, I'm sorry that I won't be around anymore, but since I'm not very experienced with BeOS/Haiku it shouldn't be too much of a problem for you.

--[[User:Gwyatg|Gwyatg]] 08:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

I don't know if this will ever be official, but I needed an easy way to add documentation as I was able to, so count me in. I will add things as I am able and have time - good documentation is a must for Haiku.
[[User:Darkwyrm|Darkwyrm]] 01:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I'm planning to work on this too. I've fleshed out the section on the Deskbar a little and plan to dig into the rest of it as time permits. Also, any objections/suggestions around moving this over to the official Haiku wiki? I think they use the same license (GFDL) and it might attract some more interest over there, which would be nice considering it's quite a big task. --[[User:Hn|Hn]] 11:24, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==
Group theory is one of the most important mathematical theories today. ''...more motivation to come''

Let ''p'' be a prime then the multiplicative group mod ''p'' is the set of numbers {1, 2, .., ''p'' - 1}. As the name suggests, in a mod ''p'' group, multiplication is the main and only concern. Notice that in the multiplicative group of order ''p'' - 1, every element has an inverse. This is a key requirement for a group. In general group theory, for ''G'' to be a group, it must 
# be made up of a set of ''things''
#* in this case the numbers 1 to ''p'' - 1,
# have a binary operation 
#* in this case ''multiplication'',
# be closed under the operation, i.e. if ''a'' and ''b'' are ''things'' belonging to the group then ''ab'' must also belong to the group
#* this is definitely satisfied in modulo ''p'' arithmetic 
# have an identity
#* in this case the number 1
# every element has an inverse under the operation
#* in mod ''p'' since we have excluded 0 from the group this is satisfied.

Basically a group needs to have a 1 and every other element must have an inverse. In modular arithmetic, a group is very special because it is also ''commutative'' (''ab'' = ''ba'') where as for a general group, commutativity is not required. A commutative group is called an ''abelian group'', named after the Norwegian mathematician, [[w:Abel|Abel]].

On a side note, multiplicative groups modulo ''p'' have a finite number of elements. In general group theory, a group can have infinitely many elements.

== The discrete log problem ==
Recall the ''log'' function defined in real numbers. Let ''b&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' = y, taking the ''log'' to be base ''b'' we get ''x'' = log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), so given ''b'' and ''y'' we can solve for ''x''. But in modular arithmetics the same problem can be quite hard to solve.

Take for example, we know that 5&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 172 (mod 263) for some ''x''. Finding the ''x'' is not easy. The most simple way seems to be trying ''x'' = 2, 3, ... and so on. In fact for ''p'' a prime, and if given ''a&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;equiv; ''b'', finding ''x'' is the so called discrete log problem and there is no known efficient way for solving it.

Lack of efficient algorithm is not the only problem though. Consider 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 7), there is no solution! ''...more to come''

We will present a quite powerful way for solving the discrete log problem a little later in the chapter, called the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm. It works by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and breaking the problem into components. At this moment though we should try to gain some sense of just how difficult the discrete log problem is.

=== Exercises ===
1. Find ''x'' such that 3&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 7)

2. Find ''x'' such that 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 48 (mod 61)

3. Find ''x'' such that 5&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 172 (mod 263)

== Order ==
The ''order'' of a group refers to the number of element in the group. E.g. the multiplicative group mod 17 has order 16. For a start we should only consider multiplicatives group mod a prime ''p'', so a group has order ''p'' - 1. If ''G'' is a group then we denote the order of the group by |''G''|.

The ''order'' of an element, ''g'', in a group ''G'' refers to the smallest number ''k'' &amp;ne; 0 such that ''g&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;equiv; 1. We denote the order of ''g'' by |''g''|, so ''g''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1. There are two very important and fundamental theorems we want to discuss. The first we have met a number of times already. It states that
:If ''G'' is a (finite) group and ''g'' is an element of the group, then
::&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} = 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of the theorem is similar to that of the FLT. Let ''a'' be an element of ''G'' and let the ''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s be the elements of ''G''. Let's consider,
:&lt;math&gt;a, ag_1, ag_2, ag_3, ... , ag_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
there are |''G''| elements above, and they must all be different. To see this let's suppose the opposite, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;g_i \ne g_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
but
&lt;math&gt;ag_i \equiv ag_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
then since ''a'' belongs to a group, there must exist ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, multiply both sides by the inverse of ''a'' we get
&lt;math&gt;g_i \equiv g_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is a contradiction.

Therefore, we can say the above list is just the |''G''| elements of ''G'' in a different order, we get
:&lt;math&gt;a(ag_1)(ag_2)(ag_3)\cdots (ag_{|G| - 1}) \equiv g_1g_2\cdots g_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
to save some writing, let's say
:&lt;math&gt;s \equiv g_1g_2\cdots g_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so we have
:&lt;math&gt;a^{|G|}s \equiv s \!&lt;/math&gt;
but ''s'' belong to the group therefore ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; exists, and we get
:&lt;math&gt;a^{|G|} \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

''The reader should be persuaded to compute the order of every element in mod 17.'' If that is done it should be noted that the order of every element divides 16, the order of the group. This fact is generally true and is known as the Lagrange's Theorem.

=== Lagrange's Theorem ===
 Let ''G'' be a (finite) group, and let ''g'' be an element of the group.
 The order of ''g'' must divide the order of the group ''G''. More symbolically, |g| divides |G|.

We will give a proof of the above, but the reader should try and come up with their own justifications.

''' Proof '''&lt;br/&gt;
Let ''g'' be an element of ''G''. We know that
:&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
Let's compute the remainder of |''G''| divided by |''g''|, i.e. we find ''r'' &lt; |''g''| and ''q'' such that |''G''| = ''q''|''g''| + ''r''. So we have
:&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} = g^{|g|q + r} \equiv (g^{|g|})^qg^r \equiv g^r \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
but ''r'' is smaller then the order of ''g'', so  ''r'' = 0. Therefore we have q|''g''| = |''G''|, and so the order of ''g'' divides the order ''G''.

''' Summary '''
 Let ''G'' be a group and ''g'' be an element of the group, then
 1. ''g''&lt;sup&gt;|''G''|&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, and
 2. |g| divides |G|

=== Exercises ===
1. Compute the order of all the elements mod 47.

2. Compute the order of all the elements mod 137.

3. The number 3 has order 16 mod 17. Find all the other elements in mod 17 with order 16.

== Generator ==
We have shown that in mod 17, the number 3 has order 16. This is actually very interesting, because it says that every element in the mod 17 group can be expressed as a power of 3, as can be confirmed below
:&lt;math&gt;3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^1 \equiv 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 9&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^3 \equiv 27 \equiv 10&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^4 \equiv 30 \equiv 13 \equiv -4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^5 \equiv -12 \equiv 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^6 \equiv 15 \equiv -2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^7 \equiv -6 \equiv 11&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^8 \equiv 33 \equiv 16 \equiv -1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^9 \equiv -3 \equiv 14&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{10} \equiv -9 \equiv 8&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{11} \equiv 24 \equiv 7&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{12} \equiv 21 \equiv 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{13} \equiv 12 \equiv -5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{14} \equiv -15 \equiv 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{15} \equiv 6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{16} \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is so that every other element in ''G'' can be expressed as a power of ''g'' then ''g'' is called the generator of ''G'', in the sense that ''g'' can be used to generate every other element. In other books, ''g'' may also be called a ''primitive element''.

It is a remarkable fact that if ''p'' is a prime then the multiplicative group mod ''p'' has a generator. A proof will be given later. For now let's discuss the implications of this fact. For a start, if ''g'' is a generator, then it makes sense to talk about ''log to the base g'', which in number theory is called the ''index'' to base g, because every element ''h'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, so ind&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(''h'') = ''x''. Therefore if we are given
:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv k^x \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some unknown ''x'', we take the index of both sides
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind_g}(h) = x\ \operatorname{ind_g}(k) \!&lt;/math&gt;
make ''x'' the subject, we get
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\operatorname{ind_g}(k)}{\operatorname{ind_g}(h)} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we have essentially converted a general discrete log problem to a discrete log problem to the base ''g'', where ''g'' is a generator. Therefore, if we can solve the discrete log problem to a base ''g'', then we have solved every discrete log problem.

But solving the discrete log problem to a base ''g'' (generator) is also very hard.  Actually ''finding'' a generator is not easy either.

Let's get back to the mod 17. Notice that there are actually 8 generators. They are 3, 10, 5, 11, 14, 7, 12 and 6. It is not a coincidence that &amp;phi;(17 - 1) also equals 8.

=== Exercises ===
1. Find all the generators of 41.

2. Given that 6 is a generator mod 41. Find the discrete log to the base 6 of 17 (mod 41).

3. How many generators are there in mod 709. Note that 708 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 59.

== Existence of a generator ==
In this section, we will show that there must exist a generator in mod ''p'' prime. Suppose an abelian (multiplicative) group ''G'' has order ''p'' - 1 (i.e. {1,2,3,...p - 1} are the elements of ''G'' and arithmetic is performed mod ''p''), let ''g'' be the element of ''G'' of '''maximal order''', i.e. |''g''| &amp;ge; |''h''| for any element ''h'' in ''G''.

Now consider the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|}  - 1\equiv 0 \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;
the element ''g'' definitely satisfies the above equation, but so does any power of ''g''. It can be confirmed
:&lt;math&gt;(g^a)^{|g|} \equiv (g^{|g|})^a \equiv 1^a \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
in other words, we can factorise the polynomial as follows
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|} - 1 = (x - 1)(x - g)(x - g^2)\cdots (x - g^{|g|-1}) \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
We can show that only powers of ''g'' can satisfy the above equation. Suppose otherwise, i.e. if an element ''h'' is not a power of ''g'', but ''h'' also satifies ''h''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1, then substitute ''h'' into the equation above, we get
:&lt;math&gt;h^{|g|} - 1 = (h - 1)(h - g)(h - g^2)\cdots (h - g^{|g|-1}) \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
since by assumption ''h'' is not a power of ''g'', so none of the terms above is zero, therefore they must have inverses. Multiply each term by its inverse. We end up with
:&lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is absurd! Contradiction! Therefore only powers of ''g'' can satisfy ''x''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p'').

Now if we show that every element in ''G'' must satisfy ''x''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1, then we are done. Let's suppose there is an element ''h'' such that ''h'' does not satisfy the equation, then |''h''| does not divide |''g''|. Thereofore we must have
:&lt;math&gt;|gh| = \frac{|g||h|}{\gcd{(|g|,|h|)}}&lt;/math&gt;
(see exercise if this is unclear) which is greater than |''g''|. But this is a contradiction of the fact that ''g'' has maximal order! Therefore every element of ''G'' must be a power of ''g'' and so ''g'' is the generator of ''G''.

The above shows that in mod ''p'' prime, there is always a generator, but it doesn't tell us how to find one. As of today, there is no widely known ''efficient'' algorithm for finding the generator for a general ''p''.

=== Exercises ===
0. (Optional) Show that lcm(''a'',''b'')&amp;times;gcd(''a'',''b'') = ''ab'', where lcm(x,y) denotes the lowest common multiple of ''x'' and ''y''. E.g. lcm(5,7) = 35 and lcm(14,49) = 98.

1. Show in mod ''p'', |''ab''| = lcm(|''a''|,|''b''|) where lcm(x,y) denotes the lowest common multiple of ''x'' and ''y''. E.g. lcm(5,7) = 35 and lcm(14,49) = 98.

== *Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm* ==
We are now ready to learn about the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm for finding the discrete log. As mentioned above, it works by breaking the problem into components. We will probably need a calculator for this section.

Let's consider a simple case first. Let ''p'' = 113 and given 3 is a generator mod 113, we want to find a ''x'' such that 3&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 38. We can assume that
:''x'' = 0, 1, 2, ... , or 111
(as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 &amp;equiv; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ). So ''x'' is like a value in mod 112 = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;7. By the CRT ''x'' can be uniquely represented as a two-tuple.

Let's assume
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_0 + 2a_1 + 2^2a_2 + 2^3a_3 \pmod{2^4} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we represented ''x'' in the funny way above so that we can obtain the values more easily (as will be clear soon), and
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv b \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;.
where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; takes value 0 or 1, and ''b'' takes value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

The algorithm is completed in three stages, we will describe each in turn. Firstly, we want to compute the values of &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt;. We compute the following values
# &lt;math&gt;3^{0\frac{112}{2}} \equiv 3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{1\frac{112}{2}} \equiv 3^{56} \equiv -1 \equiv 112&lt;/math&gt;
we did this so we can ''look it up'' later.

Now consider
:&lt;math&gt;a = 38^\frac{p - 1}{2} \equiv 3^{x\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(a_0 + a_12 + a_22^2 + a_32^3)\frac{p - 1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3^{(a_0\frac{p - 1}{2} + a_1(p - 1) + a_22(p - 1) + a_32^2(p-1))} \equiv 3^{(a_0\frac{p - 1}{2})}&lt;/math&gt;
now we compare ''a'' to the values computed above, if ''a'' equals 1 then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; = 0, otherwise if ''a'' equals -1 then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; = 1. So we have uncovered the value of &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;.

To find out &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; we notice that
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2}}3^{-a_0\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(x - a_0)\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(a_1(p - 1) + a_22(p - 1) + a_32^2(p-1))} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so compute
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;a \! &lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^2}}3^{-a_0\frac{p-1}{2^2}} \equiv 3^{(x - a_0)\frac{p - 1}{2^2}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;3^{(a_1\frac{p - 1}{2} + a_2(p - 1) + a_32(p-1))}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;3^{(a_1\frac{p - 1}{2})} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
now if ''a'' = 0 then &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

In the same way, compute
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^3}}3^{(-a_0-2a_1)\frac{p-1}{2^3}} &lt;/math&gt;
and then
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^4}}3^{(-a_0-2a_1-2^2a_2)\frac{p-1}{2^4}} &lt;/math&gt;
to determine the values of &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to determine the value of ''b''. Let's compute the following 7 values
# &lt;math&gt;3^{0\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{1\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{16} \equiv 49 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{2\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{32} \equiv 28 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{3\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{48} \equiv 16 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{4\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{64} \equiv 106 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{5\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{80} \equiv 109 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{6\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{96} \equiv 30 &lt;/math&gt;

then we compute
:&lt;math&gt;a = 38^{\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{x\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{b\frac{112}{7}}&lt;/math&gt;
and compare with the values computed above to obtain ''b''.

If we have computed the values of ''a'' 's correctly, then we should see that
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_3 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
and
:''b'' = 6.
Now solve
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 \equiv 15 \pmod{16} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
to obtain ''x'' = 111. Therefore 3&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt; = 38.

The combination of simultaneous modular equations is done via chinese remainder theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;x = a*7*(7^{-1} \mod{16})+b*16*(16^{-1} \mod{7}) \pmod{112}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 15*7*7+6*16*4 \pmod{112} = 111&lt;/math&gt;

Collaborative learning has taken on many forms. One form is Collaborative Networked Learning for the self-directed adult learner. 

Dr. Charles Findley,Ph.D., began exploring and coined the term Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL)  in the mid 1980's as part of the work on designing the classroom of the future for the knowledge worker.  

Collaborative Networked Learning '''(CNL)'''
is that learning which occurs via
electronic dialogue between self-directed co-learners
and learners and experts. Learners share a common purpose, depend upon
each other and are accountable to each other for their success.
CNL occurs in interactive groups in which 
participants actively communicate and negotiation meaning with one another.

Three important considerations motivate the focus on CNL in this
resource.


=CNL is sound educational practice.=

Researchers and educators have contrasted collaborative activities with two other categories--
competitive and individualistic.  Competitive activities, for example,
include those in which only one person can win, or where learners 
compete for grades, rank, or status, rather than when all members 
focus on achieving mastery or competence.
Individualistic activities, for example, include working in 
isolation with no interaction with others, or when a learner 
interacts only with a self-paced manual or CBI, rather than 
when all members share ideas with each other.

The overwhelming conclusion of research in the goals of learning
environments is that collaborative,cooperative goal directed activities lead to 
higher achievement. Overall higher achievement translates into 
higher productivity.

=CNL is sound business practice.=

Much work in the information age enterprise involves collaborative, team oriented tasks.  Learning workers share information with one another in order to accomplish common tasks in a small group. Professionals share information with each other, and learn something about
each others' specialization in order to reach consensus on a common problem.
Assembly line workers have increased productivity when workers learned from each other how their different individual parts of the task fit
together to produce the whole.   All of these different learning workers
are engaging in activities which involve
collaboration.

Life-long learning in the workplace is becoming a necessity
rather than an ideal.  The need for collaboration is great and will continue.
By facilitating collaborative methods of learning, we
could help workers acquire individually and collectively
the rapidly, changing knowledge required in the high-tech workplace. 

=Collaboration is a condition of learning in the information workplace.=
While the worker in the industrial era factory learned how to
manipulate objects and memorized actions, the worker in the 
modern organization learns how to think, learn and apply information
to a task. 
#Workers need to engage in activities that allow them to approach problems from different vantage points, testing out assumptions,and redefining meanings,i.e.creative thinking in order to develop new viewpoints.
#Workers need to engage in the social,collaborative exchange of ideas in order to pose hypothetical problems, general hypotheses, conduct experiments and reflect on outcomes.

Basically, workers are learning in groups to make meaning out of information.
Not only do workers need to make meaning out of the information but in order
to actually perform their jobs they need to be able to share that meaning
with others.


This guide is to serve as a basic resource for individuals planning, 
implementing, and participating in Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL)
communities as co-learners.  The general
guidelines provided here draw upon published research and from
experience with successful applications of different CNL models.

=Collaboration in Groups: Intra-personal and Interpersonal Communication=
Collaborative Learning, therefore, would occur in the 
context of a group with a mission or agreed-upon-purpose.  
The work involves the structuring and restructuring of
conceptual knowledge.  The final product is a message, an
external artifact of the group knowledge at a particular point
in time, which communicates the knowledge
of the group.  The message might take the form of a program,
a report, a strategy document, a diagram, a drawing etc.
Learning-work involves the cognitive processes 
of assimilation--intake of 
information from the environment, accommodation--restructuring
to fit new into the old, present structure,
and integration--directly fitting information into existing structure.
And most importantly it involves the resolution of conflict 
between old and new structures,which can lead to innovation.
&lt;p&gt;
Two communication processes or type of dialogs
are involved in collaborative learning: (1) Intra-personal
communication--integration, and accommodation--involves processing 
within the individual. (2) Interpersonal communication
involves assimilation-- the intake of information from the environment--and
representation of one's knowledge structure in a form and medium
that can be shared with another person.
As one person shares ideas with another person,
the process becomes an on-going loop from assimilation through representation 
of knowledge structures.  
&lt;p&gt;
At any point the learner may represent his/her ideas in order to test out
hypotheses to gain agreement or validation.  When members of a mission oriented
group create shared knowledge structure and produce an artifact such as a 
written report or a software program, for example, 
they engage in learning to created a product which is their collective knowledge.

=Collaboration--Across Time and Distance= 



===Channel Selection===
Electronically networked group involves different communication channels than when working one to one.   Selecting an appropriate channel for the each tasks may accomplish the objectives.  Adler and Elmhost (2005) consider five important factors to help one decide when, where and how to communicate, such as the time required to receive feedback, amount of information conveyed, sender’s control over the message, control over receiver’s attention and effectiveness for detailed message.   In order to determine when to meet face-to-face or when to send e-mail or perhaps when to send a simple instant text message, consult Table 1.1 page 13 in Adler and Rodman, ''Understanding Human Communication'' 9th edition for guidance. 

===Feedback Strategy: Feedback messages without nonverbal clues=== 
As part of a face-to-face group individuals are constantly
reading the nonverbal communication such as gestures,
facial express, voice tone, and change in body position.  In essence, the communicators are monitoring the interaction looking for feedback that says &quot;how things are going.&quot;
These feedback messages are both verbal and non-verbal.  
Communicators become accustomed to reading the nonverbal messages for level of understanding, agreement, or meaning that is shared among the participants in the interaction.  In many collaborative
networked environments, the non-verbal messages are
reduced or non-existent. Participants develop special strategies
for eliciting and sharing feedback in networked environments.
For example, in an electronic network involving only text-based computer mediated communication (CMC) the feedback is more restricted than in other networks.  

===Eliciting and contributing Feedback=== 

====Process Facilitation—how are we doing as a group====


While any participant may assume responsibility for eliciting
feedback and confirming meaning from other participants, all
members of the learning group share the responsibility for
clarification and confirmation.  Each individual participates
actively to let others know their current level of understanding
or acceptance.  David and Roger Johnson (1994) offer some general advice for providing feedback which will help create a group context which supports group communication.  Based on their research in collaborative group learning environments, they offer the following ground rules for providing effective feedback:

Effective feedback is as immediate as possible; rather than
allowing misunderstandings to multiple and continue through
a series of exchanges, members check for understanding regularly.

Effective feedback focuses on description  and personal
interpretations of messages rather than judgment or 
evaluation. 

Effective feedback focuses on the particular message or
behavior of the participant rather than imagined
personality traits.

Effective feedback is personal such as 
I perceive...  or I understand
rather than impersonal such as 
The general perception is..... or The level of understanding is ......

Effective feedback provides only the amount of information
that can be understood or is meaningful at the time, rather
than a dissertation.

Effective feedback is specific and focused rather than
general and abstract. It is meaningful within the present
context of the group communication.

====Feedback about group process is important.====

One often neglected aspect of feedback is the collaborative
process itself.  The Johnsons suggest that members of a group
who are attempting to engage in collaborative group work 
focus feedback on group process as well as the specific content of 
the group efforts.  Elaine Kerr (1985,p.16) &quot; Small task-oriented
groups need to occasionally pause to talk about the process itself:
participant rates, the tone of the conversation, conflicts,
feelings about the process, impacts, observations and problems
of using the system, equipment...&quot;  Creating a special time or
electronic space for this type of feedback is vital to the on-going
success of the collaboration.

If the team is to continue to collaborate
and grow as a group, then it will need to 
focus on its own interaction as a group.  Sharing observations
about process in the group can help group members become aware
of where the group is collectively and how individuals 
have contributed to that direction.  Observation of this
nature provides the feedback necessary for groups to 
improve their overall productivity and satisfaction.



====Collaborative Group Productivity suggestions====

Get to Know the members	

	Review the background introduction profiles
	Share fears, success and concerns about collaborative team work
	
Group Memory

As part of the work process it is important to create a group memory or repository of content date.  

	Use the chat room with “record” selected to archive the decisions and discussion.
	Use the discussion forum conference to post and discuss ideas rather than sending individual attachment emails.
	
Project Management Hints
	Create time tables for different phases.

	Set expectations about individual and group deliverables.

	Follow-up discussion and meetings with summarized agreements and 	reminders of timelines.

listing of trends.


==JOBS IN THE FUTURE==

===LONG RANGE===

1) There will be a shortfall of approximately 50 million jobs by 2010.
(Alan Porter, FUTURIST,Sept/Oct 1986)

2) The &quot;job&quot; is the cornerstone of our social structure.  It  provides
for  economic,  social,  and  psychological  needs.   Take it away and
society   could   collapse--unless   we   plan   ahead.(Alan   Porter,
FUTURIST,Sept/Oct 1986)

(3) Self-learning programs will be on the market in  specific  domains
so   that   they   can  generalize  from  experience,i.e.   learn  new
information; therefore, individual will not have to learn content  but
how  to  access  new knowledge (information) from the learning machine
supporting the work.

===MID RANGE===

(1)The first jobs to be replaced will be the procedural since they are
the  easiest  to be automated,e.g.  robotics in manufacturing,assemble
line work.   (2)  More  and  more  intelligent,  self-monitoring  and
self-diagnosing  programs  on  microprocessors  are  being included in
products.   (3)  New  jobs  will  require  workers  who   can   make
decisions, solve  problem  and  think  independently  since the routine
control,  monitoring,  and  procedural  tasks  will  be  performed  by
intelligent machines.

===PRESENT===

Industrial era has ended; we have moved  into  a  post-industrial  era
with a central focus on information and service.

GM uses programmable controllers in manufacturing; GM is making a
substantial long-term investment in Automation.
American corporations reduce manufacturing staff.
IBM offers early retirement options beginning at age 45.
Bundled solutions with SW/HW products.


QUESTIONS:

What  trends  do  you  see  in  product  strategy,  job  descriptions,
personnel policies etc. that reinforce or contradict this trend?

==Information Technology: Communication and Computers(C  sq.) become Utility==



===LONG RANGE===
Csq. adapts to you, knows  you, and  adapts,  intelligent  C  sq.
becomes interactive partner in on-going dialog

(1)Knowledge processing schemes with parallel processing,  associative
memory, and  inference/knowledge  processing rather than stored-program

     (Hideo Aiso, Chair Fifth Generation Computer Systems Project, speech
     &quot;Research Topics in Japanese national Projects for Information Technology&quot;
     presented October 10, 1986 at Digital Equipment Corp. Hudson, Mass.

(3)New Computing machines could not only be much faster  and  cheaper,
but   could   achieve   the   elusive  goals  of  recognizing  images,
understanding  speech,  and  exhibiting  more  intelligent   behavior.
(Michael  L.   Dertouzos,  The  Multiprocessor Revolution:  Harnessing
Computers Together, TECHNOLOGY REVIEW, February/March 1986)


===MID-RANGE=== 
1)mini-computers, micro-computers, to lap-top, to  knee-top
all with the same power,.e.g.  more memory on a chip--more power and memory in
smaller size (e.g.  follow product strategy from  floor  model  TV  to
hand held &quot;Watchman.&quot;)

2)all data-types(including but not limited to real time  audio,video,
text,  graphics) will be processed and transmitted as part of the home and
office infospere.

3) &quot;Whether you're talking about the office  or  the  home,  I  don't
think you'll be able to tell the difference between your telephone and
your  computer  as  time  goes  on.&quot;  John  Roach,  Tandy  Corporation
Chairman, PERSONAL COMPUTING, Sept.  1985

4)Computer  Aid  Communication  (CAC)   becomes   common   place   in
organizations.   (See  Chandler  Stevens,ELECTRONIC  ORGANIZATION  and
EXPERT NETWORKS,  report   5.41.011  from  Management  in  the  1990's
project at MIT.)

===PRESENT===

(1)&quot;A revolution is taking place within  the  information  revolution.
It  involves  harnessing  hundreds,  thousands,  or  even  millions of
computers to work together on a single task.   The  technological  and
economic  forces  spurring  this  revolution  arise form two important
trends.  On the one hand is the dramatic improvement over the past two
decades  in  very-large-scale-integrated  (VLSI)  circuits,  which now
incorporate some hundred-thousand components on a silicon  chip.   The
cost  of  computational  power  has  dropped  an average of 30 percent
annually.  For less  than  $100  manufacturers  can  now  fabricate  a
microprocessor--the  computational  core  of  a  computer  etched on a
single chip-- capable of performing more than a  million  instructions
per  second.&quot;  (Michael  L.  Dertouzos, The Multiprocessor Revolution:
Harnessing  Computers  Together,  TECHNOLOGY  REVIEW,   February/March
1986,p45.)

(2)Local  and  wide-area  networks  marketed.
('Power,status'  based  on  withholding information breaks down.  (See
discussion of information society.)

(3)Video-phone's on the market using voice over internet or cable

(4)Phone slave project at MIT

(5)In 1984, 40% of the Fortune 500 Industry and Service companies  had
local  area  networks, projected to be 72% 1985.  It is clear from the
study that respondents have a good understanding  of  word  processing
equipment  and personal computers.  But there is a lot of confusion as
to the linkage between these tools.  (The Office Automation Challenge:
American  Business  Responds  prepared  by the OMNI GROUP, reported in
COMPUTER WORLD April,1984) (6)Electronic mail (e.g. mail and ateways  to  the  world  from office or home terminal) and electronic conferencing (e.g.  Conferencing, public  and private bulletin boards and collaborative information creation)


QUESTIONS (1)F.  S.  engineers working with  networks  need  different
type of problem-solving analysis, and independent thinking skills than
their counterparts.  (How was  this  addressed  and  are  their  other
indicators that educaiton and training will change?)

(2)Did training change to adjust to the market in 1984?   Also  the
level  of  training  required  shifts  from the clerical worker to the
system administrator did it?

==Characteristics of Information Society==

===LONG RANGE===

(1)Using Toffler's framework, the Third Wave, based on information and
electronic  technology  with mature and become clearly dominate in the
next 10 years.  Another period of  innovation  and  high  growth  will
occur,  lasting  about  25  years.   A  third  period  of  Third  Wave
innovation will take off and last us until about 2045, at which  point
the  economy will decline until the next wave of technology comes into
dominance:  the Cybernetic Wave.  (H.  Alan  Raymond.   Management  in
the Third Wave.  THE FUTURIST.  Sept./Oct.  1986.  p.  15-17.  (2) The
rate of change is increasing  and  continuous.   (See  Alvin  Toffler.
1980.  THE THIRD WAVE.  Bantan Books,New York.)


===MID RANGE===

(1)Individual's  are  becoming  more  specialized  in  their  area  of
endeavor.   Problem-solving  and  decision  making require integration
from number of specialized.

(2)Multiple dissimilar databases can be searched without changing  the
structure of the representation within the individual databases.  (See
notes on Hudson seminar and I 3 work)


(3)&quot; The  increased  adoption  of  knowledge-distribution  technology,
super-  imposed  on  the geometrically increasing knowledge base, will
necessarily result in a knowledge  environment  that  is  dramatically
more  munificent  (  or  burdening)  than  is that of today.  &quot; George
Huber.   The  Nature  and  Design  of  Post-industrial  Organizations.
MANAGEMENT SCIENCE Vol 30, 8, Aug 1984, p.,931

(4)Corporations will invest in the workers and technologies that  best
extract and process information resources.


===PRESENT===

(1)The information age of the post-industrial  era  has  replaced  the
industrial   era.    New   demands   for  information,  its  creation,
management, use and distribution are needed.

(2)Providing access  to  more  information  is  prevalent  vs.   right
information to meet demand is waiting for solution.

(3)Work is underway to design Collaborative Working environment tools
      MCC conference in December 1986
      Debbie Tatter's group at Xerox PARC
      GDSS ( Group Decision Support Systems) are being designed to 
     help facilitate the need for shared information within organizations.  
     AS typical GDSS consists of a meeting room with a conference table.
     Each seating position has a small CRT terminal.  Input at these terminals 
     is by keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, or some combination of these devices.

     The meeting's participants are able to create displays on their CRT's
     and to select portions of their 'personal' display for forwarding 
     to a public display screen.
     George Huber, Issues in the Design of Group Decision Support Systems,
     MIS QUARTERLY, September 1984 p.195.  

(4)Life-cycle of information--the information explosion is  continuing
at  an  every  expanding  rate.   Product  training is outdated before
printed because  of  the  faster  rate  and  number  of  new  products
introduced  into  the  marketplace.   For example, training groups develop  courses
printed 1600 pages of material on  products for new hire  
training.   It  was  outdated before delivered to the audience.  
(Reference key points  from  Huber  and  Ackoff  about  organizations,
information, and post-industrial society).

                                                               


QUESTIONS (1)What database solutions are people developing  to  handle
information  needs?   What  complaints are their about too much/or not
enough information?   (2)Is  information  being  managed  as  a  Corp.
resource?   (3)Are  the right people getting the information they need
to perform their tasks?

==Key trends in individual thoughts and Values==


A premium was placed upon obedience  and  loyalty  in  the  industrial
organizational  structure.   Thinking and innovation only upset rigid,
planned structures  and  were  not  highly  valued.   Tasks  including
management  with  simplified down to their lowest level so that almost
anyone do them.   People,  like  parts,  were  interchangeable  and
standardized.

A new monetary premium is being placed on the individual, on  thinking
and  on  innovation,  and  on  the  speed  and precision of execution.
Decision  making  and  responsibility  are  again  required   of   the
individual  who  may less easily pass the buck and must be financially
responsible  for  his  area  or  product,  as  the  corporate  pyramid
flattens,  i.e.   four  levels of management from the bottom to top is
goal of many organizations today.   [Look  at  your  organization  and
count the levels.] Decisions in a faster-paced economy cannot wait for
endless committee meetings and analysis  that  would  only  allow  the
competition  to  win.  Fast decisions require a maximum of information
and instant and precise analysis.  This, in turn, requires better  and
more  highly  educated personnel, who also must be innovative in using
new technology.  Individuals are becoming less easily interchanged and
more intrinsic to the business.  (H.  Alan Raymond.  Management in the
Third Wave.  THE FUTURIST.  Sept./Oct.  1986.  p.  15-17.

==Long Range Goals:Key Themes in Learning Environments==


Holistic approach to person and process with less  focus  on  product.
Product will be more intelligent and will help you use it.

Needs analysis and problem definition tools such as  decision  support
for  manager  and  instructional  design  will  become much, much more
sophisticated than  today  taking  into  consideration  all  variables
effecting total solution for client.

Needs analysis becomes interactive and self monitoring rather  than  a
discrete part of dead end process.

Methods will not just be  limited  to  text  based  but  will  include
multiple sensory inputs with simulations.

More sophisticated matching of means with ends in terms of  &quot;training&quot;
solution.

New ways of testing/indicating knowing--suggest  looking  at  paradigm
such   as   (1)doesn't   know  (2)consciously  aware  of  knowing  (3)
unconsciously conscious  of  knowing,  DON'T  TEST  'HOW  TO'  CONTENT
instead PERFORMANCE defined in broad since related to job, not trivial
performance as in behavioral objectives.

===More learning on job with intelligent systems that are  adaptable  and
tolerable to individual===

Possibly less learning on the part of the individual and more learning
from  computer,  so  that  computer  monitors job tasks and strategies
employed becomes more intelligent and thus becomes intelligent job aid
for  worker  who  just has to use the computer, e.g.  self-referential
programs.

Need to consider not only the physical dimension, but the  social  and
task/ knowledge requirements of any learning situation.

Instructors can not possibly know everything about a  particular  area
thus  the  &quot;instructor&quot;  is  not  a  disseminator of information but a
facilitator, guide or coach for the learner, i.e.  equality of learner
with the human or machine manager of learning environment.

Content has to change to help learner move beyond  rote  memorization,
stress process, learning how to learn, visualization, decision making,
thinking and problem solving.

Social environment of designer of learning environments and experience
has  to change drastically because the social environment is reflected
in the tools, e.g.  top down, structured  programming  in  an  era  of
object- oriented programming, parallel processing, and networks.

The user controls the learning process rather than the  process  being
controlled by an outside designer, teacher or system.

                                                               
====The learning environment knows about itself and the user within it====

System is maintained by a &quot;maintenance librarian&quot; program.

Content (is process) is flexible and evolving, need processes in place
to  replace outdated information automatically, need ways to know what
the learner doesn't need to be learning anymore.

There is a spectrum of solutions, for any  learning  problem--need  to
have way of analyzing situation and recommending solution.

== Political History ==
{{incomplete}}

:''This section needs checking for correctness and details.''

There were 10 versions of X, corresponding to 10 versions of the protocol between clients and server. Then came the eleventh version, X11. This version sustained many additions and continues in use today.

Control of the X11 spec and reference implementation passed between several organizations: MIT X Consortium, X Consortium, Open Group, and X.org. The OS vendors (mostly Unix and VMS) would take the reference implementation, modify it, add an X server for their OS, and give the modified version a non-free license. These non-free versions deployed themselves on servers and workstations.

===XFree86===
As home computers with cheap Intel 386 processors (helped by Microsoft DOS and Windows) spread, so did cheap or free Unix implementations (Minix, Xenix, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD) for them. Thus Thomas Roell and Snitily Graphics Consulting Service created the X386 server and donated it to X11R5, that is X version 11 release 5 of the reference implementation. From there, [[w:XFree86|XFree86]] produced an X11 implementation with a free license, thus the &quot;Free&quot; in its name. Eventually, XFree86 added ports to Alpha, PowerPC, and SPARC. XFree86 spread to several free and commercial Unix variants including Mac OS X and Cygwin.

===Window managers and widgets===
Meanwhile, as X11 spread, several persons wrote software for it, including window managers. The reference implementation contained &quot;twm&quot;, a simple window manager. Several persons wrote window managers either by modifying twm or starting from nothing. Many of these window managers, such as fvwm, afterstep, and windowmaker, had free licenses. These were distributed and maintained separately from X11 or XFree86. Some Linux distributions provided several of them.

The reference implementation also contained the Xt (X toolkit) framework and the Xaw (Athena) widgets using this toolkit. The primitive, black-and-white buttons, scroll bars, and menus used by Xaw dissatisfied Macintosh and Windows users. So some persons made variations like Xaw3d and distributed them as patches to X11. Others rejected Xt and made their own widgets, creating toolkits like FOX, FLTK, GTK+, and Qt. OpenOffice.org still uses its own widgets.

===Motif and CDE===
The OS vendors at the Open Group combined efforts and created the Motif window manager and widget toolkit. From there, the vendors made a Common Desktop Environment. Though Motif and CDE appeared in several commercial OS distributions, they had a non-free license, so many Linux and *BSD users avoided it. As Linux and XFree86 advanced, Motif and CDE waned.

===GNOME and KDE===
The K Desktop Environment, based on the Qt widget toolkit, and the GNU Network Object Module Environment, based on the GTK+ widget toolkit, became freely licensed alternatives to Motif and CDE. The GNOME and KDE developers encouraged improvements to XFree86 and also cooperated through http://www.freedesktop.org. Eventually, XFree86 and freedesktop.org displaced x.org for development of X11.

Other toolkits and window managers also took notice of freedesktop.org and continue to compete against GNOME and KDE.

===License crisis and forking===
The Open Group ended free licensing for the X11 reference implementation. They later reintroduced the free license, but most X11 development had already moved to XFree86, which remained free for an extended period of time.

In February 2004, The XFree86 Project adopted with XFree86 4.4.0 a license change from an MIT License to XFree86 License 1.1 which contained a credit clause similar to the original BSD license, which the Free Software Foundation considered incompatible with [[:w:en:GNU General Public License|GPLv2]]. 

This license change caused a dispute amongst core XFree86 developers and incentivised most Linux distributors and OpenBSD to abandon XFree86 in favor of a fork. Eventually, the '''X.Org Server''' became the official reference implementation of X11. The first version of '''X.Org''', X11R6.7.0, was forked from XFree86 version 4.4 RC2 to avoid the XFree86 license changes, with X11R6.6 changes merged in.

Most of the open-source Unix-like operating systems have adopted the X.Org Server in place of XFree86, and most of the XFree86 developers have moved to X.Org.

While there is fragmentation out of a multitude of desktop environments and window managers, X servers and clients from different developer and user communities work well together. Development within X.Org is steady, and use of X.Org between desktop distributions remains firmly in place.

The fragmentation between desktop and windowing environments is not necessarily a bad thing, as this allows users more choice and adaptation to different usage scenarios with varying requirements.

In some use cases, X has been supplanted by Wayland, which is used in Sailfish and Tizen mobile operating systems and in the Hawaii desktop environment. Wayland also has preliminary support in GNOME, KWin (KDE), Enlightenment and Mate desktop environments, and the Fedora distro.

== Window Managers ==

A window manager is a program which draws the frames around windows and allows the user to move, resize, iconify, and otherwise manage windows. Unlike with some other window environments, one can find many window managers for X11.

:[[/Features and Facilities of Window Managers/]]

=== Using X11 Without a Window Manager ===

One can also use X11 without a window manager. Typically, one writes a session script which starts an &quot;xterm&quot; at a &quot;-geometry&quot; location. Keyboard-oriented users may start a keyboard shortcut daemon like xbindkeys and manage windows through
Xresources geometry hints or with tools like xdotool.

== Building ==
X11, from the reference implementation to Xorg 6.9, uses its own &quot;imake&quot; build system. The clients, server, and libraries are in one build tree. (It is very difficult to build only one part of the tree; the entire tree must be built.) Some things, like Mesa and Freetype, are hacked to optionally be part of the tree.

Xorg 7.0 replaces this with a set of modules based around GNU autoconf build system. This creates a complex system of packages and dependencies. Problems with implementing two systems for the simultaneous Xorg 6.9rc1 and Xorg 7.0rc1 delayed release candidate 1.

=== Imake system ===
In order to build Xorg with imake, you first need to download and extract the source tarball. The tarball for Xorg 6.9rc1 was called &lt;tt&gt;xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt; and is available from [http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R6.9-RC1/ here]. Now that the final versions of Xorg 6.9 and 7.0 are available, you can find them using the list of mirrors [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Mirrors here].

A rough outline of the build system:
# Create a &quot;host.def&quot; file (which is optional).
# Do &quot;make World&quot; to configure and build the tree.
# Do &quot;make install&quot; and &quot;make install.man&quot; to install everything.

You can use the &quot;host.def&quot; file to customize your build. If you do not create one, then you use the default settings, which should already be tuned to your operating system.

The file &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; describes the build in more detail.

Yes, you must build the entire tree to build one part. The exception is that sometimes you can do a server-only or server-less build. See our section on [[#Building a static server]] and &lt;tt&gt;xc/config/cf/xorgsite.def&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Example build ===
In the following example, root has given us the write access to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt;. We downloaded Xorg 6.9 release candidate 1 (&lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt;).

We already have Xorg 6.8.2 installed. We are running it during the build, so we have multiple xterms to type shell commands in.

Using an &quot;xterm&quot;, extract the source to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt;, creating &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xc&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''cd /usr/local/src'''
 $ '''bzcat xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2 | pax -rv'''

As &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; explains, we can use '''lndir''' to create a ''shadow tree'' of symbolic links to the source. (This prevents objects from appearing in the source tree.) Because &quot;lndir&quot; is part of X, and we have Xorg 6.8.2 already, we can run &quot;lndir&quot;:
 $ '''mkdir xcbuild'''
 $ '''cd xcbuild'''
 $ '''lndir ../xc'''

Note that the current directory is &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xcbuild&lt;/tt&gt; now. We will skip creating the &lt;tt&gt;config/cf/host.def&lt;/tt&gt; and use the default configuration. It is now time to call the Makefile. We must run &lt;tt&gt;'''make World'''&lt;/tt&gt; because there is no other correct way to configure and start the build. If we run Bourne shell:
 $ '''make World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

{{Warning|If we run C shell, then the above command is &lt;tt&gt;'''make World &gt;&amp; World.log'''&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

The &quot;xterm&quot; running &quot;make&quot; is now busy. To watch the log, we run &quot;tail&quot; in a second xterm:
 $ '''cd /usr/local/src/xcbuild'''
 $ '''tail -f World.log'''

Eventually, the log announces that the build of Xorg is complete.

{{Warning|If we need to restart the build (for example, after an error) then we do not want to clean the tree. A &lt;tt&gt;'''make World'''&lt;/tt&gt; configures the tree, cleans the tree, and starts the build. We can restart a build with &lt;tt&gt;'''make Everything'''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'''make'''&lt;/tt&gt;; see &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; for details.}}

We install (to the default &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6&lt;/tt&gt;, thus overwriting most of Xorg 6.8.2):
 $ '''sudo make install'''
 $ '''sudo make install.man'''

Note:
# If we do not have &quot;sudo&quot; working on our system, then we would use &quot;su&quot;.
# One can exit from X11 before doing the install. The other option is to overwrite most of X11 while it is running. This can work, but is slightly less safe.

If necessary, exit from X and run &lt;tt&gt;'''xorgcfg'''&lt;/tt&gt; to make a config file.

=== Building a static server ===
One can hack the tree to build only a static X server. This is useful if you need better hardware support from an X server in the newer version of a tree. Also, this skips over building the libraries, clients, and separate server modules. (X11 protocol is very stable, so newer servers work with older libraries and clients.)

OpenBSD provides an example &lt;tt&gt;host.def&lt;/tt&gt; for that. Their example &lt;tt&gt;host.def&lt;/tt&gt; is the basis of the next scenario. If you have some reason to static-build an X server, you would do something similar to the next scenario.

''Scenario: We have installed Xorg 6.8.2. We need the better &quot;ati&quot; driver in Xorg 6.9rc0 (release candidate 0), but we need to skip most of the 6.9rc0 tree to avoid errors.''

Solution: We will static-build a 6.9rc0 server.

{{warning|If you have a shadow tree made with &quot;lndir&quot;, create files like &quot;host.def&quot; and &quot;X11Conf.h&quot; in the shadow tree, not the source tree.}}

Create this file at &lt;tt&gt;config/cf/host.def&lt;/tt&gt; in the tree. If you have a shadow tree, put it in the shadow tree. The file is:
 #define InstallEmptyHostDef
 
 #define BuildServersOnly        YES
 
 /*
  * you may also restrict the drivers that are built by editing and
  * uncommenting the line below
  */
 #define XF86CardDrivers              wsfb ati

The &quot;XF86CardDrivers&quot; line is changed to specify only &quot;wsfb&quot; and &quot;ati&quot;. Our driver is &quot;ati&quot;. We have a ''second driver which avoids advanced hardware features'', in case &quot;ati&quot; fails us. The &quot;wsfb&quot; driver on OpenBSD uses the kernel framebuffer instead of reconfiguring the hardware. At Linux, the framebuffer driver is &quot;fbdev&quot;. On i386 hardware, &quot;vga&quot; and &quot;vesa&quot; might be good choices. Use one of the following lines:
 #define XF86CardDrivers              wsfb ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              fbdev ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              vga ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              vesa ati

Now start the build:
 $ '''make World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

The build eventually stops with an error because some &quot;XlibConf.h&quot; is missing; our host.def is skipping that step. (This is a bug; Xorg 6.8.2 did not need an &quot;XlibConf.h&quot; file.) That file probably would have been generated by building libX11, which we skipped. For the server, we actually do not need it. Create an empty file at &lt;tt&gt;xc/lib/X11/XlibConf.h&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''touch lib/X11/XlibConf.h'''

Now resume the build:
 $ '''make Everything &gt;&gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

Eventually the build finishes. The server appears at &lt;tt&gt;xc/programs/Xserver/Xorg&lt;/tt&gt;. Because this file is statically linked, it is the only file to install. We install at &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69&lt;/tt&gt; to complement our Xorg 6.8.2 installation at &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''cp -p programs/Xserver/Xorg /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69'''

Now we need to test the server. First, if we are running X now, ''exit from X to the console''. Then make our new server setuid root so it can use video hardware:
 $ '''cd /usr/X11R6/bin'''
 $ '''chown root:wheel Xorg69'''
 $ '''chmod a+xs Xorg69'''

Generate the new config file with '''Xorg69 -configure''', then test it with '''xinit -- /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69'''. If it works, make Xorg69 the default server by changing the &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin/X&lt;/tt&gt; symbolic link:
 $ '''cd /usr/X11R6/bin'''
 $ '''rm X'''
 $ '''ln -s Xorg69 X'''

We might want to '''chmod a-x /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg''' to prevent anyone from using the old &quot;Xorg&quot; with the new config file that relies on a &quot;Xorg69&quot; driver.</text>

      <comment>/* Early Sparta */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of the large amounts of material available on Spartan society, this essay is simply designed as an overview. All of this information, and more, can be found in any text relating to ancient Greece.

Sparta was a [[w:Dorian|Dorian]] civilization located in the [[w:Peloponnese|Peloponnese]]. One thing that made Sparta different from other [[w:Poleis|poleis]] is that it was a military state for most of its history.

==Early Sparta==
In the [[../Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] (the era after the fall of Mycenae) Dorians built Sparta as a military encampment, and it remained as such until the Spartans incorporated nearby settlements on the Laconian plain.

By the end of the Dark Ages, Sparta had become pre-eminent in Greece. Spartan lords endeavored to conquer more land, for their population was growing exceedingly large. Those whom the Spartans conquered were enslaved and called Helots, and they eventually revolted against the small Spartan army and Sparta herself was almost destroyed. In light of this, King Lycurgus established a military aristocracy  .

==Lycurgus==
In the early 7th century BCE, Lycurgus rose to power. He was the great lawmaker of Sparta, having written its constitution and laying down the law that made Sparta such a military power. Under Lycurgus' laws, Sparta had political equality for all Spartan citizens. At the time Sparta controlled all of the Peloponnesos.

==Managing Sparta==
Managing Sparta was no small task. Thanks to its military might, there were massive amounts of conquered territory, which, though citizens managed it privately, remained the property of the state. Most subjects of those conquered lands were enslaved by the Spartan government and were known as ''helots''. Though the helots were viewed as state property, individual Spartans &amp;ndash; presumably those who managed the conquered land &amp;ndash; took half the responsibility of the helots' protection, while the other half reverted to the state.&lt;!--Suggest this curious-sounding arrangement is explained a little further here as well as perhaps elsewhere...?--&gt;

Because of the amount of conquered territory under Spartan rule, there were numerous helots. The helots identified themselves as one race, although they previously belonged to different city-states. This unified them and sowed seeds of discontent. Helots' unity made the risk of an uprising a very real possibility, which furthered Sparta's drive to remain a military state. As well as acting as a deterrent, Spartan military power would provide the means to quash any rebellion.

Not all natives of subjugated lands were reduced to the position of being helots. Some of the more important communities in conquered regions were given some level of independence in their own domestic affairs. These peoples were called ''perioikoi'' (which translates as &quot;neighbors&quot;) and received somewhat better treatment than helots. In spite of their better treatment, however, these peoples were not happy to be under Spartan rule, even if they were less likely to rise up against Sparta.

==Sparta's Militarism and Politics==
From the ages of seven to 60, Spartan males were required to serve in the military. During that time, they lived in military barracks. After twenty-five years of service, it was common for them to spend their days in military training and evenings with other military companions. This military lifestyle made a home life next to impossible. The men weren't allowed to marry until the age of 20 (which some took wives by force), but were unable to have a household until the age of 30. Spartan women were treated unusually well, they had many rights and were not subjected to the common roll of women found in other civilizations, namely, stay at home and keep the children. Spartans citizens in general had a great deal of freedom.

Because Sparta's military state was so firmly established, it was sufficient to maintain a tradition of a military monarchy. Other poleis began with this form of leadership, but grew away from it as time passed. Sparta's kingship was hereditary, but also dual; that is to say, there were two kings from two different families. Sometimes these kings got on well and worked well together, but sometimes, of course, they did not.

==The Spartan Constitution==
Under Lycurgus' constitution, Spartan citizens did have some basic rights. The constitution also mapped out Sparta's political structure. There were always two kings, both military leaders. The kings worked with a council of aristocrats referred to as Gerousia. The Gerousia also handled political and judicial decisions.
Another governing body was the ''homoioi'' (&quot;equals&quot;). The homoioi was comprised of Spartan citizens who had survived their required military service, received state land (conquered territories) with helots to work it, and continued to obey Spartan rules. This assembly met regularly and made final decisions on most of the important issues related to Spartan government. Also there were the 'ephorites', the spiritual leaders with a 'connection' to the Gods, which had the power to dispose of a King, or over-turn his will.

==The Spartan Citizen==
In Sparta, a citizen was a member of society who was automatically entitled to certain &amp;ndash; albeit few &amp;ndash; rights Citizens also shared a basic sense of community. That this sense was based on fear of helot uprisings or the desire to profit from them (or both) wasn't important. This communal equality, however, was a minimum. That all Spartans owned their land privately while others had been granted use of state land was irrelevant. It didn't matter that some were high-ranking nobleman and others were 'mere mortals' as all were Spartan citizens, so all enjoyed those same basic rights.

== What is this book for? ==

The purpose of this book is to begin down the long and winding road of Electrical Engineering. Previous books on electric circuits have laid a general groundwork, but again: that is not what electrical engineers usually do with their time. Very complicated integrated circuits exist for most applications that can be picked up at a local circuit shop or hobby shop for pennies, and there is no sense creating new ones. As such, this book will most likely spend little or no time discussing actual circuit implementations of any of the structures discussed. Also, this book will not stumble through much of the complicated mathematics, instead opting to simply point out and tabulate the relevant results. What this book will do, however, is attempt to provide some insight into a field of study that is considered very foreign and arcane to most outside observers. This book will be a theoretical foundation that future books will build upon. This book will likely not discuss any specific implementations (no circuits, transceivers, filters, etc...), as these materials will be better handled in later books.

== Who is this book for? ==

This book is designed to accompany a second year of study in electrical engineering at the college level. However, students who are not currently enrolled in an electrical engineering curriculum may also find some valuable and interesting information here. This book requires the reader to have a previous knowledge of differential calculus, and assumes familiarity with integral calculus as well. Barring previous knowledge, a concurrent course of study in integral calculus could accompany reading this book, with mixed results. Using Laplace Transforms, this book will avoid differential equations completely, and therefore no prior knowledge of that subject is needed.

Having a prior knowledge of other subjects such as physics (wave dynamics, energy, forces, fields) will provide a deeper insight into this subject, although it is not required. Also, having a mathematical background in probability, statistics, or random variables will provide a deeper insight into the mechanics of noise signals, but that also is not required.

== What will this book cover? ==

This book is going to cover the theory of LTI systems and signals. This subject will form the fundamental basis for several other fields of study, including signal processing, [[Digital Signal Processing]], [[Communication Systems]], and [[Control Systems]]. 

This book will provide the basic theory of LTI systems and mathematical modeling of signals. We will also introduce the notion of a stochastic, or random, process. Random processes, such as noise or interference, are so common in the studies of these systems that it's impossible to discuss the practical use of filter systems without first discussing noise processes.

Later sections will introduce some more advanced topics, such as digital signals and systems, and filters. This book will not discuss these topics at length, however, preferring to direct the reader to more comprehensive books on these subjects.

This book will attempt, so far as is possible, to provide not only the materials but also discussions about the importance and relevance of those materials. Because the information in this book plays a fundamental role in preparing the reader for advanced discussions in other books.

== Where to go from here ==

Once a basic knowledge of signals and systems has been learned, the reader can then take one of several paths of study.

*Readers interested in the use of electric signals for long-distance communications can read [[Communication Systems]] and [[Communication Networks]]. This path will culminate in a study of [[Data Coding Theory]].

*Readers more interested in the analysis and processing of signals would likely be more interested in reading about [[Signal Processing]] and [[Digital Signal Processing]]. These books will focus primarily on the &quot;signals&quot;.

*Readers who are more interested in the use of LTI systems to exercise control over systems will be more interested in [[Control Systems]]. This book will focus primarily on the &quot;systems&quot;.

All three branches of study are going to share certain techniques and foundations, so many readers may find benefit in trying to follow the different paths simultaneously.</text>

There's no need to duplicate Wiktionary entries here.  There's no need to have entire conjugation tables.  Make use of Wiktionary.  Being the lexical companion to Wikibooks is one of the things that it is ''for''.  Concentrate upon writing an ''instructional text'' about Italian irregular verbs, rather than a dictionary.  The dictionary is ''already there'' for readers to reference.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 12:05, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, it's a work in progress. I want to explain some rules/ patterns that give more insight in the conjugations. Give me some time, thanks/</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Homonyms can be tricky to figure out!  The following examples of common homonym mistakes prove that spell-check can only go so far in helping to error proof your document.

'''Remember''' that two words that sound the same don't always have the same meaning.  If you are ever in doubt which one to use, check your dictionary.


=== Affect, Effect ===
:* '''Affect''' is most commonly a verb, usually meaning 'influence'. (An easy way to remember this is that 'affect' starts with an &quot;a&quot;, as does 'action'.) As a noun, it is a psychological term for emotion.
:* '''Effect''' is most common as a noun meaning 'result'. 'Effect' used as a verb means 'bring about' some kind of change.
:** Example: The game '''affected''' the standings. Its '''effect''' was overwhelming. It '''effected''' a change in the '''affect''' of the winning team's captain.

=== Afterward, Afterwards, Afterword ===
:* '''Afterward''' and '''afterwards''' are synonymous adverbs meaning that an event occurs later than another.
:* An '''afterword''' is an epilogue.

=== Aid, Aide ===
:* '''Aid''' is a noun meaning 'assistance' or a verb meaning 'assist'. 
:* An '''aide''' is a person who serves or offers assistance.
:** Example: &quot;The '''aide''' will '''aid''' the victim.&quot;

=== It's, Its ===
:* '''It's''' is a contraction, short for either '''It is''' or '''It has'''.
:* '''Its''' is the possessive form of '''it'''. This usually means that the following noun phrase belongs to 'it'. It is important to recognise that 'its' the possessive form does not have an apostrophe - it is in the same category as 'his'.
:** Example: &quot;'''It's''' (It is) my dog.&quot; &quot;The computer crashed a few minutes ago, and '''it's''' (it has) done it again!&quot; &quot;What is '''its''' name?&quot;

=== Lay, Lie ===
:* '''Lay''' is the action word. 
:* '''Lie''' is the state of being or a telling someone something untruthful on purpose.
:** Example: &quot;I will '''lay''' the book on the desk.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;I plan to '''lie''' in bed most of Saturday.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;Jim will probably '''lie''' to get out of being punished for breaking the window.&quot;

=== To, Too, Two ===
: Figuring out which of these three forms have stumped more than one person!  You can find a quick way to tell them apart below:
:*'''To''' is generally used to describe a relationship between things. It is also used as an infinitive verb, as in &quot;I love '''to''' eat.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;Matt is going '''to''' the doctor.&quot;  &quot;This gift is '''to''' you.&quot;  &quot;It is ten minutes '''to''' seven.&quot; 
:*'''Too''' is usually used when you are describing an excess or is used when noting something is ''in addition''
:** Example: &quot;I usually eat '''too''' much on Thanksgiving.&quot; or &quot;Joe cleaned the house, washed the car, and mowed the lawn, '''too'''.
:*'''Two''' is the word you use for the number '''2'''.
:** Example: &quot;You have '''two''' minutes left before class starts.&quot;

=== Then, Than ===
:*'''Then''' indicates time.
:** Example: &quot;First we went to dinner, and '''then''' we went to the show.&quot;
:*'''Than''' is comparative.
:** Example: &quot;I would rather see the comedy '''than''' see the horror movie.&quot;

=== Versus, Verses ===
:*'''Versus''' indicates opposition.
:*'''Verses''' is the plural of verse, as related to poetry.

== x86 Processor Modes == 

Real mode and protected mode are two operating modes of the Intel x86 processor. However, there are certain other modes as well. 

;V86 (Virtual 86 mode): This is the mode in which DOS applications run on Windows machine. This was done mainly to maintain compatibility with older DOS applications.

;SMM (System Management Mode): This mode was introduced, as the name suggests, for managing the system transparently without applications or OS getting the hint of it. Its primarily meant to be used by the BIOS code.

;Big Real Mode: Now this mode is more like Real mode, but in this we can access full 4Gb address space of the 32-bit processor.

 However in this page, we will be focussing mainly on Real mode and Protected mode only.

== Real Mode ==

This is the only mode which was supported by the 8086 (the very first processor of the x86 series). The 8086 had 20 address lines, so it was capable of addressing &quot;2 raised to the power 20&quot; i.e. 1 MB of memory.

== Protected Mode ==

This is the mode used most commonly by modern 32-bit operating systems.

== Entering Protected Mode ==

For instructions to enter protected mode, see: [[X86 Assembly/Protected Mode]].</text>

To simplify many tasks, programmers for many systems will often employ a generic piece of software called a '''bootloader''' that will set some system settings (such as enabling protected mode), and then will be used to load the kernel, and then transfer control to the kernel for system operation. In embedded systems particularly, bootloaders are useful when doing work on the kernel: the kernel can be altered and tested, and the bootloader will automatically load each new version into memory.

To further simplify the process, the programmer can employ a tool called a '''bootmenu''', which is essentially a bootloader that allows the user to select which kernel to load, from a list of possibilities. This is useful when multiple kernels are being compared, or when different versions of the same kernel are being debugged.

Bootloaders are used on many microcontrollers.
A [[:w:bootloader|bootloader]] is often the fastest way to update a program in a microcontroller with small changes. That makes the edit-compile-download-test cycle a little bit faster. 

The microcontroller can also have minimal hard-coded silicon dedicated to a simpler programming interface, which needs an expensive programmer socket. A vendor can then put a tiny program in Flash which reads the real program through the interface-du-jour, be it RS-232, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2C I&amp;sup2;C], wireless, or USB. 

Bootloaders are traditionally written in pure assembly language,
although it is possible to write a bootloader almost entirely in C.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Compile_and_link_a_bootloader_using_SDCC &quot;Compile and link a bootloader using SDCC&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Many bootloaders accept pre-compiled executable machine code bytes, often the output of a C compiler.
A few bootloaders accept Forth source code and compile it on-the-fly.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/FORTH &quot;One Laptop per Child: FORTH&quot;].
&quot;Forth is at the core of Open Firmware, the boot-loader for the XO-1.&quot;

== Data Transmission ==

Data can be sent either serially, one bit after another through a single wire, or in parallel, multiple bits at a time, through several parallel wires. Most famously, these different paradigms are visible in the form of the common PC ports &quot;serial port&quot; and &quot;parallel port&quot;.  Early parallel transmission schemes often were much faster than serial schemes (more wires = more data faster), but the added cost and complexity of hardware (more wires, more complicated transmitters and receivers).  Serial data transmission is much more common in new communication protocols due to a reduction in the I/O pin count, hence a reduction in cost.  Common serial protocols include SPI, and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C.  Surprisingly, serial transmission methods can transmit at much higher clock rates per bit transmitted, thus tending to outweigh the primary advantage of parallel transmission.  Parallel transmission protocols are now mainly reserved for applications like a CPU bus or between IC devices that are physically very close to each other, usually measured in just a few centimeters.  Serial protocols are used for longer distance communication systems, ranging from shared external devices like a digital camera to global networks or even interplanetary communication for space probes, however some recent CPU bus architectures are even using serial methodologies as well.

As on-chip memory increases, it is becoming more common to see Ethernet support in small system-on-chip embedded systems.  New Ethernet ASIC products are also on the market.  This allows an embedded system to have its own IP address on a network or on the internet.  It can act as a server for its own webpage, to implement a GUI or general purpose I/O, and to display any relevant information such as sensor data, or even as a portal to remotely upgrade firmware.  For example, many network routers have these features.

}}

Now you've got your [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/object|armature]], but it's not much use until you add some more bones to it. Think about your body for a moment -- you've got this thing you call a 'skeleton', which for our purposes corresponds more or less to an armature object. Your skeleton consists of a number of bones (about 206, to be precise), but generally these are not independent from each other. If you move your femur (the bit of your leg between your pelvis and your knee) then conveniently the rest of your leg moves with it. In that example, the tibia/fibula would probably be counted as one bone, with the femur as their 'parent' bone. In this way, you build up a hierarchy of bones, making animation much simpler.

Editing an Armature Object gives you the chance to add, move or connect bones together. Whilst in edit mode, you will see all of the bones within the currently selected Armature.

When you create a new armature in Object mode a single bone will automatically be created for you, centered at the cursor position. Blender will then switch straight to Edit mode to allow you to add further bones. At this point we're just defining the default 'rest' position of the bones and specifying how they connect together -- you'll have to wait until [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/pose|the next chapter]] to find out how to create specific poses.

== Now the basics about bones ==
[[Image:Bone_ana.jpg|right]]
Having created and selected an armature in Object mode, you can add and modify the bones in this armature by switching to Edit mode.
*You can add a new bone at cursor position by pressing SPACEKEY in the 3DView --&gt; Add --&gt; Armature.
*A bone has two ends: a root (the lower part) and a tip (the upper part). You can select and move the tip or the root independently with RMB, or you can select the entire bone by clicking on its body.
*You can extrude a new bone from the selection using EKEY. This will create a bone connected to the original one, meaning the Root of the new bone will follow the Tip of the original one. You can also CTRL-LMB to extrude a new bone. It will extrude to where you clicked.
*Alternatively, you can connect two existing bones by selecting them one after the other and pressing CTRL-PKEY. You can then choose either 'Connected' (the child bone - the one you selected first - will automatically be moved so that it touches the parent) or 'Keep offset'.
*You can use SHIFT-DKEY to duplicate a bone
*Using the WKEY menu, You can subdivide your bone or flip the name of the bone between Left-Right (See Naming convention below).
*You can delete the bone with XKEY
*You can select a chain of bones (connected together) using LKEY, when you hover your mouse over a bone.

== The edit panel ==
[[Image:Edit_panel_bones.jpg]]

*Armature Bones Panel
**OB: this field lets you rename your bone.
**&quot;Child of&quot; Dropdown: lets you choose which bone will be the parent of this bone. If a parent is selected, there will be a small button labelled &quot;con&quot;, meaning connected. Setting the parent defines the relationship between your bones. When one bone has another as its parent, it will do everything the parent does, such as rotate, move and scale. A dotted line between the parent and child will appear. If you select Connected, the Root of the Children will go stick to the tip of the parent, giving you a chain of bones like the 2 bones in your arm.[[Image:Ie_Parent_bones.jpg|none]]
**Segm: If you set this value to something greater than 1, it will cut your bone into several little segments and deform them on a bezier curve - referred to as a 'B-Bone'. You need to create a chain of bones to really show off this feature though. In the example below, the image on the right has 1 segment, and the one on the left has 3 segments each (these are shown in Object mode to show the effect more clearly):[[Image:Ie_bbones.jpg|none]]
**Dist: This is the area of influence of the bone. It can be visualised using the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/env|Envelope]] display mode. We generally don't touch this field as there is an easier and faster way to change this option. Turn Envelope on and select a bone. Then using ALT-S, you can scale the zone of influence. This has the advantage that you can do it on multiple bones simultaneously, and it works in both editmode and posemode:[[Image:Ie_envelope.jpg|none]]
**Weight: This specifies how strongly this bone will influence the geometry around it, relative to the other bones. If two bones crossing each other, both with envelope influence, have the same weight (like 1:1) they will influence the surrounding geometry equally. But if you set one to 0.5, the geometry will be affected more significantly by the other one, with weight 1. For example, in this image, 2 bones using envelope influence try to move the same geometry. The 2 on the left have the same weight, you can see the geometry didn't move. On the right, one of the bones has 0.5 so the bone with weight 1 is winning the tug-of-war!:[[Image:Ie_Weight.jpg|none]]
**Hinge: This tells the bone to remain motionless in a chain. It doesn't copy the rotation and scale of the parent. Useful for mechanical rig I would say, as you can animate the rotation of the hinge bone without having to correct it because the parent rotated: [[Image:Ie_hinge.jpg|none]]
**Deform: This lets you say if you want the bone to deform the geometry at all. Switching it off is like setting the weight to 0, except it's faster this way. Useful when using a bone as a target or a controller, i.e. a bone you just want to use to control other bones, but not the geometry itself.
**Mult: to deform geometry you can use [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/vg|vertex group]] and/or [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/env|Envelope]]. The ability to mix both of these methods is handy for using one to tweak the other. For example, you might use envelope everywhere but tweak difficult places manually with vertex group. We'll discuss this in more detail later on.
**Hide: This option lets you hide the bone. You can use it to hide the less important bones when you want to see what you're doing or for when you come to animate later on. For example, when you animate you don't need to see the entire chain of the leg, just the controllers. The values you select here apply to both Editmode and Posemode.

== Naming convention ==
In many cases, rigs are symmetrical and can be mirrored in half. In these cases, it is helpful to use a left-right naming convention. This is not only useful for your own sake, but it gives Blender a hint that there is a pair of equivalent bones, and enables the use of some very cool tools that will save you some significant work.

*It's helpful to name your bones with something useful telling you what it's there for, such as leg, arm, finger, back, foot, etc. 
*If you get a bone that has a copy on the other side, however, like the arm (you have 2 arms right?), then the convention is to call them arm.Left and arm.Right.
*Other alternatives are also possible, like _L, _LEFT, _left, .L, and .Left. Anyway, when you rig try to keep this left-right thing as accurate as possible; it will pay off later on. 
*You can copy a bone named blah.L and flip it over using WKEY --&gt; flip name. So the bone will be blah.L.001 after you copy it, and flipping the name will give you blah.R. Blender handily detects if the .001 version already exists, and increments the number for you.

This is an example of naming in a simple rig:

[[Image:Ie_bonesname.jpg]]

== Mirror Editing ==
Now we come to the X-Axis Mirror Edit feature.
This handy little number allows you to define only half of your character and tell Blender to automatically repeat the same actions on the other side. It's cool, it's simple and it saves a whole lot of time.

We will create a little guy out of sticks for the occasion -- don't worry about the geometry yet.

* Create a new, empty scene. Since the mirror editing feature mirrors along the X Axis, make sure you've got the front view selected (NUMPAD_1KEY) so that the X Axis runs from left to right. Add a new armature to the scene (SPACE, Add|Armature). Enable 'Draw names' from the 'Display options' section of the Editbutton panel, so we can see what we're doing. 
* Now enable mirror editing by pressing F9 on the buttons window and clicking the '''X-Axis Mirror''' button in the '''Armature''' panel under '''Editing options'''.  You'll also need to use the center of the armature (indicated by a purple dot) as the center of your rig, otherwise the symmetry will go wrong when we come to create the mirror image.
*Name the first bone you have &quot;Back&quot;. You can scale it to make the entire back of the guy.
*Select the tip of this and extrude a new bone from it to do the Head. Name it Head.
*Select the tip of Back again and do '''SHIFT-EKEY''' to tell Blender you're starting a '''mirrored''' chain of bones. Blender will automatically extrude another bone and will create an exact mirror of whatever you do. Take note that the name of both bones are Back_L and Back_R. Blender also tries to keep to the naming convention. Unfortunately, since we extruded from the Back bone, the names aren't quite right anymore.


*To change the names: Start by editing one of the names as Arm. Add the suffix to it (_L or _R). Then hover your mouse over the name field and do CTRL-CKEY. You just copied the name of the bone! Select the other bone, hover you mouse over the name field and do CTRL-VKEY. This will paste the name as-is. But as there is already a bone with the same name, Blender will add .001 after it. No problem; just go into 3Dview and do WKEY --&gt; Flip name. There you have it -- a working mirror again.
*Mirror editing works using names. If you move a bone named blah_L and there is a bone named blah_R in the same armature, Blender will mirror the move you do to it, so make sure you follow name convention correctly.
*Then we can continue: extrude an other bone to make the lower part of the arm using EKEY or CTRL-LMB. The new set of bones should be arm_L.001 arm_R.001.
*Then we will add the legs. Up till now we have always worked from the tips of the bone. This is easy as Blender understands you want to create children of the selected bone, but to make the legs you need to extrude from the root of &quot;Back&quot;. So go ahead, select the root of &quot;Back&quot; and do SHIFT-EKEY to start a pair of chains. Rename them to &quot;leg&quot;+suffix.
*Now take note that doing so will not parent or connect the new bones to anything. We don't want it to be connected to the tip of &quot;Back&quot;, it would look silly. But we want it to follow the body!
* The way to go is to parent the two legs we just created to the &quot;Back&quot; bone. The old way (pre 2.40) was to select all bone and select the parent manually in the drop down. In the new version, editmode and posemode have an ''active bone''. The active bone is the last bone you selected. In this case we can't work with more than 2 bones selected. Select the child (a leg) then select the parent (Back) and Do CTRL-PKEY. A menu will popup asking ''Connected'' or ''Keep offset''. For now use ''Keep offset''.  Do this for the other leg as well.
*it's also possible to remove parent easily. Select any bone you want to remove parent relation from and do ALT-PKEY. A menu will popup asking if you want to clear all or just to unconnect. Of course you don't need to select the parent and/or the child for this to work since any parent relationship will be cleared. So if you do that on a bone which is parent of 5 bones, then immediately all the children will be parentless.
*Extrude one more time to get a leg with 2 bones.
*Turn on the Stick display mode and enjoy your guy made of sticks!

[[Image:Ie_stick_guy.jpg]]

*Now you can go into Posemode and pose your guy as you want.
*You can move the entire guy just by moving the &quot;Back&quot; bone, since this is how we built him. This bone is the highest in the bone hierarchy, &quot;The daddy of all bones&quot;, you could say!

FASTER WAY TO NAME YOUR BONES
1) Create one side of the armature complete with correct bone names like the way this tutorial describes.
2) Copy the side of the armature you just created and paste it on the opposite side to form a complete armature.
3) On the side that you just duplicated, your names would have numbers added to them. Now select each bone on 3D View and  hit &quot;W&quot;   then select &quot;FLIP NAME&quot;. MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTING IS THE SAME AS THIS TUTORIAL DESCRIBES!</text>

This module of ''Embedded Systems'' is a very brief review of the most popular microprocessor families used in embedded systems.
We will go into more detail in the next few modules. Each one of these microprocessor families has an entire module dedicated to that family of processors.

The microprocessor families we will discuss are:

''This section should not give pages to each individual chips, but instead pages should only be devoted to particular microprocessor families''.

Do not add multiple pages for individual microcontrollers.

Please *do* add pages and listings for microcontroller families. For instance &quot;PIC Microcontrollers&quot; is acceptable, but &quot;PIC 16C55A&quot; is not.

== brief selection guide ==

For many embedded systems, any of these microcontrollers would be more than adequate.

* TI MSP430 has the lowest power consumption. In sleep mode, 0.3 &amp;micro;W = 3 V * 0.1 &amp;micro;A. Some chips in 2xx and 4xx series include 12-bit DACs.
* The Cypress PSoC has more than one true analog output. Using sleep mode, power consumption as low as 21 &amp;micro;W = 5 V * 4.2 &amp;micro;A[http://www.psocdeveloper.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2953]. (You can get analog output from the other chips by using an external ADC, or by faking it with a PWM output and some low-pass filtering.) Most Cypress PSoC microcontrollers come in both DIP and SMT versions.
* Many of these series include microcontrollers with integrated 10 bit ADCs, but Atmel AVR 8 bit series (as of early 2006) had the lowest-price chip that included such an ADC, as well as another chip with the lowest cost/ADC. Most Atmel AVR 8 bit microcontrollers come in both DIP and SMT versions.
* If you need a very tiny chip, the Atmel AVR, PIC, PSoC1, and Freescale microcontroller lines all include tiny 8-pin SOIC microprocessors.
* If you want a 32 bit processor, some Philips ARM processors and Freescale Coldfire processors are now under $5 for one. (only comes in LQFP64 ?).
* If you want a 32-bit processor, and you want it in a (relatively) easy-to-prototype DIP package, and you want it currently in production, your choices are extremely limited:&lt;ref&gt;

* Many people and several commercial products run Linux on a XScale microprocessor or a Atmel AT91RM9200 (ARM core), without a heatsink or fan. Linux has also been ported to the Atmel AVR32 AP7 family [http://atmel.com/dyn/corporate/view_detail.asp?FileName=AT32AP7001_6_4.html] (only comes in a 208-pin VQFP). Linux has also been ported to Freescale 68k/ColdFire processors. I don't think Linux has been ported to any of the other processors mentioned above.

* If you often want to download and run new code on the processor, it makes things easier if the processor is a &quot;Princeton architecture&quot; that can execute instructions in RAM -- a processor such as a MSP430 or ARM processor or PIC32 MIPS processor or the Parallax Propeller or Freescale RS08 or M·CORE. It is more difficult (but, as the Arduino demonstrates, not impossible) to download and run new code on a &quot;Harvard architecture&quot; that cannot execute instructions in RAM, such as most 8051 and Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR chips.

Most of these adapters are designed to have the microcontroller at the device end, and a PC on the host end. These adapters are full speed (12Mbps) USB devices, but don't expect them to be fast, most of them emulate a serial port with baud rates up to about 1 Mbps.

Welcome to your first year as:  The Teacher.  Holding this title entails all sorts of possibilities, responsibilities, and challenges.  Being a teacher in today's classroom requires more than knowing about a subject matter or about child psychology.  Teachers must juggle a gazillion different things at once, including classroom interactions with all kinds of students and the tremendous amounts of paperwork that pile up on the desk.  

This book presents a set of guidelines and advice for those who find themselves teaching their first year at the K-12 level.  As a beginning teacher (or experienced teacher wanting to revisit some key concepts about teaching), you are encouraged to use this as a resource.  The authors of this text have crafted the book into various modules.  Feel free to pick and choose which modules you need and when.

We have divided the text into these core areas:  What to expect, The First Days of School, The School Environment, Planning for Learning, Student Discipline, Legal Stuff You Need to Know and the Substitute Teacher.  A final section, called Trouble Shooting, provides a way for the new teacher to post a short situation or question not addressed in the text and have authors respond accordingly.

When talking about Intel microprocessors, the first words that come to mind might be &quot;Pentium&quot; or &quot;Celeron&quot;, or any of the other high-performance, expensive PC chips that are on the market today. However, Intel maintains a very impressive list of legacy parts that can be adapted for embedded systems. The beauty of using these microprocessors is that they are frequently very cheap, and they will all use the standard x86 assembly language, so that developers can program, assemble, and test from the comfort of a PC.

== 8086 and 80186 ==

8086 and 80186 processors are available in heavily integrated packages. They are usually available in DIP form, and are relatively cheap (10$ or 15$ range). These processors might not be as good as an 8051 in an embedded environment, but the ease of programming, and the familiarity that many programmers will feel for these chips can more than make up for the cost.

== i386 Embedded Processors ==

The i386 microprocessor is a modified form of the Intel 80386 microprocessor with a few notable differences: an integrated FPU (originally wasn't standard until th 80486), and a variety of different, small form-factors. One of the major benefits of an i386 microprocessor is that it can be programmed easily using most standard C compilers and x86 assembly language. In fact, many times no additional settings need to be changed in the compiler, except maybe to not link to the standard libraries on the host system.

i386 processors are 32 bit processors, and are frequently very economical choices when a 32bit processor is required. Also, i386 processors frequently have very low power consumption, and generate very little heat. Remember, Intel has been working on this architecture and the general design of this chip continuously for many years now.

== X-Scale Embedded Processors ==

The X-Scale processor is an [[Embedded_Systems/ARM_Microprocessors|ARM]] based device, designed for embedded systems requiring high performance with low power consumption, such as PDA's.

== Other Chips ==

Intel does sell embedded varieties of all its chips, from the 486 up to the Pentium 4. Keep in mind, however, that these chips have all the power of their PC cousins, but in a smaller package. Therefore, it can be expected that they will all be ''considerably more expensive'' then the desktop chips. Also, with some of the higher performance chips (pentium and up), since the size has been aggressively reduced, and because they have been highly integrated for embedded environments, heat can become an issue (meaning you will need to invest in fans and heat sinks as well).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==
[[Image:Cities of Sumer (en).svg|thumbnail|300px|right|Sumerians cities.]]
The Sumerians lived in '''Mesopotamia''' around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or &quot;the Fertile Crescent&quot; was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf.  Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia.  Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit.

Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practicing agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities because of the development of farming. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar.  The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:UR 17 01 2004 003.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Ziggurat in Ur.]]

The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick.

Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame.  The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top.  The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today.  Hot sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened.  Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings.  Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls.  Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls.

The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the ''' Ziggurat '''. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like Egyptian pyramids, or wedding cakes.  Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top.  Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building.  This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air.  There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there,   built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings.

Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs.  We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess.  They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud.

== What did they eat? ==
As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods. 

Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people.  Sheep and goats were probably more common.  The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing, armor, or tools.

== What did they wear? ==

Their clothing was mostly made out of wool and flax. flax is a plant with blue flowers. the stem of flax was used in making the clothing. clothing was also made out of other products they could grow themselves.

The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and breast were left bare.

Sumerian women also wore their hair long. Most women would braid their locks into one long braid which they then wrapped around the top of their heads. when there were guests around women would wear a headdress. 

Princesses wore bright colored clothes and expensive jewelry made out of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian. 

Heavier clothing was worn in the winter and lighter clothing was worn in the summer.

Social status was determined by the quantity and quality of jewelry and clothing a person owned but they did not wear a lot of clothing because of where they lived (in a warm, dry climate).

== What did their writing look like? ==

[[Image:Cuneiform script2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cuneiform tablet]]

Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of ''' reed ''' – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a ''' stylus '''. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called ''' Cuneiform ''', which means &quot;wedge-shaped&quot;.

Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called ''scribes'', were able to read and write.  The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures.  After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures.  

Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes.  They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well.  Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees.  They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city.  The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra.  After learning many words, scribes practiced making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs.  This made them fast and accurate scribes.

Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60.  So the number &quot;157&quot; would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157).  Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not.  Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar.

[[Image:Fragment Bau Louvre AO4572.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Sumerian Goddess]]

== What did they believe? ==
Sumerians had many gods. An was the god of the sky, Enki the god of water, Enlil the god of air, Ki the goddess of the earth, Inanna the goddess of fertility and many more. Plus, they had lots of local deities; each town had its own.

The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart.  In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake.  An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so.  But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense.  Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise.  

Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air.  Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat.  The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last.  Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans.

A version of this story is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is repeated in the Christian Bible.

==What is their history?==

The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East. 

The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains.

After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after.They had over 100 gods.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the '''Epic of Gilgamesh''', a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality.

In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh.  As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends.  Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized.  Both grow up to be very handsome.

Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree.  Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest.  Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree.  Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree.

But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry.  Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband.  But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you.  Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death.  Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail.  

Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it.  But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies.  Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend.  He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils.  Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself.  His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it.  He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal.

He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth.  He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive.  He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster.  However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired.  The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth.  Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever.  Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble.

The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah’s Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days.  Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat.  No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise.  Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman.

The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water.  If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life.  Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him.  He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water.  There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant.   Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing.  He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone.

== What is left of them today? ==
Though Sumerians as an ethnic group do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They were the first people to use natural forces to do some of their own work by fitting sails to boats. They were also the first to make astronomical observations, and to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain.

Recent collaboration between archeologists and DNA analysts tell that there is a strong connection between the marsh Arabs of Iraq and Iran and the Sumerian culture.

== New Map ==

The current map we have has far to much information, much of which doesn't relate to the Sumerians. I have created a map which is accurate enough. I do, however, recognize that it is in its rough form and needs more work. Feal free to work on it as you see fit.

In the original DOS operating system, there was no capability for multi-threading, or multi-process mechanisms. However, it was found to be very beneficial to leave certain components in memory even after the process that created it ended. These program fragments were known as '''Terminate and Stay Resident''' modules, and were the precursors to the dynamic library infrastructure of current Windows operating systems. TSR routines are often used to implement device drivers, or common library functions.

There are a number of different random distributions in existence, many of which have been studied quite extensively, and many of which map very well to natural phenomena. This book will attempt to cover some of the most basic and most common distributions. This chapter will also introduce the idea of a distribution transformation, which can be used to turn a simple distribution into a more exotic distribution.

== Uniform Distribution ==

One of the most simple distributions is a Uniform Distribution. Uniform Distributions are also very easy to model on a computer, and then they can be converted to other distribution types by a series of transforms.

A uniform distribution has a PDF that is a rectangle. This rectangle is centered about the mean, &lt;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, has a width of ''A'', and a height of ''1/A''. This definition ensures that the total area under the PDF is 1.

== Gaussian Distribution ==

{{Matlab CMD|randn}}

The Gaussian (or normal) distribution is simultaneously one of the most common distributions, and also one of the most difficult distributions to work with. The problem with the Gaussian distribution is that it's pdf equation is ''non-integratable'', and therefore there is no way to find a general equation for the cdf (although some approximations are available), and there is little or no way to directly calculate certain probabilities. However, there are ways to approximate these probabilities from the Gaussian pdf, and many of the common results have been tabulated in table-format. The function that finds the area under a part of the Gaussian curve (and therefore the probability of an event under that portion of the curve) is known as the Q function, and the results are tabulated in a Q table.

=== PDF and CDF ===
The PDF of a Gaussian random variable is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The CDF of the Gaussian function is the integral of this, which any mathematician will tell you is impossible to express in terms of regular functions.

=== The Functions &amp;Phi; and Q ===
The normal distribution with parameters &amp;mu; = 0 and &amp;sigma; = 1, the so-called standard normal distribution, plays an important role, because all other normal distributions may be derived from it. The CDF of the standard normal distribution is often indicated by &amp;Phi;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^x e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}dt&lt;/math&gt;.

It gives the probability for a standard normal distributed random variable to attain values less than x.

The Q function is the area under the right tail of the Gaussian curve and hence nothing more than 1 - &amp;Phi;. The Q function is hence defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_x^\infty e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}dt&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematical texts might prefer to use the erf(x) and erfc(x) functions, which are similar. However this book (and engineering texts in general) will utilize the Q and Phi functions.

== Poisson Distribution ==

The Poisson Distribution is different from the Gaussian and uniform distributions in that the Poisson Distribution only describes discrete data sets. For instance, if we wanted to model the number of telephone calls that are traveling through a given switch at one time, we cannot possibly count fractions of a phone call; phone calls come only in integer numbers. Also, you can't have a negative number of phone calls. It turns out that such situations can be easily modeled by a Poisson Distribution. Some general examples of Poisson Distribution random events are:

#The telephone calls arriving at a switch
#The internet data packets traveling through a given network
#The number of cars traveling through a given intersection

== Transformations ==

If we have a random variable that follows a particular distribution, we would frequently like to transform that random process to use a different distribution. For instance, if we write a computer program that generates a uniform distribution of random numbers, and we would like to write one that generates a Gaussian distribution instead, we can feed the uniform numbers into a transform, and the output will be random numbers following a Gaussian distribution. Conversely, if we have a random variable in a strange, exotic distribution, and we would like to examine it using some of the easy, tabulated Gaussian distribution tools, we can transform it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">No engineering structure can be built on the ground or within it without the influence of geology being experienced by the engineer. Yet geology must remain an ancillary subject to students of engineering and it is therefore essential that their training is supported by a concise, reliable and usable text on the subject of geology and its relationship to engineering. In this book all the fundamental aspects of geology are described and explained, but within the limits thought suitable for engineers.

The structure of the Earth and the operation of its internal processes are described, together with the geological processes that shape and fashion the Earth and produce its rocks and soils. The commonly occurring types of rock and soil, and many types of geological structure and geological maps, are described. Throughout this book care has been taken to focus on the relationship between geology and geomechanics. For this reason emphasis has been placed on the geological processes that bear directly upon the composition, structure and mechanics of soil and rocks, and on the movement of groundwater.

      <comment>/* Expected Value Operator */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signals and Systems Page}}

== Expected Value Operator ==

The Expected value operator is a linear operator that provides a mathematical way to determine a number of different parameters of a random distribution. The downside of course is that the expected value operator is in the form of an integral, which can be difficult to calculate.

The expected value operator will be denoted by the symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[\cdot]&lt;/math&gt;

For a random variable ''X'' with probability density ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', the expected value is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

provided the integral exists.

The '''Expectation''' of a signal is the result of applying the expected value operator to that signal. The expectation is another word for the mean of a signal:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_x = \mathbb{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt;

== Moments ==

The expected value of the ''N''-th power of ''X'' is called the ''N''-th moment of ''X'' or of its distribution:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Some moments have special names, and each one describes a certain aspect of the distribution.

== Central Moments ==
Once we know the expected value of a distribution, we know its location. We may consider all other moments relative to this location and calculate the ''N''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moment of the random variable ''X'' - E[X]; the result is called the '''N&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; central moment''' of the distribution. Each central moment has a different meaning, and describes a different facet of the random distribution. The ''N''-th central moment of ''X'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mathbb{E}[X])^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

For sake of simplicity in the notation, the first moment, the expected value is named:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu_X&lt;/math&gt;,

The formula for the ''N''-th central moment of ''X'' becomes then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu_X)^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mu_X)^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

It is obvious that the first central moment is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu_X)] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The second central moment is the variance,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu_X)^2] = \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; 


=== Variance ===

The variance, the second central moment, is denoted using the symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 =\mathrm{var}(X)= \mathbb{E}[X - \mathbb{E}[X]]^2= \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Standard Deviation ===

The standard deviation of a random distribution is the square root of the variance, and is given as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \sqrt{\sigma_x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Moment Generating Functions ==

== Time-Average Operator ==

The time-average operator provides a mathematical way to determine the average value of a function over a given time range. The time average operator can provide the mean value of a given signal, but most importantly it can be used to find the average value of a small sample of a given signal. The operator also allows us a useful shorthand way for taking the average, which is used in many equations.

The time average operator is denoted by angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) and is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;</text>

One of the most useful developments in the history of computing is multitasking and multithreading. This technique isn't always available to an embedded system engineer, but some embedded systems and RTOS have multithreading (MT) capability. The chapters in this section will talk about some of the uses of MT, and will discuss some of the common pitfalls associated with MT programming. This page is only going to serve as a brief reference to multi-threaded programming. 

== Preemptive Multithreading ==

When the first multi-tasking systems were established, they did not have a central controller. Multi-tasking was established by having programs voluntarily give up control to the system, and the system would then give control to another process. This system worked reasonably well, except that any program that was misbehaving would slow down the entire system. For instance, if a program got stuck in an infinite loop, it would never give up control, and the system would freeze. 

The solution to this problem is '''preemptive multithreading'''. In a preemptive environment, control could be moved from one process to another process at any given time. The process that was &quot;preempted&quot; would not even know that anything had happened, except maybe there would be a larger than average delay between 2 instructions. Preemptive multithreading allows for programs that do not voluntarily give up control, and it also allows a computer to continue functioning when a single process hangs. 

There are a number of problems associated with preemptive multithreading that all stem from the fact that control is taken away from one process when it is not necessarily prepared to give up control. For instance, if one process were writing to a memory location, and was preempted, the next process would see half-written data, or even corrupted data in that memory location. Or, if a task was reading in data from an input port, and it was preempted, the timing would be wrong, and data would be missed from the line. Clearly, this is unacceptable.

The solution to this new problem then is the idea of synchronization. Synchronization is a series of tools provided by the preemptive multithreaded operating system to ensure that these problems are avoided. Synchronization tools can include timers, &quot;critical sections,&quot; and locks. Timers can ensure that a given process may be preempted, but only for a certain time. Critical sections are commands in the code that prevent the system from switching control for a certain time. Locks are commands that prevent interference in atomic operations. These topics will all be discussed in the following chapters.

== Mutexes ==

The term '''Mutex''' is short for &quot;Mutual Exclusion&quot;, and is a type of mechanism used in a preemptive environment that can prevent unauthorized access to resources that are currently in use. Mutexes follow several rules:

#Mutexes are system wide objects, that are maintained by the kernel.
#Mutexes can only be owned by one process at a time
#Mutexes can be acquired by asking the kernel to allocate that mutex to the current task
#If a Mutex is already allocated, the request function will block until the mutex is available.

In general, it is considered good programming practice to release mutexes as quickly as possible. Some problems with mutexes will be discussed in the chapter on deadlocks.

== Spin Locks ==

Spin locks is a quick form of synchronization methods. It is named after its behavior - spin in the loop while the condition is false. To implement spin lock system should support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-and-set test-and-set] idiom or give exclusive access to a locking thread by any means (masking interrupts, locking bus).

An advantage of spin locks is that they are very simple. A disadvantage is that they waste CPU cycles in loop waiting. Most common use of spin locks is to synchronize quick access to objects. It is not advisable to do a long computations while spin locked a section.

== Sentinels ==

== Critical Sections ==

A critical section is a sequence of computer instructions that may malfunction if interrupted.  An atomic operation is a sequence of computer instructions that cannot be interrupted and function correctly.  In practice, these two subtly different definitions are often combined.  Operating systems provide synchronization objects to meet these requirements, and some actually call these objects as &quot;critical sections,&quot; &quot;atomic operations&quot; or &quot;monitors.&quot;  

An example of a critical section is code that removes data from a queue that is filled by an interrupt.  If the critical section is not protected, the interrupt can occur while the dequeuing function is changing pointers, and corrupt the queue pointers.  An example of an atomic operation is an I/O read where the process must read all the data at a particular rate, and cannot be preempted while reading.

A generally good programming practice is to have programs exit their critical sections as quickly as possible, because holding a critical section for too long will cause other processes on the system not to get any time, and will cause a major performance decrease. Critical sections should be used with care.

== Priority Scheduling ==

Many RTOS have a mechanism to distinguish the relative priorities of different tasks. High-priority tasks are executed more frequently than the low priority tasks. Each implementation of priority scheduling will be a little different, however. 

== Deadlock ==

A '''deadlock''' occurs when a series of synchronization objects are held in a preemptive MT system in such a way that no process can move forward. Let us take a look at an example:

Let's say that we have 2 threads: T1 and T2. We also have 2 mutexes, M1 and M2.
#T1 asks for and acquires mutex M1. 
#T2 acquires M2
#T1 asks for M2, and the system transfers control to T2 until T2 releases M2.
#T2 asks for M1, and the system is in deadlock (neither thread can continue until the other releases it's mutex).

This is a very difficult problem to diagnose, and an even more difficult problem to fix. This chapter will provide some general guide-lines for preventing deadlocks.

== Watchdog Timer ==
See [[../Watchdog Timer]].

== reading counters without locking ==

==== read twice and compare ====

Perhaps the most common concurrency algorithm used in embedded systems is the &quot;read the counter twice and compare&quot; optimistic concurrency control pattern.

Many hardware timers and hardware counters are connected to the CPU over an 8-bit bus.
If the low byte of the timer happens to be 0xFF when we start to read the timer,
if the timer increments between two byte reads, a simple read of each byte separately will get a corrupted value.&lt;ref&gt;
A few timers, such as the Atmel AVR timers, fix this with hardware.
Those times have special additional hardware so that, when the program reads the low byte,
all the remaining bytes of the timer are simultaneously latched into a hardware temporary register.
Later the CPU can read each byte from the temporary latch (while the timer itself continues to count) without corruption.

2002.

Unfortunately, sometimes
the main application needs to read one 16-bit register that uses a hardware temporary register,
and an interrupt routine needs to read a (the same or some other) 16-bit register that overwrites the same temporary register.
Then the main application will occasionally get a corrupted value.

[http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/FAQ.html#faq_16bitio &quot;AVR Libc FAQ: Why do some 16-bit timer registers sometimes get trashed?&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
We get a slightly different corrupted value if we read the low byte first vs. the low byte last,
but it's corrupted either way.

One simple solution is to read the counter twice and compare:&lt;ref&gt;

&quot;since the read data is not held (the data may be changing), to obtain accurate data the countdown status should be read twice and then compared.&quot;

subsection: &quot;How to 'read' a timer?&quot;.
says:
&quot;... The lower byte is correctly read (255), but at the moment the program counter was about to read the higher byte TH0, an overflow occurred and the contents of both registers have been changed (TH0: 14→15, TL0: 255→0). This problem has a simple solution. The higher byte should be read first, then the lower byte and once again the higher byte. If the number stored in the higher byte is different then this sequence should be repeated. It's about a short loop consisting of only 3 instructions in the program. ...
another solution ... is ... turn the timer off while reading ... and turn it on again after reading is finished.&quot;

Because no locks are used, the double-read algorithm avoids deadlocks, avoids priority inversion, and avoids other problems with locks.

There are many other algorithms based on this read-twice-and-compare algorithm.

For example, the seqlocks used in Linux use this read-twice-and-compare algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: seqlock]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Chapter
[http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-5-sect-7 &quot;Alternatives to Locking&quot;]
O'Reilly 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, single-reader single-writer ring buffers are also common in embedded systems, and both the reader and the writer can be implemented with a similar lock-free algorithm.

==== incrementing counter ====

When the read-twice-and-compare algorithm is used to synchronize several processes
(rather than, as above, a hardware counter and a process that reads the counter),
the process that changes the counter needs to make that change in a way that appears atomic to the other process.

Many architectures have a single instruction that can atomically increment a variable.
Alas, the exact details vary from one architecture to another, and from one C compiler to another.
Some relatively portable ways to tell the C compiler to atomically increment a variable
involve
the std::atomic template class from the standard Atomic operations library, part of the C11 standard for the C programming language;&lt;ref&gt;
http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic
&lt;/ref&gt;
or
the tbb::atomic template class;
or
the boost::atomic template class;
etc.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// rough draft -- untested code

__interrupt_handler h(){
        // ...
        // inside interrupt handler, interrupts are already turned off, so it's safe to increment the counter
        raw_counter++;
        // ...
}

// using CAS to update the counter is safe even if interrupts are turned on.
// inspired by example_atomic_inc() in
// https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/atomic_ops.txt
void increment_counter(long *counter){
	do{
		long old = *counter;
		long new = old + 1;
		// requires #include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;
		long ret = atomic_compare_exchange_strong( counter, old, new );
	}while(ret != old)
        return ret;
}

// only use if interrupts are turned on, and it's not a multiprocessor machine:
void increment_counter(long *counter){
    disable_interupts();
        (*counter)++;
    enable_interrupts();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The main problem with the double-read algorithm is the ABA problem.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: ABA problem]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid the ABA problem, we use counters that only count up,&lt;ref&gt;
Counters that only count down are also fine.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and we give the counter enough bits that, for any reasonable amount of time a thread could possibly be delayed between reading the first byte of the first read and the last byte of the second read (say, maximum 1 second),
the counter is long enough that at the worst-case (highest-frequency) count rate it takes much longer than that -- say, the minimum time to overflow is once every 10 seconds.

For example, up-down counters can be synthesized from 2 counters, one that only counts up, and the other that only counts down.

== Note from John Burkitt ==

Thanks for the kind words.  Wikipedia and Wikibooks are wonderful resources and they capture all the best of what makes the internet great.  You may not know this, but of the titles published by traditional houses, two out of every three are reissues of classics that are guaranteed to sell...either as texts for literature classes or as ''must haves'' to gather dust on a bookshelf.  Of the remaining third, much of it is by the ''If you write it they will come'' rich and famous with juicy secrets about what it's like to make out with Donald Trump or order a low level operative in the CIA to take the heat.  That leaves a number of ''by the author of'' books that people will buy because he/she also wrote ''Galaxy of Blood''.  Maybe one out of ten books is really an innovative title by a new author.  The odds are stacked against new talent, or at least they were until the Internet.  Wikipedia is unique in that it capitalizes on the idealism, fire, and social conscience of a wide spectrum of our society.  People like you who make this resource work are my heroes.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 02:04, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== Don't Hold Your Breath ==

I know you would like to have Jimbo make some kind of conciliatory remark about his actions, but my experience in dealing with him is that he seldom gets involved in day-to-day matters of projects like Wikibooks directly.  It is interesting that he gave himself admin privileges for Wikibooks at the same time he put up the notice of speedy delete on [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  I don't know if he intended to use it or if that was merely a threat.

I have made a comment about this whole thing on [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-November/005085.html Foundation-l] and the response has been very interesting to say the very least.  At least this is bring the issue up to the larger Wikimedia community, including the other board members... although I'm not sure if they are going to speak out against Jimbo here.  This is going to be rather interesting to say the least about how this is going to be resolved.

The main point I want to make is that we as a community need to decide if we accept or reject Jimbo's &quot;ruling&quot; on this matter, and more importantly on how to change policy to fit this new reality.  Thank you for pointing out that Wikibooks has been sent into a tailspin over this issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:55, 19 November 2005 (UTC)



== Game Manuals ==

I certainly understand what you have been saying about the game manuals. However, they have not previously been considered to be against policy, they are not explicitly against policy, jimbo did not specifically say they were against policy (although admittedly he got close). I think that at the moment it is a waste of time to fight this fight. Until we can get an enforced policy, in writing, the community will never justify the mass deletion of all the game manuals. If you want to start targeting manuals, then don't go for something so big as the pokedex: It's a high profile book with a large following. Pick the smaller books that are in a state of disrepair.

We should also probably post a prominent link in the community portal to let people know that there is currently a debate on the game manual topic, and we can call an official vote on the issue soon. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)



== Question about a block ==

I prefer to block an IP listed on SORBS whatever he contributes. If he really wants to help Wikibooks, he will log from normal IP or complain that he is not an open proxy. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

==Thanks for the message==

I think our only real problem is that we're 2 very opinionated people who love the project, and have different ideas of whats best for it.  Given that, I can't promise we won't butt heads again in the future, but I think we can put this recent argument behind us.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:19, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

==Oops, I edited from a history==

Really sorry about that.  I was backpaging through the history of the page (thats how I normally read those megapages, so I can keep track of what has changed-  they're too long to read every time I go to the site).  I must have hit the edit from the history text tab rather than the current text tab.  I didn't actually mean to delete those, just to add my comment and vote.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

: On the original proposal to the Beck Foundation (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior/proposal_to_Beck_Foundation), we said it would be printed by December 2005. All good printers likely have a backlog of jobs, because they're so in demand. Plus, I have to preflight the file to make sure it will print. So, sooner is better than later.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

::Well, thanks for the response. So what is going to happen to the Solar System book? I thought that that book was going to be the first to print. Maybe I read that wrong somewhere. Anyway, do we even know who is going to be doing the printing or distributing?

I'm glad you like them.  I'm planning on doing one for each cat, but it takes longer with really big ranges.  Hopefully I'll be done today or else later this weekend.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 18:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Marbled Cat ==
It is correctly considered a big cat, though it's the size of your average house cat.  More closely related to the leopard than the cougar, it's really quite an oddity.  I added it in a hurry.  You can still smell the tire skid marks where I rushed to get this one in under the wire.  By all means take a lookie.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 02:07, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Debate ==

Hello. I have seen the Staff Lounge discussions and the matter seems to have ended. Wales came in and did some rather unusual things, there was a reaction, and now everything has passed. Perhaps you had some justification mentioning ''the debate'' three weeks ago, but I think you were pushing your opinion when you announced that the Muggles' Guide was inappropriate for Wikibooks. The community decided the appropriateness of the Guide months ago and that was settled. One user will not come in and totally change all policies. Those discussing with you in Staff Lounge made it quite clear that you had a misrepresentation of Wikibooks policies and I think many more would agree with them. I believe your actions on Wikipedia were inappropriate since they effectively '''did''' scare others about the project. In the end, I just want to make sure there isn't trouble caused that doesn't need to be. Hit me at my Talk page if you need. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 18:38, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
:I believe that since you wrote the statements yourself (obviously), you don't see how they can be seen as inappropriate. Your point of view should not affect what you say to others at Wikipedia. As a reader, I see you saying &quot;this book is going to be deleted so we need to figure out what's going to happen with some of the content.&quot; You were not very suggestive and were instead telling the audience what would happen. You should have exercised more grace and given a &quot;heads up&quot; instead of a plan of action based on your opinion of what would happen. Your statements of how the Guide &quot;is&quot; this and &quot;isn't&quot; that shouldn't be placed in the same location as your so-called &quot;informative&quot; message. Bolding the word &quot;might&quot; doesn't help explain the point of view you laced in with your message. Wikibooks changes will come at a gradual pace (and quite gradual at that since I think the Wales edit issues were rather random and current policy overwhelmed them) and suggesting the immediate backup of content contradicts your previous &quot;informative only&quot; remarks. Even after things calmed down, you didn't go back and modify your statement to be less rash. If you came back to make one change you could have made another. Your opinions here at Wikibooks have come under a great deal of criticism (evident through the Staff Lounge discussions) and I see this as a continuation. I disagree with your actions and I don't think our conversation will move any further. You have already begun throwing out personal insults towards me and so I think I'll end it here. My explanations have agreement with Wikibooks admins and several other big-time editors here so I'm fine with my stance. Hopefully you'll understand policy better the more time you spend here. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:15, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
::Just one last thing, since I don't want a name-calling fight (a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy doesn't need to be here either, I just think it's appropriate). From what I've seen, there's been clashes with you here on Wikibooks. I'd rather end this as &quot;we agree to disagree.&quot; I think the Guide fits policy, you think it might not. That's the end. Don't get so personal. I'll take the time to make sure I've read all your comments. I'd love to see many of the policies you're proposing go into official effect and maybe I'll start getting into policy discussion like you do. &quot;What Wikibooks Is&quot; is a constant circular discussion here and I'd rather have friends at Wikibooks than enemies. Oh, and I just like cleared talk pages. If someone wants archives, they can view the history. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:50, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== Christmas Break ==

Massive edit today to add some of the more popular itty-bitty-kitty species.  Am taking a Christmas Break from Big Cats until after Season's Greetings.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 03:56, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== One Last Thing ==
I edited the talk page on BIG CATS not for CENSORSHIP but for massive LENGTH.  It has started triggering alerts when I add to it that the page is so long that some browsers can't edit it.  That is a serious concern for the democracy of the group.  There are several dead horses that no longer need kicking that date back months.  I removed all superfluous comments I made that added nothing to the discussion, turned a few bullet point lists into concise paragraphs, and removed a couple of completely settled discussions like whether SOMEBODY should add Margays (I did).  That page is becoming Gone With The Wind.  Please remain aware of this situation so nobody gets locked out.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 15:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== Return ==

Yeah, I've been here before. It's just that I work in Wikipedia most actively. Thanks for the welcome message anyways! -- [[User:Water Bottle|WB]] 23:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

== Re: English? ==

* [http://hu.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_vita:Gubbubu&amp;diff=cur]

Thank you for your message. Yes, I speak a bit english. I've left a buerocrat request on that page you recomended. [[User:Gubbubu|Gubbubu]] 18:58, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== Blocking vandals ==

Hey, LV, if you block such obvious vandals as WoW, check Block log. Actually, I blocked him an hour ago ;-)

BTW: I was able to block and revert this vandal shortly after his appearance, IRC anti-vandal bot warned me about it. Without this bot this guy would make severe mess. Please take this in consideration and if you are online, join #wikibooks-en-vandalism, set highlighter on for 'wikibooks' and leave IRC client hidden in your taskbar. I reccomend you [[w:X-Chat|X-Chat]] for IRC connections, it's cross-platform, easy yet powerful. I'm also surprised that you're so active but have never (as far as I can remember) visited #wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:30, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks for the greeting... ==

Hi LV - Thanks for the greeting on my talk page.  I have actually been registered here for about a year (UserID 3362, out of about 17,500!) but thanks for the thought... :) --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 18:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

: :-) Appreciated! --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 19:41, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== Personal Greeting ==
Thanks for the policy and saying hi and stuff :) If only the 'pedia were as personal! So, Wikiversity is a good start to choosing which Wikibooks to read and in what order and so forth I guess.--[[User:Tyciol|Tyciol]] 10:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Fair Use Policy]] ==

You seem to be interested in new policies, and this is one that I've come up with based on an eariler discussion which took place on the Foundation-l mailing list.  Apparently Wikipedia is going through fits and starts with fair use, as is Wikisource.  This policy is actually based off of a suggestion by one of the admins on the Italian Wikipedia, and I think it is a very good idea.  Add comments and hack away at this policy as you see fit.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:59, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Good to see you here, LV - it multiplies my faith in this project. [[User:BD2412|&lt;font style=&quot;background:lightgreen&quot;&gt;''BD2412''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:BD2412|'''T''']] 00:37, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== Hmmm... Spaaaaaam. ==

I fail to see how a few links on a single page = spamming wikibooks, but if it ''really'' bothers you ''that'' much I'm sure I can leave the links off. :) [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 22:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

== Email... ==

As an active admin, you should have a specified email address so people can email their concerns to you. If you wouldn't mind, please activate it. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:06, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]==

This policy needs a few more people to take a look at it and vote. Any help would be most useful. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I haven't seen you around in a while! I hope you haven't gotten sick of us. anyway, I created a new proposed version of the voting policy. It's gone through some heavy editing and discussion, but I think we are finally close to a proposal that we can put to a vote. Once we get the voting policy enforced, it will be easier to get other policies voted on in a timely, organized manner. If you are still around, and still want to help out, I hope you can come give us your comments/suggestions on this new proposal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lord Voldemort. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lord Voldemort~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Introduction ==
[[image:X11.svg|thumb|right|This is the logo of the X Window System. The '''xlogo''' program draws it.]]
This book, the ''Wikibooks Guide to X11'' is about the ''X Window System''. The target audience of this book is X11 users.

X11 is the graphical environment for most [[Guide to UNIX|Unix or Unix-like]] systems, including [[Guide to UNIX/BSD|*BSD]] and [[Linux Guide|GNU/Linux]]; it provides access to screen, keyboard, and mouse. ''X11 is the Unix and Linux graphics drivers.'' Are you using [[Using Firefox|Firefox]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[GIMP]], or [[Using KDE|KDE]] with those systems? Then ''you'' are an X11 user.

This book is about the ''X Window System''. Some users describe it as the Unix and Linux graphics drivers.

This chapter will explain the basics of X11, including:
* Why are there so many window managers and desktop environments?
* What is a console, and how does X provide access to it?
* What is the purpose of X servers and X clients?
* Is it possible for different X clients to interoperate?

=== X11 has diverse desktop environments ===
[[image:xfce-4.2.2.png|thumb|right|There are many desktop environments available for X11, including [[Using GNOME|GNOME]] and [[Using KDE|KDE]]. Shown here is ''Xfce'', the &quot;cholesterol-free desktop environment&quot;.]]
Most of the Unix and Linux distributions provide both a command line and X Window System. In [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X]], &quot;X&quot; is the version number &quot;ten&quot;; however, Apple and other parties provide X11 for Mac OS X, which allows you to use the X11 and native Macintosh window systems simultaneously.

However, just because so many systems provide X Window System, does not mean that it always looks the same. Some users of X have the GNOME desktop environment, some have the KDE desktop environment. Some use Xfce desktop environment while working with both GNOME and KDE programs. It is not as if all *BSD users have GNOME and all Linux users have KDE; instead, both *BSD and Linux users are split between those who use GNOME, those who use KDE, those who use other environments, and those who do not run X.

There are other Wikibooks, [[Using GNOME]] and [[Using KDE]], that document those two environments.

=== X11 gives choice of window manager to user ===
There are many different [[../Window Managers|window managers]] for X. Most windows have decorations around them which provide features like moving, closing, resizing, and otherwise organizing the window. However, these decorations are not the same on every computer that runs X.

Window managers are those programs which make those decorations. Most window managers draw title bars, but some do not. Some window managers make no decorations, but provide menus or keystrokes for managing windows. Some window managers allow you to overlap windows, switch between windows, and hide windows temporarily.

Some window managers are older than both GNOME and KDE, and some users continue to prefer lightweight window managers to the heavy desktop environments that occupy more memory and computing resources. Many X11 users are running ''Metacity'', the GNOME window manager, or ''KWin'', the KDE window manager.

What is extraordinary about X is that there are many window managers to pick from. (This book lists at least 20 window managers.) As the user, ''you'' pick which window managers to install, configure, and use. You can have your own custom environment, unless you are not able to install or configure the window manager that you want.

However, though X allows only one window manager, it allows more than one window. Unlike Mac or Windows, X11 does not provide a standard interface or color scheme, so each window might be drawing its menus, scrollbars, and buttons in a different way. At least the window decorations will be the same on every window. For example, one can run Firefox and OpenOffice.org, and also programs from GNOME and KDE, all at the same time on one X server, because each program has its own window or windows. But if you are running Metacity, then you cannot also be running KWin at the same time, as these two are Windows Mangers, and not desktop environments.

=== X provides access to the console ===
[[File:X client server example.svg|thumb|right|The X Window System consists of an ''X server'' which controls the screen, mouse, and keyboard, and various ''X clients'' which connect to the server.]]
At the interior, the X window system has a special protocol - version 11 of the X protocol. The role of this protocol is give console access to programs like Firefox, OpenOffice.org, Nautilus, and Konqueror.

Each home computer or workstation has a ''console'', which consists of a screen, mouse, and keyboard. In fact, some consoles have multiple screens and multiple input devices, like two mice or a mouse and touchpad. Typically, the Unix kernel only provides a ''console terminal''. The kernel loads a text-only video driver and a keyboard driver and makes a text-only terminal, good for running a command line such as the [[Bourne Shell Scripting|Bourne shell]] and certain text-only programs like [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]] and [[NetHack]].

If we want to draw graphics or use the mouse, we must run a program that knows how to do this. We start an X11 program called the ''X server''. It loads a graphics video driver, a keyboard driver, and a mouse driver. Then, the X server allows programs to make a ''window''. A window is a rectangular area where the program appears; one can type and click windows. X11 allows programs to share the console because it allows more than one window on the screen. (For example, one might have two Firefox windows and one OpenOffice.org window open.) This is the same function that Mac and Windows has.

=== X clients connect to X servers ===
When you start the X server, it changes the screen to grey and makes a mouse cursor. Then it waits. Like a web server, which waits for web browsers to connect, or an ssh server, which waits for remote logins, the X server waits for X clients to connect. An ''X client'' is a program like Firefox and OpenOffice.org which wants to make one or more windows on the screen.

Unlike Mac or Windows, the X server can accept network connections. While you use the X server on one computer, you can [[Guide to UNIX/Connecting to Remote Unix|login remotely]] to another computer and then ask it to connect to your X server. This lets you see and use programs that are on other computers, even if those computers use X on different operating systems.

When an X client connects to the X server (on the same or different computer), it speaks version 11 of the ''X protocol''. This is how the client tells the server what to draw, and the server tells the client what the keyboard and mouse input is. The many X clients never need to know about the hardware or operating system of the X server, because the X server controls the console. Clients like Firefox and OpenOffice.org only need to know X protocol.

=== X sometimes lets programs interoperate ===
X11 programs share a clipboard and fonts, but sometimes they have not much else in common. This led to incompatibilities in not only appearance, but function: drag and drop between applications was sometimes impossible, and use of the clipboard was inconsistent.

Now, with efforts at [[w:freedesktop.org|freedesktop.org]] and elsewhere, some programs not of the same desktop environment can cooperate. Desktop environments, such as GNOME and KDE, and less-used environments like Xfce, provide applications that work well with each other. The results of these efforts include:
*standard rules for using the clipboard
*cooperation between window manager and applications
*drag-and-drop between GNOME, KDE, and other windows
*improvements to the X server</text>

== Configuring ==
You would do
 $ '''XFree86 -configure'''
 $ '''Xorg -configure'''

or
 $ '''xf86cfg'''
 $ '''xorgcfg'''

Especially with XFree86 4.0 or Xorg, the &quot;xf86config&quot; and &quot;xorgconfig&quot; scripts are obsolete (unless you have old hardware).

This makes your XF86Config or xorg.conf file.

=== Debian and Ubuntu ===
If you use [[w:Debian|Debian]], you can create a new config file if you reconfigure the xserver-xorg package. Running this will overwrite your current configuration, so create a backup copy, e.g.:
 cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.new.backup
Reconfigure with:
 dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg 

== Easier Alternatives / Troubleshooting ==
* Usually, the first thing you want to do if X is misbehaving is shut it down. Usually this can be done with ctrl-alt-backspace, but sometimes KDM/GDM will start back up (the login manager). Press ctrl-n or whatever for console login.
* Login in as root and type &quot;init 3&quot; to go to runlevel 3. This will allow you to install graphic drivers.
* If you are using opensuse, you should run sax2, or if that doesn't work, the option for non-accelerated x, sax2-vesa.
* If you have an nvidia graphics card, they have an x configure script. the command is nvidia-xconfig (correct?), start typing &quot;nvidia&quot; and press tab twice. If you don't get anything, you need to install the graphics driver.

If you have Opensuse, you might receive help from Novell's Bugzilla team. They can't always immediately resolve the issue, but often you'll find that either because of your efforts or someone else, things are fixed in a later revision.

== Manual Configuration ==
For manual configuration of almost anything, search for the gentoo or gentoo wikis. For this subject, http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml should be useful.</text>

== Starting Sessions ==
This chapter describes '''how to start an X11 session'''. 

This chapter will answer the following questions:
* What are the different methods for starting X11?
* How does one start X11 and a window manager?
* How does one control which window manager and programs will start?
* Is there a way to make fonts appear nicer?

=== Methods to start X11 ===
Recall that X11 consists of an ''X server'' and several clients. If you only start the X server, you obtain a blank screen. What one needs is a way to start the X server plus some default clients such as a window manager.

First, some Unix consoles give a text-only login prompt. In this case, first login as normal to obtain your Unix shell, then use a '''xinit''' or '''startx''' command to start the X server and default clients at your shell.

Second, some Unix consoles have a graphical login prompt! In this case, the system boot scripts have started an X server already; a program called the ''display manager'' has drawn a graphical user interface that lets you type a username and password. In this case, when you login, you start using X11 immediately.

Third, some systems are using a graphical environment that is not X11. For example, Mac OS X has its native ''Quartz'' system. In Mac OS X, you start the [[Wikipedia:X11.app|X11.app]] program, which is an X server that lets X clients appear on the same desktop as your other Mac programs. Similar programs exist for Microsoft Windows (which is not a Unix platform).

=== xinit and startx ===
There is a program '''startx''', which launches X11. It is simple to use:
 $ '''startx'''

This gives you some default environment. However, if you want to customise your default environment, using '''xinit''' might be easier. The '''startx''' script looks for several files (&lt;tt&gt;~/.Xresources&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;~/.Xmodmap&lt;/tt&gt;, ...) and loads them; the files it uses are different on each system, so you might have to read the '''startx''' script on your system to understand what it does.

In contrast, the '''xinit''' program only starts an X server and runs a &lt;tt&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; script. There is no need to remember whether your system calls it &quot;.Xresources&quot; or &quot;.xresources&quot; or &quot;.xrdb&quot;; you can simply specify the exact behavior that you want in your &quot;~/.xinitrc&quot;.

==== Using xinit without an .xinitrc ====
If you broke your &quot;.xinitrc&quot;, or do not have one yet, then you can start one. For example:

 ''these will work''
 $ '''xinit /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm'''
 $ '''xinit `which xterm`'''
 ''this will NOT work''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''

This will start an X server and the program called &quot;xterm&quot;, which you can use to start more X clients. The last line fails (even if &quot;xterm&quot; is in your PATH) because xinit assumes that it is an argument, not a program. You must have a slash / somewhere in the name of the program.

If you have KDE, you can find your '''startkde''' script:
 $ '''which startkde'''
 /usr/local/bin/startkde

Then you can start KDE:
 $ '''xinit /usr/local/bin/startkde'''

This will let you use Konqueror to find your &quot;.xinitrc&quot; and Kate to edit it. (When browsing your home directory, check &quot;Show Hidden Files&quot; in the View menu.)

If you see a message like:
 $ xinit
 /bin/ksh: xinit: not found

...then you need to add &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin&lt;/tt&gt; to your PATH environment variable.

==== How to write .xinitrc ====
If you do not specify a program with a slash, then &quot;xinit&quot; uses your &lt;tt&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; script in your home directory.

 $ '''xinit'''            ''# starts .xinitrc''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''      ''# passes &quot;xterm&quot; as argument to .xinitrc''

Before using &quot;xinit&quot;, one needs a file called &lt;tt&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; in their home directory. Because the filename starts with a dot, the file is normally invisible. There are ways to handle invisible files from the shell:

 $ '''cd'''               ''# changes current directory to home directory''
 $ '''ls -a'''            ''# list all files, including dotfiles''
 $ '''ls .xinitrc'''      ''# list the .xinitrc file''
 $ '''vi .xinitrc'''      ''# edit .xinitrc using [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]]''
 $ '''emacs .xinitrc'''   ''# edit it using Emacs''

An &quot;.xinitrc&quot; is simply a [[Bourne Shell Scripting|Bourne shell script]]. You could try running it with '''&lt;tt&gt;sh .xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt;''', but it would fail unless you already started the X server. You put in commands like you would type at the Unix shell. If you fail to understand this, try starting with the examples below.

Here is a simple, one-line example of an &quot;.xinitrc&quot;:
 exec startkde

A &quot;startkde&quot; command starts the KDE desktop environment. This command does not finish until you logout of KDE. Normally the shell would wait for KDE to finish, then run the next command. The &quot;exec&quot; prefix to this command tells the shell that this is the last command, so the shell does not need to wait to run a next command. The &quot;exec&quot; is optional in this case.

Here is a more complex example of an &quot;.xinitrc&quot;:
 ulimit -Sn 512
 /usr/bin/mixerctl monitor.master=5,5
 /usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'
 case &quot;$#&quot; in
 0)
   exec sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
   ;;
 *)
   session=&quot;$1&quot;
   shift
   exec &quot;$session&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
  ;;
 esac
 
 # NOTREACHED
 exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm

The first line, &quot;ulimit -Sn 512&quot;, is a Bourne shell command to increase the soft limit &quot;-S&quot; on open files &quot;-n&quot; to 512. (Use '''ulimit -a''', or if your shell is not a Bourne shell, use '''sh -c 'ulimit -a' ''', to see your default limit.) The next command, '''/usr/bin/mixerctl monitor.master=5,5''', sets the sound volume on a OpenBSD or NetBSD system to 5 on both the left and right channels. On other Unix systems, the command will be different. There are many other commands that one could add.

The third line, &quot;/usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'&quot; (or just &quot;xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'&quot;), adjusts the keymap. For users that only make a few adjustments, this might by easier than loading a ''.Xmodmap'' file. (You can load such a file with '''xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap'''.)

The remaining lines form a Bourne Shell &quot;case&quot; statement. These process the command-line arguments to enable the following:

 $ '''xinit gnome-session''' ''# start GNOME''
 $ '''xinit startkde'''      ''# start KDE''
 $ '''xinit fvwm'''          ''# start window manager fvwm''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''         ''# start an xterm without a window manager''

Note that because none of the programs have a slash in them, they are handled by the &quot;.xinitrc&quot; script, not directly by &quot;xinit&quot;.

=== xdm ===
Example &lt;tt&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/tt&gt;:
 . ~/.profile
 
 managers=startkde,fvwm,wmaker
 prompt=&quot;Welcome, $USER@$(hostname), select window manager:&quot;
 
 # miscellaneous setup
 xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'
 test -f /usr/local/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh &amp;&amp;
         . /usr/local/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
 
 manager=&quot;$(xmessage -buttons &quot;$managers&quot; -print -center &quot;$prompt&quot;)&quot;
 test -z &quot;$manager&quot; &amp;&amp; exec fvwm
 exec &quot;$manager&quot;

==Making screenshots==
The standard utility to dump an image of an X Window is &lt;tt&gt;xwd(1)&lt;/tt&gt;, xwd produces an [[w:XWD|XWD]] image. It can be invoked in the following way:
 xwd -root -out root.xwd
xwd can also be used to dump a single window selected with the mouse or provided with the &lt;tt&gt;-id&lt;/tt&gt; option followed by the corresponding window id; for further info see &lt;tt&gt;man 1 xwd&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.hmug.org/man/1/xwd.html].  When run remotely, xwd is useful for taking screen shots of modal menus in action.  The [[w:GIMP|GIMP]] can be used to convert an XWD file to other more common formats such as [[w:PNG|PNG]]; equivalently, the command-line utility '''xwdtopnm''', part of the [[w:Netpbm|Netpbm]] utility suite, can be used to convert the XWD file to [[W:Portable Pixmap file format|PNM]] format, from which it can be converted to any common format, for example with the following [[w:pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]]:
 xwd | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng &gt; screendump.png
It is also possible to convert an XWD image into many other formats using the &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; utility ([http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php available here]): &lt;code&gt;convert root.xwd root.XYZ&lt;/code&gt;, where XYZ is a typical filename-extension for a desired format.

== Xt Clients ==
{{wikipedia|Intrinsics}}
[[Image:xman-main-interface.png|frame|right|This window from &quot;xman&quot; contains three rectangular buttons. Each button is a widget using the X Toolkit Intrinsics.]]
Some X clients are '''Xt clients''', that is, they use the ''X Toolkit Intrinsics''. This is a mechanism to divide a window into smaller windows called [[w:widget|widget]]s such as buttons and menus. You can configure these widgets using X resources.

For example, a typical &quot;xterm&quot; window contains a scroll bar and the emulated screen of the terminal. The &quot;xman&quot; program, for viewing manual pages, contains three widgets of buttons on its tiny main screen. By using the &quot;Manual Page&quot; button, you obtain a larger window with several widgets: menu buttons, a scroll bar, and a text box containing the manual page.

However, developers of libraries like GTK+ and Qt have decided not to use these intrinsics.  Thus, X resources are not available to GTK+ and Qt programs.{{TODO|Why they did that?  Alternative mechanisms?}}

The ''X resources'' are settings that you write in a text file in a certain syntax and then load with xrdb.

=== xrdb ===
To set X resources, you need to put them in some text file like &lt;tt&gt;~/.Xresources&lt;/tt&gt; and then load it with:

 $ '''xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources'''

There is a difference between &quot;XTerm.''resource''&quot; and &quot;xterm.''resource''&quot;.

If you want one xterm to use the resources &quot;GameTerm.''resource''&quot; instead of &quot;XTerm.''resource''&quot;, you would start it with:

 $ '''xterm -class GameTerm'''

=== xrdb with standard input ===
{{incomplete}}

You can also input resources using standard input.

=== xterm ===
{{TODO|todonote=Describe xterm. Explain some common configuration problems. Demonstrate how to use command-line options or xrdb to fix things.}}

xterm has menus. You must hold Control and click with mouse button 1, 2, or 3.

Posemode is a very versatile place where you Animate your character, create and manage constraints and apply your rig to your character.

Contrary to Editmode, Pose mode isn't an obligatory mode where you can't do anything else. It's now part of the UI like any other object. A good example of it is you can be in posemode and still select another object.

== So What Can You Do? ==
When you are done building your armature, you can go into Posemode to add constraints and start creating actions. 
There are also some new tools accessible in Posemode that you may want to look at. You can easily get into &quot;pose&quot; mode by selecting the mode from IPO type list box in the left portion of the lower screen.

The panel has changed a bit too:


[[Image:Pose_panel.jpg]]


*What's new in the panels?:
**You can use the Automatic IK feature in the Editbutton(F9) to pose a chain of bones like it was an ik chain. It's usefulness is very limited though. It works well only if there is no other ik solver in the chain, and if your chain is isolated from the rest of the rig.
**Ghost: in the armature panel the ghost option lets you see the action linked to the armature over time. Also called onion skinning.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_Ghost.jpg]]
**There are two number fields to better tweak the effect of B-Bones. The in/out is used to tell the scale of the virtual handle of the bezier curve. In is the Root of the bone, and Out is the Tip. The bigger the value, the bigger the effect of rotation.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_bboneinout.jpg]]
**There is now a Constraint panel where you can add a constraint to a bone, like any other object in the scene. This will be shown later.
&lt;br&gt;
*You can pose your rig using GKEY, SKEY and RKEY. Note that if the bone is part of a chain it can't be moved (except if it's the first of the chain, moving all the chain as they are all children), so you rotate the bone instead.
*You can do ALT-SKEY on one or more bones while in Envelope display mode to tweak the envelope size in real time while animating. Useful when for example you move the hand and some part of the character isn't in the influence zone; the result will be that some vertices will stay behind.
*You can do CTRL-CKEY to copy stuff from a bone to bones. The options are location, rotation, scale and constraint. Constraint is very handy when you wan to copy a constraint to other bone. The way it works is easy.
*The W-KEY menu gets some neat options too:
**Select constraint target: Will select the target of the bone's constraint currently selected.
**Flip name: Yep, you can flip name in Posemode too.
**Calculate/Clear path: This is a visual way to see the action linked to your armature. You can select just some bones and ask Blender to show you the paths of the bones.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_path.jpg]]
*You can pose your character and select all bones you want to see included in the action and press I-KEY. You can insert a key just for loc, rot or size. Avail will add a key to all available channels in IPO window (all channels you previously added something).
*When you insert key for your armature, a new action is created and linked to the armature if there was no action before. You can also see the curves of each selected bone of the armature in the IPO window. We will see action window and IPO window later.
*You can parent a bone to an external object by selecting this object then selecting the bone in question so it's active (The armature is in Posemode so you can select a bone). Do CTRL-PKEY. Then when you move the bone the object will follow. This kind of Hard relationship doesn't include any bending at all. It's useful when doing robot rigs as you are just moving objects around.

== Introduction ==

&lt;p&gt;
There are three main parts of the guitar that contribute to sound production. First of all, there are the strings. Any string that is under tension will vibrate at a certain frequency.  The weight and length of the string, the tension in the string, and the compliance of the string determine the frequency at which it vibrates.  The guitar controls the length and tension of six differently weighted strings to cover a very wide range of frequencies.  Second, there is the body of the guitar.  The guitar body is connected directly to one end of each of the strings.  The body receives the vibrations of the strings and transmits them to the air around the body.  It is the body’s large surface area that allows it to “push” a lot more air than a string.  Finally, there is the air inside the body.  This is very important for the lower frequencies of the guitar.  The air mass just inside the sound hole oscillates, compressing and decompressing the compliant air inside the body.  In practice this concept is called a Helmholtz resonator.  Without this, it would difficult to produce the wonderful timbre of the guitar.
&lt;/p&gt;

[[Image:zehme_guitar.jpg]]

== The Strings ==

The strings of the guitar vary in linear density, length, and tension.  This gives the guitar a wide range of attainable frequencies.  The larger the linear density is, the slower the string vibrates.  The same goes for the length; the longer the string is the slower it vibrates.  This causes a low frequency.  Inversely, if the strings are less dense and/or shorter they create a higher frequency.  The lowest resonance frequencies of each string can be calculated by

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = \frac{1}{2 L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho_1}} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;= string tension, &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt;=linear density, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = string length

The string length, L, in the equation is what changes when a player presses on a string at a certain fret.  This will shorten the string which in turn increases the frequency it produces when plucked.  The spacing of these frets is important.  The length from the nut to bridge determines how much space goes between each fret.  If the length is 25 inches, then the position of the first fret should be located (25/17.817) inches from the nut.  Then the second fret should be located (25-(25/17.817))/17.817 inches from the first fret.  This results in the equation

[[Image:zehme_frets.jpg]]

When a string is plucked, a disturbance is formed and travels in both directions away from point where the string was plucked.  These &quot;waves&quot; travel at a speed that is related to the tension and linear density and can be calculated by

[[Image:zehme_wavespeed.jpg]]

The waves travel until they reach the boundaries on each end where they are reflected back.  The link below displays how the waves propagate in a string.

[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/objects/waves&amp;amp;strings2.swf Plucked String @ www.phys.unsw.edu]
  
The strings themselves do not produce very much sound because they are so thin. This is why they are connected to the top plate of the guitar body.  They need to transfer the frequencies they are producing to a large surface area which can create more intense pressure disturbances.

== The Body ==

The body of the guitar transfers the vibrations of the bridge to the air that surrounds it.  The top plate contributes to most of the pressure disturbances, because the player dampens the back plate and the sides are relatively stiff.  This is why it is important to make the top plate out of a light springy wood, like spruce.  The more the top plate can vibrate, the louder the sound it produces will be.  It is also important to keep the top plate flat, so a series of braces are located on the inside to strengthen it.  Without these braces the top plate would bend and crack under the large stress created by the tension in the strings.  This would also affect the magnitude of the sound being transmitted.  The warped plate would not be able to &quot;push&quot; air very efficiently.  A good experiment to try, in order to see how important this part of the guitar is in the amplification process, is as follows:

1.  Start with an ordinary rubber band, a large bowl, adhesive tape, and plastic wrap.

2.  Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times to get a good sense for how loud it is.

3.  Stretch the plastic wrap over the bowl to form a sort of drum.

4.  Tape down one end of the rubber band to the plastic wrap.

5.  Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times.

6.  The sound should be much louder than before.

== The Air ==

The final part of the guitar is the air inside the body.  This is very important for the lower range of the instrument.  The air just inside the soundhole oscillates compressing and expanding the air inside the body.  This is just like blowing across the top of a bottle and listening to the tone it produces.  This forms what is called a Helmholtz resonator.  For more information on Helmholtz resonators go to [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/Helmholtz.html Helmholtz Resonance].  This link also shows the correlation to acoustic guitars in great detail.  The acoustic guitar makers often tune these resonators to have a resonance frequency between F#2 and A2 (92.5 to 110.0 Hz).  Having such a low resonance frequency is what aids the amplification of the lower frequency strings.  To demonstrate the importance of the air in the cavity, simply play an open A on the guitar (the second string).  Now, as the string is vibrating, place a piece of cardboard over the soundhole.  The sound level is reduced dramatically.  This is because you've stopped the vibration of the air mass just inside the soundhole, causing only the top plate to vibrate.  Although the top plate still vibrates a transmits sound, it isn't as effective at transmitting lower frequency waves, thus the need for the Helmholtz resonator.

=Abstract=

In class, we have begun to discuss the solutions of multidimentional wave equations. A particularly interesting aspect of these multidimentional solutions are those of bessel functions for circular boundary condictions. The practical application of these solutions is the kettledrum. This page will explore in qualitative and quantitative terms how the of the kettledrum works. More specifically, the kettledrum will be introduced as a circular membrane and it solution will be discussed in visual (e.g. visualization of bessel functions, video of kettledrums and audio forms (wav files of kettledrums playing. In addition, links to more information about this material, including references will be included.

=What is a kettledrum=

A kettledrum is a percussion instrument with a circular drumhead mounted on a &quot;kettle-like&quot; enclosure. When one strikes the drumhead with a mallet, it vibrates which produces its sound. The pitch of this sound is determined by the tension of the drumhead, which is precisely tuned before playing. The sound of the kettldrum (called the Timpani in classical music) is present in many forms of music from many difference places of the world.

[[Image:myKettledrum.jpeg]]

=The math behind the kettledrum:the brief version=

When one looks at how a kettledrum produces sound, one should look no farther than the drumhead. The vibration of this circular membrane (and the air in the drum enclosure) is what produces the sound in this instrument. The mathematics behind this vibrating drum are relatively simple.  If one looks at a small element of the drum head, it looks exactly like the situation for the vibrating string (see:). The only difference is that there are two dimensions where there are forces on the element, the two dimensions that are planar to the drum. As this is the same situation, we have the same equation, except with another spatial term in the other planar dimension. This allows us to model the drumhead using a helmholtz equation. The next step (solved in detail below) is to assume that the displacement of the drumhead (in polar coordinates) is a product of two separate functions for theta and r. This allows us to turn the PDE into two ODES which are readily solved and applied to the situation of the kettledrum head. For more info, see below.

=The math behind the kettledrum:the derivation=

So starting with the trusty general Helmholtz equation:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Psi+k^2\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt;

Where k is the wave number, the frequency of the forced oscillations divided by the speed of sound in the membrane.

Since we are dealing with a circular object, it make sense to work in polar coordinates (in terms of radius and angle) instead of rectangular coordinates. For polar coordinates the Laplacian term of the helmholtz relation (&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;) becomes &lt;math&gt;\partial^2 \Psi/ \partial r^2 + 1/r \partial^2\Psi/ \partial r +1/r^2 \partial^2 \Psi /\partial \theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now lets assume that:&lt;math&gt;\Psi (r,\theta) = R(r) \Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
 

This assumption follows the method of separation of variables. (see Reference 3 for more info) Substituting this result back into our trusty Helmholtz equation gives the following:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 / R (d^2 R/dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr) + k^2 r^2 = -1/\Theta d^2 \Theta /d\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since we separated the variables of the solution into two one-dimensional functions, the partial dirivatives become ordinary dirivatives. Both sides of this result must equal the same constant. For simplicity, i will use &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as this constant. This results in the following two equations:

&lt;math&gt; d^2 \Theta / d\theta^2 = -\lambda^2 \Theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; d^2 R / dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr + (k^2 - \lambda^2 / r^2) R = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The first of these equations readily seen as the standard second order ordinary differencial equation which has a harmonic solution of sines and cosines with the frequency based on &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. The second equation is what is known as Bessel's Equation. The solution to this equation is cryptically called Bessel functions of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; of the first and second kind. These functions, while sounding very intimidating, are simply oscillatory functions of the radius times the wave number that are unbounded at when kr (for the function of the second kind) approaches zero and diminish as kr get larger. (For more information on what these functions look like see References 1,2, and 3)

Now that we have the general solution to this equation, we can now model a infinite radius kettledrum head. However, since i have yet to see an infinite kettle drum, we need to constrain this solution of a vibrating membrane to a finite radius. We can do this by applying what we know about our circular membrane: along the edges of the kettledrum, the drum head is attached to the drum. This means that there can be no displacement of the membrane at the termination at the radius of the kettle drum. This boundary condiction can be mathematically described as the following:

&lt;math&gt; R(a) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where a is the arbirary radius of the kettledrum. In addition to this boundary condiction, the displacement of the drum head at the center must be finite.  This second boundary condiction removes the bessel function of the second kind from the solution. This reductes the R part of our solution to:

&lt;math&gt; R(r) = AJ_{\lambda}(kr) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; J_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; is a bessel function of the first kind of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. Apply our other boundary condiction at the radius of the drum requires that the wave number k must have discrete values, (&lt;math&gt;j_{mn}/a&lt;/math&gt;) which can be looked up. Combining all of these gives us our solution to how a drumhead behaves (which is the real part of the following):

&lt;math&gt; y_{\lambda n}(r,\theta,t) = A_{\lambda n} J_{\lambda n}(k_{\lambda n} r)e^{j \lambda \theta+j w_{\lambda n} t} &lt;/math&gt;

=The math behind the kettledrum:the entire drum=

The above derivation is just for the drum head. An actual kettledrum has one side of this circular membrane surrounded by an enclosed cavity. This means that air is compressed in the cavity when the membrane is vibrating, adding more complications to the solution. In mathematical terms, this makes the partial differencial equation non-homogeneous or in simpler terms, the right side of the Helmholtz equation does not equal zero. This result requires significantly more derivation, and will not be done here. If the reader cares  to know more, these results are discussed in the two books under references 6 and 7.


=Sites of interest=

As one can see from the derivation above, the kettledrum is very interesting mathematically. However, it also has a rich historical music tradition in various places of the world. As this page's emphasis is on math, there are few links provided below that reference this rich history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
The first part of this book is about the stages of the writing process. Now it's time to shift gears and start thinking about the kinds of assignments you're likely to encounter in college. Each &quot;writing mode&quot; requires a different mode of thinking, and that's why teachers and professors often ask for different kinds of writing (they want you to think about a subject in a variety of ways).  But generally, assignments will require you to apply several modes, simultaneously, to accomplish a well-rounded body of writing.  Few professors beyond the first-year level of coursework require an assignment that merely focuses on description or narration; other modes are required to generate a well-rounded piece of writing that entertains, informs, and persuades (i.e., narrative, explication, argument).

Most of the time, you'll find yourself switching among all of these modes as you write. You would have a hard time, for instance, reviewing a car without spending any time describing it, and the strength of an argument depends on how well you've evaluated its evidence. What's important is that you recognize the difference between them. Many students lose points each year when they offer their teacher a description instead of the evaluation or argument called for by the assignment. Below, we first give you some hints about analyzing assignments to find out what different types of writing task you need to do. Then, we break down some common writing modes, telling you their characteristics and what makes them unique, then offer examples of informal and formal writing that show them in action.

=== How to analyze an assignment ===

Writing successfully for your college classes depends a lot on finding out as much as possible about what you need to do to fulfill the assignment each time you write. While many instructors try hard to clarify their expectations, the final responsibility for making sure you know what it takes to fulfill an assignment is yours. Be your own advocate!

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Analyzing assignments|This chapter]] will give you strategies for interpreting assignments successfully and break down eighteen words commonly used in assignments to help you understand what critical and writing tasks you need to do.

=== Description ===
One key difference between a good writer and a bad one is the ability to write vivid, detailed descriptions. What does something look like? Sound like? Feel like? Good descriptions make all the difference when you're trying to hook readers and keep them interested. We don't want to read, &quot;The house was scary.&quot; We want to read a great description of the house that actually makes us feel that fear for ourselves. This can only be accomplished by observant writers who are willing to &quot;show&quot; as well as &quot;tell&quot; their readers about their subject.  

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Description|This chapter]] will introduce you to description and offers some good advice about writing highly descriptive essays.

=== Narration ===
&quot;Narrative&quot; is really just a fancy way of saying &quot;story.&quot; When you are narrating, you are describing an event, step-by-step, usually in the order that it happened. In other words, a &quot;narration&quot; is a &quot;description&quot; of something taking place in time. As you can probably guess, narration and description are highly related. You can't narrate very well if you lack the ability to describe accurately and vividly what is taking place. 

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Narration|This chapter]] will introduce you to narration and some strategies for telling good stories.

=== Exposition ===
Expository writing is writing that explains or informs. You may encounter expository writing in an assignment that has you describing a process or developing a set of clear instructions. You aren't just describing a &quot;what&quot; (&quot;What is fishing?&quot;) but explaining a &quot;how&quot; (&quot;How do you fish?&quot;). Writers with excellent exposition skills are generally good learners, since describing processes well requires a thorough understanding of the process. 

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Exposition|This chapter]] offers tips and suggestions for expository writing and some helpful examples.

=== Evaluation ===
Magazines like ''Consumer Reports'' and movie reviewers like Roger Ebert are famous for the quality of their evaluative writings. They give people the information they need to determine if a car is worth buying or a movie is worth seeing. You'll also find lots of evaluations in business, in which they are used to determine an employee's eligibility for promotion or a manager's effectiveness at overseeing an important project.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Evaluation|This chapter]] will tell you all about evaluative writing and the strategies you'll need to do it right.

=== Argumentation ===
Some people think of arguments as a lot of shouting and cursing (but that's not what college professors mean when they use the term &quot;argumentation&quot;). What they have in mind is a clear-headed, logical, and convincing style of speaking or writing that makes a valid point and supports it with good evidence. An argument isn't just summarizing or restating what others may have said about an issue. You'll need to research the issue, evaluate the evidence, reach a conclusion, figure out the best way to support it, and arrange your thoughts effectively. Writing a good argumentative paper is probably the most difficult of all types of writing assignments, but we'll give you advice and discuss some strategies that will get you on the right track.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Argument|This chapter]] describes what college professors mean by the term &quot;argumentation,&quot; and discuss some methods that will earn good grades on these common but challenging assignments.

=== Heating and Cooling ===
:Since the 2004 model year, the Prius has electric air conditioning that does not need the engine to remain running. However, the air conditioning does present a drain on the battery, so the engine will run more often with it on or set colder than if it were off or set warmer.

:The majority of the heat comes from the engine, like any traditional car. In cold weather, the engine will run longer and more often. Turning the temperature down helps some. There is also an electric heater which helps warm the car. The electric heater can be brought into play by adjusting the desired cabin temperature to &quot;Hi&quot; (that's one notch above 85 degrees). Like most vehicles, the Prius will heat up faster when driven and there is no need to allow the car to idle to warm up before driving.

=== Navigation System ===
Starting in the 2006 model and in any upgrade from older GPS software to version 6.1, it is no longer possible to override the &quot;greying out&quot; of the function buttons while the car is in motion.  This means that while the car is moving, your passenger cannot input a destination address.  Previous to this, there was an override function available.

=== Fuel System ===
;Fuel Type: The Prius is designed to run on unleaded 87 octane fuel (85 in high altitudes) (R+M)/2 method [http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/motorgas/1_driving-performance/pg3.asp]; there is no advantage to using higher-grade fuel.

:The [http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/octane.htm FTC] says:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;In most cases, using a higher octane gasoline than your owner's manual recommends offers absolutely no benefit. It won't make your car perform better, go faster, get better mileage or run cleaner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:[[wikipedia:Octane rating|Octane]] is the measure of a fuel's resistance to autoignition (detonation or pre-ignition) that can occur as the fuel/air mixture is compressed. Engines with higher compression ratios generally require higher antiknock index fuel, while lower-compression engines safely burn regular-grade gasoline. Modern engines frequently incorporate [[wikipedia:Piezoelectric_sensor|piezoelectric sensors]] that detect pre-ignition ([[wikipedia:engine knocking|knocking]]) and quell it by retarding the spark timing, which can prevent engine damage but usually reduces performance and efficiency. [http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/motorgas/1_driving-performance/pg4.asp] [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/autos/gasoline-faq/part1/preamble.html]

;Fuel Tank/Gauge: The North American Prius uses a rubber bladder system besides a charcoal filter for gas vapor emissions control.  However, the rubber is temperature sensitive and will shrink/stiffen in cooler weather lowering the tank capacity from the default 11.9 gallons, and contributing to a wildly inconsistent fuel gauge.  This is similar to the &quot;memory&quot; in NiCad batteries.  Slow filling of the tank with careful &quot;burping&quot; of the fuel inlet past the first &quot;click-off&quot;, without spilling, will stretch the bladder back out and restore the original tank capacity.

:Page 206; The tank is 45L (11.9 gal., 9.9 Imp.gal) and decreases by 5L (1.3 gal., 1.1 Imp.gal) @ -10°C/14°F.

; MPG display on the Multi-Function Display (MFD): The numbers shown on the Consumption screen are the instantaneous values measured from the fuel-flow through the fuel-injectors.  On the 2005 model, the average MPG will reset if the tank is refilled with more than 3? gallons of gas so allowing only tank MPG.  On the 2006 model it will '''not''' reset until the reset button has been pressed thus allowing lifetime MPG.

==== 2006 Federal Tax Credit ====
'''The 2006 federal income tax credit for the Toyota Prius was[http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=156048,00.html $1575] for purchases until March 31, 2007.'''
:Purchases from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006 qualified for the full $3150 credit.

:*[http://www.aceee.org/transportation/hybtaxcred.htm#table Estimates] of tax credits for 31 hybrid and diesel cars and light trucks

:This credit is intended to offset the cost of a car being outfitted with hybrid technology. 
:Individuals can claim the credit for each vehicle that they purchase. 

:Since this is a tax credit your tax bill is reduced dollar for dollar, '''it will not reduce your tax bill below your alternative minimum tax.''' 

:Earned income credit and additional child tax credit are the only refundable credits (you can get back more than your tax liability if you qualify for these credits). 
:If your tax liability is less than the hybrid tax credit, it will reduce your tax liability to $0 but you will receive none of the remainder of the credit nor can it be carried over to the next tax year.

:Itemized deductions that are allowed for AMT are:
:*mortgage interest for purchase or remodeling of your home
:*medical/dental expenses above 10% of AGI
:*charitable gifts
:*casualty and theft losses
:*some miscellaneous deductions

:Some itemized deductions that are not allowed for AMT are:
:*state and local income taxes
:*real and personal property taxes
:*loan interest not related to buying or improving your home

:AMT allows fewer itemized deductions than the regular tax calculation. However, the AMT exemption is larger than the personal exemption. 

:Regular taxable income is taxed at 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 31%, and 35% in a progressive manner. Income subject to AMT is taxed at 26% and 28%, also progressive.

:AMT used to be for the richest people, but it's affecting an increasing number of the middle class. A lot of people seem to think that they will get the full $3150 tax credit by buying a Prius in early 2006. It's better to crunch the numbers now and find out for sure than to get a nasty surprise in April 2007.

==== 2005 Federal Tax Deduction ====
;'''A deduction of $2000 was in effect until the end of 2005'''
Under the current law, those in the top tax bracket would realize a maximum tax savings of $700 if they purchase a hybrid vehicle before January 01, 2006.

*'''How to Claim a Federal Tax Deduction'''
:The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that purchasers retain normal proof of purchase documentation as well as the Toyota Certification letter and Internal Revenue Service Acknowledgement letter as substantiation for the deduction. 

*'''Federal Tax Deduction Guidelines'''
:The purchase of a new Prius (model years 2001 - 2005) must be completed on or before December 31, 2005, for the $2000 deduction.

Before using this important federal tax deduction on your tax return, please check with your tax advisor for possible additional state tax benefits and for any changes in the federal tax laws that might have occurred. 

''The federal tax deduction is not available for Prius lessees or purchasers of used Prius vehicles''. '''To the extent applicable, this deduction is available to Prius purchasers regardless of whether you itemize deductions on your federal income tax return.''' 
Your overall federal tax benefit will depend on your individual tax situation, particularly if you claim depreciation deductions on your Prius. See your tax advisor for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== When did Arabian civilization exist? ==
The earliest known mention of Arabian people was in 853 BC where they were listed as one of the peoples defeated by the Assyrians. By about 400 AD there were a couple of firmly established Arab civilizations. Arab based civilizations still exist today.

== Where did they live? ==
Arabs lived in the Middle East. At present there are more than 20 Arabian countries which are situated in Africa and Asia. They stretch from Western Sahara to the border of Turkey, an area the size of approximately 5.25 million square miles.

Agriculture is the primary economic activity in the Arab world. The most important food crops are wheat, barley, rice, maize and millet. Some of the Arabs countries have a vast reserve of natural oil.

The Middle East, where the Arabs settled, was previously the region where man first moved into a settled form of society, cultivating grain and raising livestock, establishing cities and promoting diverse skills and occupations. In such a setting, rich and complex cultures were nourished. Eventually Arabs spread through and settled in the Middle East, northern Africa, and the Iberian peninsula.

The Middle East is also the area of the establishment of three monotheistic religions:  Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Today, all three religions are found worldwide.

== What did they eat? ==
Arabs used to eat foods like many other Mediterranean people, including homemade bread, dates and olives. Arabic food can rival any culture's food for originality and taste, and, because it basically comprises simple, natural and easily digested foodstuffs, it ranks high in nutritional value with today's fitness-conscious society. The Moors of Spain were the first people who introduced 12 course dinners to the world.

== What did they wear? ==
Arabs used to wear very beautifully designed clothes. Traditionally men used to wear knee-long cloaks. The ''Bisht'' or ''Aba'' is a traditional loose cloak popular among them, usually worn on top of the Thobe. Also, men wore headbands along with a turban. Women used to wear something that resembled a long maxi. It is traditional that Arab women cover themselves with a special type of clothing called a Jillbab.

Arab clothing is diverse, and some Arabs dress like Western Europeans.

== What did their writing look like? ==
Arabic writes from right to left unlike English which writes from left to right. Arabic has a 28 letter Alphabet. Basically it does not have any dedicated vowels and later some of the letters have been identified as vowels for the convenience of the foreigners who converted to Islam as most of the Islamic scriptures are in Arabic. Arabic writing is similar to [[../Hebrews|Hebrew]] writing and they even share almost similar sounds of their alphabets. 

Arabic numerals are the ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). They came to the Arabs from Indian mathematicians through their [[../Persians|Persian]] neighbors. The numerals changed shape as they were passed along. By the time they reached North Africa, they had their modern shapes. From there they were transmitted to Europe. The numerals then spread all around the world. Today, they are the most common type of number symbols.

== What do they believe? ==
Ancient Arabs were polytheistic pagan people, that means they believed in many gods and every natural phenomenon had its own god. From all the gods they believed in, the sun god and the moon god were most important.

Modern Arabs are predominantly Muslim. They believe in a single God, as do Christians and Jews. Today, there are also millions of Arabs who are Christians.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Ancient Arabs used to live in houses made of mud and wood. Many Arabs preferred to live in tents, particularly the nomadic Arabs. Legend says that the first building of Arabia was the ''Holy Kaaba'', the house of God, which was first built by the Prophet Adam and later rebuilt by the prophets Abraham and Ishmael in its original site.

There are also two groups of Muslims: Sunni and Shia. The reason why there are two different types of Muslims is because there was a debate over who should be the successor of Mohammed. The Sunni believe that Ali was the fourth '''Caliph''', the leader of all Muslims, and that the Caliphs that come after him would be elected; the Shia believe that the Caliph should always be a direct descendant of Ali himself. Despite their differences, the Sunni and Shia still share a common belief in the fundamentals of their religion, and recognize each other as Muslims.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

Yes, many of them are famous today. They are mainly famous in Muslim world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will educate high school students in the concepts of [[w:physics|physics]] and how they apply to everyday life. The eventual goal of this book is to help student to understand difficult concepts by breaking them down into smaller parts and using analogy. The goal is a Physics book that makes sense to anyone who desires to understand it. It should strive to use helpful diagrams and be entertaining. It should utilize the online format to take advantage of videos, animations, simulations and other tools not available in print media to aid understanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Should we have a glossary for bookbinding terms within this wikibook, or should we instead link to wikipedia and make articles there?

Gutter seems too obscure to warrant a wikipedia article, but signature, pamphlet and many of the tools seem important enough to warrant an encyclopedic article on their history for instance. 

Wikipedia's bookbinding article has a wonderful terms section, is it possible to hotlink the individual sections of an article? I have a feeling it is, I just have to figure out how.

Also, I don't think stapling is really a kind of saddle stitch. It serves the same purpose, but a how-to on saddle stitch would be more useful. At the Minnesota Center for the Creation of Book Art, most people call stapling &quot;stapling&quot; and call sewing a single codex &quot;pamphlet stitch&quot; and use the term saddle stitch for sewing a whole book with multiple codices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am the lotusduck.

I am feverently overjoyed by the how-to section here, and the language section. 
Learning is for everyone.

I am adding to [[botany]] some transitions and contrasts evolution-wise between the articles.  I will likely be actively editing and adding to that and the wikipedia articles related to it until Christmas, when my botany class ends and I have far less need to study botany. 

I have started [[Tagalog/Lesson 1]] with my mom. Lessons are basically copied from french (with the french replaced with tagalog) for want of ideas of what to teach. She is a native from Manila, and we will be recording her saying the things on the module shortly. We don't know anyone who speaks another Philippine language. Sorry! Do you?
Seriously, somebody help, or try to learn tagalog or something. I need input. And help.

For the time being my contributions will be more academic than book arts, because I'm just a little wound up in all this ecology business. But consider this to be an official to-do: it is absolutely neccessary that there is a developed wiki page for people to learn and share bookbindings. I will do diagrams of slightly more complicated japanese stab bindings, and find my stiff leaf book I made so I can remember how that goes.

Finally, I find the Arts Dance section to be a potential to free people that just want to learn something and get some exercise from being conned by some of those expensive dance videos. As such, I am recruiting an extremely good dancer I know to make videoclips and articles on various dance forms. Expect some small changes and additions to dance pages in the meantime, and videoclips and expanded descriptions over witer break.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Experts! Many people have talked to me about a &quot;plant boundry layer&quot; which has been described as the air around a leaf. A plant expands it's boundry layer by having rattly leaves and makes it's boundry layer small and humid by having hairs on it's leaves, or by having compound leaves (I think!). However- I cannot find any resources for this concept. 
Usually I've had luck finding public domain science information through government sites, but there is an unrelated (again, I think) physics concept that plagues these searches. 
So, yeah. Any help? - [[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 01:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)lotusduck
:Well I think you are right in that the concept you are pursuing makes sense and there must exist sources of information out there that can provide details. I suspect your problem is this: you are putting too much faith in the internet.  As great a source of information as the internet is, it is unreal to expect that all knowledge is now available on-line if only you could figure out where to look.  If I learned nothing else as a graduate student, it was how to move out from the more general knowledge contained in books (i.e., textbooks) to what we called the foreskin of science.  To track a specific question or esoteric point or subject to its very end point: where the published knowledge presently exists. It is a process that must be done in a good University library, using various sources that track journal publications. That effort will usually get you to within a few years of current knowledge.  Crossing that final gap requires knowing who is doing what research in the field or on the specific question and then contacting them. Until you get into the journals on published literature on the subject of &quot;boundary layer&quot; concepts, you will not see much about it. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

== How Does A Violin Make Sound? ==
=== General Concept ===
When a violinist bows a string, which can produce vibrations with abundant harmonics.  The vibrations of the strings are structurally transmitted to the bridge and the body of the instrument through the bridge.  The bridge transmits the vibrational energy produced by the strings to the body through its feet, further triggering the vibration of body. The vibration of the body determines sound radiation and sound quality, along with the resonance of the cavity.


[[Image:procedure.jpg]]
=== String ===
The vibration pattern of the strings can be easily be observed. To the naked eye, the string appears to move back and forth in a parabolic shape (see figure), which resembles the first mode of free vibration of a stretched string. The vibration of strings was first investigated by [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Helmholtz.html Hermann Von Helmholtz], the famous mathematician and physicist in 19th century. A surprising scenario was discovered that the string actually moves in an inverse “V” shape rather than parabolas (see figure). What we see is just an envelope of the motion of the string. To honor his findings, the motion of bowed strings had been called “Helmholtz motion.”

[[Image:String.jpg]]  [[Image:Helmholtzmotion.jpg]]

=== Bridge ===
The primary role of the bridge is to transform the motion of vibrating strings into periodic driving forces by its feet to the top plate of the violin body. The configuration of the bridge can be referred to the figure. The bridge stands on the belly between f holes, which have two primary functions: One is to connect the air inside the body with outside air, and the other one is to make the belly between f holes move more easily than other parts of the body. The fundamental frequency of a violin bridge was found to be around 3000 Hz when it is on a rigid support, and it is an effective energy-transmitting medium to transmit the energy from the string to body at frequencies from 1 kHz to 4kHz, which is in the range of keen sensitivity of human hearing. If a violinist desires a darker sound from the violin, he or she may attach a mute to the top of the bridge. The mute is actually an additional mass which reduces the fundamental frequency of the bridge. As a result, the sound at higher frequencies is diminished since the force transferred to the body has been decreased. On the other hand, the fundamental frequency of the bridge can be raised by attaching an additional stiffness in the form of tiny wedges, and the sound at higher frequencies will be amplified accordingly.

The sound post connects the flexible belly to the much stiffer back plate. The sound post can prevent the collapse of the belly due to high tension force in the string, and, at the same time, couples the vibration of the plate. The bass bar under the belly extends beyond the f holes and transmits the force of the bridge to a larger area of the belly. As can be seen in the figure, the motion of the treble foot is restricted by the sound post, while, conversely, the foot over bass bar can move up and down more easily. As a result, the bridge tends to move up and down, pivoting about the treble foot. The forces appearing at the two feet remain equal and opposite up to 1 kHz. At higher frequencies, the forces become uneven. The force on the soundpost foot predominates at some frequencies, while it is the bass bar foot at some.

[[Image:crossview.jpg]]

=== Body ===
The body includes top plate, back plate, the sides, and the air inside, all of which serve to transmit the vibration of the bridge into the vibration of air surrounding the violin. For this reason, the violin needs a relatively large surface area to push enough amount of air back and forth. Thus, the top and back plates play important roles in the mechanism. Violin makers have traditionally pay much attention on the vibration of the top and back plates of the violin by listening to the tap tones, or, recently, by observing the vibration mode shapes of the body plates. The vibration modes of an assembled violin are, however, much more complicated. 

The vibration modes of top and back plates can be easily observed in a similar technique first performed by Ernest Florens Friedrich Chaldni (1756 – 1827), who is often respectfully referred “the father of acoustics.” First, the fine sand is uniformly sprinkled on the plate. Then, the plate can be resonated, either by a powerful sound wave tuned to the desired frequencies, by being bowed by a violin bow, or by being excited mechanically or electromechanically at desired frequencies. Consequently, the sand disperses randomly due to the vibration of plate. Some of the sand falls outside the region of plate, while some of the sand is collected by the nodal regions, which have relatively small movement, of the plate. Hence, the mode shapes of the plate can be visualized in this manner, which can be referred to the figures in the reference site, [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/patterns2.html Violin Acoustics]. The first seven modes of the top and back plates of violin are presented, with nodal lines depicted by using black sands.

The air inside the body is also important, especially in the range of lower frequencies. It is like the air inside a bottle when you blow into the neck, or, as known as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustics_of_pipes%2C_enclosures%2C_and_cavities_at_low_frequency Helmholtz resonance], which has its own modes of vibration. The air inside the body can communicate with air outside through the f holes, and the outside air serves as medium carrying waves from the violin.


see www.violinbridges.co.uk for more articles on bridges and acoustics.

=== Sound Radiation ===
A complete description of sound radiation of a violin should include the information about radiation intensity as functions both of frequency and location. The sound radiation can be measured by a microphone connected to a pressure level meter which is rotatably supported on a stand arm around the violin, while the violin is fastened at the neck by a clip. The force is introduced into the violin by using a miniature impact hammer at the upper edge of the bridge in the direction of bowing. The detail can be referred to [http://www.schleske.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;http://www.schleske.de/06geigenbauer/en_akustik3schall3messmeth.shtml  Martin Schleske, master studio for violinmaking ]. The radiation intensity of different frequencies at different locations can be represented by directional characteristics, or acoustic maps. The directional characteristics of a violin can be shown in the figure in the website of [http://www.schleske.de/picshoch/a0044_abstr_netz.gif Martin Schleske], where the radial distance from the center point represents the absolute value of the sound level (re 1Pa/N) in dB, and  the angular coordinate of the full circle indicates the measurement point around the instrument. According to the directional characteristics of violins, the principal radiation directions for the violin in the horizontal plane can be established. For more detail about the principal radiation direction for violins at different frequencies, please refer to reference (Meyer 1972).

[[Image:Perfect Health Corset.png|right|thumb|An advertisement from the 1890s]]
Most people have an idea of a &quot;Victorian corset&quot;; however, the British Victorian era comprised a long period of changes in culture and fashion from 1837 to 1901.&amp;nbsp; During that time many styles of corsets were in use.&amp;nbsp; The most ubiquitous feature was the &quot;horizontal waist&quot; which was common from about 1850 to 1899.

==Introduction==
When sound travels through a medium, its intensity diminishes with distance. This weakening in the energy of the wave results from two basic causes, scattering and absorption. The combined effect of scattering and absorption is called attenuation. For small distances or short times the effects of attenuation in  sound waves can usually be ignored.  Yet, for practical reasons it should be considered.  So far in our discussions, sound has only been dissipated by the spreading of the wave, such as when we consider spherical and cylindrical waves.  However this dissipation of sound in these cases is due to geometric effects associated with energy being spread over an increasing area and not actually to any loss of total energy.  

==Types of Attenuation==
As mentioned above, attenuation is caused by both absorption and scattering.   Absorption is generally caused by the media. This can be due to energy loss by both viscosity and heat conduction. Attenuation due to absorption is important when the volume of the material is large.  Scattering, the second cause of attenuation, is important when the volume is small or in cases of thin ducts and porous materials. 

====Viscosity and Heat conduction====
Whenever there is a relative motion between particles in a media, such as in wave propagation, energy conversion occurs.  This is due to stress from viscous forces between particles of the medium.  The energy lost is converted to heat.   Because of this, the intensity of a sound wave decreases more rapidly than the inverse square of distance.   Viscosity in gases is dependent upon temperature for the most part.  Thus as you increase the temperature you increase the viscous forces.

====Boundary Layer Losses====
A special type of adsorption occurs when a sound wave travels over a boundary, such as a fluid flowing over a solid surface.  In such a situation, the fluid in immediate contact with the surface must be at rest.  Subsequent layers of fluid will have a velocity that increases as the distance from the solid surface increases such as in the figure below.

The velocity gradient causes an internal stress associated with viscosity, that leads to a loss of momentum.  This loss of momentum leads to a decrease in the amplitude of a wave close to the surface.   The region over which the velocity of the fluid decreases from its nominal velocity to that of zero is called the acoustic boundary layer.  The thickness of the acoustic boundary layer due to viscosity can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\delta_{visc}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{ 2*\mu}{\omega*\rho_o}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \mu \,&lt;/math&gt;  is the shear viscosity number.   Ideal fluids would not have a boundary layer thickness since &lt;math&gt; \mu=0 \,&lt;/math&gt; .

===Relaxation===
Attenuation can also occur by a process called relaxation.   One of the basic assumptions prior to this discussion on attenuation was that when a pressure or density of a fluid or media depended only on the instantaneous values of density and temperature and not on the rate of change in these variables.   However, whenever a change occurs, equilibrium is upset and the media adjusts until a new local equilibrium is achieved.   This does not occur instantaneously, and pressure and density will vary in the media.  The time it takes to achieve this new equilibrium is called the relaxation time, &lt;math&gt; \theta \,&lt;/math&gt; .   As a consequence the speed of sound will increase from an initial value to that of a maximum as frequency increases.  Again the losses associated with relaxation are due to mechanical energy being transformed into heat.

==Modeling of losses==
The following is done for a plane wave. 
Losses can be introduced by the addition of a complex expression for the wave number

&lt;math&gt;k=\ \beta-j\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

which when substituted into the time-solution yields

&lt;math&gt;\ p = A e^{\alpha x}e^{jwt-j\beta x}&lt;/math&gt;

with a new term of &lt;math&gt;\ e^{\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt; which resulted from the use of a complex wave number.  
&lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is known as the absorption coefficient with units of nepers per unit distance and &lt;math&gt;\ \beta&lt;/math&gt; is related to the phase speed. 
The absorption coefficient is frequency dependent and is generally proportional to the square of sound frequency. However, its relationship does vary when considering the different absorption mechanisms as shown below.


The velocity of the particles can be expressed as 

&lt;math&gt;\ u=\frac{k}{w*\rho_o}p= \frac{1}{\rho_o c}\left(1-j\frac{\alpha}{k}\right)p&lt;/math&gt;

The impedance for this traveling wave would be given by

&lt;math&gt;\ z= \rho_o c\frac{1}{1-j\frac{\alpha}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we can see that the rate of decrease in intensity of an attenuated wave is 
&lt;math&gt;\ a=8.7\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The chapters in this section will discuss some of the general concepts involved in writing your own Real-Time Operating System. Readers may be able to read and understand the material in these pages without prior knowledge in operating system design and implementation, but a background knowledge in those subjects would certainly be helpful.

== Memory Management ==

An important point to remember is that some embedded systems are locked away and expected to run for years on end without being rebooted. If we use conventional memory-management schemes to control memory allocation, we can end up with fragmented memory which can take valuable time to defragment and really is a major problem for tasks that are time-sensitive. This page then will talk about how to implement a memory management scheme in an RTOS, and will talk through to a basic implementation of malloc( ) and free( ).

There are a variety of ways to deal with memory:
* Some systems never do a malloc() or free() -- all memory is allocated at compile time.
* Some systems use malloc() and free() with manual garbage collection.
** With manual garbage collection, it's possible to fragment memory so badly that one day the system locks up because there is no one piece of memory large enough for a reasonably-large malloc() request, although the total size of the many free pieces of memory add up to far more than that the requested malloc(), which would be bad.
** A small, almost unnoticeable bug could slowly leak memory until the system ran out of memory and locked up, which would be bad.
* Some early automatic garbage collection schemes did a &quot;stop the world&quot; for several seconds during garbage collection and/or memory defragmentation. Such a system could miss real-time deadlines, which would be bad.
* Some later automatic garbage collection schemes do &quot;incremental&quot; garbage collection and memory defragmentation.
* Many real-time systems allocate memory one block at a time from a pool of fixed-size memory blocks. This entirely eliminates external fragmentation.

== What is a Task ==

Embedded systems have a microprocessor connected to some piece of hardware (LEDs, buttons, limit switches, motors, serial port(s), battery chargers, etc.).

Each piece of hardware is generally associated with a little bit of software, called a &quot;task&quot;. For example, &quot;Check the keyboard and figure out which (if any) key has been pressed since the last check&quot;. Or &quot;Check the current position of the spindle, and update the PID&quot;.

Often a task has a real-time limits, such as
* the motors must be shut off within 1/10 second after hitting the limit switch to avoid permanent damage
* the PID loop must be updated at least every 1/100 second to avoid oscillation
* the MP3 player must decode a new sample at 44.1 kHz -- no faster, or it sounds chipmunk-like -- no slower, or it sounds like it's underwater.

Some embedded systems have only one task.

Other embedded systems have a single microcontroller connected to many different pieces of hardware -- they need to &quot;multi-task&quot;.

=== task communication and synchronization ===

Most RTOSes have some way to allow tasks to communicate and synchronize with each other,
usually one or more of:
* message passing (often highest-priority-message first, rather than first-in first-out)
* event flags
* mutual exclusion mechanisms: serializing tokens, mutex, semaphore, monitor, etc.

== What is the Scheduler ==

The &quot;task scheduler&quot; (or often &quot;scheduler&quot;) is the part of the software that schedules which task to run next. The scheduler is the part of the software that chooses which task to run next.

The scheduler is arguably the most difficult component of an RTOS to implement.
Schedulers maintain a table of the current state of each task on the system, as well as the current priority of each task. The scheduler needs to manage the timer too.

In general, there are 3 states that a task can be in:

#Active. There can be only 1 active thread on a given processor at a time.
#Ready. This task is ready to execute, but is not currently executing.
#Blocked. This task is currently waiting on a lock or a critical section to become free.

Some systems even allow for other states:

#Sleeping. The task has voluntarily given up control for a certain period of time.
#Low-Priority. This task only runs when all other tasks are blocked or sleeping.

There are 2 ways the scheduler is called:
* the current task voluntarily yield()s to the scheduler, calling the scheduler directly, or
* the current task has run &quot;long enough&quot;, the timer hardware interrupts it, and the timer interrupt routine calls the scheduler.

The scheduler must save the current status of the current task (save the contents of all registers to memory associated with that task), it must look through the list of tasks to find the highest priority task in the Ready state, and then must switch control back to that task (by restoring all register values from memory associated with the new task).

The scheduler should first check to ensure that it is enabled. If the scheduler is disabled, it shouldn't preempt the current thread. This can be accomplished by checking a current global flag value. Some functions will want to disable the scheduler, so this flag should be accessible by some accessor method. An alternate method to maintaining a global flag is simply to say that any function that wants to disable the scheduler can simply disable the timer. This way the scheduler never gets called, and never has to check any flags. 

A few RTOSes disable the process scheduler during the entire duration of system calls -- to avoid missing deadlines, this requires that system calls finish very quickly.
Other RTOSes have preempt-able system calls; they only disable the process scheduler and other interrupts for extremely short &quot;critical sections&quot;.

We will talk more about those functions that need to (briefly) disable the scheduler, inside their critical sections, in the next chapter,
[[../Locks and Critical Sections/|../Locks and Critical Sections/]].

== Interrupts ==

One main difference between an RTOS and other operating systems
is that a RTOS attempts to minimize interrupt latency --
the response time to external hardware.
This requires minimizing the amount of time that interrupts
(including the timer interrupt) are disabled.
Some RTOS vendors publish worst-case interrupt disable times.

Greetings, readers. The intention of this book is to fill a void in suitable instructional materials for teaching business students the fundamentals of programming in the contexts of organizational work and improving personal productivity.

Information Technology (IT) is a pervasive, value-creating vehicle in contemporary organizations, used in a multitude of ways to plan, execute &amp; manage business activities &amp; information, and to achieve business objectives and generate business value. Practically all aspects of business have been drastically changed by information technologies over the last 50 years, and they will continue to change with technological capabilities.

Business students need to be comfortable with IT, and be able to exploit its potential in organizational work. One of the first steps in equipping Business students with these capabilities is to use IT as a tool for personal productivity in organizational work. This book aims to be an instructional resource to develop programming and software development skills that will allow Business students to support their business information management and decision making in the organizational context.

To accomplish this, this book will lead its readers through understanding the importance and use of electronic spreadsheet software in businesses, and introduce Microsoft Excel. Rather than focus on the basics of Excel, this book will contribute to more advanced Excel concepts such as recording macros and using the in-built Visual Basic for Applications programming language to create software solutions to business problems. The intended focus is on developing problem-solving capabilities while understanding the language of VBA, and allow readers to creatively construct software solutions to business problems.

An important part of an RTOS is the lock mechanisms, and the Critical Section (CS) implementation. This section will talk about some of the problems involved in creating these mechanisms.

== Basic Critical Sections ==
{{wikipedia|critical section}}

Most embedded systems have at least one data structure that is written by one task and read by another task.
With a preemptive scheduler, it is all too easy to write software that *seems* to work fine most of the time, but occasionally the writer will be interrupted right in the middle of updating the data structure, the RTOS switches to the reader task, and then the reader chokes on the inconsistent data.

We need some way of arranging things so that a writer's modification appears &quot;atomic&quot; -- a reader always sees only the (consistent) old version, or the (consistent) new version, never some partially-modified inconsistent state.

There are a variety of ways to avoid this problem, including:
* Design the data structure so that the writer can update it in such a way that it is always in a consistent state. This requires hardware that supports atomic primitives powerful enough to update the data structure from one consistent state to the next consistent state in one atomic operation. [[Wikipedia:lock-free and wait-free algorithms]]. For example, the [[Embedded Systems/Threading and Synchronization#read twice and compare | read twice and compare]] algorithm we discuss elsewhere.
* Have the writer turn off the task scheduler while it is updating the data structure. Then the only time the reader could possibly see the data structure, the data structure is in a consistent state.
* Have the writer turn off all interrupts (including the timer interrupt that kicks off the task scheduler) while it is updating the data structure. Then the only time the reader could possibly see the data structure, the data structure is in a consistent state. But this makes interrupt latency much worse.
* Use a &quot;lock&quot; associated with each data structure. When the reader sees that the writer is updating the data structure, have the reader tell the task scheduler to run some other process until the writer is finished. (There are many kinds of locks).
* Use a &quot;monitor&quot; associated with every routine that uses a data structure.

Whenever a lock or CS mechanism is called, it is important that the RTOS disable the scheduler, to prevent the atomic operations from being preempted and executed incorrectly. Remember that embedded systems need to be stable and robust, so we cannot risk having the operating system itself being preempted while it is trying to create a lock or critical section. If we have a function called DisableScheduler( ), we can call that function to disable the scheduler before any atomic operation is attempted, and we can then have a function called EnableScheduler( ) to restore the scheduler, and continue with normal operation. 


Let us now create a general function for entering a critical section:

 EnterCS()
 {
    DisableScheduler();
    return;
 }

and one for exiting a critical section:

 ExitCS()
 {
    EnableScheduler();
    return;
 }


By disabling the scheduler during the critical section, we have guaranteed that no preemptive task-switching will occur during the critical section.

This method has a disadvantage that it slows down the system, and prevents other time-sensitive tasks from running. Next, we will show a method by which critical sections can be implemented to allow for preemption.

== Critical Section Objects ==

Critical Sections, like any other term in computing can have a different definition than simply an operation that prevents preemption. For instance, many systems define a CS as being '''an object that prevents multiple tasks from entering a given section of code'''.  Let us say that we are implementing a version of malloc( ) on our system. We want to ensure that once a memory allocation attempt has started, that no other memory allocation attempts can begin. Only 1 memory allocation attempt can be happening at one time. However, we want to allow for the malloc function to be preempted just like every other function. To implement this, we need a new data object called a CRITICAL_SECTION, or CRIT_X, or something of that nature. Our malloc function will now look like this:

 CRIT_SECT mallocCS; //a global CS variable, for use in all tasks.
  
 int RTOS_main(void) //we register our CS in the beginning of the RTOS main routine
 {
    AllocCS(mallocCS);  //register our critical section with the OS, to prevent duplicates
    ...
  
 void *malloc(size_t size)
 {
    void *ptr;
    EnterCS(mallocCS); //we enter the CS, and no other instance of malloc can enter it.
    ptr = FindFreeMemory(size);
    ExitCS(mallocCS);  //other malloc attempts can now proceed
    return ptr;
 }

If two tasks call malloc at nearly the same time, the first one will enter the critical section, while the second one will wait, or be &quot;blocked&quot; at the EnterCS routine. When the first malloc is finished, the second malloc's EnterCS function will return, and the function will continue.  

To allow other processes looking at other data structures to continue even though this data structure has been locked, EnterCS() is typically redefined something like:

  // non-blocking attempt to enter critical section
  int TryEnterCS( CRIT_SECT this )
  {
    int success = 0;
    DisableScheduler();
        if( this-&gt;lock == 0 ){
            this-&gt;lock = 1; // mark structure as locked
            success = 1;
        };
    EnableScheduler();
    return success;
  }
  
  // blocking attempt to enter critical section
  EnterCS( CRIT_SECT this ){
    int success = 0;
    do{
        success = TryEnterCS( this-&gt;lock );
        if( !success ){ Yield(); }// tell scheduler to run some other task for a while.
    }while( !success );
    return;
  }
  
  // release lock
  ExitCS( CRIT_SECT this )
  {
    ASSERT( 1 == this-&gt;lock );
    this-&gt;lock = 0;
    return;
  }

  
The value to creating a Critical Section object, and using that to prevent preemption of sensitive areas is that this scheme does not slow down the system, the way the first scheme does (by disabling the scheduler, and preventing other tasks from executing).

{{wikipedia|serializing tokens}}
Some OSes, such as Dragonfly BSD, implement EnterCS() and ExitCS() using &quot;serializing tokens&quot;, in such a way that when a process attempts to get a lock on another data structure, the OS briefly releases all locks that process holds, before giving that process a lock on all requested locks.

{{Engineering Acoustics}}

== Proposal ==
As electric/electronic devices get smaller and functional, the noise of cooling device becomes important. This page will explain the origins of noise generation from small axial cooling fans used in electronic goods like desktop/laptop computers. The source of fan noises includes aerodynamic noise as well as operating sound of the fan itself. This page will be focused on the aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms.

== Introduction ==
Inside a desktop computer, there may be three (or more) fans. Usually there is a fan on the heat sink of the CPU, in the rear of the power supply unit, on the case ventilation hole, and maybe on the graphics card, plus one on the motherboard chipset if it is a very recent one. The noise from a computer that annoys people is mostly due to cooling fans if the hard drive(s) is fairly quiet. When Intel Pentium processors were first introduced, there was no need to have a fan on the CPU at all, but most modern CPUs cannot function even for several seconds without a cooling fan, and some CPU's (such as Intel's [[Prescott]] core) have extreme cooling requirements, which often causes more and more noise.
The type of fan used in a desktop computer is almost always an [[fan (implement) |axial fan]], while centrifugal fans are commonly used in laptop computers. Several fan types are shown [http://www.etrinet.com/tech/pdf/aerodynamics.pdf here (pdf format)]. Different fan types have different characteristics of noise generation and performance. The axial flow fan is the main type considered in this page.

== Noise Generation Mechanisms ==
The figure below shows a typical noise spectrum of a 120 '''mm''' diameter electronic device cooling fan. One microphone is used at the point 1 '''m''' far from the upstream side of the fan. The fan has 7 blades, 4 struts for motor mounting and operates at 13V. Certain amount of load is applied. The blue plot is background noise of anechoic chamber, and the green one is sound loudness spectrum when the fan is running.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Noisespectrum.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
(*BPF = Blade Passing Frequency)
Each noise elements shown in this figure is caused by one or more of following generation mechanisms.

=== Blade Thickness Noise - Monopole (But very weak) ===
Blade thickness noise is generated by volume displacement of fluid. Fan blades has its thickness and volume. As the rotor rotates, the volume of each blade displaces fluid volume, then they consequently fluctuate pressure of near field, and noise is generated. This noise is tonal at the running frequency and generally very weak for cooling fans, because their RPM is relatively low. Therefore, thickness of fan blades hardly affects to electronic cooling fan noise.

(This kind of noise can become severe for high speed turbomachines like helicopter rotors.)

=== Tonal Noise by Aerodynamic Forces - Dipole ===
==== Uniform Inlet Flow (Negligible) ====
The sound generation due to uniform and steady aerodynamic force has very similar characteristic as the blade thickness noise. It is very weak for low speed fans, and depends on fan RPM. Since at least of ideal steady blade forces are necessary for a fan to do its duty, even in an ideal condition, this kind of noise is impossible to be avoided. It is known that this noise can be reduced by increasing the number of blades.

==== Non-uniform Inlet Flow ====
Non-uniform (still steady) inlet flow causes non-uniform aerodynamic forces on blades as their angular positions change. This generates noise at blade passing frequency and its harmonics. It is one of the major noise sources of electronic cooling fans.

==== Rotor-Casing interaction ====
If the fan blades are very close to a structure which is not symmetric, unsteady interaction forces to blades are generated. Then the fan experiences a similar running condition as lying in non-uniform flow field.

==== Impulsive Noise (Negligible) ====
This noise is caused by the interaction between a blade and blade-tip-vortex of the preceding blade, and not severe for cooling fans.
==== Rotating Stall ====
[[w:Stall_%28flight%29|Click here]] to read the definition and an aerodynamic description of '''stall'''.

The noise due to stall is a complex phenomenon that occurs at low flow rates. For some reason, if flow is locally disturbed, it can cause stall on one of the blades.
As a result, the upstream passage on this blade is partially blocked. Therefore, the mean flow is diverted away from this passage. This causes increasing of the angle of attack on the closest blade at the upstream side of the originally stalled blade, the flow is again stalled there. On the other hand, the other side of the first blade is un-stalled because of reduction of flow angle.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Stall.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
repeatedly, the stall cell turns around the blades at about 30~50% of the running frequency, and the direction is opposite to the blades. This seriese of phenomenon causes unstedy blade forces, and consequently generates noise and vibrations.

==== Non-uniform Rotor Geometry ====
Asymmetry of rotor causes noise at the rotating frequency and its harmonics (not blade passing frequency obviously), even when the inlet flow is uniform and steady.

==== Unsteady Flow Field ====
Unsteady flow causes random forces on the blades. It spreads the discrete spectrum noises and makes them continuous. In case of low-frequency variation, the spread continuous spectral noise is around rotating frequency, and narrowband noise is generated. The stochastic velocity fluctuations of inlet flow generates broadband noise spectrum. The generation of random noise components is covered by the following sections.

=== Random Noise by Unsteady Aerodynamic Forces ===
==== Turbulent Boundary Layer ====
Even in the stady and uniform inlet flow, there exist random force fluctuations on the blades. That is from turbulent blade boundary layer. Some noise is generated for this reason, but dominant noise is produced by the boundary layer passing the blade trailing edge. The blade trailing edges scatter the non-propagating near-field pressure into a propagatable sound field. 

==== Incident Turbulent ====
Velocity fluctuations of the intake flow with a stochastic time history generate random forces on blades, and a broadband spectrum noise.

==== Vortex Shedding ====
For some reason, a vortex can separate from a blade. Then the circulating flow around the blade starts to be changed. This causes non-uniform forces on blades, and noises. A classical example for this phenomenon is [http://www.galleryoffluidmechanics.com/vortex/karman.htm 'Karman vortex street']. ([http://www2.icfd.co.jp/menu1/karmanvortex/karman.html some images and animations].)
Vortex shedding mechanism can occur in a laminar boundary layer of low speed fan and also in a turbulent boundary layer of high frequency fan.

==== Flow Separation ====
Flow separation causes stall explained above. This phenomenon can cause random noise, which spreads all the discrete spectrum noises, and turns the noise into broadband.

==== Tip Vortex ====
Since cooling fans are ducted axial flow machines, the annular gap between the blade tips and the casing is important parameter for noise generation. While rotating, there is another flow through the annular gap due to pressure difference between upstream and downstream of fan. Because of this flow, tip vortex is generated through the gap, and broadband noise increases as the annular gap gets bigger.

== Installation Effects ==
Once a fan is installed, even though the fan is well designed acoustically, unexpected noise problem can come up. It is called as installation effects, and two types are applicable to cooling fans.

=== Effect of Inlet Flow Conditions ===
A structure that affects the inlet flow of a fan causes installation effects. For example Hoppe &amp; Neise [3] showed that with and without a bellmouth nozzle at the inlet flange of 500'''mm''' fan can change the noise power by 50'''dB''' (This application is for much larger and noisier fan though).

=== Acoustic Loading Effect ===
This effect is shown on duct system applications. Some high performance graphic cards apply duct system for direct exhaustion.

The sound power generated by a fan is not only a function of its impeller speed and operating condition, but also depends on the acoustic impedances of the duct systems connected to its inlet and outlet. Therefore, fan and duct system should be matched not only for aerodynamic noise reasons but also because of acoustic considerations.

== Closing Comment ==
Noise reduction of cooling fans has some restrictions:

# Active noise control is not economically effective. 80mm cooling fans are only 5~10 US dollars. It is only applicable for high-end electronic products.
# Restricting certain aerodynamic phenomenon for noise reduction can cause serious performance reduction of the fan. Increasing RPM of the fan is of course much more dominant factor for noise.

Different stories of fan noise are introduced at some of the linked sites below like active RPM control or noise camparison of various bearings used in fans.

==Physiology of Vocal Fold==

Human vocal fold is a set of lip-like tissues located inside the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx larynx], and is the source of sound for a human and many animals. 

The Larynx is located at the top of trachea. It is mainly composed of cartilages and muscles, and the largest cartilage, thyroid, is well known as the &quot;Adam's Apple.&quot;

The organ has two main functions; to act as the last protector of the airway, and to act as a sound source for voice. This page focuses on the latter function. 

Links on Physiology:
[http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/larynx/notes/n_frames.htm Discover The Larynx]

==Voice Production==

Although the science behind sound production for a vocal fold is complex, it can be thought of as similar to a brass player's lips, or a whistle made out of grass. Basically, vocal folds (or lips or a pair of grass) make a constriction to the airflow, and as the air is forced through the narrow opening, the vocal folds oscillate. This causes a periodical change in the air pressure, which is perceived as sound. 

[http://www.entusa.com/normal_larynx.htm Vocal Folds Video]

When the airflow is introduced to the vocal folds, it forces open the two vocal folds which are nearly closed initially. Due to the stiffness of the folds, they will then try to close the opening again. And now the airflow will try to force the folds open etc... This creates an oscillation of the vocal folds, which in turn, as I stated above, creates sound. However, this is a damped oscillation, meaning it will eventually achieve an equilibrium position and stop oscillating. So how are we able to &quot;sustain&quot; sound?

As it will be shown later, the answer seems to be in the changing shape of vocal folds. In the opening and the closing stages of the oscillation, the vocal folds have different shapes. This affects the pressure in the opening, and creates the extra pressure needed to push the vocal folds open and sustain oscillation. This part is explained in more detail in the &quot;Model&quot; section.

This flow-induced oscillation, as with many fluid mechanics problems, is not an easy problem to model. Numerous attempts to model the oscillation of vocal folds have been made, ranging from a single mass-spring-damper system to finite element models. In this page I would like to use my single-mass model to explain the basic physics behind the oscillation of a vocal fold. 

Information on vocal fold models: [http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/model.html National Center for Voice and Speech]

==Model==

[[image: Schematics.png]]

                                                        Figure 1: Schematics

The most simple way of simulating the motion of vocal folds is to use a single mass-spring-damper system as shown above. The mass represents one vocal fold, and the second vocal fold is assumed to be symmetry about the axis of symmetry. Position 3 respresents a location immediately past the exit (end of the mass), and position 2 represents the glottis (the region between the two vocal folds). 

===The Pressure Force===

The major driving force behind the oscillation of vocal folds is the pressure in the glottis. The Bernoulli's equation from fluid mechanics states that: 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 + \rho gh = C &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Neglecting potential difference and applying {{EquationNote|1}} to positions 2 and 3 of Figure 1, 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_2^2 = P_3 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_3^2&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Note that the pressure and the velocity at position 3 cannot change. This makes the right hand side of {{EquationNote|2}} constant. Observation of {{EquationNote|2}} reveals that in order to have oscillating pressure at 2, we must have oscillation velocity at 2. The flow velocity inside the glottis can be studied through the theories of the orifice flow.

The constriction of airflow at the vocal folds is much like an orifice flow with one major difference: with vocal folds, the orifice profile is continuously changing. The orifice profile for the vocal folds can open or close, as well as change the shape of the opening. In Figure 1, the profile is converging, but in another stage of oscillation it takes a diverging shape. 

The orifice flow is described by Blevins as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; U = C\frac{2(P_1 - P_3)}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Where the constant C is the orifice coefficient, governed by the shape and the opening size of the orifice. This number is determined experimentally, and it changes throughout the different stages of oscillation.

Solving {{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|3}}, the pressure force throughout the glottal region can be determined.

===The Collision Force===

As the video of the vocal folds shows, vocal folds can completely close during oscillation. When this happens, the Bernoulli equation fails. Instead, the collision force becomes the dominating force. For this analysis, Hertz collision model was applied. 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; F_H = k_H \delta^{3/2} (1 + b_H \delta')&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where

&lt;math&gt; k_H = \frac{4}{3} \frac{E}{1 - \mu_H^2} \sqrt{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Here delta is the penetration distance of the vocal fold past the line of symmetry.

==Simulation of the Model==

The pressure and the collision forces were inserted into the equation of motion, and the result was simulated. 

[[image: matlab.png]]

                                               Figure 2: Area Opening and Volumetric Flow Rate

Figure 2 shows that an oscillating volumetric flow rate was achieved by passing a constant airflow through the vocal folds. When simulating the oscillation, it was found that the collision force limits the amplitude of oscillation rather than drive the oscillation. Which tells us that the pressure force is what allows the sustained oscillation to occur. 

==The Acoustic Output==

This model showed that the changing profile of glottal opening causes an oscillating volumetric flow rate through the vocal folds. This will in turn cause an oscillating pressure past the vocal folds. This method of producing sound is unusual, because in most other means of sound production, air is compressed periodically by a solid such as a speaker cone. 

Past the vocal folds, the produced sound enters the vocal tract. Basically this is the cavity in the mouth as well as the nasal cavity. These cavities act as acoustic filters, modifying the character of the sound. The acoustics of vocal tract have traditionally been described on the basis of a [[/Source-filter Theory|source-filter theory]]. Whereas the glotis produces a sound of many frequencies, the vocal tract selects a subset of these frequencies for radiation from the mouth. These are the characters that define the unique voice each person produces.

== Introduction ==
Microphones are devices which convert pressure fluctuations into electrical signals.  Two main methods of achieving this are used in the mainstream entertainment industry today - '''dynamic microphones''' and '''condenser microphones'''.  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Piezoelectric_Transducers Piezoelectric transducers] can also be used as microphones but they are not commonly used in the entertainment industry.  

== Dynamic microphones ==
Dynamic microphones utilise 'Faraday’s Law'.  The principle states that when an electrical conductor is moved through a magnetic field, an electrical current is induced within the conductor.  In these microphones the magnetic field comes from permanent magnets.  There are two common arrangements for the conductor.
  
[[File:Moving coil.JPG|300px]]

Figure 1: Sectional View of Moving-Coil Dynamic Microphone

The first conductor arrangement has a moving coil of wire.  The wire is typically copper and is attached to a circular membrane or piston usually made from lightweight plastic or occasionally aluminum.  The impinging pressure fluctuation on the piston causes it to move in the magnetic field and thus creates the desired electrical current. 

[[Image:Ribbon.jpg|300px|]]

Figure 2: Dynamic Ribbon Microphone

The second conductor arrangement is a ribbon of metallic foil suspended between magnets. The metallic ribbon moves in response to a pressure fluctuation and an electrical current is produced. In both configurations, dynamic microphones follow the same principals as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustic_Transducers_-_The_Loudspeaker acoustical transducers].

== Condenser Microphones ==
Condenser microphones convert pressure fluctuations into electrical potentials by changes in electrical capacitance, hence they are also known as capacitor microphones.  An electrical capacitor consists of two charged electrical conductors placed at some relatively small distance to each other.  The basic relation that describes capacitors is:

:'''&lt;math&gt;Q=C\times V&lt;/math&gt;'''

where Q is the electrical charge of the capacitor’s conductors, C is the capacitance, and V is the electric potential between the capacitor’s conductors.  If the electrical charge of the conductors is held at a constant value, then the voltage between the conductors will be inversely proportional to (a) the capacitance and (b) the distance between the conductors.  

[[Image:Condenser.jpg|600px]]

Figure 3: Sectional View of Condenser Microphone

The capacitor in a condenser microphone consists of two parts: the diaphragm and the backplate.  The diaphragm moves due to impinging pressure fluctuations and the backplate is held in a stationary position.  When the diaphragm moves closer to the backplate, the capacitance increases and a change in electric potential is produced.  The diaphragm is typically made of metallic coated Mylar.  The assembly that houses both the backplate and the diaphragm is commonly referred to as a capsule.

To keep the diaphragm and backplate at a constant charge, an electric potential must be presented to the capsule.  There are various ways this can be achieved.  The first uses a battery to supply the needed DC potential to the capsule (figure 4).  The resistor across the leads of the capsule is very high, in the range of 10 mega ohms, to keep the charge on the capsule close to constant.  

[[Image:Battery_Powered.jpg|500px]]

Figure 4: Internal Battery Powered Condenser Microphone

An alternative technique for providing a constant charge on the capacitor is to supply a DC electric potential through the microphone cable that carries the microphones output signal.  Standard microphone cable is known as XLR cable and is terminated by three pin connectors.  Pin one connects to the shield around the cable.  The microphone signal is transmitted between pins two and three.   

[[Image:XLR.jpg|700px]]

Figure 5: Dynamic Microphone Connected to a Mixing Console via XLR Cable

===48V Phantom Powering===
The most popular method of providing a DC potential through a microphone cable is to supply +48 V to both of the microphone output leads, pins 2 and 3, and use the shield of the cable, pin 1, as the ground to the circuit.  Because pins 2 and 3 see the same potential, any fluctuation of the microphone powering potential will not affect the microphone signal seen by the attached audio equipment.  The +48 V will be stepped down at the microphone using a transformer and provide the potential to the backplate and diaphragm in a similar fashion as the battery solution.

[[Image:Powering.jpg|600px]]

Figure 6: Condenser Microphone Powering Techniques

===12V T-Powering===
A less popular method of running the potential through the cable is to supply 12 V between pins 2 and 3.  This method is referred to as T-powering.  The main problem with T-powering is that potential fluctuation in the powering of the capsule will be transmitted into an audio signal because the audio equipment analyzing the microphone signal will not see a difference between a potential change across pins 2 and 3 due to a pressure fluctuation and one due to the power source electric potential fluctuation.

===Electret Condenser Microphones===
Finally, the diaphragm and backplate can be manufactured from a material that maintains a fixed charge, known as 'electret' (from electric+magnet, because these materials can be seen as the electric equivalents of permanent magnets).  As a result, these microphones are termed electret condenser microphones (ECM).  In early electret designs, the charge on the material tended to become unstable over time.  Advances in science and manufacturing have effectively eliminated this problem in present designs.

== Conclusion ==
Two types of microphones are used in the entertainment industry.  
* Dynamic microphones, which are found in the moving-coil and ribbon configurations.  The movement of the conductor in dynamic microphones induces an electric current which is then transformed into the reproduction of sound.  
* Condenser microphones which utilize the properties of capacitors.  The charge on the capsule of condenser microphones can be can by battery, by phantom powering, by T-powering, and by using 'electrets' - materials with a fixed charge.

=Room Acoustics and Concert Halls=
==Introduction==
From performing on many different rooms and stages all over the United States, I thought it would be nice to have a better understanding and source about the room acoustics. This Wikibook page is intended to help the user with basic technical questions/answers about room acoustics. Main topics that will be covered are: what really makes a room sound ''good'' or ''bad'', ''alive'' or ''dead''. This will lead into absorption and transmission coefficients, decay of sound in the room, and reverberation. Different use of materials in rooms will be mentioned also. There is no intention of taking work from another. This page is a switchboard source to help the user find information about room acoustics.

==Sound Fields==
Two types of sound fields are involved in room acoustics: Direct Sound and Reverberant Sound. 

===Direct Sound===
The component of the sound field in a room that involves only a direct path between the source and the receiver, before any reflections off walls and other surfaces. 
===Reverberant Sound===
The component of the sound field in a room that involves the direct path and the path after it reflects off of walls or any other surfaces. How the waves deflect off of the mediums all depends on the absorption and transmission coefficients.

Good example pictures are shown at [http://akamaipix.crutchfield.com/ca/reviews/20040120/roomacoustics1a.gif Crutchfield Advisor], [http://physics.mtsu.edu/~wmr/reverb1f1.gif a Physics Site from MTSU], and [http://www.voiceteacher.com/art/bounce.gif Voiceteacher.com]

==Room Coefficients==
In a perfect world, if there is a sound shot right at a wall, the sound should come right back. But because sounds hit different materials types of walls, the sound does not have perfect reflection. From 1, these are explained as follows:

===Absorption &amp; Transmission Coefficients===
The best way to explain how sound reacts to different mediums is through acoustical energy. When sound impacts on a wall, acoustical energy will be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the wall. 

[[File:Ad_Rev.jpg]]

----
Absorption Coefficient: [[File:Absorption Coefficient.jpg]]
----
Transmission Coefficient: [[File:Transmission Coefficient.jpg]]
----
If all of the acoustic energy hits the wall and none is reflected, the alpha would equal 1.    The energy had zero reflection and was absorbed or transmitted. This would be an example of a ''dead'' or ''soft'' wall because it takes in everything and doesn't reflect anything back. Rooms that are like this are called Anechoic Rooms which looks like this from [http://www.axiomaudio.com/archives/22chamber.jpg Axiomaudio].

If all of the acoustic energy hits the wall and all reflects back, the alpha would equal 0. This would be an example of a ''live'' or ''hard'' wall because the sound bounces right back and does not go through the wall. Rooms that are like this are called Reverberant Rooms like this [http://www.roger-russell.com/revrm3.jpg McIntosh]room. Look how the walls have nothing attached to them. More room for the sound waves to bounce off the walls.

===Room Averaged Sound Absorption Coefficient===
Not all rooms have the same walls on all sides. The room averaged sound absorption coefficient can be used to have different types of materials and areas of walls averaged together.

===Absorption Coefficients for Specific Materials===
Basic sound absorption Coefficients are shown here at [http://www.acousticalsurfaces.com/acoustic_IOI/101_13.htm Acoustical Surfaces].

Brick, unglazed, painted alpha ~ .01 - .03 -&gt; Sound reflects back

Units are in [http://zone.ni.com/devzone/nidzgloss.nsf/webmain/0174ABCAF438C613862568C6005C852A?OpenDocument Sabins].

==Sound Decay and Reverberation Time==
In a large reverberant room, a sound can still propagate after the sound source has been turned off. This time when the sound intensity level has decay 60 dB is called the reverberation time of the room.

::Thank you for trying to help clean up Wikibooks.  Wikijunior, however, is trying to experiment with a &quot;slow growth&quot; policy right now that started with the creation of that sub-project.  I know it is kind of un-wiki like in the fact that new modules must achieve some sort of community concensus.  I started the [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]] as a forum to decide what to start next, modeled after [[m:Proposals for new projects]] but with the intention of actually trying to allow some of these project ideas a chance to develop.  I'm going to put the Wikijunior Alaska into the new project area for now.  This module was developed because some people wanted to add to Wikijunior, but there was no social mechanism to add new book projects.  I've started that process now, so hopefully there will be some valuable new additions to Wikijunior in the future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zondor. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zondor~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

'''[http://lush.sourceforge.net Lush]''' is a lisp-like object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in numerical applications, including computer vision and machine learning. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, C++, or other languages.

== Fuel ==

When I saw the text under &quot;Fuel&quot;, I just couldn't ignore some serious factual errors:

1) Avgas is not kerosene; it is gasoline, and there are several varieties (80, 100, 100LL, etc.). If avgas WERE kerosene, my airplane would not fly and I would be very unhappy. Jet fuel (JET-A, JP4, etc.) is essentially kerosene, although it's not a good idea to fill your jet aircraft with commercial kerosene, for a variety of reasons.

2) The sentence on high-performance engines was out of place and factually inaccurate. In internal-combustion engines, power is produced by the thermal expansion of gases heated by the combustion of fuel. Generally speaking, burning more fuel (or burning it hotter) produces more power. Large-displacement engines burn more fuel and high-compression engines burn it hotter (and require fuel with a high antiknock index to ensure the ignition spark results in deflagration rather than detonation). At any rate, the discourse really doesn't belong in an article on the Prius.

3) The term &quot;octane&quot; historically refers to how well a fuel resists autoignition while being compressed, as compared to a mixture of iso-octane and heptane. Fuel that resists autoignition as well as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane is rated &quot;90 octane&quot;. Unfortunately, there are in use several different systems for determining octane equivalencies, meaning the same fuel can have many numerically different ratings.

4) Aviation fuel is rated using the Motor Octane Number (MON) system, as is automobile gasoline in many countries. MON is a component--along with the Research Octane Number (RON) of the AntiKnock Index (AKI) commonly seen on gas pumps in the United States. Therefore, the statement that avgas is rated using a different system is incorrect.

This section will explain how to deform your mesh using the armature.

There are two ways to tell Blender which vertex will go with which bone: Vertex group, and Envelope. 

There is also a tool useful when animating which is part of the mesh object: the Shape key, to create a preset deformation. For example: deform the face to look like a smile.

=Introduction=

Piezoelectricity from the Greek word &quot;piezo&quot; means pressure electricity.  Certain crystalline substances generate electric charges under mechanical stress and conversely experience a mechanical strain in the presence of an electric field.  The piezoelectric effect describes a situation where the transducing material senses input mechanical vibrations and produces a charge at the frequency of the vibration.  An AC voltage causes the piezoelectric material to vibrate in an oscillatory fashion at the same frequency as the input current.

Quartz is the best known single crystal material with piezoelectric properties.  Strong piezoelectric effects can be induced in materials with an ABO3, Perovskite crystalline structure.  'A' denotes a large divalent metal ion such as lead and 'B' denotes a smaller tetravalent ion such as titanium or zirconium.  

For any crystal to exhibit the piezoelectric effect, its structure must have no center of symmetry.  Either a tensile or compressive stress applied to the crystal alters the separation between positive and negative charge sights in the cell causing a net polarization at the surface of the crystal.  The polarization varies directly with the applied stress and is direction dependent so that compressive and tensile stresses will result in electric fields of opposite voltages.  

=Vibrations &amp; Displacements=

Piezoelectric ceramics have non-centrosymmetric unit cells below the Curie temperature and centrosymmetric unit cells above the Curie temperature.  Non-centrosymmetric structures provide a net electric dipole moment.  The dipoles are randomly oriented until a strong DC electric field is applied causing permanent polarization and thus piezoelectric properties.

A polerized ceramic may be subjected to stress causing the crystal lattice to distort changing the total dipole moment of the ceramic.  The change in dipole moment due to an applied stress causes a net electric field which varies linearly with stress.

=Dynamic Performance=

The dymanic performance of a piezoelectric material relates to how it behaves under alternating stresses near the mechanical resonance. The parallel combination of C2 with L1, C1, and R1 in the equivalent circuit below control the transducers reactance which is a function of frequency.

==Equivalent Electric Circuit==

[[Image:eqcct.gif]]

==Frequency Response==

The graph below shows the impedance of a piezoelectric transducer as a function of frequency.  The minimum value at fm corresponds to the resonance while the maximum value at fn corresponds to anti-resonance.

[[Image:response.gif]]

=Resonant Devices=

Non resonant devices may be modeled by a capacitor representing the capacitance of the piezoelectric with an impedance modeling the mechanically vibrating system as a shunt in the circuit.  The impedance may be modeled as a capacitor in the non-resonant case which allows the circuit to reduce to a single capacitor replacing the parallel combination.

For resonant devices the impedance becomes a resistance or static capacitance at resonance.  This is an undesirable effect.  In mechanically driven systems this effect acts as a load on the transducer and decreases the electrical output.  In electrically driven systems this effect shunts the driver requiring a larger input current.  The adverse effect of the static capacitance experienced at resonant operation may be counteracted by using a shunt or series inductor resonating with the static capacitance at the operating frequency.  


[[Image:resonant device.gif]]

=Applications=

==Mechanical Measurement==

Because of the dielectric leakage current of piezoelectrics they are poorly suited for applications where force or pressure have a slow rate of change.  They are, however, very well suited for highly dynamic measurements that might be needed in blast gauges and accelerometers.  

==Ultrasonic==

High intensity ultrasound applications utilize half wavelength transducers with resonant frequencies between 18 kHz and 45 kHz.  Large blocks of transducer material is needed to generate high intensities which makes manufacturing difficult and is economically impractical.  Also, since half wavelength transducers have the highest stress amplitude in the center, the end sections act as inert masses.  The end sections are often replaced with metal plates possessing a much higher mechanical quality factor; giving the composite transducer a higher mechanical quality factor than a single-piece transducer.

The overall electro-acoustic efficiency is:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Electro acoustic efficiency}}
     
              Qm0 = unloaded mechanical quality factor
              QE  = electric quality factor
              QL  = quality factor due to the acoustic load alone

The second term on the right hand side is the dielectric loss and the third term is the mechanical loss.

Efficiency is maximized when:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Condition}}

then:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Max efficiency}}

The maximum ultrasonic efficiency is described by:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Ultrasonic Intensity}}

Applications of ultrasonic transducers include:
  Welding of plastics
  Atomization of liquids
  Ultrasonic drilling
  Ultrasonic cleaning
  Ultrasound
  Non destructive testing
  etc.

= Theorems =

A ''theorem'' is a formula for which a zero-premise derivation has been provided.  We will keep a numbered list of proved theorems.  In the derivations that follow, we will continue our informal convention of adding a formula to the annotations of assumptions, in particular the formula we hope to derive by means of the newly started subderivation.

== An example ==

You may remember from [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Constructing a Complex Derivation | Constructing a Complex Derivation]] that we had to employ a silly trick to copy a formula into the proper subderivation (Lines 16 and 17).  We can prove a theorem that will help us avoid such obnoxiousness.

Derivations can be abbreviated by allowing a line to be entered whose formula is a substitution instance of a previously proved theorem.  The annotation will be 'T''n''' where ''n'' is the number of the theorem.  Although we won't require it officially, we will also show the substitution, if any, in the annotation (see Line 3 in the derivation below).  The proof of the next theorem will use '''T1'''.

== Justification: Converting to unabbreviated derivation ==

We need to justify using theorems in derivations in this way.  To do that, we show how to produce a correct, unabbreviated derivation of '''T2''', one without citing the theorem we used in its abbreviated proof.

Observe that when we entered Line 3 into our derivation of '''T2''', we substituted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in '''T1'''.  Suppose you were to apply the same substitution on each line of our proof for '''T1'''.  You would then end up with the following equally correct derivation.

Suppose now you were to replace Line 3 of our proof for '''T2''' with this derivation.  You would need to adjust the line numbers so that you would have only one line per line number.  You would also need to adjust the annotations so the line numbers they would continue to refer correctly.  But, with these adjustments, you would end up with the following correct unabbreviated derivation of '''T2'''.

Thus we see that entering a previously proved theorem into a derivation is simply an abbreviation for including that theorem's proof into a derivation.  The instructions above for unabbreviating a derivation could be made more general and more rigorous, but we will leave them in this informal state.  Having instructions for generating a correct unabbreviated derivation justifies entering previously proved theorems into derivations.

Additional theorems will be introduced over the next two modules.</text>

== Sentential logic ==

'''Sentential logic''' attempts to capture certain logical features of natural languages.  In particular, it
covers ''truth-functional connections'' for ''sentences''.  Its formal language specifically recognizes the sentential connections

: It is not the case that _____
: _____ and _____
: Either _____ or _____
: _____ or _____ (or both)
: if _____, then _____
: _____ if and only if _____

The blanks are to be filled with statements that can be true or false.  For example, &quot;it is raining today&quot; or &quot;it will snow tomorrow&quot;.
Whether the final sentence is true or false is entirely determined on whether the filled statements are true or false. 
For example if it ''is'' raining today, but it ''will not'' snow tomorrow, then it is true to say that &quot;Either it is raining today or it will snow tomorrow&quot;.
On the other hand it is false to say &quot;it is raining today and it will snow tomorrow&quot;, since it won't snow tomorrow.

&quot;Whether a statement is true or false&quot; is called the ''truth value'' in logician slang.
Thus &quot;Either it is raining today or it will snow tomorrow&quot; has a truth value of ''true'' and &quot;it is raining today and it will snow tomorrow&quot; has truth value of ''false''.

Note that the above listed sentential connections do not include all possible truth value combination.
For example there is no connection that is true when both sub-statement are true, both sub-statements are false or the first sub-statement is true while the other is false, and that is false else.
However, you can combine the above connections together to build any truth combination of any number of sub-statements.

== Issues ==

Already we have tacitly taken a position in ongoing controversy.  Some questions already raised by the seemingly innocuous beginning above are listed.

* Should we admit into our logic only sentences that are true or false?  Multi-valued logics admit a greater range of sentences.

* Are the connections listed above truly truth functional?  Should we admit connections that are not truth functional sentences into our logic?

* What should logic take as its truth-bearers (objects that are true or false)?  The two leading contenders today are sentences and propositions.

:* Sentences.  These consist of a string of words and perhaps punctuation.  The sentence 'The cat is on the mat' consists of six elements: 'the', 'cat', 'is', 'on', another 'the', and 'mat'.

:* Propositions.  These are the meanings of sentences.  They are what is expressed by a sentence or what someone says when he utters a sentence.  The proposition ''that the cat is on the mat'' consists of three elements: a cat, a mat, and the on-ness relation.

: Elsewhere in [[Main_Page|Wikibooks]] and [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]], you will see the name 'Propositional Logic' (or rather 'Propositional Calculus', see below) and the treatment of propositions much more often than you will see the name 'Sentential Logic' and the treatment of sentences.  Our choice here represents the contributor's view as to which position is more popular among current logicians and what you are most likely to see in standard textbooks on the subject.  Considerations as to whether the popular view is actually correct are not taken up here.

: Some authors will use talk about ''statements'' instead of sentences.  Most (but not all) such authors you are likely to encounter take statements to be a subset of sentences, namely those sentences that are either true or false. This use of 'statement' does not represent a third position in the controversy, but rather places such authors in the sentences camp.  (However, other&amp;mdash;particularly older&amp;mdash;uses of 'statement' may well place its authors in a third camp.)

Sometimes you will see 'calculus' rather than 'logic' such as in 'Sentential Calculus' or 'Propositional Calculus' as opposed to 'Sentential Logic' or 'Propositional Logic'.  While the choice between 'sentential' and 'propositional' is substantive and philosophical, the choice between 'logic' and 'calculus' is merely stylistic.

== General Technique ==

# A microphone should be used whose frequency response will suit the frequency range of the voice or instrument being recorded.
# Vary microphone positions and distances until you achieve the monitored sound that you desire.
# In the case of poor room acoustics, place the microphone very close to the loudest part of the instrument being recorded or isolate the instrument.
# Personal taste is the most important component of microphone technique.  Whatever sounds right to you, ''is'' right.

== Working Distance ==

=== Close Miking ===

When miking at a distance of 1 inch to about 3 feet from the sound source, it is considered close miking.  This technique generally provides a tight, present sound quality and does an effective job of isolating the signal and excluding other sounds in the acoustic environment.

==== Leakage ====

Leakage occurs when the signal is not properly isolated and the microphone picks up another nearby instrument.  This can make the mixdown process difficult if there are multiple voices on one track.  Use the following methods to prevent leakage:

* Place the microphones closer to the instruments.
* Move the instruments farther apart.
* Put some sort of acoustic barrier between the instruments.
* Use directional microphones.

==== 3 to 1 Rule ====

The 3:1 distance rule is a general rule of thumb for close miking.  To prevent phase anomalies and leakage, the microphones should be placed at least three times as far from each other as the distance between the instrument and the microphone.

[[Image:Threetoone.gif|3:1 Rule]]

=== Distant Miking ===

Distant miking refers to the placement of microphones at a distance of 3 feet or more from the sound source.  This technique allows the full range and balance of the instrument to develop and it captures the room sound.  This tends to add a live, open feeling to the recorded sound, but careful consideration needs to be given to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Basic_Room_Acoustic_Treatments acoustic environment].

=== Accent Miking ===

Accent miking is a technique used for solo passages when miking an ensemble.  A soloist needs to stand out from an ensemble, but placing a microphone too close will sound unnaturally present compared the distant miking technique used with the rest of the ensemble.  Therefore, the microphone should be placed just close enough to the soloist that the signal can be mixed effectively without sounding completely excluded from the ensemble.

=== Ambient Miking ===

Ambient miking is placing the microphones at such a distance that the room sound is more prominent than the direct signal.  This technique is used to capture audience sound or the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Room_Acoustics_and_Concert_Halls natural reverberation of a room or concert hall].

== Stereo and Surround Technique ==

=== Stereo ===

Stereo miking is simply using two microphones to obtain a stereo left-right image of the sound.  A simple method is the use of a spaced pair, which is placing two identical microphones several feet apart and using the difference in time and amplitude to create the image.  Great care should be taken in the method as phase anomalies can occur due to the signal delay.  This risk of phase anomaly can be reduced by using the X/Y method, where the two microphones are placed with the grills as close together as possible without touching.  There should be an angle of 90 to 135 degrees between the mics.  This technique uses only amplitude, not time, to create the image, so the chance of phase discrepancies is unlikely.

[[Image:Spacedpair.gif|Spaced Pair]] [[Image:Xypair.gif|X/Y Method]]

=== Surround ===

To take advantage of 5.1 sound or some other surround setup, microphones may be placed to capture the surround sound of a room.  This technique essentially stems from stereo technique with the addition of more microphones.  Because every acoustic environment is different, it is difficult to define a general rule for surround miking, so placement becomes dependent on experimentation.  Careful attention must be paid to the distance between microphones and potential phase anomalies.

== Placement for Varying Instruments ==

=== Amplifiers ===

When miking an amplifier, such as for electric guitars, the mic should be placed 2 to 12 inches from the speaker.  Exact placement becomes more critical at a distance of less than 4 inches.  A brighter sound is achieved when the mic faces directly into the center of the speaker cone and a more mellow sound is produced when placed slightly off-center.  Placing off-center also reduces amplifier noise.

=== Brass Instruments ===

High sound-pressure levels are produced by brass instruments due to the directional characteristics of mid to mid-high frequencies.  Therefore, for brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, and tubas, microphones should face slightly off of the bell's center at a distance of one foot or more to prevent overloading from windblasts.

=== Guitars ===

Technique for acoustic guitars is dependent on the desired sound.  Placing a microphone close to the sound hole will achieve the highest output possible, but the sound may be bottom-heavy  because of how the sound hole resonates at low frequencies.  Placing the mic slightly off-center at 6 to 12 inches from the hole will provide a more balanced pickup.  Placing the mic closer to the bridge with the same working distance will ensure that the full range of the instrument is captured.

Some people prefer to use a contact microphone, attached (usually) by a fairly weak temporary adhesive, however this will give a rather different sound to a conventional microphone. The primary advantage is that the contact microphone performance is unchanged as the guitar is moved around during a performance, whereas with a conventional microphone on a stand, the distance between microphone and guitar would be subject to continual variation. Placement of a contact microphone can be adjusted by trial and error to get a variety of sounds. The same technique works quite well on other stringed instruments such as violins.

=== Pianos ===

Ideally, microphones would be placed 4 to 6 feet from the piano to allow the full range of the instrument to develop before it is captured.  This isn't always possible due to room noise, so the next best option is to place the microphone just inside the open lid.  This applies to both grand and upright pianos.

=== Percussion ===

One overhead microphone can be used for a drum set, although two are preferable.  If possible, each component of the drum set should be miked individually at a distance of 1 to 2 inches as if they were their own instrument.  This also applies to other drums such as congas and bongos.  For large, tuned instruments such as xylophones, multiple mics can be used as long as they are spaced according to the 3:1 rule.

=== Voice ===

Standard technique is to put the microphone directly in front of the vocalist's mouth, although placing slightly off-center can alleviate harsh consonant sounds (such as &quot;p&quot;) and prevent overloading due to excessive dynamic range. Several sources also recommend placing the microphone slightly above the mouth.

=== Woodwinds ===

A general rule for woodwinds is to place the microphone around the middle of the instrument at a distance of 6 inches to 2 feet.  The microphone should be tilted slightly towards the bell or sound hole, but not directly in front of it.

== Sound Propagation ==

It is important to understand how sound propagates due to the nature of the acoustic environment so that microphone technique can be adjusted accordingly.  There are four basic ways that this occurs:

=== Reflection ===

Sound waves are reflected by surfaces if the object is as large as the wavelength of the sound.  It is the cause of echo (simple delay), reverberation (many reflections cause the sound to continue after the source has stopped), and standing waves (the distance between two parallel walls is such that the original and reflected waves in phase reinforce one another).

=== Absorption ===

Sound waves are absorbed by materials rather than reflected.  This can have both positive and negative effects depending on whether you desire to reduce reverberation or retain a live sound.

=== Diffraction ===

Objects that may be between sound sources and microphones must be considered due to diffraction.  Sound will be stopped by obstacles that are larger than its wavelength.  Therefore, higher frequencies will be blocked more easily that lower frequencies.

=== Refraction ===

Sound waves bend as they pass through mediums with varying density.  Wind or temperature changes can cause sound to seem like it is literally moving in a different direction than expected.

= Derived Inference Rules =

This page introduces the notion of a '''derived inference rule''' and provides a few such rules.

== Deriving inference rules ==

=== The basics ===

Now we can carry the abbreviation a step further.  A ''derived inference rule'' is an inference rule not given to us as part of the derivation system but which constitutes an abbreviation using a previously proved theorem.  In particular, suppose we have proved a particular theorem.  In this theorem, uniformly replace each sentence letter with a distinct Greek letter.  Suppose the result has the following form. [Comment: This and what follows seems to me to be potentially confusing to students. The intention stated in earlier sections to avoid metatheory makes for a problem here as one really should know about the Deduction Theorem for this to make more sense.]

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2 \land\ ...\ \varphi_n \rightarrow \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We may then introduce a derived inference rule having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;...\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

An application of the derived rule can be eliminated by replacing it with (i) the previously proved theorem, (ii) enough applications of Conjunction Introduction (KI) to build up the theorem's antecedent, and (iii) an application of Conditional Elimination (CE) to obtain the theorem's consequent.  The previously proved theorem can then be eliminated as described above.  That would leave you with an unabbreviated derivation.

Please remember, removing the abbreviations from a derivation is not desirable.  It will make the derivation more complicated and harder to read.  Rather, the fact that a derivation ''could'' be unabbreviated if so desired (even though we don't really desire it) is what justifies the abbreviation, what permits us to employ the abbreviation in the first place.

=== Repetition ===

Our first derived inference rule will be based on '''T1''', which is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Replace the sentence letters with Greek letters, and we get:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We now generate the derived inference rule:

: Repetition (R)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can show how this rule could have simplified our proof of '''T2'''.

While this is only one line shorter than our original proof of '''T2''', it is less obnoxious.  We can use an inference rule instead of a silly trick.  As a result, the derivation is easier to read and understand (not to mention easier to produce).



== Double negation rules ==

The next two theorems&amp;mdash;and the derived rules based on them&amp;mdash;exploit the equivalence between a doubly negated formula and the unnegated formula.

Our next rule is based on '''T5'''.

: Contradiction (Contradiction)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


This rule is occasionally useful when you have derived a contradiction but the discharge rule you want is not NI or NE.  This then avoids a completely trivial subderivation.  The rule of Contradiction will be used in the proof of the next theorem.

=== Conditional Addition ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T6.} \quad \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

On the basis of '''T2''' and '''T6''', we introduce the following derived rule.

: Conditional Addition, Form I (CAdd)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: Conditional Addition, Form II (CAdd)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\psi \rightarrow \varphi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


The name 'Conditional Addition' is not in common use.  It is based on the traditional name for Disjunction Introduction, namely 'Addition'.  This rule does not provide a general means of introducing a conditional.  This is because the antecedent line you would need is not always derivable.  However, when the antecedent line just happens to be easily available, then applying this rule is simpler than producing the subderivation needed for a Conditional Introduction.

Now we use '''T7''' to justify the following rule.

: Modus Tollens (MT)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Modus Tollens is also sometimes known as 'Denying the Consequent'.  Note that the following is '''not''' an instance of Modus Tollens, at least as defined above.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Q} \quad \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The premise lines of Modus Tollens are a conditional and the negation of its consequent.  The premise lines of this inference are a conditional and the '''opposite''' of its consequent, but not the '''negation''' of its consequent.  The desired inference here needs to be derived as below.  

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 4 DNE
|-
|}
|}

Of course, it is possible to prove as a theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then you can add a new inference rule&amp;mdash;or, more likeley, a new form of Modus Tollens&amp;mdash;on the basis of this theorem.  However, we won't do that here.

== Additional theorems ==

The derived rules given so far are quite useful for eliminating frequently used bits of obnoxiousness in our derivations.  They will help to make your derivations easier to generate and also more readable.  However, because they are indeed derived rules, they are not strictly required but rather are theoretically dispensable.

A number of other theorems and derived rules could usefully be added.  We list here some useful theorems but leave their proofs and the definition of their associated derived inference rules to the reader.  If you construct many derivations, you may want to maintain your own personal list that you find useful.

=== Theorems with biconditionals ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T8.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T9.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T10.} \quad \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T11.} \quad \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theorems with negations ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T12.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T13.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T14.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T15.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

How to tell Blender: &quot;use this armature to deform this mesh&quot;

== The Armature Modifier ==
Blender now has a Modifier stack (Editbutton, F9KEY). As such, we should use it over existing methods to pair mesh and armature, as the modifier stack is optimised and simple to use. Note: You don't need to parent the mesh to the Armature anymore. The only case you could need to do this would be animating the Armature object itself. Then the mesh should also follow the armature. In this case select mesh, then armature, and do CTRL-PKEY --&gt; Object. 

[[Image:Ie_Arm_parent.jpg]]

The clean way to do so is to go in the Editbutton window (F9KEY) and press &quot;Add modifier&quot; in the Modifier panel, then select &quot;armature&quot; in the dropdown menu. Then you'll get a new modifier &quot;Armature&quot; like the previous picture. Change the '''OB:''' field to the name of the armature object that should control the mesh. This step is very important! Without the armature object being defined, Blender won't know how to modify the mesh since there may be multiple armatures within your world. To limit the effect of the modifier, you can enter the name of a vertex group in the '''VGroup''': field. This will minimize unwanted distortions in very dense meshes. There are also fields to enable/disable the modifier when rendering, enable/disable when working to only move the armature (could get handy with massive character), and when editing (that's very handy, you can edit the topology while it's deformed). There are also two toggles to tell Blender what it should use to deform: Vertex Groups and/or Envelopes. You may have noticed these options are repeated also in the Editbutton --&gt; Armature panel, but as the tooltip says: these two are used when you use virtual modifier (the old way) to keep compatibility with old files.

Parenting the mesh to the &quot;armature&quot; will create an old-way link, still visible in the modifier stack, but not very useful.
The first entry with the &quot;make real&quot; button is what appends if you do a CTRL-PKEY to &quot;armature&quot;.
You should not use that kind of connection when you see that. Press &quot;make real&quot; to get a working modifier.

== The Old Way ==
This way is not recommended but can still be useful. When doing CTRL-PKEY to &quot;armature&quot;, you will get a menu like this:

[[Image:Ie_arm_parent_menu.jpg]]

*&lt;u&gt;Don't Create Groups&lt;/u&gt; will just create a virtual modifier so you can deform the mesh (the &quot;make real&quot; button)
*&lt;u&gt;Name Groups&lt;/u&gt; is almost useless now as blender will create a group for you when you do weight painting.
*&lt;u&gt;Create From Closest Bones&lt;/u&gt; is a function to remember when you want to bake all your envelopes to vertex groups.

== Tip: Bake envelope to vertex groups ==
The workflow is very simple. When you are done with the envelope's tweaking and you have gotten the best out of it, delete the Armature modifier and parent the mesh to the armature. To parent it, go to object mode, first select the mesh and then the armature, then press CTRL-PKEY. Select ''Create From Closest Bones''. 

Do ALT-PKEY and redo the Armature modifier. Now all the envelope influence are converted to Vertex Groups. This way you can further tweak influence zone using Weight paint. More info in the following pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Bartending Wikibook.

Before we progress, we first look at exactly who a bartender is and what he does.

A bartender is someone who serves drinks behind a bar in a bar, pub, tavern or similar establishment. This usually includes  alcoholic beverages of some kind, such as beer (both draught and bottled), wine and/or cocktails, as well as soft drinks or other non-alcoholic beverages.

In addition to their core beverage-serving responsibility, bartenders also:
* take payment from customers (and sometimes the waiters or waitresses);
* maintain the liquor, garnishes, glassware, and other supplies or inventory for the bar;
* serve food to customers sitting at the bar.

In establishments where cocktails are served, bartenders are expected to be able to mix hundreds to thousands of different drinks.  

Bartenders also usually serve as the public image of the bar they tend, contributing to as well as reflecting the atmosphere of the bar. In establishments focused more on food, this can mean the bartender is all but invisible. On the other extreme, some establishments make the bartender part of the entertainment, expecting him perhaps to engage in flair bartending or other forms of entertainment such as those exemplified in films such as ''Cocktail'' or ''Coyote Ugly''.  Some bars might be known for bartenders which serve the drinks and otherwise let a patron alone, while others want their bartenders to be good listeners and offer counselling (or a &quot;shoulder to cry on&quot;) as required. Good bartenders help provide a steady clientèle by remembering the favoured drinks of regulars, having recommendations on hand for local night life beyond the bar, or other unofficial duties. They are sometimes called upon for answers to a wide variety of questions on topics such as sports trivia, directions or the marital status of other patrons.  

In regions where tipping is the norm, bartenders depend on tips for most of their income.  In those establishments where minors are allowed within the bar area, bartenders are also usually responsible for confirming that customers are of the legal drinking age before serving them alcohol.

==United States==
In some states, bartenders are required to obtain certification as a condition of employment.

The [http://bbbartendingschools.org Better Bureau Bartending Schools] has State information regarding alcohol server laws.

The Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) provides extensive detail on the typical job requirements faced by bartenders in the United States, as well as employments and earning statistics by those so employed.  For example, a November 2004 (unemployed) BLS study determined that Montana is the only US state where over 1% of the state's workforce is employed as a bartender.  

The following is the job description for bartenders used by the BLS:

:Bartenders fill drink orders either taken directly from patrons at the bar or through waiters and waitresses who place drink orders for dining room customers. Bartenders check identification of customers seated at the bar, to ensure they meet the minimum age requirement for the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products. They prepare mixed drinks, serve bottled or draught beer, and pour wine or other beverages. Bartenders must know a wide range of drink recipes and be able to mix drinks accurately, quickly, and without waste. Besides mixing and serving drinks, bartenders stock and prepare garnishes for drinks; maintain an adequate supply of ice, glasses, and other bar supplies; and keep the bar area clean for customers. They also may collect payment, operate the cash register, wash glassware and utensils, and serve food to customers seated at the bar. Bartenders usually are responsible for ordering and maintaining an inventory of liquor, mixes, and other bar supplies.

:The majority of bartenders directly serve and interact with patrons. Bartenders should be friendly and enjoy talking with customers. Bartenders at service bars, on the other hand, have less contact with customers. They work in small bars often located off the kitchen in restaurants, hotels, and clubs where only waiters and waitresses place drink orders. Some establishments, especially larger, higher volume ones, use equipment that automatically measures, pours and mixes drinks at the push of a button. Bartenders who use this equipment, however, still must work quickly to handle a large volume of drink orders and be familiar with the ingredients for special drink requests. Much of a bartender's work still must be done by hand to fill each individual order.

==Aim of this Wikibook==

This Wikibook seeks to teach you the essential theoretical knowledge you need as a barkeeper, whether you wish to do this as an amateur or as a professional. Then you will be ready to practice the art for real.

==Quotations about Bartending==

Here are some '''quotations''' related to bartending.  These quotations are from or to bartenders; from bartending books; or about bartending in general.

*''It took thousands, nay, millions of years for humankind to evolve to the point where its opposable thumbs allowed the species to finally achieve success in its tumultuous struggle to twist open a beer.''

*''To my mother, who could use a drink for having been blessed with me.''
:::--Dedication to ''Bartender's Black Book, 7th Edition'', ISBN 1-891-26775-2

*''Time to slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry Martini.''
:::--Mae West

*''A good writer is not necessarily a good book critic. No more so than a good drunk is automatically a good bartender.''
:::--Jim Bishop

*''In Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief desperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon-keeper occupied the same level of society, and it was the highest'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Work Responsibilities and Duties Intro.==
{{barwork|Needs lots of expansion sections need breaking off to different articles}}
As stated before, a '''bartender''' is not a simple autonomous drink mixer; he/she is the most important figure in the establishment. He/she must make patrons of the establishment feel welcome, secure, and relaxed.  To the patrons of a bar, the bartender is a very powerful figure. Bartenders must keep their work area clean. Counter tops and tables must be cleaned with disinfectant, soap and water. Outside furniture must also be wiped at the start of the day. Refer to your opening/shift change/closing checklist ensuring ALL duties are complete. Make sure people drink responsibly.

==Personality==
Another way to occupy the customers is to engage two strangers; a few words between two patrons new to each other can draw two strangers into a quick bond of friendship, which not only benefits them, but frees you, the bartender, up during the busy rush.
     
Always get your regulars something free once in a while.  Make sure that you have the authority to give out a free drink occasionally, or Popcorn.  You're a friend, you need to make sure you can get your best customers something free when they're low on cash, stressed out, or just generally could use it.  If a customer has been hanging at the bar continuously buying food and drinks for a while, you could mix them something cheap for free, perhaps something they haven't tried before. Note that in many states the giving away of alcohol is illegal for various reasons. However, it is often worthwhile for a bartender to purchase a drink for his or her customer out of his or her pocket as the money is often returned with substantial interest at tip time.

==It's all about Service!==
Bartending is the art of providing excellent service to each guest that enters the bar. A good bartender is one who is always ready to greet a guest, accommodate to their needs and serve them with the utmost respect and professionalism. When providing service to a patron the bartender should always maintain a cheerful and upbeat attitude, be able to quickly take a guest's order, prepare the order and complete the transaction in a collected manner that's swift and precise. Make them as high as possible. Approach the guest as they enter the entry to your establishment and greet with a smile. Always acknowledge a guest if you are busy with another order or guest. Let them know, &quot;you'll be right with them&quot;. Also, bus tables, bar tops and wipe down at all times during the shift. There should be no empty bottles/glasses etc.. left on tables or counters for an extended period. Wash dishes as you go, do not let them stack up as it looks dirty and unorganized.

===Steps of Service behind the Bar===
A bar can go from a  sleepy slow to a bustling, jam-packed, out-of-control place in only the blink of an eye. The way of reducing this potentially dangerous situation is to have a set procedure of service behind your bar. Situations that cause a lot of grief among patrons, especially those who have been consuming alcohol, can cause conflicts between patrons, or even worse bar staff, and should be avoided at all cost!  

#Greet your guest(s) and prepare them to order
#Offer service 
#Prepare order(s) 
#Complete transaction 
#Check back on customer in a timely manner 
#Say farewell to customer. 

If these steps are consistently applied whilst behind the bar, your daily workload becomes much more manageable, and your work shifts can be a much more productive time (remember, bartenders are still there to make money!).      

====Greet Your Guests and make them feel at home.====

Make your guests feel welcome in the same way you would make an old friend feel welcome at home.  Smile when they arrive and make sure they know you have pleasingly recognized their presence.  If possible, suggest a seat close to others sitting at the bar. The overall focus is to make guests feel as if they are not strangers and should not act as such.

====Offer Services.====
Once the guest is obviously ready to order, smile and ask what he, she, or the group, would like to drink.  

Here the skill of the bartender is often put to the test.  Many patrons will deliberately try to confound the bartender by requesting a drink that the customer thinks the bartender has never heard of.  In this instance it is best for a bartender to happily declare that the drink shall be made if the customer is glad to instruct in its creation.
The bartender also must be avoid under-pouring and over-pouring....

====Prepare Order(s). ====

All beverages should be created in the most expeditious fashion with a focus on cleanliness, precision, and presentation.  If at any point the bartender runs into difficulty it is best for him or her to acknowledge the problem and attempt again.  If the customer is unhappy with the result, the bartender should smilingly offer to remake the cocktail to the patron's specifications free of charge, given the ingredients are not exceptional in cost or rarity.

====Complete Transaction. ====

There is a common understanding in most &quot;cash&quot; bars that payment is due upon delivery of service.  In these instances the bartender should declare the cost of the drink while presenting it and execute the transaction by taking the cash while looking the paying party in the eye and making change (if applicable) as quickly as possible so as to reduce the amount of time the bartender's attention is away from the patron.  Once change is made it should be placed in the hand of the customer with eye contact and the amount of change should be clearly communicated so as to avoid error.

In the instance that a customer wishes to keep a tab there are two ways of handling this.  The first is to keep a cash tab for the patron.  Usually this is done by recording each drink on a slip of paper by hand and making the transaction on an agreed upon time.  

The second way is to run a patron's credit card and charge each drink separately to the electronically stored card number.  

In either case the burden lies on the bartender to make certain that all patrons are cognizant of the nature of a tab and that they are obligated to pay said tab at the agreed upon time.

====Check Back on customer in a timely manner. ====

Checking on the customer is a tenet of bartender success.  Many customers will require more than one instance of service and every good bartender knows this.  Most bartenders use a &quot;rounds&quot; approach where they keep mental track of the succession of patrons they have served, and repeat that sequence in their follow-up.  

The most useful technique is to simply look at the glasses on the bar.  The patron with the least in his or her glass will probably require service first.  Using this method requires more responsibility on the mixologist however as excessive drunkenness should be avoided at any honorable bar.

====Farewell customer and welcome them back. ====

The farewell is one of the most important parts of bartending well.  Just as every patron should be acknowledged on arrival, they should be acknowledged upon departure.  The enthusiasm of the farewell should be independent of any tip amount left by the patron as the best patrons will know how to tip in a respectable manner and there is sufficient time during a bartending shift to treat special customers or &quot;regulars&quot;.

The most successful bartenders learn the names of all of their patrons and are certain to use them when said patrons leave.  

A sincere &quot;thank you&quot; is required on patron departure along with an indication that he or she is always welcome to come again.

Never display money to a well-tipping patron.  The customer knows how much money was left as a tip.  To wave cash before a person is classless and beneath good mixology.

==Things a bartender needs==
There are many things a bartender needs.  These include personality traits and skills as well as physical objects like a bottle opener.

===Physical needs===

====''Bottle opener''====
A heavy bottle opener under the bar is a good thing to have.  These bolt against the bar and allow the bartender to leverage the length of the bottle against the cap.  Aside from this, a portable one may be kept on hand; don't use a light one, they can break or snap the bottle neck off. Most bartenders favor a heavy steel &quot;speed opener&quot; about 7 inches long. These openers allow quick, sure opening of bottles and the additional leverage helps cut down on soreness during long busy shifts.

====''Pens''====
You'll need pens to write up tabs, bills, phone numbers, phone orders, and the like. Ball point pens are best; gel pens that simply pour ink through a thin tube look very nice, but they can pool ink and leave trailing lines. You could enhance the display of the bar by keeping a novelty mug with writing utensils in it. It also might be a good idea to have a decorative tip jar, such as an oversized snifter, or ornate (but not expensive) vase close to these pens.

====''Rags or Towels''====
You'll need a rag or bar towel to wipe down the bar and clean and polish glass. As a rule of thumb it is always a good idea to have a generous supply of these on hand, as the busier the bar gets, the more mess the people will make. A dry towel should be kept close at hand (often placed in a back pocket, or hung from the belt). The wet towels should be used to wipe down areas to prevent sugar in drinks from sticking, subsequently drying with the dry towel.

====''Seltzer water''====
Bartenders need to clean things.  Sticky speedpours, dirty glasses, etc.. While all glasses and utensils need proper cleaning, there are many cleaning uses for carbonated water.  Speedpours, spoons that you used to mix something or spoon syrup are all candidates for seltzer water cleaning; just soak them in the stuff, especially sticky speedpours.  
Besides cleaning, seltzer water is an important component of some drinks.

===Mental===



====''Personality''====
A good bartender personality must be positive, welcoming, knowledgeable and just fun to be around! But also be strict if people get out of hand. You must be able to diffuse a negative situation and handle situations or people in a proper, peaceful and respectful manner. You must be able to tell a person &quot;No&quot; and cut them off if they have had too much to drink. You also must be respectful of other bartenders while they are working. It is important that the bartenders are on the same &quot;team&quot;. The bartender working is the person in charge of the bar during that time, unless the Bar Manager is on duty.

====''Knowledge''====
Bartenders need knowledge of a wide range of subjects, from sports to relationships to the local town.  Travelers may ask general questions about Manhattan, corporate clients might ask about the subway lines, etc..  You should also know the fastest way to the airport, police station, or hospital; where other bars or clubs are, especially if you're not in a club where patrons can dance; and where the social elites hang out.

====''Sense of humor''====
A bartender needs a good sense of humour.  Your customers will often need cheering up, or have funny stories at which you have to laugh.  A good trait in a friend is a sense of humour; and a bartender's number one job is to be a friend to his patrons.

You should also always have a good joke or two.  Just remember, not all your patrons want to hear about when your fishing buddy got his balls caught in a window sneaking out of a college dorm after a one-night stand; as Cunningham put it, always have a joke you can tell your mother.

====''Time-Management Skills''====
Just like any other service-oriented job, a good bartender has to make the best use of their time.  It may be a slow hour between rushes - make sure your back-up well and bottle reach-in is stocked, your garnishes are ready for the next rush, your ice tubs are full, and your glassware is cleaned and racked (even if - no, ESPECIALLY if - you have a barback working with you!). Oh yeah - don't forget to wipe down your bar, backbar, and worktrough under the bar once in a while.  The cat who taught me told me, &quot;If you're not always moving, doing at least 2 things at once, you're forgetting something&quot;. There is always something that can be cleaned or done. Check your checklist etc. Use dead time to tighten loose nuts on chairs, wiping blind, cleaning cigarette butts. Maintain the business at all times. Make sure to utilize the Communication Log after completing tasks to ensure that the next person doesn't do the same thing. The Communication Log is a great tool for you and for the business. It assists in communicating things in between meetings. The Communication Log should be read at the beginning of each shift, from the date of your last shift to current. The Communication Log should be written in during or at the end of each shift.

Somewhat related to this is if you have waitstaff as well as working behind the bar - make sure you take care of your runners. They're your &quot;force multiplier&quot;, and will double or triple your effectiveness by taking care of patrons, but only if you take care of them.  Little things - making sure their garnish trays are full, keeping patrons out of their launch pads, and pulling their pours on priority will both make you their hero AND keep more customers happy.

==Drinking Behind the Bar==
A difficult subject which requires a direct conversation with bar owners and managers. A bartender must balance the need to maintain a `professional image' and be in full control of their facilities with their obligations to appear fun-loving, and sell alcohol. 
Absolutely no drinking on duty! Drinking on duty will receive a warning and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

==Legal Obligations==
*Do not serve those who are already under the influence of alcohol
**This obligation needs flexible interpretation, but if someone has clearly had too much to drink, then you are legally obliged to refuse to serve them
**NEVER be afraid to refuse service.  You may be saving yourself, the license owner, and the bar owner serious (and possibly legal) headaches.  Trust your gut - if something doesn't seem right - likely it's not.
*Ensure that those you are serving are of legal drinking age 
**If you are unsure of someone's age, always ask for appropriate ID
**You can be given a heavy personal fine for serving alcohol to minors
**Know your state's alcohol laws.  Each state differs considerably.  If you bartend in more than one state (common on the east coast or between California and Nevada), remember which state you're 'tending in. Something that's allowed in one may be prohibited in the other - criminally so.

==Final words==

Enjoy your work and remember that &quot;Happier customers can lead to healthier business.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
This textbook concerns the wonderful world of '''macroeconomics''', or economics on a very large scale, concerning national and international systems. It is primarily aimed at students in their final few years of secondary education, though it could also be used by interested students younger or older than that. Having a background knowledge of [[Subject:Economics|economics]] would be useful, but grasping overall concepts should not require an in depth previous knowledge.

It is worth remembering that this textbook can be edited at any time, with the link at the top of this page. This is both good and bad - you yourself, having spotted a mistake or having noticed a poor definition, can correct it and should feel free to do so. The bad side is that anyone can edit it, so content may be inaccurate while the wikibook is in its infancy!

Now we use '''T7''' to justify the following rule.

: Modus Tollens (MT)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Modus Tollens is also sometimes known as 'Denying the Consequent'.  Note that the following is '''not''' an instance of Modus Tollens, at least as defined above.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Q} \quad \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The premise lines of Modus Tollens are a conditional and the negation of its consequent.  The premise lines of this inference are a conditional and the '''opposite''' of its consequent, but not the '''negation''' of its consequent.  The desired inference here needs to be derived as below.

|-
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1, 3 CE
|-
| 5.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 4 DNE
|-
|}
|}

Of course, it is possible to prove as a theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then you can add a new inference rule&amp;mdash;or, more likeley, a new form of Modus Tollens&amp;mdash;on the basis of this theorem.  However, we won't do that here.</text>

In this lesson, you will learn basic greetings, the first nine Persian letters, connecting letters, and unwritten vowels.

== Dialogue: ‹sa'''lâm'''!› ==
Shirin sees her friend Arash in passing and greets him:
: &lt;small&gt;The dialogues in lessons 1 through 3 are shown in [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]], a system of writing the Persian language in the Latin alphabet.  In later lessons, the native Persian script is shown along with a transcription.&lt;/small&gt;
{{Persian/dialogue-top}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Shirin | |sa'''lâm''', '''â'''raš!|Hello Arash!| audio=salam-s1.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |sa'''lâm''', '''ši'''rin! ce'''tor'''i?|Hello, Shirin! How are you?| audio=salam-a1.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Shirin | |'''mer'''si, '''xub'''am. tow ce'''tor'''i?|Thank you, I’m fine. How are you?| audio=salam-s2.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |man '''xub'''am.|I'm fine.| audio=salam-a2.ogg}}
|}

'''Explanation'''
:Arash and Shirin are using a casual style of speech typically among friends.  Later lessons will use various styles of speech, including some for more formal situations.

'''Vocabulary'''
{{Persian/vocab-list|hide Arab=yes

== The Persian Alphabet ==
The Persian language has six vowel sounds and twenty-three consonant sounds.  [[w:Old Persian language|Old Persian]] was written using [[w:Old Persian cuneiform|its own cuneiform alphabet]].  Other scripts were used in later stages of the language, and eventually the [[w:Arabic alphabet|Arabic alphabet]] was adopted.   The sounds of Persian are different from Arabic, though, so four letters were added for Persian sounds that do not exist in Arabic ( {{term-fa|پ|pe}}, {{term-fa|چ|ce}}, {{term-fa|ژ|že}}, and {{term-fa|گ|gâf}}), and letters for several foreign Arabic sounds are pronounced like their closest Persian approximation.

Thus, the twenty-nine sounds of Persian are written in the [[w:Perso-Arabic script|Perso-Arabic script]], which has thirty-two letters and is called {{term-fa|الفبا|alef'''bâ'''}}, named after its first two letters (similar to &quot;ABCs&quot; in English).  It is a cursive script, written from right to left like Arabic, opposite of the English direction. The letters are presented in the first four lessons of this book, followed by a summary of the whole alphabet in [[Persian/Lesson 4#Alphabet summary|the &quot;Alphabet summary&quot; section of Lesson 4]].

{{Persian linguistics note
| Culture Point: The Tajik (тоҷикӣ) language&lt;/font&gt;
| Not all dialects of Persian are written using the Perso-Arabic alphabet taught here.  The [[w:Tajik language|Tajik (тоҷикӣ) language]], spoken mainly in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, is a variety of Persian written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

The language diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran as a result of political borders, geographical isolation, and the influence of Russian and neighboring languages. The standard language is based on the north-western dialects of Tajik, which were influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persian world.

== ا  ‹alef› ==

| آ || ا
|-
| colspan=2 dir=ltr | {{Audio|fa-آ ا.ogg|‹â›}}
|}
The first letter in Persian is {{term-fa|ا|a'''lef'''}}.

At the beginning of a word (on the right side), alef has two forms.  The form on the far right here with the ''madde'' (the small &quot;hat&quot; on top: &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; ) is written as a tall, vertical stroke from top to bottom followed by the ''madde'' on top written from right to left as a straight (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) or curved (&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;) line.  This form represents a doubled alef ( &lt;big&gt;اا&lt;/big&gt; ).  It is pronounced with the long vowel sound /[[w:Open back rounded vowel|ɒ]]ː/ ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), transcribed here as ‹â›.  That is, it has a long duration and is produced with rounded lips and the tongue low and far back in the mouth, like a slow version of the vowel in the Queen's English pronunciation of ''h'''o'''t'', American English ''c'''augh'''t'', or South African English ''p'''a'''rk''.  When the first letter of a word is alef without a &quot;hat&quot; ( &lt;big&gt; ا &lt;/big&gt; ), it is read as a short vowel: ‹a› (IPA: /[[w:Near-open front unrounded vowel|æ]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;t'', ‹e› (/[[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|e]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'' or ‹o› (/[[w:Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;pen'', as will be seen in later examples.

When alef appears later in a word (after the first letter), it is always written without the &quot;hat&quot; ( &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ) and it always represents long ‹â›.

After alef (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;), the next four Persian letters, shown on the right, are all written similarly but with varying dots.

Persian letters have names that begin with the sound they make, so these four letters make the sounds ‹b›, ‹p›, ‹t›, and ‹s›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

| ب
|- dir=ltr
| {{Audio|fa-ب.ogg|‹be›|help=no}}
|}
The second Persian letter is {{term-fa|ب|be}}.  It represents the /b/ sound.  Its name sounds like a quick pronunciation of the English word “bay”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box
|Arab=آب|Latn=âb|audio=fa-آب.ogg
|آ|â|ب|b}}
The Persian word {{term-fa|آب|âb|water}} is shown on the right.  In this word, the initial alef is written with a “hat” ( &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; ), so it is read as long ‹â›.  Persian is written from right to left and positioned on and around a horizontal baseline that is typically not visible on the page.  The swooping stroke of &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; is written from right to left and sits on that baseline, as does &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; .  The dot is below the baseline and, like the dot in the English cursive letter ''i'', it is written after the connected strokes in the word.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian linguistics note
| Connecting letters
| 2=Like English cursive, most Persian letters in a word connect with each other, but separate Persian words never connect.  For example, &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; connects with the letter that follows it.  Notice, though, that the letters in &lt;big&gt;آب&lt;/big&gt; above do not connect with each other. That's because &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; '''never''' connects with the letter that follows it.

Connecting letters may be written one way alone (in the “isolated” form) or with slightly different forms when connected with letters before or after them:

&lt;div align=center dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:200%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ب&amp;nbsp;ب&amp;zwj;&amp;nbsp;&amp;zwj;ب&amp;zwj;&amp;nbsp;&amp;zwj;ب&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:{{Persian/fonts-traditional}}&quot;&gt;ب&amp;nbsp;ببب&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


The line above shows &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; in its “isolated” form on the far right, then in its “initial” form used when another letter follows, then its “medial” form used to connect it with letters on both sides, and then its “final” form used to connect it only to the previous letter.  Notice that the upward-swooping tail only appears in the isolated and final forms.  Many Persian letters have tails that behave this way.

As the remaining alphabet lessons will explain, all but seven Persian letters connect with the letter that follows.
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab= بابا | Latn= bâ'''bâ'''| ب&amp;zwj; |b| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ب&amp;zwj; |b| &amp;zwj;ا |â| audio=fa-بابا.ogg }}
As shown on the right, the swooping stroke of each &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; connects with the following &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; to spell {{term-fa|بابا|bâ'''bâ'''}}, an informal word for “father”, similar to the English words “dad” and “daddy”.  The other letters in this section are like &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; in that each has a swooping stroke that sits on the baseline and connects with the following letter, and each has one or more dots that are written after all of the connected strokes of the word.

Note that the alefs in &lt;big&gt;بابا&lt;/big&gt; are not at the beginning of the word, so they represent long ‹â› and are not written with a “hat”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=پ| Latn=pe| audio=fa-پ.ogg }}
The third Persian letter is {{term-fa|پ|pe}}.  It is pronounced as /p/ and its name sounds like a quick pronunciation of the English word “pay”.  Its swooping stroke is written from right to left like the other letters of this group, then after the rest of the connected strokes of the word are written, the three dots of &lt;big&gt;پ&lt;/big&gt; are written below the baseline.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=پا| Latn=pâ| audio=fa-پا.ogg | پ&amp;zwj; |p| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;پ&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|پا|pâ|foot}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ت| Latn=te| audio=fa-ت.ogg }}
The letter {{term-fa|ت|te}} is pronounced like /t/ and is written with two dots above the swooping line.  Its name rhymes with the other letters in this section.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=تا| Latn=tâ| ت&amp;zwj; |t| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;ت&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|تا|tâ|until}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian linguistics note
| Letters with dots
| Many Persian letters have one, two, or three dots.  In most printed publications, those dots appear as diamond shapes, or squares, or circles.  Groups of three dots are positioned in a triangle, and groups of two dots are positioned side by side.  In fast handwriting, though, three dots are often written as a caret (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;) and two dots are often written as a dash (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;)  or like a reversed tilde (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;~&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ث|Latn=se|audio=fa-ث.ogg }}
The letter {{term-fa|ث|se}} is one of three separate Persian letters for the /s/ sound, since that is the Persian approximation of the letter's Arabic sound [[w:Voiceless dental fricative|[θ]]].  In Persian, its name sounds like an abbreviated version of the English word “say”.  It is used mainly in words of Arabic origin and is not a very common letter in Persian.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=اثاث| Latn=a'''sâs'''| ا |a| ث&amp;zwj; |s| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ث |s}}
As shown on the right, &lt;big&gt;ث&lt;/big&gt; appears twice in the word {{term-fa|اثاث|a'''sâs'''|furniture}}.

Note the difference between a hatless initial alef pronounced as short ‹a› and an alef in the middle of a word, pronounced as long ‹â›.

{{Persian linguistics note
| Hook-shaped tails
| 2=Notice that the tails in these four letters hook to the right.  Recall that tails only appear in the isolated and final forms for letters.  When another letter follows, the tails are not written, so these four letters lose their hooks when another letter follows them.
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ج| Latn=jim| audio=fa-ج.ogg}}
The letter {{term-fa|ج|jim}} is transcribed as ‹j› and pronounced as [[w:Voiced postalveolar affricate|[d͡ʒ]]] (i.e. like the English letter ''j'' in '''''j'''ump''). The top stroke is written first from left to right above the baseline, followed by the lower hook extending counterclockwise below the baseline.  The dot is written later, after any other connected strokes in the word.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=جا| Latn=jâ| ج&amp;zwj; |j| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;ج&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|جا|jâ|place}}. This example shows that the shape of this letter changes when another letter follows it.  The top stroke is still written from left to right, but a simple right-to-left stroke along the baseline replaces the hook when another letter follows.  The other letters in this section change shape similarly when another letter follows.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=چ| Latn=ce}}
The letter {{term-fa|چ|ce}} is transcribed in [[w:Romanization_of_Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] as ‹c› and pronounced as [[w:Voiceless postalveolar affricate|[t͡ʃ]]] (i.e., like ''ch'' in English '''''ch'''ur'''ch''''').

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ح| Latn=he}}
The letter {{term-fa|ح|he}} is pronounced as /h/.  Its name sounds like a quick version of the English word “hay” (that is, it does '''not''' sound like the English word “he”). 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=حب| Latn=hab| ح&amp;zwj; |h| &amp;zwj;ب |b}}
&lt;big&gt;ح&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|حب|hab|pill}}.

{{Persian linguistics note
| Unwritten vowels
| You probably noticed that the short vowel ‹a› is not represented in &lt;big&gt;حب&lt;/big&gt; ‹hab›. That is because Persian makes an important distinction between short and long vowels.  The short vowels (‹a›, ‹e› and ‹o›) are not usually written in Persian.  When you come across a new word in writing you might have to find out how it is pronounced from a dictionary or someone who speaks Persian. Although there is a system of marking vowel sounds (see [[Persian/Alphabet|Alefba]]), it is only usually seen in children's books, because it disrupts the normal layout of text. In contrast, long vowels have their own letters and are written down.

More details about writing and pronouncing vowels will be presented in the [[Persian/Lesson 4|Lesson 4]].
}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=خ| Latn=xe}}
The letter {{term-fa|خ|xe}}  is pronounced like the [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] sound [[w:Voiceless velar fricative|[x]]] (like the Spanish letter ''j'' or the German ''ch''), transcribed in [[w:Romanization_of_Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] as ‹x›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=خاج| Latn=xâj| خ&amp;zwj; |x| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ج |j}}
&lt;big&gt;خ&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;ج&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|خاج|xâj|cross}}.  Like the previous few letters, the tail of &lt;big&gt;خ&lt;/font&gt; is not written when another letter follows it.

== Review ==
In this lesson, you learned some greetings, the first nine letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell several words with those letters from right to left.  You also learned that short vowels are usually not written, and that many letters change their shape depending on whether they connect with letters before or after them.

I had intended to eventually write some security stuff into [[Guide to UNIX]], but I might put it in this book instead. I do wonder what the current plans are. Some created a page [[UNIX Computing Security:References]]. Does that mean that this book uses colon convention? The slash convention &quot;UNIX Computing Security/References&quot; automatically generates upward links, but both conventions are acceptable. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
:My feeling is that security information would still be quite appropriate for the general UNIX books. I was going to aim this at a more hard-core security audience focusing on all the nitty-gritty details, &amp;c. So, ultimately, how to take a UNIX system and harden it down to meet government security ratings. On the sub-page conventions, I saw both types in use so I wasn't sure about which way to go. I'd be fine with using the slash notation instead. Thanks. :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 17:56, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

If you want to be really meaningful, to really educate people, then you might want to put Unix security in the context of theoretical security. Meaning, capabilities-based systems like EROS. Basically, at every turn you'd have to show how the security problem wouldn't have been a problem at all if it weren't for Unix's choosing the ACL route or would have been trivially resolved or how meeting certain govermental standards would have been deemed utterly impossible from a capabilities' point of view and they would never have been attempted (and how from a theoretical point of view it IS in fact impossible ...).

Estimated probability you'll take this advice: 1%. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 22:03, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:Even in a theorecal and acedemic sense, capabilities-based systems like EROS are not really better than ACL-based systems. They simply use an alternate representation of the security matrix. Either way you do things, you need ACTORS*OBJECTS*OPERATIONS bits of data. Both systems can support this. Since actors are normally not persistent and objects normally are, the ACL method is superior. Persistent actors will give you trouble when you decide to do an OS upgrade. Then, leaving theory behind, we get to the matter of compatibility... ouch. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

:Probability correct, at least for me. I wanted to focus more on real-world applicable solutions than on more abstract security theory. :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 20:05, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== DOS (denial-of-service) ==

A few tips at http://cr.yp.to/docs/resources.html describe how to deal with DOS (denial-of-service) attacks.
Which chapter here describes how to respond to DOS attacks?

:I just added in a chapter titled &quot;Attacks and Exploits&quot; to cover DoS, buffer overflow, &amp;c. Will that work? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 23:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

In the next box is the original content of this page, from [[User:nmontague]] at 1 February 2005. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
This is currently a placeholder for a set of books I intend to get working on after completing a couple books I am contributing to.

&lt;nowiki&gt;First will be [[Using OpenBSD/As a Firewall | As a Firewall]], from there [[Using OpenBSD/As a Webserver | As a Webserver]], [[Using OpenBSD/As a Mailserver | As a Mailserver]], [[Using OpenBSD/As an Internal Multiserver | As an Internal Multiserver]] and then [[Using OpenBSD/As a DNS Server | As a DNS Server]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;Each of these would cover some history on the protocols involved and talk about the specifics of setup, management and maintenance.  [[Using OpenBSD/As an Internal Multiserver | As an Internal Multiserver]] would cover sftp, scp, samba, dhcp and anything else handy for a machine on the inside of a home or office network.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;If I really get ambitious after all this I will do a [[Using OpenBSD/To Learn Unix | To Learn Unix]] book as well, which will cover shells, user administration and the like.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==As a desktop==
I think that I will start &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Using OpenBSD/As a Desktop]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if I have time. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:22, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

==Economics==
Every day, billions of dollars of shares change hands on stock exchanges worldwide. The United States alone produces $34.5 trillion worth of output daily. The social science '''economics''' concerns the use of scarce resources to maximize satisfaction of unlimited wants.

What is '''scarcity'''?  Scarcity, also known as the basic '''economic problem''', is a law of nature.  All resources, even those which seem to be in complete abundance (such as water), are scarce.  The principle of scarcity operates on two assumptions:

*Natural resources are finite and extinguishable
*Seemingly limitless resources are hampered by our inability to utilize them

Because of scarcity, every person, business, and government in the world must make ''choices'' concerning the use of limited resources.  However, we have limitless wants since we will always demand more gold, oil, or water. Economics deals with how to use these resources to make maximum efficient use to satisfy the maximum number of these wants.

==Assessing scarcity==
The choices people make when addressing scarcity are known as '''opportunity costs'''.  An opportunity cost is the next best alternative that could have been chosen.  Suppose that Company A makes 10,000 pillows per day and 4,000 mattresses.  Company A decides to make another 1,000 mattresses per day.  However, it is forced to cease production of 2,000 pillows.  The opportunity cost of producing 1,000 extra mattresses per day was 2,000 pillows per day.  If you choose to go to your college's football game and could have been doing laundry instead, then that task is the opportunity cost of your attending the football game.

Opportunity costs are an important part of economics that require further inspection.  Suppose that instead of producing 1,000 mattresses per day Company A could also choose to produce 3,000 blankets for the same lost production of 2,000 pillows.  What is the opportunity cost of producing the 3,000 blankets?  It is still 2,000 pillows.  It is not 2,000 pillows and the 1,000 mattresses which Company A could have produced.  Opportunity costs are thought of only as the ''single next-best alternative''.  The economic perspective focuses on the '''marginal analysis''', or only the immediate effects, of the costs.

==Marginal analysis==
Marginal analysis underlies much of economic thought.  Governments and businesses usually make decisions based on the ''marginal cost'' and ''marginal benefit''.  Marginal analysis deals heavily with '''utility''', or the satisfaction received from use of something.  Suppose you choose to buy a sports car from Company B.  Company B offers several options packages for that sports car.  The packages include: an upgraded radio; the radio and a navigation system; the radio, navigation system, and heated seats.  If you choose to buy the radio and navigation system package over simply the upgraded radio, your marginal cost is the extra dollar value you must pay.  Your marginal benefit is the utility you derive from having the navigation system.  If you decide the utility, and therefore the marginal benefit, is greater than the cost of the radio, and therefore the marginal cost, you should buy the radio.  If not, you should choose the less expensive package instead.

Economics evaluates mostly the marginal costs and benefits because the entire picture is often irreducibly complex or irrelevant.  You will later learn that in the short run a ''tradeoff'' (opportunity cost) exists between unemployment and inflation.  When one is low the other is high.  In the long run, however, there is no tradeoff between unemployment and inflation because unemployment will return to a natural level.  Despite this, a problem exists: the long run may well be ten to fifteen years.  Therefore, governments cannot simply afford to do nothing because they are confident unemployment will return to its natural level.  Instead, they use the short run model to decide what to do and evaluate the actual change which will affect people in the immediate time period.  

==Ceteris paribus==
This idea leads into another basic tenet of economics.  In any economic analysis, we usually assume that everything outside of the problem at hand remains constant.  For instance, some variables in our unemployment and inflation model will actually erase the tradeoff.  This happened in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, where there was low unemployment and low inflation at the same time.  However, for the most part the model is almost always correct.  Thus, for the purposes of examining those two variables, economists usually assume that all of the other possible variables affecting those remain the same.  Economists call this '''ceteris paribus''' or the ''other things being equal assumption''.  When considering economics, it is helpful to first evaluate only two variables, and then to examine the effects of other upon the '''model'''.

==Methodology==
As a science, economics follows the ''scientific method''.  Hypothesis are developed from observations, and are tested to ensure validity (usually in economics this simply involves more observation).  For results to be valid, a hypothesis must be able to predict an outcome more than once.

Economists are usually involved in '''theoretical economics''' and use their observation of facts to interpret them in a meaningful way.  They use cause and effect relationship to establish '''economic theories''' or '''principles'''.  Over time, a theory or principle may become accepted as universally true, at which point it becomes a '''law'''.  A law is generally always considered to be true.  A caveat to all of this is that all economic theories, principles, and laws are generalizations or abstractions.  They simplify the actual picture, even more so because of ceteris paribus.  A law, though almost always true, may prove false under special circumstances.  Like other social sciences, economics cannot apply universal rules because humans sometimes act irrationally.

==Positive and normative economics==
The act of establishing cause and effect relationships to create theories is known as '''positive economics'''.  Once positive economics establishes the rules, '''normative economics''' seeks to apply it.  Sometimes economists refer to this as '''policy economics'''.  Thus, they act to apply economic theories to policy.  This is where economists usually differ with each other.  Almost all economists, and virtually all capitalists, accept economic laws as true; however, it is their interpretation of what to do about them that brings them into conflict.  The chapters on [[Macroeconomics/Contents|Fiscal and Monetary policy]] provide examples of the competing points of view.

==Macroeconomics==
Economics is divided into two portions: '''macroeconomics''' and '''microeconomics'''.  This text deals with macroeconomics, the study of an economy as an ''aggregate'', or as a whole.  Macroeconomics deals with problems exclusively at a very large scale, usually the national level.  Economics concerns itself with several basic goals.  These can only be met at the macroeconomic level.  They will be discussed in the chapter concerning the [[Macroeconomics/Market Economics|market economy]].

==Cautions==
Karl Marx, who wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', stated that history is the sum of economic factors.  Largely, this is the case.  As such, economics is a much more controversial field than most people think.  This is because economics effects everyone equally, personally, and intimately.  Economics is the only science which touches us in a way we can relate to every day.  There are a few problems which people may fall victim to when assessing economics.  These include biases, &quot;loaded terminology&quot;, and jargon.  A few are more serious and harder to spot.

===The Broken Window Fallacy===
The following is an excerpt from Henry Hazlitt's &lt;u&gt;Economics in One Lesson&lt;/u&gt;:

''A young hoodlum, say, heaves a brick through the window of a baker’s shop. The shopkeeper runs out furious, but the boy is gone. A crowd gathers, and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies. After a while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection. And several of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that, after all, the misfortune has its bright side. It will make business for some glazier. As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon it. How much does a new plate glass window cost? Two hundred and fifty dollars? That will be quite a sum. After all, if windows were never broken, what would happen to the glass business? Then, of course, the thing is endless. The glazier will have $250 more to spend with other merchants, and these in turn will have $250 more to spend with still other merchants, and so ad infinitum. The smashed window will go on providing money and employment in ever-widening circles. The logical conclusion from all this would be, if the crowd drew it, that the little hoodlum who threw the brick, far from being a public menace, was a public benefactor.''

''Now let us take another look. The crowd is at least right in its first conclusion. This little act of vandalism will in the first instance mean more business for some glazier. The glazier will be no more unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death. But the shopkeeper will be out $250 that he was planning to spend for a new suit. Because he has had to replace a window, he will have to go without the suit (or some equivalent need or luxury). Instead of having a window and $250 he now has merely a window. Or, as he was planning to buy the suit that very afternoon, instead of having both a window and a suit he must be content with the window and no suit. If we think of him as a part of the community, the community has lost a new suit that might otherwise have come into being, and is just that much poorer.''

''The glazier’s gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor’s loss of business. No new “employment” has been added. The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction, the baker and the glazier. They had forgotten the potential third party involved, the tailor. They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene. They will see the new window in the next day or two. They will never see the extra suit, precisely because it will never be made. They see only what is immediately visible to the eye.''


===Post Hoc fallacy===
The ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy is the most common fallacy and the easiest to fall victim to.  In this fallacy, people assume that because Event A precedes Event B, Event A is necessarily the cause of Event B.  However, this is easily disproven.  If you go to jail and get raped, you cannot assume that you got raped because you went to jail.

===Correlation===
Correlation does not prove causation.  Often studies will attempt to prove any number of things by showing that when people did something, something else happened to them.  However, this proves nothing.  For instance, you cannot assume that because 90% of people who took the SAT applied to college that taking the SAT caused people to attend college.  More likely, it is the other way around.

===Fallacy of composition===
The ''fallacy of composition'' shows that just because something is true for an individual unit, it does not mean that it is true for the aggregate.  For example, if you leave a sporting event a few minutes early because there will be traffic at the end, you cannot assume that everyone should leave a few minutes early.  This will simply cause traffic a few minutes earlier.  More often this fallacy involves applying microeconomic principles on the macroeconomic scale.</text>

This module, in a word, is total fecies. It supports the exceedingly biased and distorted delusion that the computer revolution is something that happened because of business activity and investment. '''It DID NOT'''. The computer revolution was due entirely to the government, especially the military, and quasi-governmental organizations (fat monopolies) like Xerox, IBM and Bell Labs.

Microsoft in particular did '''absolutely nothing''' that any other company wouldn't have been willing and eager to do at the same time, at a lower cost both monetary and social. I'm referring there to its rapacious business practices such as using NDAs to hide blackmail from government. Microsoft is the mafia of the computer revolution and Bill Gates its Al Capone. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:37, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

: I think your arguments are just propaganda. Microsoft has brought computers to everyone's house (imagine housewives using HP-UX or something) and, no matter anyone loves it or not, is a part of computer history. No matter that &quot;anyone could do it better&quot;. Noone was able to compete with Microsoft so, apart from morality, this company should be mentioned. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 08:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Apple did that. Learn something other than propaganda and sucking at big corporations' teats, why don't you?

And the reason why &quot;nobody was able to compete with Microsoft&quot; is because they managed to rip off IBM and then proceeded to rip off every other hardware manufacturer under the sun.

And yeah, Microsoft ''should'' be mentioned. The form of that mention is what's at stake. The, quite typical, kowtowing to power you've just engaged in is exactly what I find disgusting. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 09:01, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:Apple did what, brought a computer into every home? Apple has done many things, but it has never held and maintained a majority share in the home computer market for any amount of time. Microsoft, whether you love it or hate it (and i get the vague idea that you hate it, for some reason) has made a number of good business moves in it's time, is good to it's investors, and has advanced the entire computer industry, either directly or indirectly. Windows may be an &quot;inferior&quot; OS according to you, but current versions of windows are fully backwards compatable all the way down to version 3.1 (Linux versions arent even all compatable cross-distro), and it has a commanding market share that it uses to provide standards for the entire industry. On top of all that, we can't even write what you want to write, because it isnt NPOV, and therefore would violate policy. sorry. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

: This is just ridiculous. Yes, Apple would be more of a candidate for &quot;brought computers to the home&quot;, because with their Apple and Apple II computers they actually had affordable hardware that people could buy and take home, while at the same time Microsoft was just providing programming languages. But what is really amusing is your skewed world-view. Regurgitating some stuff that you have probably heard about Microsoft sometime from somebody somewhere... name one example where Microsoft broke the law, or some morality standard that all other companies upheld (Apple Inc. in particular, which was based on copying and imitating (even literally stealing (physical stuff) from others) from hour one, which you would know if you knew more about Apple than just propaganda). They were shrewd businessmen, no doubt, but anyone whose company is still around today was. They didn't deceive IBM, they just knew how to get a good deal. And they didn't screw IBM over, IBM messed things up for themselves. Also, they have a long history of doing that, time and time again. But what do I even bother, you're probably also the guy who added the release of the iPad as an entry to a timeline called &quot;The Computer Revolution&quot;... and the mere fact that you put OS in quotation marks up there shows how little you know, or care, about facts. But what never ceases to amuse me is how Apple fanboy's love to pretend being the edgy underground outsiders who stick it to the establishment (i.e. Microsoft), when in fact not only is Apple just as big and just as much part of the establishment, but more importantly their past and current practices give them absolutely no moral highground to look down from.

==Colour Coding==

We need to find a way to colour code entries based on whether they're hardware, system software or internet related, that way people can keep track of the threads in history and see how they interleave. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:05, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, I've coded them. Now I need to create a style sheet. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 23:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

==To Add==

* the history of CPU chipmakers; the death of alternatives to x86 (death of SPARC, death of ARM, death of AlphaPC)
* Microsoft's vicious predatory practices and criminal activities
* early history of Mosaic, how it was ripped off from academia

::Yeah, about #2: we can write about how microsoft's business dealings got it to where it is today, but the second we start talking about &quot;The evil corporate beast that devors other companies, and destroys hope&quot;, we violate NPOV. If this issue gets you too charged up to contribute in a manner in accordance to wikibooks policy, i suggest you spend your time working on another book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:11, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== Warning ==

I just wanted to let the authors of this page know that wikibooks has basically entered a phase of clamping down on policy violations, and a number of books are going to be deleted off the site in the near future. This book is not a textbook, and will probably never be anything more then a timeline. It therefore is a policy violation, and will be subject to speedy delete. If there is a suitable place to merge this book, i recommend that it be done quickly. This book very well could land on the chopping block, and soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Instead of a time-line, how about someone writes an [[History of Computers]] book instead? Maybe talk about early machines used as computers like the ones Pascal invented, etc? The ones used to do calculations. Early computers used in the military. The migration from mechanical to electronic computers. The founding of IBM, etc. Major inventions that revolutionalized computers like the vaccum tube, transistor, microchip, etc. --[[User:Orion Blastar|Orion Blastar]] 21:54, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Spanish language uses adjectives in a similar way to English and most other Indo-European languages. Spanish adjectives usually go after the noun they modify, and they agree with what they refer to in terms of both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine).
Spanish adjectives are very similar to nouns, and often interchangeable with them. A bare adjective can take an article and be used in the same place as a noun (where English would require nominalization using the pronoun one(s)). For example:
* El rojo va aquí/acá, ¿no? = &quot;The red one goes here, doesn't it?&quot;
* Hay que tirar las estropeadas = &quot;We have to throw away the broken ones.&quot;

== Agreement ==

Adjectives in Spanish can mostly be divided into two large groups: those that can be found in the dictionary ending in o, and the others. The former typically agree for number and gender; the latter typically agree just for number. Here are some examples:
Frío means &quot;cold&quot;. This is the dictionary form, and it corresponds to the masculine singular form. When it agrees with a feminine noun, it becomes fría. When it agrees with a plural noun, it becomes fríos. When it agrees with a noun which is both feminine and plural, it becomes frías. Here is a list of a few common adjectives in their four forms:

* Frío = &quot;cold&quot;; → frío, fría, fríos, frías
* Pequeño = &quot;small&quot;; → pequeño, pequeña, pequeños, pequeñas
* Rojo = &quot;red&quot;; → rojo, roja, rojos, rojas
* Here are a few common adjectives that agree only in number:
* Caliente = &quot;hot&quot; → caliente, caliente, calientes, calientes
* Formal = &quot;formal&quot; → formal, formal, formales, formales
* Verde = &quot;green&quot; → verde, verde, verdes, verdes

The division into these two groups is a generalisation however. There are many examples such as the adjective español itself which does not end in o but nevertheless adds an a for the feminine and has four forms (español, española, españoles, españolas). There are also adjectives that do not agree at all (generally words borrowed from other languages, such as the French beige (also Hispanicised to beis)).

== Descriptive and attributive uses ==

=== The superlative ===

Instead of putting muy, &quot;very&quot; before an adjective, one can use a special form called the superlative to intensify an idea. This consists of the suffix -ísimo.

==== Regular forms ====

* muy rápido → rapidísimo
* muy guapas → guapísimas
* muy rica → riquísima
* muy lento → lentísimo
* muy duro → durísimo

==== Irregular forms ====
* muy antiguo → antiquísimo
* muy cursi → cursilísimo
* muy inferior → ínfimo
* muy joven → jovencísimo
* muy superior → supremo
* muy bueno → óptimo
* muy malo → pésimo
* muy grande → máximo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* muy pequeño → mínimo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;These two forms keep the original meaning of the superlative: not &quot;very&quot; but &quot;the most&quot;.

==== Forms that are irregular in high literary style, and regular normally ====
* muy amigo → amicísimo / amiguísimo
* muy áspero → aspérrimo / asperísimo
* muy benévolo → benevolentísimo / not used
* muy célebre → celebérrimo / not used
* muy cruel → crudelísimo / cruelísimo
* muy fácil → facílimo / facilísimo
* muy fiel → fidelísimo / fielísimo
* muy frío → frigidísimo / friísimo
* muy íntegro → integérrimo / integrísimo
* muy libre → libérrimo / librísimo (familiar)
* muy magnífico → magnificentísimo / not used
* muy mísero → misérrimo / not used
* muy munífico → munificentísimo / not used
* muy pobre → paupérrimo / pobrísimo
* muy sabio → sapientísimo / not used
* muy sagrado → sacratísimo / not used

==== Forms that are not felt a superlative anymore ====
* muy agrio (&quot;very bitter&quot;) → acérrimo (&quot;strong, zealous, fanatic&quot;)

Applying -ísimo to nouns is not frequent, but there is the famous case of Generalísimo.
As in English and other languages influenced by it, a teenspeak superlative can be formed by the prefix super-, or sometimes hiper-, ultra-, re- or requete-. They can also be written as adverbs separate from the word.

* Superlargo or súper largo = &quot;super-long&quot;, &quot;way long&quot;
* Requeteguay = &quot;totally cool&quot;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Asdfasdfasdfasdf. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Asdfasdfasdfasdf~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We have described a process of creating definitions of words by listing sequences of other words previously in the dictionary which are to be executed in turn in the order given. One can imagine calling a &quot;high-level&quot; word which in turn calls other &quot;high-level&quot; words lower in the dictionary, which call other words lower still. Note that all this structuring is for the benefit of the programmer, maintenance, and many other good reasons to be there.

There obviously needs to be something else than a means to organize sequences of previously defined words, and so on ad infinitim. Eventually we must come to a different type of word that actually does something: adds two numbers, moves a value, or other operation normally thought of in connection with &quot;machine instructions&quot;. These are called &quot;machine code words&quot;. At the bottom of the dictionary, classic Forth systems include a set of words of this type that implement a more or less standard &quot;Forth Virtual Machine&quot;. Often each machine code word is a short sequence of assembly language instructions that implement a particular standard function, for example a parameter stack manipulation named SWAP. Alternate implementations implement machine code words directly in hardware, as in the gates of an FPGA (Field Programmable Logic Array ~= Desktop hardware development environment).

The process of defining machine code words and &quot;high level&quot; words is formally analagous to &quot;axioms&quot; and &quot;theorems&quot; of such formally built up mathematical systems as Euclidean geometry or Bertrand Russell and Albert North Whitehead's Principia Mathematica [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica]]. Analagous questions of which axioms are essential, and whether it is necessary to add an axiom to allow a previously undefined operation to take place at all are considered in the design of the Forth dictionary. In this sense, adding a new machine code word that enables, for example, TCP/IP communications that could not be made to occur using a structure based on the previous set of machine code words is seen as adding a &quot;TCP/IP communications axiom&quot; to the dictionary.

Execution of a Forth program typically takes place when the user or another process requests the &quot;execution&quot; of a particular word.
If this is a &quot;high level&quot; word, a mixture of tracing through the sequence of calls and sometimes reaching a machine code word and doing instructions on the &quot;Forth Virtual Machine&quot;. Clearly, this technique can be used to great benefit when specialized hardware presents a unique set of machine code words necessary to send signals to exotic specialized processors or I/O devices. Adding the standard machine code and higher level words then provides an environment to develop additional &quot;high level&quot; words on top to bring out the functionality of the unique instrument.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Elizabeth II (1926 - Present) 
 

Elizabeth II Queen since 1952, Elizabeth is the elder daughter of Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She initially had little prospect of succeeding to the throne until her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in December 1936. Her father then became king and she became heir.

During World War II, she and her sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of their time safely away from the London Blitz, living mostly at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at Windsor. Early in 1947 she went with her parents to South Africa. After her return, her engagement to her distant cousin Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (formerly Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark) was announced. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20th November 1947. On the eve of the wedding the king conferred various titles on Philip, including Duke of Edinburgh.

In the summer of 1951 the health of King George VI entered into a serious decline. He died the following February, while Elizabeth was in Kenya. Now queen, she returned home. Her coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on 2nd June 1953.

From November 1953, she and the Duke of Edinburgh made a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. In 1957, after state visits to various European nations, they visited Canada and the United States. During her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she presided at a London banquet attended by the leaders of the 36 members of the Commonwealth, travelled all over Britain and Northern Ireland, and toured overseas in the South Pacific and Australia, in Canada, and in the Caribbean.

Over the course of her reign, the queen has tried to square the circle of a modern monarchy commanding respect in the age of global media. She allowed the televising of the royal family's domestic life in 1970 but has had to deal with its consequences: an insatiable hunger for information. She was known to favour simplicity in court life and was also known to take a serious and informed interest in government business, aside from the traditional and ceremonial duties. Privately she has become a keen horsewoman; she keeps racehorses, frequently attends races, and periodically visits the stud farms of Kentucky, US. Her financial and property holdings have made her one of the world's richest women

I ''really'' don't think it's wise to say that the Quadratic Formula should be used in place of completing the square where possible. While the Quadratic Formula may be derived from the process of completing the square, the two are not at all equivalent. Completing the square is a problem-solving ''method'' used in other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus, whereas the Quadratic Formula is a problem-solving ''tool'' which only gives answers. Encouraging the use of the Quadratic Formula in this way, as the tool of choice, will only make other areas of mathematics more difficult to the beginner. I refer you to [http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/example.html Peter Afeld's explanation] for a more in-depth explanation - and a much cleaner technique for completing the square (the one on this page would confuse all but mathematicians, I think). --[[User:Deriamis|Deriamis]] 22:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
To create a [[w:fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear bike]], a screw-on freewheel hub (not freehub with cassette) may be converted to fixed gear use.

==Supplies==
Parts:
*Wheel with screw-on freewheel hub
*Track sprocket
*Bottom bracket lockring
*Axle spacers

Tools:
*Freewheel removal tool
*Adjustable wrench (large) 10&quot;-12&quot;
*Thread locker
*Chainwhip
*Lockring wrench
*Cone wrenches
*Straight edge
*Metric ruler
*Truing stand
*Spoke wrench
*Dishing tool

==Hub selection==
The preferred hub for this process is called a freewheel hub.  In this type of hub, the freewheel mechanism is an independent mechanism that screws onto the hub proper.  More importantly, the bearings for the axle are contained within the hub itself; the wheel does not rely on the structure, or presence, of the freewheel for operation as a wheel, so the freewheel mechanism can be removed entirely.

Not all hubs are suitable for conversion to a fixed gear, though.  Modern hubs are an evolution of the freewheel: they split the gear cluster from the freewheeling mechanism in order to move the bearings further out from the bicycle's center plane. These hubs are called freehub hubs, and the cluster of gears used on such hubs is readily replaced. These hubs can not be converted using the method described below because the freewheeling mechanism (or body) is an integral part of the hub; the bearings that support the axle itself depend on the presence of the freehub body, so the freehub body cannot be removed and still leave a working wheel.

When considering a candidate hub, it will be necessary to identify the type of hub in hand. While the distinction between the two types of hub discussed above is not obvious if the hub has gears of the original type still installed, there is a simple method to distinguish freewheel hubs from freehub hubs: while holding the wheel and looking closely at the gears, spin the gears counter-clockwise, then note whether or not the circular metal band running around the axle is moving with the gears as they freewheel. If the ring remains stationary, the hub uses a freewheel; if the ring turns with the gears, the wheel is equipped with a freehub--and is not suitable for this conversion. &lt;!-- A good rule of thumb, though, is to count the number of gears on the hub.  Nine and ten-speed hubs are only available as a modern freehub.  Five and six-speed hubs can usually be assumed to be proper freewheel hubs.  Seven and eight-speed hubs may be found in both varieties depending on the age and quality of the bike. 

Once a candidate hub is found, it should additionally be verified to see whether it is truly a freewheel hub or not.  The sprockets on a freehub have notches on their inner diameter.  The sprockets slide onto the freehub where the notches mesh with the splines on the freewheel mechanism.  It is often possible when peering down the back of the largest sprocket, between the sprocket and the spokes, to see the ends of the splines just protruding from under the gear.  If splines are visible, the hub is not suitable for conversion.  Also, with seven speed hubs, if there appears to be a large lockring, threaded onto the smallest sprocket, not the inner side of the freehub, exposing a 1.5cm gap to the internals, it is a freewheel, not a freehub.  The splines may still be visible from the back, though. --&gt;

==Dismantling==
Once a proper hub is selected, it needs to be prepared for conversion.  Principally, the freewheel needs to be removed from the hub.  This is accomplished through the use of a freewheel removal tool.  The tool has splines on one end and a hex-nut on the other.  The splines fit into the freewheel, and the nut, through the use of a wrench, allows the freewheel to be unthreaded (in a normal counter-clockwise fashion) from the hub body. The freewheel must be held in position by a quick release or axle nut when it is turned by the wrench.

Many varieties of freewheel removal tools exist, so care should be taken that the correct tool is selected before trying to remove the hub.

==Sprocket selection==

===Gear ratio and sprocket selection===
With the freewheel removed from the hub body, the track sprocket can be installed.  When selecting a sprocket for installation, some consideration should be made.  The tooth count and sprocket width must be decided upon.

The number of teeth on the sprocket is a matter of user preference.  The number of teeth affect both the ease of acceleration and the top attainable speed, but the two factors are inversely related.  A lower gear (higher tooth count) will make starting from a dead-stop easier, but will require the cyclist to spin the cranks faster at high speeds, eventually at such a rate that a higher speed is not possible.  With training, higher rotational speeds are possible, but there is definitely a limit.

A higher gear (lower tooth count) on the other hand will make standing starts more difficult but will make higher speeds possible before reaching the physical limit of how fast a rider can ride.

Regardless of the tooth count guidelines, the final gear ratio is dependent, also, on the tooth count of the front chainring.  For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that the front chainring is a fixed variable.  When deciding the desired gear ratio, it is often helpful to ride a multi-geared bike first, testing the ridability of each gear ratio, to decide on the most suitable ratio. If the chosen sprocket size later turns out to be unsuitable, it can be changed.

It is also important to select a sprockets of proper width.  A traditional track cog, used on track bikes raced in velodromes, is 1/8&quot; in width, however, it is often the case with fixed-gear conversions, that the wheel is used on a normal road bike where the chainring and chain require a cog that is 3/32&quot; in width.  A cog of proper width should be obtained depending on the application.

===Sprocket installation===
After the sprocket is selected, it can be installed onto the hub.  The design of a freewheel hub difers from a proper track hub, so special care must be taken with the installation.  Because braking on a fixed gear bike can be accomplished by resisting the rotation of the cranks, it is possible to unthread the sprocket from the hub, which could prove disastrous under the wrong circumstance--even deadly.  This problem is solved on a true track hub by having a set of left-hand (reverse) threads outboard of the regular sprocket thread.  A special left-hand threaded lock ring is installed after the cog and prevents the cog from loosening, since the lockring would be tightened by any loosening of the sprocket.

This feature does not exist on a freewheel hub.  There is only a single set of normal, right-hand threads.  A track hub lockring will not fit on the hub; however, the lockring from an adjustable bottom bracket has the same threads as the hub and can be used to secure the cog, to a degree.  The caveat is that the lockring is threaded in the same direction as the cog and, theoretically, can loosen in the same way as the sprocket. An improvement to this combination--a threaded sprocket in combination with an identically-threaded lock ring--is judicious pinning of the sprocket to the hub. The downside to this method is that the pins used to secure the sprocket must be ground flush with the outside face of the sprocket, in order to accommodate the lock-ring, making it impossible to later remove the sprocket. However, this method is much more secure than simply threading the sprocket and lock-ring onto the hub.

Before installing the sprocket, apply threadlocker to the threads.  Screw the sprocket all the way onto the hub.  Use the chainwhip to tighten the sprocket.  It is recommended that the wheel be supported upright while the rider's weight is applied to the end of the chainwhip to greatly tighten the sprocket.  Caution should be taken not to strip the threads.

After the sprocket is installed, use the lockring wrench to install the lockring in the same fashion as the sprocket, using threadlocker and the rider's weight again.  Allow the threadlocker to fully set before using the wheel.

==Spacing==

Once the track sprocket has been installed, the hub is still not ready for practical use.  In its original freewheel form, the hub makes room for the sprocket cluster on the right by spacing the hub body toward the left side of the axle.  With the track sprocket installed, the positions of the sprocket is too far to the left and leaves a disproportionate length of axle exposed on the right.

To correct this spacing problem, axle spacers are removed from the right side of the hub, the bearing cones (and thus the hub body) are move towards the right, and extra spacers are installed on the left.  Technically, this is a straight forward process.  The spacers are usually situated on the axle between the outer locknuts and the threaded cones.  Use appropriately sized cone wrenches to loosen the locknuts.  The spacers should be able to be removed by hand at this point.  Depending on the hub, the existing spacers installed on the hub may be multiple, equally sized spacers or a single, specifically sized spacer on each size.  In the former case, it may be possible to simply remove one or more spacers from the right side and install them directly on the left side to achieve the desired spacing.  In the latter case, new spacers will need to be acquired before continuing.  These are usually available at better equipped bike shops.

Besides the purely technical aspect of respacing the hubs, the chainline must also be considered.  For a fixed-gear bike to be as safe and efficient as possible, the rear sprocket must be directly inline, from front to rear, with the front chainring.  This alignment, called the chainline, may be adjusted in a number of ways.  Varying length bottom bracket axles, cranks with differing spider depth, or chainring stackbolt spacers may all be used to affect the chainline.  Assuming that the crank and bottom bracket, though, are not open to modification, the chainline must be adjusted through the use of rear hub spacers.  Since the hub has already been dismantled for the purposes of converting it, it is reasonable to adjust the chainline at this point.

With the hub initially respaced, install the wheel in the frame and place a rigid straight-edge against the face of the chainring so that it is extending rearward toward the cog.  If the straight-edge aligns perfectly with the face of the cog, no further spacing adustments are required.  Otherwise, using a metric (or other finely graduated) ruler, measure the distance from the straight edge to the face of the cog.  Spacers can be moved around on the axle to account for the difference in the chainline.  For example, if the distance from the straight-edge to the cog is 3mm, 3mm worth of spacers should be removed from the right side and installed on the left.  This will move the cog 3mm to the right to bring it into alignment with the chainring.  Be sure, however, to maintain the correct locknut-to-locknut length for your frame (120, 126, 130 or 135mm depending on type and vintage of frame).   

After the desired spacing is achieved, the hub bearings should be [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Hubs/Cleaning_and_repacking_a_hub#Cleaning_and_repacking_a_traditional_cone_and_cup_front_hub|adjusted]] in a normal fashion.

==Dishing==

With the hub properly spaced, the rim will be found to be too far to the right and must be redished to move it back inline with the center of the frame.  Dishing is the process of adjusting spokes on each side of the wheel to bring the rim inline with the hub centerline.  The centerline of the hub is not related to the hub flanges where the spokes fits into the hub, but rather to the locknut faces where the axle contacts the frame.

Dishing is a normal part of [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Wheels_and_Tires/Truing_a_bicycle_wheel|truing a wheel]] and should be carried out as such. At a minimum only a spoke wrench is needed, a bicycle frames can be used as a truing stand. However a truing stand and dishing gauge will make the job much more convenient and quicker.  And if the wheel is in poor adjustment to begin with, a spoke tensiometer may be desired.

The only specific consideration that should be made is to the spoke length.  There is usually a sufficient amount of spoke threads and length to account for the relatively large shift in dishing.  There are times, however, when the process causes the spokes to protrude too far above the rim (more of a concern for a single-, rather than double-, walled rim), causes the spoke nipple to bottom out on the spoke threading, or causes the spoke nipple to disengage completely from the spoke threading.  The former two symptoms occur on the right-(or drive-)side.  The latter occurs on the left.  If any of these problems occur, the wheel may need to be partially rebuilt with spokes of correct length.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Statements ===
Most, if not all, programming languages share the concept of a ''statement'', also referred to as an ''expression''. A statement is a command the programmer gives to the computer.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a single statement
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Each valid C++ statement is terminated by a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).  The above statement will be examined in detail later on, for now consider that this statement has a subject (the noun &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot;), a verb (&quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, meaning &quot;output&quot; or &quot;print&quot;), and, in the sense of English grammar, an object (what to print). In this case, the subject &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;the standard console output device&quot;, and the verb &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;output the object&quot; &amp;mdash; in other words, the command &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;send to the standard output stream,&quot; (in this case we assume the default, the console).

The programmer either enters the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program, called interpreter), or creates a text file with the command in it (you can use any text editor for that), that is latter used with a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compiler]]. You could create a file called &quot;hi.txt&quot;, put the above command in it, and save that file on the computer.

If one were to write multiple statements, it is recommended that each statement be entered on a separate line.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;                   // a statement
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;; // another statement
&lt;/source&gt;

However, there is no problem writing the code this way:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The former code gathers appeal in the developer circles. Writing statements as in the second example only makes your
code look more complex and incomprehensible. We will speak of this deeply in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions|Coding style conventions Section]] of the book.

If you have more than one statement in the file, each will be performed in order, top to bottom. 

The computer will perform each of these statements sequentially. It is invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming. Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot; If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect code. Stop and check the language standards and the specific compiler depended implementation if the standard declares it as undefined.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it is a cout statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen. It'll look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;Hi there!&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the quotation marks are not there. Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose. The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;Hi there!Strange things are afoot...&lt;/pre&gt;

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used. For example, there could be a beep statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a window statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language. These differences are fairly superficial. The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's syntax. The set of verbs is called its library.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Compound statement ====
Also referred to as ''statement blocks'' or ''code blocks'', consist of one or more statements or commands that are contained between a pair of curly braces &lt;tt&gt;{ }&lt;/tt&gt;. Such a block of statements can be named or be provided a condition for execution. Below is how you'd place a series of statements in a block.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a compound statement
{
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  int result = a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Blocks are used primarily in loops, conditionals and functions.  Blocks can be nested inside one another, for instance as an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; structure inside of a loop inside of a function.

{{NOTE|Statement blocks also create a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|local scope]].}}

;'''Program Control Flow'''
As seen above the statements are evaluated in the order as they occur (sequentially). The execution of flow begins at the top most statement and proceed downwards till the last statement is encountered. Any single statement can be substituted by a compound statement. There are special statements that can redirect the execution flow based on a condition, those statements are called ''branching'' statements, described in detail in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Flow Control|Control Flow Construct Statements Section]] of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}
It is quite often the case that reverse code engineering a software product is teetering on the border of legal and illegal. Note that reverse engineering a competing car or a weapon is never legally challenged, nor was reverse engineering software a few decades ago. So as a reverse engineer, you should know your rights and the rights of the software owner.  This chapter will focus on just that, exploring issues surrounding patents, copyrights, and licensed software. Even if you play by the rules, you are not immune to harassment lawsuits. (NB: The material here reflects the legal position in the USA. Other juridictions may have different laws.)

== Patented Software ==

Explain the rights of the software owner under the patent law

== Copyrighted Software ==

There are laws about the copyright that someone who reverse-engineers must take care of in open source projects, and the common approach to this problem is to divide the programmers into 2 groups:

#The one who disassembles the code of the program/firmware and writes the specifications.
#The second group that makes a program using these specifications.

=== Fair Use ===

Under a few circumstances, fair use allows the reproduction of copyrighted material without the owner's permission.  The Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html § 107] states specifically:

{{cquote|
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000106----000-.html 106] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000106---A000-.html 106A], the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include— 

# the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
# the nature of the copyrighted work; 
# the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and 
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
}}

In terms of reverse engineering and fair use, the law tends to favor the reverser.  However, negatively effecting the value of the original product will almost never result in it being categorized as &quot;fair use.&quot;  Also keep in mind that fair use does not permit breaking the user license terms.

It needs to be noted that fair use is not black and white.  The line between fair use and copyright infringement is very gray.  Unless you are very confident about what you are doing, you shouldn't do it.

=== Digital Millennium Copyright Act ===
{{Wikipedia|Digital Millennium Copyright Act}}
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act was put into place in 1998 in order to make any service or device with purpose of undermining or removing DRM (Digital Rights Management) copyright infringement.  The act forbids any service or device from being designed to circumvent, or even being marketed to circumvent any DRM.

There is, however, an exception in the DMCA stating that reverse engineering can be done under the purposes of inter-operability between software components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ304.105.pdf Digital Millennium Copyright Act], Public Law 105–304 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  It states the following:

{{cquote|
REVERSE ENGINEERING.—
#Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.
#Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.
#The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.
#For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘interoperability’ means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.}}

Fair use does still apply. However, it is not fair use to gain unauthorized access to copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf &quot;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998&quot;] Copyright Office Summary (December 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

== End User License Agreement ==

An end user license agreement (or EULA) is a legal contract between the software manufacturer and the user. It explains the terms under which the user may use the software, giving a list of conditions of what the user may and may not do. This contract can states anything from the number of copies that can be made to conditions under which it can be reverse engineered.

=== EULA and Fair Use ===

Fair use seems to be safe ground for reverse engineers, almost always using it as a defense.  However, an EULA is a legally binding contract.  If a user agrees to terms which are in conflict with fair use, the user has effectively waived their rights to fair use.

In the case of Davidson &amp; Associates v. Jung &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lclark.edu/faculty/loren/objects/bnetdappEDIT.pdf &quot;Davidson &amp; Associates v. Jung, 422 F.3d 630 (8th Cir. 2005)&quot;] &lt;/ref&gt;, Ross Combs, Rob Crittenden, and Jim Jung reverse engineered Blizzard's protocol language to allow gamers to play pirated video games online.  In this case, the reverses agreed to an EULA and TOU (Terms of Use) prohibiting reverse engineering.  The judge found the EULA and TOU to be enforceable by law and that a user's right to reverse engineer a product can be contractually waived.

== Famous Cases ==

=== Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm &quot;Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc.&quot;] U.S. Court of Appeals (September 1992) &lt;/ref&gt; ===

When Nintendo came out with the Nintendo Entertainment System, they designed a program, the 10NES, to prevent unauthorized video games from working on the NES.  In order to make an authorized game, you had to become licensed with Nintendo.  And the license agreement basically stated that a company could only make five games per year and prevented them from selling the same games to other home entertainment systems.

Atari attempted to crack the 10NES in order to bypass any need for a restrictive licensee agreement. In 1986 they purchased some Nintendos and started reverse engineering. By chemically dissolving top layers of the chip containing the 10NES, they were able to use a microscope to physically look the bits and accrue some of the object code.  The object code was then decompiled to source.  However, Atari was unable to completely reverse the 10NES using this method.

In 1988, Atari requested a copy of the 10NES source code from the Copyright Office.  To get the Copyright Office to comply, they lied and said they were involved in an infringement lawsuit with Nintendo.

Once Atari completely understood the 10NES program, they built a program that defeated it.  In 1989, Nintendo filed charges against them for unfair competition, patent infringement, copyright infringement, and trade secret violations.

One of Atari's defenses was that reverse engineering was fair use under the copyright law.  In the end, the courts decided the act of chemically peeling back the chip and looking at the bits to get the object code on systems they purchased was fair use.  It was expected that the courts would find Atari at fault for copyright infringement for stealing the source from the Copyright Office.  However, in 1994 Atari and Nintendo settled out of court.

=== Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade Inc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1561.htm &quot;Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade Inc.&quot;] U.S. Court of Appeals (October 1992) &lt;/ref&gt; ===

This case concerned Sega's video game console and cartridges. The cartridges had a 20-25 byte code segment which was interrogated by the console, as a security measure.

Accolade disassembled the code which was common to three different Sega games cartridges, to find the security segment, and included it in competing games cartridges. 

The Ninth Circuit held this disassembly to be a permitted &quot;fair use&quot; of the copyright in the games programs that the disassembly of copyrighted object code as a necessary step in its examination of the unprotected ideas and functional concepts embodied in the code is a fair use that is privileged by section 107 of the Copyright Act. Because disassembly was the only means of gaining access to those unprotected aspects of the program, and because Accolade has a legitimate interest in gaining such access (in order to determine how to make its cartridges compatible with the Genesis console).

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mkalz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mkalz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:31, 17 March 2015 (UTC)
&lt;!-- SUL finalisation notification --&gt;

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The PowerPoint Window==
[[Image:PowerPoint_Window.png|PowerPoint Window]]
#'''Title Bar''' - Displays the name of the application followed by the title of the presentation
#'''Formatting Toolbar''' - Provides quick access to commands you need for formatting
#'''Outline and Slides Tab''' - The slides tab gives you a thumbnail view of all the slides in the presentation and allows to rearrange their order; the outline tab adds textual content to the slides in an outline format
#'''Slide Pane''' - Area where you build the slides for your presentation
#'''View Buttons''' - Change the way you view the presentation; the Normal view (left button) is the default, the Slide Sorter view (center button) shows you only the thumbnails and is used to sort and rearrange the presentation, and the Run view (right button) runs the presentation from the current slide
#'''Drawing Toolbar''' - Provides all the tools you need to draw and format objects
#'''Notes Pane''' - Adds notes for yourself for each slide in your presentation
#'''Task Pane (Windows version)''' - Varies based on what you are currently working on; when you first start PowerPoint, you see the New Presentation task pane; other possible tasks include Slide Layout, Slide Design, and Effects
#'''Menu Bar''' - Includes all of the PowerPoint menu choices
#'''Placeholders''' - Designate the space that will be filled with titles, text, or other objects such as graphics or charts
#'''Application Close Button (Windows Version)''' - Exits PowerPoint
#'''Presentation Close Button (Windows version)''' - Closes the current presentation

==Create a New Presentation==
===Using a Design Template===
#If necessary, choose '''File''' &gt; '''New''' to display the '''New Presentation''' pane
#On the '''New Presentation''' pane, click on the '''From Design Template''' link
#The '''Slide Design''' pane will display on the right side of the screen with a variety of different templates to choose from
#Select the design of your choice from the '''Slide Design''' pane
#Click '''OK''' to begin working with the first slide in the Normal View

===Using a Blank Presentation===
#If necessary, choose '''File''' &gt; '''New''' to display the '''New Presentation''' pane
#On the '''New Presentation''' pane, click on the '''Blank Presentation''' link

This will open a new presentation with no template. You will provide the content, background, color scheme, text format, etc.  This method gives you the most freedom, but also requires the most amount of time to complete.

==Adding a new slide==
Once you have opened a new presentation, the next step is to add and format the content.  PowerPoint provides a selection of pre-defined slide layouts based on different types of content that you can use to quickly add content to the slides.  For each of the 27 Slide Layouts provided, PowerPoint combines the four types of placeholders in different combinations; each placeholder will be replaced with the following type of content:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Placeholder: !! Replaced with:
|-
| Title
| A title
|-
| Subtitle
| A subtitle
|-
| Text
| A bulleted list
|-
| Content
| Clipart, a diagram, a chart, a table, a media clip, or a picture
|+''Slide Layout Placeholders''
|}

Using a Slide Layout ensures that the text and other elements you enter into the placeholders will have consistent spacing and be optimally arranged.

===How to Add Slides to a Presentation===
#Click the New Slide button on the Formatting toolbar.
#From the list of Slide Layouts, select the layout you want to apply to the new slide.
#You may now begin adding content using the placeholders in the layout.

===How to Change the Layout for any Slide===
PowerPoint will try to guess what layout you want to use for new slides that are added to the presentation.  If you want a different layout for the slide you can quickly change the layout for any slide.

#Display the slide that you want to change in the Slide Pane (work area in the center of the window).
#Choose '''Format &gt; Slide Layout''' to display the Slide Layout task pane.
#Click on the layout you want to apply to the slide.
#PowerPoint will attempt to fit existing content into the new layout, but you will probably have to make additional changes.

===How to Add Slides in the Outline Tab===
You can also create new slides while working in the Outline tab.  By default the Outlining toolbar should display, but if it does not, select '''View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Outlining'''.

#Display the Outline tab by clicking on Outline in the pane on the left.
#Place the cursor at the end of the text in the slide you wish the new slide to follow.
#Click the '''New Slide''' button to insert a new slide.

==Entering Text on a Slide==

===Enter Text on a Slide Using Placeholders===
#Click on the '''Title''', '''Subtitle''', or '''Text''' placeholder.
#Type the text you want.
#If necessary, press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to move to a new line.
#Click anywhere on the slide outside of the placeholder to deselect it.

===Enter Text Using the Outline Tab===
Working in the '''Outline Tab''' allows you to type and edit text for the presentation in a more word processing-like environment than the Slide pane.  The Outline tab displays in the pane on the left side of the screen when you are working in the Normal view.

Information in the Outline tab is arranged by levels.  The Title of each slide appears as the first, left-most level next to a numbered icon of the slide. Bulleted text is indented one to four levels to the right of the title.  The Outline tab has an Outlining toolbar that displays to the left of the pane.

''Tip:  If the Outline and Slides panes are not displaying in the Normal view, select '''View &gt; Normal (restore panes)''' and it will display on the left side of the screen.''


#After adding a new slide, Type the slide title and press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]'''.
#To change the slide text to a first level bullet, press '''[Tab]''' or click the '''Demote''' button on the Outlining toolbar.
#Type the text for the first bullet and press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to move to the second bullet.
#To create a sub-bullet, press '''[Tab]''' and type the text.
#Continue to enter text for bullets and sub-bullets until the slide is complete.
**Use '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to create a new instance of the same level you are on.  For example, if you are typing a level one bullet, pressing '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' will create another level one bullet.
**To demote a line of text, use '''[Tab]''' or the '''Demote''' button.  This will make a level one bullet into a level two sub-bullet.
**To promote a line of text, press '''[Shift] and [Tab]''' together or click on the '''Promote''' button.  This will turn a level one bullet into the Title of a new slide.

==Adding Clip Art to a Slide==
Effective visuals emphasize the key content points in a presentation.  PowerPoint provides a selection of professionally designed pictures, or clip art, that you can use in your presentations.  These clip art images include many different themes such as animals, people, buildings, food, holidays, business, and more.

===How to Insert a Clip Art Image===
#Move to the slide on which you want to place clip art.
#Apply a Slide Layout that includes a content or clip art placeholder.
#Open the Select a Picture dialog box by:
**Clicking on the Clip Art button on the content placeholder OR
**Double-clicking on the clip art placeholder
#In the '''Search''' box, type a word or phrase that describes the clip you want.
#Click '''Search'''.  PowerPoint displays the search results in the Select Picture List.
#Click on the clip art image you want and click '''OK'''.

===How to Resize a Clip Art Image===
Once you have added a clip art object to your slide, you can resize it to make it fit better into your presentation.

#Click on the Clip Art object to select it.
#Put the arrow on one of the resize handles at the corner of the picture until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow.
#Depress the mouse button and drag the handle toward or away from the center to make the image larger or smaller.  The corner handles resize the image proportionally and the handles on the sides of the image increase or decrease the height or width of the image.  When you release the mouse button, the object appears in its new size.

==Editing Slide Text==
You know how to enter text into your presentation, but what happens if you decide you want to change the text?  PowerPoint allows you to navigate to a specific slide and change the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The advent of the Domain Name System has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks, particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue. As with dilution protection, enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market, because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service.

This conflict was more easily resolved when the domain name user actually used his website to compete with the trademark owner. Cybersquatting, however, involves no such competition, but instead an unlicensed user registering the trademark as a domain name in order to pressure a payoff (or other benefit) from the lawful mark owner. Typosquatters—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits.

This clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue (and not always successfully) within the framework of existing trademark law. As the website itself was not the product being purchased, there was no actual consumer confusion, and so initial interest confusion was a concept applied instead. Infringing domain names were analogized to a sign identifying one store but falsely placed in front of another, in the hopes that customers will in the end not care that they were duped or will at least give up on trying to reach the right store.

Most courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting, and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., &quot;trafficking&quot; in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement. Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters.
This international legal change has also led to the creation of ICANN Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy and other dispute policies for specific countries (such as Nominet UK's DRS) which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name (without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages). This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous.

Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy is a policy of ICANN for the resolution of disputes over domain names. According to the policy, complaints are submitted to approved dispute-resolution service providers, which can be corporations or non-profit organizations. The process is based on international and national dispute resolution traditions.

Registrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves (e.g., &quot;XYZ.COM&quot;) as trademarks for perceived advantages, such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked, and to avail themselves of such remedies as confusion or passing off against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names.

As with other trademarks, the domain name will not be subject to registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant's goods or services to the public, rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant's web site appears. Amazon.com is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public's identification of the company and its products.

Terms which are not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning, do not become registrable when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it. Examples of such domain names ineligible for trademark protection would be &quot;SOFT.COM&quot; (merely descriptive when applied to a product such as facial tissue), or &quot;BANK.COM&quot; (generic for banking services).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A saxophone embouchure is formed by placing the top teeth about mid-way on the mouthpiece and applying the lower lip as a cushion on the reed (lower part of the mouthpiece). The upper lip muscle is then pulled downwards around the mouthpiece. Think of the upper lip as a clamp and the lower lip as the control. The saxophone embouchure may be described as an &quot;O&quot; shape. Note that the jaw should be dropped and the throat open. Practice this by singing a very low note, this is similar to how your embouchure will be while playing. For a better tone, practice keeping the corners of your mouth drawn in an &quot;O&quot; shape around the mouthpiece, sealing the air from all sides. This may not feel natural at first, but with practice it will become second nature.

One common practice technique for embouchure is called Long Tones. The idea is to play long controlled notes. While doing this it is helpful to imagine the air leaving your mouth and traveling through the saxophone to your listener. One good LT exercice is to start on the mid-c# then D the expand with each following note, C#-D, C-Eb and so on until you have played through the full range of the saxophone, then reverse until you're back a the C#.

There are other embouchures that can be used to produce multiphonic sounds.

Breathing is extremely important in sound production. Breath with your stomach region, using the abdominal muscles to assist in the blowing. When taking a breath, breathe through the corners of your mouth so as not to disturb your embouchure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Selecting a Parking Spot ==


The choice of a parking spot is one of the most critical decisions a vehicle dweller will make. The choice of parking spot for a night will have much to do with safety, security, quality of sleep, and avoidance of police. Considering the fact that more and more communities are passing laws that make it illegal to sleep in a vehicle, stealth is of utmost importance if in the city. If one is boondocking in the wilderness, this is of little consideration. So, the choice of parking spot creates an incredible challenge. Let us consider several different scenarios, and analyze the pros and cons of each.

'''Forested Wilderness'''

From the standpoint of safety, security, and a quiet night's sleep, nothing is likely to be better than a heavily forested location miles and miles from civilization, parked next to a creek or river. The serene surrounding and gentle sound of flowing water quickly settles me down and allows me to get right to sleep.

Finding such spots is not difficult in some parts of the country, such as the Rocky Mountain region, Pacific Northwest, and central Appalachians, but may be much more difficult in other parts of the United States. Your mileage may vary in other countries.

A significant downside to living in these areas is also the reason you are there: The remoteness. Being so remote also means you are far from gas stations and grocery stores and other conveniences of modern life.

'''Desert and Plains'''

There is a lot of this land and many people congregate for certain seasons in these open areas. You can usually be closer to civilization and have more of a community atmosphere, but noise and other things that come along with being around other ''Homo sapiens'' can be a negative. I have never done this before, so somebody else could fill this in better.

'''City Camping: Residential'''

When van dwelling in an urban environment, you pretty much have three choices of places to park: Residential, commercial, and industrial areas.

The beauty of residential areas is that it is usually common to have cars on the street at night, so it is potentially easy to blend in, depending on what kind of vehicle you have. It is less common in wealthier neighborhoods to see vehicles on the street, and you should also be aware of crime rates in the neighborhood you choose to inhabit.

Living in a large cargo van makes me shy away from parking in most residential areas, as the vehicle just doesn't fit in as well.

'''City Camping: Commercial Areas'''

Retail and business sectors are my preferred parking areas for my cargo van. It is not unusual to see large cargo vans, box vans, and other commercial-looking vehicles in these parts of town, since many businesses use them as service and delivery vehicles. When stealth is of the utmost importance, commercial/business parks are the cream of the crop. Not only are larger vehicles commonly parked overnight in these parts of town, it is also common to see smaller cars in these areas because there are night crews doing stocking, cleaning, customer service, etc.
It also helps to strap a disguise on your van. So if u park by a plumbing supply it helps to put magnets on van that says &quot;Bobs Plumbing&quot; and add pcv pipe on the roof. 

'''City Camping: Industrial Sectors'''

Industrial zones are typically noisier and dirtier than most other parts of cities. These areas are also more likely to have 24-hour operations, which mean more people coming and going during the night. Private security is also more abundant near industrial facilities. This increases the likelihood of somebody seeing you come and go, or  of having your window tapped on in the middle of the night. In large metropolitan areas, crime rates also tend to escalate near large industrial areas. To me, these are all reasons to avoid industrial parts of town.

'''Summary: The Best Parking Place?'''

I personally find the best possible parking spot to be a quiet, low-traffic dead end piece of road with several other vehicles parked nearby on the border between a middle-class residential neighborhood and a large office or retail park. My van typically fits in perfectly in this sort of place and I tend to feel safe and secure knowing other people are nearby.

'''Other Ideas'''

Many websites offer tips on parking.  In general parking relates to the concept of movement discipline.  Have checklists in the vehicle (a good idea in general) like those of an airline pilots, and go through your checklist each time you move the vehicle.

Here are a few discreet parking strategies.

With intent to leave:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park in areas of high visibility to deter theft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

With intent to stay:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a cohort, they can park the van for you practically anywhere that allows overnight parking.  To external observers it would appear as though your cohort had simply parked the van and left.  If you have a van with a barrier you may consider simply getting in the back of the van to start with (although that may arouse suspicion), or driving into an alley or some unobservable place and transfer to the back there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park in the very early hours of the morning, and shut your door as though you had left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park so as to obscure visibility of your entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park the van as if to leave it overnight and return to it later.  Be aware of who is watching you.  Not recommended in residential areas where you cannot be sure if you are being watched, except for late at night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always park near other vans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In winter park in sunlight, and summer in shadow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid parking in front of someone's house in a residential neighborhood, unless you plan on leaving early in the morning.  Some residential areas that are mainly apartment complexes are better, where the people living there don't own the property, but people who own their own homes tend to believe that the curbside in front of their house is their property too, even though it is city property, and they might call the police on you.
&lt;li&gt;If you need to be in a city, try parking near a college or university.  It is borderline acceptable that some college students are poor and live in vehicles, and most of the facilities on college campuses such as bathrooms, gym showers, and library are available to anyone.

Also truck stops, rest areas and Wallmart lots are usually good spots to park n sleep.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Startup==
 Run &lt;tt&gt;start.bat&lt;/tt&gt; (win32) or &lt;tt&gt;start.sh&lt;/tt&gt; (Unix) to start the Application.

This starts the application in a maximised window. It is possible to start the application in fullscreen mode as would likely be required in a deployment scenario. See below for further details. 

The lower part of the screen lists all of the current valid accounts. By default, these are 
* Administrator
* Manager
* Employee
* Guest

You can log in as any of these users by selecting the relevant icon. You will not be prompted for a password since all of the default accounts are created without a password. 

== Sales Workflow ==

Choose the sales window from the left hand menu options.

=== Using a Barcode Scanner ===

Simply scan the barcode. Each item scanned which has an entry in the stock table will add an entry to the sales ticket. 

If you have sold more than one item of a product, you can press the '+' sign to increase the amount of items. You can also use the '-' sign to decrease the quantity. If the quantity is one and you press '-' it will erase the item.

When all of the items have been scanned, press the equals '=' sign on the screen and the payment options dialog will appear. 

The dialog has options for cash, cheque, electronic payment. Choose the relevant option e.g. cash and type in the amount handed over by the customer. LibrePOS will calculate the change. Press the printer button to print the receipt and open the till. Press OK to complete the transaction and return to the sales screen.

=== Using a Keyboard or the On Screen Keypad ===

This functions much as the barcode scanner does. Simply type in the barcode number and LibrePOS will lookup the barcode item in the stock table. Then when return on the keyboard or the green tick on the screen is pressed, the item will be added to the sales ticket.

=== Using the Catalog ===

LibrePOS maintains a catalog of current stock items, if icons have been added in the stock management screen they are displayed on the bottom right of the sales screen using images loaded into the database at the time of the stock update. If the images are not added to the stock items, the items will not appear in the catalog window.

To use these icons to make a sales transaction, select the category the stock item is in. Type in the number of items to be sold on the on screen keypad, press the multiply button '*' and ''only then'' choose the item itself from the catalog window. If only one item is to be sold, don't bother with the number or the multiply button, simply press the item's screen icon. The required number of items will be added to the sales ticket. When all of the items are added, complete the transaction as per the barcode scanner.

=== Selling General items which don't have barcodes/stock entries ===
You can type the price and then press the '+' sign. It will add a line with the price to the ticket.

Previously add a &quot;General Item&quot; entry to the stock database with an icon and with £0.00 as the price. When selling such an item, choose the general item from the catalog to add the item to the sales ticket. Then select the &quot;General Item&quot; on the sales ticket and press the pencil button to change the price and number of units being sold.
== Closing cash ==
Closing cash allows you to see the sales of the day and prints a report for the day's sales.

#Under Main go to Close cash
#Click on close cash. A message box will appear and will ask you if you are sure. click yes.
#A report will print on the default printer for the payments and sales
===Manage cash closings===
You can see the cash closings on a certain time frame. To do that go to Main-&gt;Cash closed and select a start and end time.
A report with the data will appear
== Troubleshooting ==
===Notice: message.nosave===
After completing a sale you get a message box and this error: (with or without the psql/postgresql words)
&lt;pre&gt;net.adrianromero.data.loader.DataException: 
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException:
ERROR: duplicate key violates unique constraint &quot;tickets_pkey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Explanation'''

There are sales stored in the database with the same ticket ID that the ticket you are trying to save (pressing =). 

'''Solution'''

''PostgreSQL''

If the result of:
&lt;pre&gt;select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS&lt;/pre&gt;
is greater than: 
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT last_value from ticketsnum&lt;/pre&gt;
Do this:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT setval('ticketsnum', (select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS))&lt;/pre&gt;

''MySQL''

if the result of:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS&lt;/pre&gt;
is greater than: 
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT ID FROM TICKETSNUM&lt;/pre&gt;
Do this:
&lt;pre&gt;UPDATE TICKETSNUM set ID = (select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS)&lt;/pre&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
* Uncommon in U.S., incidence ~3,000/year
** Incidence increases with age, peak in 8th decade
** Overall incidence has been increasing, particularly intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
* Risk factors
** Sporadic in most patients
** [[w:Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis|primary sclerosing cholangitis]] risk ~160x
** [[w:Choledochal_cyst|choledochal cysts]] 10-20%
** [[w:Liver_fluke|liver fluke]] infestation in China and Southeast Asia
** Cholelithiasis minimal impact, unlike for gallbladder cancer


* '''Texas A&amp;M; 2002''' PMID 11991810 -- &quot;Worldwide trends in mortality from biliary tract malignancies.&quot; (Patel T, BMC Cancer. 2002 May 3;2:10.)
** Conclusion: Marked global increase in mortality from intrahepatic, but not extrahepatic, biliary tract malignancies


== Anatomy ==
* Cholangiocarcinoma - malignancy of the biliary duct epithelium. The term is somewhat ambiguous, as it may refer only to cancers of the intrahepatic bile duct (originally), or include entire bile duct (commonly today), or even include the gall bladder
* Intrahepatic bile ducts form part of the portal triad within liver, together with hepatic artery and portal vein
* Left and right hepatic ducts join together at the hilum to form the common hepatic duct
* Common hepatic duct and cystic duct from gallbladder join to form common bile duct, which travels in the porta hepatis along portal vein and hepatic artery. This can lead to early vessel involvement
* Common biled duct travels within head of pancreas, joins pancreatic duct, and empties together with it into duodenum in Ampulla of Vater
* Tumor location (from [http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/51/suppl_6/vi1.pdf UK 2002 Consensus Document]), based on classification of Nakeeb (PMID 8857851):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! width=&quot;100&quot; | Location !! width=&quot;80&quot; | Frequency
|-
| Intrahepatic || align=&quot;center&quot; | 20-25% 
|- 
| Perihilar || align=&quot;center&quot; | 50-60%
|-
| Distal bile duct || align=&quot;center&quot; | 20-25%
|-
| Multifocal || align=&quot;center&quot; | ~5% 
|}

* &lt;u&gt;Perihilar tumors&lt;/u&gt; can be further described according to Bismuth classification (Bismuth H, Castaing D. Hepatobiliary malignancy. London: Edward Arnold, 1994.)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &amp;nbsp; !! '''Bismuth Classification'''
|-
| Type I || occluding common hepatic duct, below bifurcation of left and right hepatic ducts 
|- 
| Type II || occluding common hepatic duct, reaching bifurcation but not involving either left or right hepatic duct
|-
| Type III || occluding common hepatic duct, and either left or right hepatic duct
|-
| Type IV ||  occluding both left and right hepatic side, OR multifocal
|}
* [[w:Klatskin tumor|Klatskin tumors]] are perihilar cholangiocarcinomas that involve the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts (Bismuth Type II), named after Dr. Klatskin who described them in 1965 (PMID 14256720)


== Pathology ==
* 90% adenocarcinoma (papillary, nodular, sclerosing)
** CA19-9 and CA-50 are positive in 80-90% of chalnciocarcinomas and rarely in hepatomas
** AFP is rarely positive in cholangiocarcinoma but in 35-75% of hepatomas
** Presence of MIB-1 and AgNOR, and lack of CD44 (esp. CD44v6) appears correlated with LN mets and tumor progression
* 10% all other histologies (squamous cell, mucoepidermoid, etc.)


They are locally invasive, and rarely metastatic PMID 4354116


Please see [[Radiation Oncology/Bile duct/Pathology|Bile Duct Pathology]] for literature review


== Diagnosis ==
* Clinical: S/S of biliary obstruction (jaundice, pale stool, dark urine, pruritus)
* Blood tests: none diagnostic, LFTs consistent with obstruction (elevated bilirubins, AP, GGT)
* Tumor markers: CA19-9 (85% patients, but also other GI tumors), CA125 (40-50% patients)
* Imaging:
** U/S first line investigation
** Contrast-enhanced spiral CT or MRI
** Cholangiography (MRCP, ERCP, PTC). PTC may be better than ERCP due to 1) better define the proximal extent of tumor and 2) place percutaneous transhepatic catheters for decompression
** Endoscopic U/S and PET are under evaluation
* Confirmatory histology
* Met from a primary located elsewhere work-up:
** Pancreas
** Stomach
** Breast
** Lung
** Colon

=== Carcinoid tumor of bile duct ===
* '''UT Southwestern''' PMID 11075851 -- ''Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts: a study of seven cases.'' ('''2000 Maitra''' A, Am J Surg Pathol. 2000 Nov;24(11):1501-10.)
** &quot;Because carcinoid tumors of the EHBD are of low malignant potential, they should be separated from the more common adenocarcinomas in this location.&quot;




== Imaging ==
* '''Princess Margaret''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2088.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''A Prospective Comparison Study of Liver Tumour Target Definition Based on Triphasic CT and Gadolinium MR'' ('''2005 Voroney''' JJ, ASTRO 2005 #2088)
** 23 patients (CCA 4, HCC 10, liver mets 9) on protocol; liver immobilized using ABC/voluntary breath hold. Best CT (arterial phase for HCA, venous phase for CCA and mets), best MRI T1 gado
** Average GTV difference 11cc (1-263); CT GTV larger in 3/7 mets, 4/4 CCA, 6/11 HCA
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;MR defined GTVs can be significantly different than CT defined GTVs and this should be considered for high precision liver cancer radiotherapy.&quot;

* '''Essen Germany''' PMID 14764888 -- ''Intraoperative radiation therapy in liver tissue in a pig model: monitoring with dual-modality PET/CT.'' ('''2004 Antoch''' G, Radiology. 2004 Mar;230(3):753-60. Epub 2004 Feb 5.)
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The morphologic and functional changes due to IORT in liver tissue can be accurately monitored with dual-modality PET/CT. By enabling the integration of functional and morphologic data, PET/CT may have an important role in monitoring radiation treatment.&quot;

* '''Jichi Japan''' PMID 10744810 -- ''Intraductal US in assessing the effects of radiation therapy and prediction of patency of metallic stents in extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2000 Tamada''' K, Gastrointest Endosc. 2000 Apr;51(4 Pt 1):405-11.)
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Assessment of local radiation effects by intraductal US is useful for predicting patency of metallic stents in bile duct cancer.&quot;

== Treatment Overview ==
Adapted partially from the [http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/51/suppl_6/vi1.pdf 2002 UK Consensus] document

* &lt;u&gt;Surgery&lt;/u&gt;
** The only curative treatment, but only &lt;50% are resectable, and &lt;30% have negative margins. Residual tumor amount is a significant predictor of post-op prognosis
** LN are positive in ~50% of patients at presentation, and signify worse prognosis. It appears patients with 5+ LNs have significantly worse survival than patients with 1-4 LNs
** 5-year OS for proximal lesions is 9-18%, for distal lesions 20-30%
** For unresectable patients, palliative stenting procedures for relief of obstructive symptoms improve OS


* &lt;u&gt;Chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;
** No evidence to support adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials
** 5-FU: ~10-20% response rate
** Newer agents (e.g. Gemcitabine): 20-30% response rate
** Combination therapy: 20-40% response rate
** Gemcitabine + cisplatin: 30-50% response rate
** Hepatic artery / portal vein infusion: good concentration, but no distal coverage


* &lt;u&gt;External Beam RT&lt;/u&gt; 
** No evidence to support adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials
*** No prospective adjuvant randomized trials
*** One prospective nonrandomized trial negative in perihilar tumors
*** Retrospective studies are suggestive of some value, particularly with higher doses and in patients with positive surgical margins
** Based on retrospective reports, RT has value in palliation
** The role of EBRT vs. ILRT vs. EBRT+ILRT has not been determined


A study from Wisconsin suggests significantly improved outcomes since 1998 in resected patients (~30%), owing to improvements in patient selection and chemoradiation.

Curative surgery (negative margins) is the only treatment modality shown to improve overall survival, and should be the first line therapy in operable patients. Unfortunately, only ~50% present with resectable disease, and only ~50% of these have negative margins. As a result, 5-year overall survival is around 30%, and as high as 50% in select series.


'''Resectability:'''
*Intrahepatic: 30-50% 
*Perihilar: 25-79%
*Distal bile duct: 56% 


'''5-year survival''': 
*Overall: 8-44%
*Margin negative: 19-47%
*Margin positive: 0-12%
*Intrahepatic tumors: one series 60%
*Perihilar tumors: as high as &gt;50% but higher periop mortality (8-10%)
*Distal tumors: 21-54% (but some series include periampullar tumors with better prognosis)


Liver transplantation no longer a treatment option outside research protocols due to high relapse rates. However, a protocol at Mayo (Rea 2005 below) appears promising for carefully selected patients.


Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Surgery|Bile Duct/Surgery]] section for review of surgical literature.


==Preoperative RT==
*'''Mayo 1993-2003''' PMID 15192792 -- ''Liver transplantation for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2004 Heimbach''' JK, Semin Liver Dis. 2004 May;24(2):201-7.)
**Prospective. 56 patients, Stage I/II perihilar CCA, treated with neoadjuvant EBRT + BT + 5-FU/capecitabine, followed by liver transplant
**4 died and 4 progression of disease prior to completion. 48 staged, 28 underwent transplant
**5-year actuarial survival: 54% for all patients, 64% for staged patients, 82% for transplant
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with liver transplantation achieves excellent results for patients with localized, regional lymph node negative, hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Nebraska''' PMID 12243499 -- ''Radiochemotherapy and transplantation allow long-term survival for nonresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2002 Sudan''' D, Am J Transplant. 2002 Sep;2(8):774-9.)
**Prospective. 11 patients treated with 60 Gy BT + 5-FU, followed by transplantation
**5/11 (45%) alive without recurrence with median follow-up 7.5 years (2.8-14.5)
**6/11 (55%) died; 2 recurrence, 3 sepsis, 1 transplant rejection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma should not be considered an absolute exclusion criteria for orthotopic liver transplantation. Long-term, tumor-free survival was achieved in 45% of the transplanted patients. Complications of biliary catheter placement for brachytherapy were associated with poor outcome.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 11016470 -- ''Prevention of implantation metastases after resection of proximal bile duct tumours with pre-operative low dose radiation therapy.'' ('''2000 Gerhards''' MF, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2000 Aug;26(5):480-5.)
**Retrospective. 21 patients with proximal tumors given 3.5 Gy/fx x 3 fractions preop + biliary drainage, followed by resective surgery
**No patients developed implantation mets (vs. 20% in previous study)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The results of this study suggest that pre-operative radiotherapy in patients with a resectable proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone pre-operative drainage, decreases the risk of implantation metastases. To be certain about the role of pre-operative radiotherapy, a randomized study is required. Until then, we advocate standard low dose radiotherapy preceding resection in all patients with lesions suggestive of a proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone biliary drainage.&quot;

**Retrospective. 12 patients pre-op RT (40.6- 58.4 Gy), 11 surgery, 9 resection, 8 additional IORT
**Complications: 4 patients, 3 post-op deaths
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The high complication rate requires modification of this strategy.&quot;

*'''Louisville 1983-96''' PMID 9409582 -- ''Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1997 McMasters''' KM, Am J Surg. 1997 Dec;174(6):605-8; discussion 608-9.)
**Retrospective. 91 patients, 40 resected (44%). Of these, 9 pre-op chemoradiation
**Median survival: resected 22 months vs. palliative 10.7 months (p&lt;0.0001)
**Margin-negative resection: pre-op chemoradiation 100% vs. surgery alone 54% (p&lt;0.01)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These results suggest that preoperative chemoradiation for extrahepatic bile duct cancer can be performed safely, produces significant antitumor response, and may improve the ability to achieve tumor-free resection margins.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 9380186 -- ''[Pre- and postoperative irradiation in the treatment of resectable Klatskin tumours] - [Article in Dutch]''' ('''1997 van Gulik''' TM, Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1997 Jul 5;141(27):1331-7.)
**Retrospective. 71 patients, treated with 10.5 Gy pre-op RT, surgery, 48 post-op RT (55 Gy either EBRT or EBRT/BT) or 23 no post-op RT
**RT statistically better survival (no numbers in abstract)
**More complication from EBRT/BT therapy, but same survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Pre- and postoperative irradiation may contribute to the success of the treatment of the resectable Klatskin tumour.&quot;

**15 patients with IORT (5-20 Gy), resected 2 patients, unresected 10 patients, recurrent 3 patients
**Median survival: 14 months, operative mortality 13%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This aggressive approach in the therapy for advanced disease has an acceptable level of morbidity and may warrant the use of IORT as part of the management of biliary tract cancer.&quot;

==Adjuvant RT==
There are no prospective randomized trials evaluating efficacy of adjuvant RT. Single institution retrospective studies seem to suggest some benefit to RT, particularly with higher doses (&gt;45 Gy) and with microscopically positive margins (R1). The role of brachytherapy is similarly unclear.

===Intrahepatic===
*'''Chang Gung Taiwan 1977-2001''' PMID 15793863 -- Prognostic analysis of surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: two decades of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. (2005 Jan YY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Mar 28;11(12):1779-84.)
**Retrospective. 373 patients with peripheral CCA (second order or more intrahepatic branches), 50% hepatectomy (36% curative resection). Please see more detail in surgical section
**RT 63 patients vs. no RT 249 (not further discussed in text)
**Median survival, 3-year OS, 5-year OS: RT 11.7 mo (16.6%, 6.6%) vs. no RT 6.2 mo (9.6%, 7.2%) (p=0.02)
**Conclusion: &quot;Favorable overall survival of PCC patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage, presence of mucobilia, papillary tumor type, hepatic resection, and post-operative chemotherapy&quot;

==Combined modality therapy==
*'''Duke; 2009''' (1992-2006) PMID 18805651 -- &quot;Concurrent chemoradiotherapy in resected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&quot; (Nelson JW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jan 1;73(1):148-53. Epub 2008 Sep 19.)
**Retrospective. 45 patients, extrahepatic cholangio, curative resection. RT (median 50.4 Gy) + concurrent 5-FU based chemo. Neoadjuvant 12 patients felt to be borderline unresectable, adjuvant 33 patients. Brachy boost (mean 29 Gy) in 4 patients. R0 resection 80%, R1 13%, R2 7%. N0 75%. Median F/U 2.5 years
**Outcome: 5-year LC 78%, DFS 37%, OS 33%. Median OS 2.8 years. Distal failure main problem. Neoadjuvant treatment potentially better (5-year OS 53% vs. 23%, p=0.16). No significant predictors of survival, though brachytherapy inferior outcome
**Toxicity: Fatigue 80%, nausea 65%, anorexia 50%, abdominal pain 30%. No deaths
**Conclusion: Possible local control benefit from combined chemo-RT and surgery. Preop CRT might be better

*'''Wisconsin; 2002''' (1990-2001) PMID 12407338 -- &quot;Improved survival in resected biliary malignancies.&quot; (Nakeeb A, Surgery 2002; 132:555-63; discission 563-4.)
**Retrospective. 140 billiary (111 cholangiocarcinoma, 29 gallbladder); 61% underwent exploration, 31% ultimately resected. Chemoradiation used more frequently since 1998
**Resected 1998-2001 (n=25): 3-year survival 70%, median survival 44+ months
**Resected 1990-1997 (n=19): 3-year survival 21%, median survival 13 months (p&lt;0.01)
**Conclusion: Improved outcomes with time, possibly due to careful surgical selection and adjuvant chemo-RT

*'''Seoul; 2002''' PMID 12243816 -- &quot;Role of postoperative radiotherapy in the management of extrahepatic bile duct cancer.&quot; (Kim S, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2002; 54:414-9.)
**Retrospective. 84 surgical patients, 86% gross resection (65% negative margin), 14% subtotal/palliative resection. Median F/U 2 years
**All patients received &gt;40 Gy of external beam RT after surgery. In patients who underwent radical resection, the target volume was designed to include regional lymph nodes (porta hepatis, pancreaticoduodenal, and celiac axis lymph nodes). In patients who had gross residual disease, the target volume included both the tumor and the regional lymph node area with a margin of 2.5–3.0 cm beyond ductal involvement as demonstrated on cholangiogram and/or CT. Concurrent 5-FU administered during external beam RT in 71 patients, and maintenance chemotherapy was performed in 61 patients after RT completion.
**OS: 2-year 52%, and 5-year 31%. N-stage only significant multivariate predictor (p=0.02)
**Conclusion: Long-term survival feasible in patients with radical surgery and postop chemo-RT

*'''South Florida; 2001''' (1988-99) PMID 11565760 -- &quot;Location, not staging, of cholangiocarcinoma determines the role for adjuvant chemoradiation therapy.&quot; (Serafini FM,  Am Surg. 2001 Sep;67(9):839-43; discussion 843-4.)
**Retrospective. 192 pts treated, 92 (48%) surgically. Of these, 38 patients had adjuvant CT/XRT vs. 50 no further treatment
**Mean survival: adjuvant CT/XRT 42 months vs. no treatment 29 months (p=0.07)
**Distal tumors mean survival: adjuvant CT/XRT 41 months vs. 25 months (p=0.04)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Adjuvant chemoradiation improves survival after resection for cholangiocarcinoma (P = 0.07) particularly in patients undergoing resection for distal tumors (P = 0.04).&quot;

*'''Pittsburgh 1990-95''' PMID 10219804 -- ''Radiotherapy and multimodality management of cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1999 Urego''' M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1999; 44:121-6.)
**Retrospective. 61 patients, 38% resection +/- transplant, 62% palliative surgery/biopsy
**All patients had RT (median dose 49.5 Gy), 50% received chemo (5-FU/Leucovorin/IFNalpha or taxol)
**Median survival (5-year OS): 20 months (24%)
**Only predictor of survival was complete resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined modality therapy that includes complete surgical resection with or without transplantation can be curative in the majority of patients with biliary duct carcinoma. Further study is needed to better define the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

This module in KDE is where the user configures the  desktop environment. It provides the user with a centralized and convenient way to configure all KDE settings.

It contains General and Advanced tab, each tab contains objects that you can click it to configure specific behaviour.
[[File:Kde system settings10.png|KDE System Settings panel from KDE 4.8.2]]

As you can see from the screenshot above, it's designed to be intuitive and simple to configure. For users familiar with Windows XP, This can seem similar to &quot;Control Panel&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a course for the language [[w:Ido|Ido]]. Ido is a simple language to learn, and the explanations in this course are simple too. If you can translate this course into your language, please do so.

==What is Ido?==
*Ido is perhaps the easiest language in the world to learn. It has a 100% regular grammar with no exceptions.
*Ido was created to be a language that everybody could learn quickly to talk to people from other countries.
*Ido was created on the basis of Esperanto but changed to make it easier to learn and write.
*Ido is used by at least 1000 people in the world today.
*Ido uses no special letters like in the [[Esperanto]] language (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ and ŭ) so you don't need extra software to write it.
*Ido has its own [[:wikipedia:io:Frontispico|Wikipedia]] and [[:wiktionary:io:Main Page|Wiktionary]].
*As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, Ido is {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1907}} years old.
*Ido has its own magazines and literature.
*Ido looks a lot like French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian (and Esperanto too).
*Ido will help you understand Latin and other romance languages.

==Okay, let's learn Ido!==

[[Easy Ido/Lesson two|Lesson two]]

==Alphabet==
The alphabet is the same as English: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.

==Pronunciation==
===Vowels===
There are five vowels. Remember to say vowels short. Don't say things like ow, aw, and so on. Just say o, a.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | letter !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | pronunciation !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | gloss
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| a || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɑ/}} || b'''a'''h
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| e || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} || m'''e'''t
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| i || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/i/}} || m'''ea'''n
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| o || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/oʊ/}} || m'''o'''w
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| u || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/u/}} || m'''oo'''
|}

When two vowels go together we can have these two possibilities. They can be pronounced together, as a diphthong:(there are only two):
*au - ow - '''ow'''
*eu - e + oo -'''e-oo''' spoken very quickly.

Or they can be pronounced separately, each vowel sound fully enunciated (like &quot;'''oa'''sis&quot;):

===Consonants===
Most are the same as English. But:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | letter !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | pronunciation !! style=&quot;padding: 0 2.4em&quot; | gloss
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| c || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/t͡s/}} || ra'''ts'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(soft '''c''')''&lt;/small&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| r || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɾ/}} || '''r'''atón&lt;br /&gt;''[[w:Intervocalic_alveolar_flapping|tapped r]]''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| g || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/g/}} || '''g'''et&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(hard '''g''')''&lt;/small&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| j || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ʒ/}} || mea'''s'''ure
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| s || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/s/}} || '''s'''ay&lt;br /&gt;''&lt;small&gt;never like &lt;/small&gt;no'''s'''e&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;nor &lt;/small&gt;ear'''s'''''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| x || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ks/}} || si'''x'''&lt;br /&gt;''&lt;small&gt;never&lt;br /&gt;like &lt;/small&gt;'''x'''ylophone''
|}

==Accent==
All words have an accent on the second-last sound, except ''infinitives'', which are verbs that end in -ar. They have an accent on the last sound.

'''me'''a, '''li'''bro, a'''mi'''ko, '''ju'''po, si'''nis'''tre.

But:

i'''rar''', fa'''car''', dor'''mar''', man'''jar'''.

Words having two consecutive vowels in the last syllable (the first being ''i'' or ''u'') take the accent on the previous syllable, if there is one:

'''a'''quo, '''ma'''nui, Wiki'''pe'''dio.

However, if there is no other syllable, then it is the second to last vowel that takes the accent:

'''di'''o, '''su'''a, '''tu'''i.

Except that an ''u'' right after a ''q'' can never take the accent. The stress vowel is then the last one in:

'''quar''', '''quo''', '''quin'''.

=='The' and 'a'==
These are called 'articles'. Ido has the word '''la''' for &quot;the&quot;. But Ido does not have a word for &quot;a&quot;. That means that &quot;amiko&quot; can mean &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;a friend&quot;. '''La amiko''' means &quot;the friend&quot;.

==Nouns==
*All singular nouns end with -o. '''Domo''' (house), '''skolo''' (school), '''urbo''' (city).
*All plural nouns end with -i. '''Domi''' (houses), '''skoli''' (schools), '''urbi''' (cities).
*You don't need an -o on people's names and names of places. These are 'proper nouns'. But don't forget that some spellings may be different; for instance if the words ''America'' and ''Canada'' existed in Ido, they would sound like ''Ameri'''ts'''a'' and '''''Ts'''anada'', so we write them as ''Ameri'''k'''a'' and '''''K'''anada'' instead. For less common names it is favourable not to alter the spelling, otherwise the original spelling could be difficult to retrieve.

==Adjectives==
*All adjectives end with -a. '''vera''' (true), '''simpla''' (simple), '''bona''' (good).
*You can make comparisons and say 'the most' and 'the least' with the words '''plu''', '''min''', '''maxim''', and '''minim'''. '''Plu vera''' (truer), '''plu simpla''' (simpler), '''min bona''' (less good), '''min simpla''' (less simple), '''maxim bona''' (best), '''minim simpla''' (least simple).
*To say something has a certain quality more or less than something else use '''kam''', as in '''plu simpla kam''' (simpler than).
*To say something has a certain quality the most or least out of a group, use '''de''', as in '''maxim bona de''' (best of).
*You can compare things as being similar and say '''tam ... kam''' meaning 'as ... as'.  For example '''tam simpla kam''' (as simple as).
*You can put adjectives before the noun like in English ('''bona skolo'''), or after the noun like in French ('''skolo bona''').

==Adverbs==
Adverbs usually come from adjectives. Just replace the -a with -e. '''Vere''' (truly), '''simple''' (simply), '''bone''' (well).

As in English, there are adverbs that don't come from adjectives, mostly relating to time and place. These include '''ibe''' (there), '''ante''' (before), '''seque''' (afterwards), '''lore''' (then, at that time), '''sempre''' (always), '''anke''' (also).

[[Easy Ido/Lesson one|Lesson one]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson three|Lesson three]]

==Verbs==
*Infinitives (to go, to walk) end in -ar: '''vidar''' (to see), '''facar''' (to do), '''flugar''' (to fly).
*The present tense ending is -as: '''vidas''' (I, you, he, she, sees), '''facas''' (do, does), '''flugas''' (fly, flies).
*The past tense ending is -is: '''vidis''' (saw), '''facis''' (did), '''flugis''' (flew).
*The future tense ending is -os: '''vidos''' (will see), '''facos''' (will do), '''flugos''' (will fly).
*The conditional mood ending is -us: (would, as in &quot;I would like to go&quot;): '''vidus''' (would see), '''facus''' (would do), '''flugus''' (would fly).
*The imperative (or command form) ending is -ez: '''videz!''' (look!), '''facez!''' (do!), '''flugez!''' (fly!). You can also use this form to say &quot;let's&quot;. '''Ni flugez''' - let's fly.
*There are also past and future infinitives, ending in -ir and -or: '''vidir''' (to have seen), '''vidor''' (to be going to see). Note the correspondence between the infinitives and the simple tenses.

===The verb &quot;to be&quot;===
*The verb &quot;to be&quot; is '''esar'''. '''Me esas''' (I am), '''Me esis''' (I was), '''Me esos''' (I will be).
*You can just say '''es''' instead of '''esas''' if you feel like it. You use this verb all the time and that's why it has a short form.
===Negative===
To make a negative, just put '''ne''' before the verb. '''Me ne esas''' (I am not), '''ne flugas''' (doesn't fly), '''ne vidos''' (will not see).

==Describing things with verbs==
===Active===
*Replacing -ar with -anta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is doing'' an action. '''Fluganta uceli''' - flying birds. '''Kantanta viro''' - a singing man.
*Replacing -ar with -inta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''has done'' an action. '''Fluginta uceli''' - birds that have flown. '''Kantinta viro''' - a man that has sung.
*Replacing -ar with -onta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is going to do'' an action. '''Flugonta uceli''' - birds that are going to fly. '''Kantonta viro''' - a man that is going to sing.
===Passive===
*Replacing -ar with -ata turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is having'' something done to it. '''Drinkata aquo''' - water being drunk. '''Manjata pano''' - bread being eaten.
*Replacing -ar with -ita turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''had'' something done to it. '''Drinkita aquo''' - water that was drunk. '''Manjita pano''' - bread that was eaten.
*Replacing -ar with -ota turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is going to have'' something done to it. '''Drinkota aquo''' - water that is going to be drunk. '''Manjota pano''' - bread that is going to be eaten.

==Had and have==
*When saying things like &quot;I have eaten,&quot; &quot;I had gone,&quot; and &quot;I will have sung,&quot; you use the endings -abas, -abis, and -abos. '''Me manjabas la pano''' (I have eaten the bread), '''me manjabis la pano''' (I had eaten the bread), '''me manjabos la pano''' (I will have eaten the bread).

I see that a course on Ido has already been started but this one has a different purpose - somewhat like the Simple English Wikipedia, with explanations written as simple as possible and probably no more than ten lessons. The goal of this course is to be translated into all other languages available on Wikibooks. The other course on Ido can be developed like any other with words like jussive, present perfect, superlative and whatnot. This course avoids specialized terms as much as possible.

:Where did you get this course? [[User:Phil.andy.graves|Phil.andy.graves]] 13:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

== How do I translate this to another language? == 

I really want to translate this page to Norwegian, but how do I do it? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Hirotosama|Hirotosama]] ([[User talk:Hirotosama|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hirotosama|contribs]]) 16:58, 26 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:You could copy the pages of this book over to the Norwegian Wikibooks [http://no.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hovedside site], satisfying the licensing requirements by giving a permanent link to the English version in the comment when you create the page. e.g. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Easy_Ido&amp;oldid=2159559 http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Easy_Ido&amp;oldid=2159559]. (This is available under the &quot;Toolbox&quot; menu on the left.) 

:Between the English Wiki projects we have an [[Help:Importing|Importing]] procedure which preserves the page histories, but I don't think this is available between different languages. You could ask for help from the people at the Norwegian Wikibooks [http://no.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hovedside site] who should be able to give you some more advice.

[[Easy Ido/Lesson three|Lesson three]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson five|Lesson five]]

''Note: This section has a lot of information, so go slowly!''

==Changing verbs to nouns, nouns to verbs, and others==
*You can turn any adjective into an adverb by replacing -a with -e. '''mala''' (bad), '''male''' (badly).
*You can turn verbs into nouns by replacing the -ar with an -o. Remember that because verbs are action words, the noun will only be about the action itself, not the thing you use to do it. '''vidar''' (to see) - '''vido''' (seeing or sight); '''promenar''' (to walk) - '''promeno''' (a walk).
*You can change the -a on an adjective to -o, which gives you a noun of the thing that the adjective symbolizes. '''giganta''' (gigantic) - '''giganto''' (a giant). '''yuna''' (young) - '''yuno''' (a young person, a youth).
*Don't forget that the verbs we turned into adjectives before can turn into nouns in the same way too. '''drinkar''' (to drink) - '''drinkanta''' (drinking) - '''drinkanto''' (someone or something drinking, a drinker). '''flugar''' (to fly) - '''fluganta''' (flying) - '''fluganto''' (flier, the thing doing the flying).
*If you change the -o to an -a, you get a direct adjective. This means that '''metalo''' (metal) turns to '''metala''' (of metal), as in '''metala telefono''' (a metal telephone). Don't forget that this doesn't mean &quot;metallic&quot;! If it did, you could turn it back into '''metalo''' with the meaning &quot;metal-like&quot;, and the word '''metalo''' would have two meanings. In the same way, '''papero''' (paper) turns into '''papera''' as in '''papera ucelo''' (a paper bird), and doesn't mean a &quot;paper-like bird&quot;. This point is very important.
*The usual way to make an adjective from a noun is to replace the -o with -ala. Now the word '''papero''' turns into '''paperala''' (of paper), and we get the word '''paperala industrio''' (paper industry). '''Papera industrio''' would be an industry made of paper, so don't say that. Words like '''lego''' (law) turn into '''legala''' (legal) and '''manuo''' turns into '''manuala''' (manual, by hand).

==Turning adjectives into verbs==
*There are some ways of turning adjectives into verbs. If you replace -a with -igar, you have a verb that means to turn something into the adjective. For example, '''kolda''' (cold) becomes '''koldigar''' (to make cold).
*To make a verb that shows something turning into the adjective, replace -a with -eskar. '''kolda''' becomes '''koldeskar''' (to become cold).
*Don't forget that now that they are verbs, don't worry and just use them in the same way as the others. '''Me koldigis tu''' (I made you cold), '''Elu koldeskos''' (she will get cold).
==Turning nouns into verbs==
*To derive a verb from a noun the appropriate suffix must be used, according to the intended meaning of the verb.
*Nouns can turn into verbs by replacing -o with -agar. The suffix -agar comes from the word ''agar'' which means &quot;to act&quot;, so -agar means &quot;to act with a tool&quot;. This means that '''martelo''' (a hammer) becomes '''martelagar''' (to act with a hammer, that is, to hammer).
*You can do the same thing to make a verb with the meaning &quot;to add&quot; by replacing -o with -izar. That means that '''salo''' (salt) becomes '''salizar''' (to salt, or to add salt).
*Once you have a verb, you can turn it into a noun again, but remember that the meaning is about the action now, not the object. So '''martelagar''' (to hammer) becomes '''martelago''' (the act of using a hammer, or  hammering), and '''salizar''' becomes '''salizo''' (the act of salting, or adding salt).
*If you use the wrong ending you'll have a different meaning. If you put -izar on '''martelo''' for example, you will have the verb '''martelizar''' which means &quot;to add hammer&quot;, which doesn't make much sense.

Okay, that's enough for this lesson. Make sure to read this one a few times to remember. Try finding some words of your own, change the endings and see if you can find them in real Ido sentences on Google.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holding the Saxophone==
The saxophone should be held as follows. Place your left thumb on the thumb rest under the octave key (the key that's facing towards you and controls the pad on the neck of the saxophone). You should be able to easily slide your thumb upwards and press the octave key. Place your first three fingers on the B, A, and G keys (respectively). In the right hand, place your thumb under the thumb rest so that some of the weight of the instrument rests on your thumb. Then place your first three fingers on the F, E and D keys (respectively).


== Playing a B ==
[[File:Saxophone Fingering Chart.jpg|thumb|right|A saxophone fingering chart (click to expand).]]
The common first note on any woodwind is a B, which is fingered
by pressing down the first finger of the left hand (note that
the first key is not where the first finger goes). Practice long tones
on this note.

== Playing an A ==
The next logical move from B is A, which is fingered by pressing down
the first and second finger (note that the &quot;little button&quot; is skipped
and the second finger goes on the larger button below it). Practice long
tones on this note, then practice moving between B and A and vice versa.

== Playing a G ==
A G is fingered by pressing down the first, second, and third fingers.
Practice long tones, moving between B, A, and G in all combinations,
then become proficient at the following:
[[Image:Saxophone_HotCrossBuns.gif|900px]]

== Playing a C ==
to play c, first place your thumb on the back button,then go two keys down and press.

== Playing a D ==
This is a tricky note on saxophone. To play a D, hold down the octave key (which is just
above your thumb on your left hand) and push down the first three fingers of your left hand
and the first three of your right hand. The note will probably not come out on the first try.
Keep trying until it works. It takes a more focused air stream. Once you can consistently get
the D out, practice long tones and moving from C to D. This is a fairly difficult jump.
Once you have mastered this, play the following until you are proficient:
[[Image:SaxophoneMaryHadALittleLamb.gif|900px]]

== Playing an E ==
Once you have mastered the D, the E should be simple. Finger a D and lift
the third finger of the right hand. The same type of air stream is required.
Again, practice long tones and moving to E from the other notes.

== Playing an F ==
To play an F, hold the octave key and finger an E, removing the second finger on the right hand.
Again, the air stream should be focused. Practice long tones and moving between all of the notes.
Practice the following exercise:

This chapter is meant to deal with '''General Safety''', and will cover what equipment you may need, visibility maintenance and security, all of which can be adjusted before a rider begins their daily commute.

=== Maintenance ===
First and foremost a cyclist needs a well maintained and functional machine.  The bicycle is one of the few consumer durables still intended to be maintainable by the owner: most cycle maintenance is simple and requires only basic tools.  At the very least the rider should regularly check safety-critical components:
* Brakes: the front brake should be capable of locking the front wheel so that if the bike is pushed forwards, the rear wheel lifts; the rear brake should be capable of skidding the rear wheel.  
* Headset: with the front brake firmly on, rock the bike forwards and backwards.  If you feel a clunk as the bike moves, and the handlebars move around, then the headset probably needs adjusting or replacing.
[[Image:Bicycle winter tire.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A winter tyre for bicycles which provide better grip in icy conditions.]]
* Tires: inspect your tires regularly for cuts and wear.  Worn tires can blow out, with perilous consequences.  They also puncture more readily.  Check that your tires are pumped up enough.  Pinch the tire between thumb and forefinger: It should feel hard.  Mountain bike tires typically run at about 45psi, road bike tires at anything up to 120psi.  Do not use garage forecourt airlines (gas station air compressors) to inflate bike tires, use a proper pump preferably with a pressure gauge.  Over-inflated tires can lift off the rim and burst.  Under-inflated tires compromise control and can result in pinch flats, also known as snakebite punctures for their characteristic double holes.
* Wheels: In turn, lift each end of the bike and spin the wheel.  It should spin freely and the rim should remain roughly the same distance from the brake blocks.  A wheel which is badly out of true may indicate a broken spoke - this should be fixed as soon as possible or else more spokes (or the whole wheel) will probably soon fail.  Try to move the rim from side to side.  If it moves or you feel a clunk, then the bearings may be worn and should be checked.  If the wheel feels gritty as it spins, or rumbles, the bearings are probably damaged.
* Handlebars: stand in front of the bike, facing towards it; hold the front wheel between your legs; grab the handlebars and try to turn.  If the bars twist on the stem, tighten them.
* General: if you have mudguards (fenders), a rack, a chain guard or any other equipment attached to your bike, give it a good rattle from time to time and check that it is still securely fixed.  Loose mudguards, for example, can go in your wheel and bring you down.

=== Lights &amp; conspicuity ===

The general consensus is that if you ride after dark you should use lights.  This a legal requirement in most places.  It is also generally recommended that you dress to be seen, especially in poor weather.  Although this consensus is broad-based, it is largely intuitive and there are few studies to support or refute it.
=== Bike fit ===
It is common for parents to buy a bike that is too big, in the knowledge that a child will grow. This can make it very difficult for the child to control the bike properly - in most cases it would be better to buy a second-hand bike the right size than a new one with &quot;room for growth,&quot; which is, in reality, too big.

In adults the biggest fault is usually having the saddle too low, but this is mainly an issue of erroneously perceived comfort and health. It upsets the ability of the rider to control the bike and damages the riders knees and back. The best advice when buying/fitting a bike is to go to a specialist bike shop (Caveat emptor) and take advice.

=== Helmets ===

The subject of cycle helmets is controversial.  Some evidence suggests that helmeted riders are less likely to suffer head injury; other evidence suggests the opposite.  Even when cycle helmet use has risen steeply due to laws that require it, it has not been demonstrated that there is a correlation between helmet use and reduction in head injuries.  Recent analysis supports the conclusion of Spaite et al. that much of the effect attributed to helmets in case-control studies may be due to behavioural differences in the types of cyclists who choose to wear or not wear them. In a low speed crash, a cyclist might benefit from wearing a helmet but the theory of risk compensation suggests that the fact of wearing one may subtly influence cyclists' riding by making them less careful.  In a more serious crash, especially if a motor vehicle is involved, it is unlikely that a helmet will make a significant difference.  One study found that 16 of 20 cyclist fatalities whose primary cause of death was listed as head injury also had other fatal injuries.  Of the remaining four, at least one rider had been helmeted at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sage MD | title=Fatal injuries to bicycle riders in Auckland | journal=NZ Med J | volume=98 | issue=793 | date=December 25, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
It is common to quote statistics from different countries to support a particular opinion that helmets do not reduce injuries. For example, figures from the Netherlands seem to indicate that helmet use increases the risk of accident. This is likely to be due to the fact that most ordinary cyclists do not wear helmets and that cycle traffic is very well segregated from other road traffic. Riders wear helmets when they are racing or taking part in other dangerous cycling activities and therefore people who wear helmets are those who are injured. 
Some people say that although it is difficult to prove whether cycle helmets are effective, wearing one may be worthwhile even though a helmet does not guarantee to reduce susceptibility to serious brain injury. It may even be worthwhile to wear a helmet just to keep the sun out of your eyes. If you do decide to wear a helmet, make sure that it is well-fitting and is correctly fastened and that it is worn in the correct position. Take care of your helmet, it must not be dropped or bumped and make sure that the surface is not scratched which could damage the internal structure.

===Local Information===
Find a local independent bike shop that you trust. Go in and have a chat with the people and see if it is your kind of place. The staff in a good bike shop will be able to offer invaluable advice and they are mostly happy to help.
Independent bike shops are recommended because their staff tend to be more passionate and knowledgeable about cycling than in most chain shops.

Many areas also have local cycling organisations, ranging from sport-oriented cycle clubs to campaigning organisations for 'transport' cyclists. 

===The Internet===
There are many web forums offering discussion of all aspects of cycling and related issues, as well as information sites run by individuals and organisations. Links to some of these are given at the bottom of the page.

===Government Information===
Government agencies issue information and advice about cycling. [http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/Cyclists/index.htm the UK Highway Code] contains a summary of road traffic laws and official 'best practice'. Whilst few cycling organisations advocate breaking the law, many see the advice elements as written by non-cyclists, and not necessarily in line with reality or cyclists' best interests.


==Maintenance==

It's vital that the bicycle you rely on is in good condition. Learn to do simple jobs like lubrication and brake and gear adjustment. Clean your bike regularly. Take your bike in for a service at your bike shop '''at least''' once a year. Essential safety critical parts that you should check often are:

'''Wheels:''' Are your tires in good condition and correctly inflated? Don't ride on bald or flat tires.
Are the wheel bolts tight enough to hold the wheel in place? If you have quick-release wheels check that the quick release is correctly tightened every time you ride your bike. Does the wheel run straight and true? if there are wobbles in the spinning wheel your bike shop can easily &quot;true&quot; them for you. 

'''Cables:''' Check all your brake and gear cables for signs of rust, wear or fraying. The brake cable is one of the most important parts on a bike so make sure you keep a close check on its condition. If your cables look worn out get your bike shop to fit new ones.

'''Brakes:''' Test the brakes before you get out on to the road. When looking at the brakes check that the brake pads are not worn out, and that they make contact with the wheel rim correctly when force is applied on the lever. Ask your bike shop to show you how to perform day to day adjustment on your brakes.  See also [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes| Adjusting Brakes]].

Many bike shops run cycle maintenance courses. Check with the staff in your local (hopefully independent) cycle shop.

==Security==

Bike theft is rampant in urban centres, so if you're going to leave your bike anywhere you must assume that it ''will'' attract thieves.   The usual method used by bike thieves is as follows:
*'''Bikes usually disappear overnight'''.  Bikes are stolen by opportunists during the day but organised bike gangs steal bikes at night, after mapping out their intended locations in the preceding daylight hours.
*'''Beware of strangers on bikes'''.  Prior to an organised theft, young strangers or near-strangers will be seen observing in the area of the bikes during the daytime, perhaps on bikes themselves.   Even if they are sent away it is wrong to assume that the point was won;   they are casing the place for a night theft and they or others ''will'' return, usually the same night.   If observers are noticed during the day, take the bikes into the house regardless of any inconvenience.
*'''No lock is totally safe'''.   Any lock can be broken, but buy a good lock to keep the odds in your favor.  Thieves use car jacks to break d-clamp locks, and bolt cutters for chains and cables.   Some say that skeleton keys are available for locks. 
*'''Bikes are then stripped of any peculiar fixings'''. In fact, all of the brakes and other accessories can be removed;  They are interchanged between other bikes to confuse recognition. 
*'''The thieves sell the bikes quickly'''. They get comparatively low prices for bikes but in view of the low penalties imposed on their activities, they steal large numbers of items.   Selling the bikes compounds the difficulty of recovery even if the items are found.   

Bear in mind then, the following points: 
*'''No cycle lock is thief proof'''. All you can do to protect your bike is buy time. You have to increase the risk for the thief to the point that they will not bother targeting you.   By the time that a bike is stolen, the chance of it being recovered by police is poor. 
*'''Invest in a secure cycle lock'''. There are many types to choose from. The staff in the bike shop will be able to offer you the best advice. A common guide is that you should invest at least 10% of the price of your cycle in a lock.   Ideally consider a lock that can fasten ''both'' wheels and the frame to a bike stand or other immovable object.   Two locks of different types may be better than one.   Insurers insist on good locks and they have approved lists.  
*'''Insure your bike'''. Read the policy carefully; some of these are difficult to claim on.   If your bike receipt does not have all of the items on it, including the bike number, date of purchase, cost, and other items, then make sure you get these or the insurance might not work.   Similarly,  the receipt for your bike lock is expected to be much-detailed, including its make, model, price, and serial number, so that you can justify the ''good lock'' clause.   No easy task; most counter receipts lack detail.   Although most insurance covers theft ''away from home'' when an approved lock was used, insurers will not usually pay for a bike stolen from the ''common area of flats'' whether or not a good lock was used, (on the railings).   There is often a stipulated front-door lock quality for insured items in the house itself, though frankly, taking the bike into the house at night gives the best protection of all.  Sadly, many only realize the limitations of insurance after an unsuccessful claim.       
*'''Quick release components need locked too'''.  Wheels and saddles need locked to deter petty thieves. It might be worth investing in a light cable lock to secure your components to your frame. Two locks are also better than one because it takes the thief longer to remove them.
*'''Choose the place that you lock your bike up carefully'''. Never lock your bike up somewhere that you hope it won't be noticed - remember, no lock is thief proof, but they buy time. If the thief thinks it will take too long to remove the lock, and they might be caught then they won't attempt a theft. By locking your bike up in a quiet spot you are removing the only advantage you have.   Ideally choose a designated cycle parking facility provided by the (most) municipal authorities. If not then lamp posts, fences, signs, etc. provide useful locking points. Make sure you lock your bike up in busy places. There are a few major points to make about picking the object you lock your bike to:
*'''Never lock your bike to cast iron railings!''' - Cast iron is brittle, so although a railing looks strong a sharp blow from a heavy hammer can shatter it in no time at all. If you're not sure find something else to lock your bike to.
*'''Check that the bike stand or other object is secure'''.  Bicycle locking stands should not move. They should be as solid as a rock. Some really do just lift up out of the ground. Some fences have railings that slide right out. What ever you're locking your bike to, give it a good shake before you lock your bike to it. If it looks like it might go somewhere, choose somewhere else to lock your bike.
*'''When you lock your bike to a sign make sure it's a tall one'''.   Thieves will just bend the sign up and lift your bike over the top of the post if they can. Make sure the post is too tall for them to do that.   Also, in some countries, (London, UK), the police might object to bikes cabled to lampposts, and as such if an offense is being committed, you might that it makes for a difficult insurance claim in the event of a theft.
*'''Try not to leave your bike outside overnight anywhere'''.   You will find that insurance policies may not cover this, even in the common area of your home.   Take any bike that you value into the house.   Folding bikes make this regime easier, even if they have 26 inch wheels. 
*'''Make your cycle less attractive to thieves'''. You can get your bicycle frame stamped with a unique number (sometimes your postcode or zip-code) and registered with the police. There are also electronic tags that identify your bike as stolen if the police find it.   There are internet property registers like ''Immobilise.com'' that are used by law enforcement and bike owners to check whether  or not for-sale and recovered items are already reported as stolen.   Theoretically, there should be no international boundaries to internet registers, though the lack of international police liaison (and their disinterest) might prevent it.   Priority in most police forces is given to ''crimes against the person'', so bike theft has quite a low priority.   
*'''Some cyclists wrap the frame of their cycles in tape.'''   Use either electrical insulating tape or &quot;gaffer&quot; tape to make the frame unique; this also covers the labels on an expensive frame and protects the paintwork. It is also removable, any gunk left over from the tape can be removed with degreaser.   Some (particularly messengers) cover their frames in vinyl stickers. This looks cool but might not be to everybody's taste. It has the same effect as taping.
*'''Fitting mudguards gives a bike a slightly less racy appearance'''.   It also helps make it less attractive to thieves.
*'''Take lots of photos of your bike'''.   This will help you identify it before reporting a find to police.   It is difficult to check a serial number on a parked bike, and perhaps dangerous too, so consider other ideas, like keeping a photo of the bike's ''paint chip patterns'' on your phone for a quick comparison.   Chip patterns are quite unique and thieves rarely take the trouble to cover them.

==Clothing==

Cycle shops sell a wide range of clothing specifically designed for cyclists.

In the summer you'll need to wear shorts and a t-shirt. The &quot;wicking&quot; t-shirts sold in bike shops and mountaineering shops etc. will draw the sweat away from you and help keep you dry. A light wind-cheater is handy for colder moments

In the winter you'll need breathable waterproofs - something that keeps the rain off but also lets the sweat out, normal waterproofs will just trap your sweat and make you feel damp.

Cycle shorts: Are really good for cyclists, but some don't like the look. The seams are specially placed to avoid chafing your &quot;sensitive&quot; regions, sometimes they have padding to soften the ride. They can be made of special wicking material to draw away sweat and keep you dry. They can be worth wearing under more conventional clothes for a more conventional look.

==Visibility==

It is important to be as visible as possible when cycling. It is very easy for other road users to fail to see a cyclist in the dark until it is too late. 

The reflectors supplied with your bike are a legal minimum requirement (in the UK) but they will not be enough to ensure you are fully visible. Reflectors fail for myriad reasons- see [http://sheldonbrown.com/reflectors.html Sheldon Brown's guide] for a list . Pedal reflectors tend to work the best, because they are in motion most of the time, resulting in a &quot;flashing&quot; effect. Spoke reflectors help to make you visible from side on, and like pedal reflectors are in constant motion. Despite this, '''A cyclist has to take responsibility for their own visibility'''. If the car that hits you has no headlights then your reflectors won't do anything. 
It is important that you fit front and rear lights. Many cyclists also attach extra lights to their clothing/helmet.

Despite the problems with bike reflectors, don't be tempted to remove them, They're an important back up. Many cyclists attach extra reflectors to their bike. Reflective tape is particularly useful as is can be wrapped around the frame, turning the surface of the bike into a reflector with out adding any unsightly bits of plastic and metal. 
Reflective clothing is also recommended. A wide range of reflective jackets, belts, trouser clips, vests etc. is available in cycle shops. A cheap alternative can be the reflective tabards worn by road repair crews. These are available in builders merchants and should be certified to be industry safety standards.

==Bells and horns==

A bell or horn (or among London cycle messengers an elaborate whistle) is an essential piece of safety equipment. Use it to warn pedestrians of your approach on shared pathways, or if they have not noticed you when they are crossing the road. Ring your bell for a few seconds before going round any blind corners. If you cycle on canal towpaths ring the bell before and while going under any bridges, as the entrance to many bridges (in London for example) is obscured by a kink in the path. Remember that bicycles don't make any engine noise so you have to help others become aware of your presence.

==Other road users==

It is inevitable when cycling in an urban centre that you will come in conflict with other road users, including both moving and parked motor vehicles, pedestrians, maintenance activities, deliveries and trash pickups.  Many regular cyclists (and many drivers) have a long list of examples of imbecility on the part of drivers that led to a near miss/close shave, or seemingly unwarranted aggression from frustrated motorists.  Growing numbers of motorists and pedestrians have equally-long lists of absurdly bad behavior by cyclists.  Cycle-commuting is healthier for you and better for the environment.  These personally- and socially-desirable benefits entitle you to &lt;u&gt;no more&lt;/u&gt; special consideration than anybody else on the street.   The important things you must remember are:

* You have as much right to be on the road as motorists (except emergency vehicles in the course of their duty). If they can't pass you safely they ought to wait.  You may not want to hold your breath for this, however.  
 
* Other users ''- especially pedestrians - '' have &lt;u&gt;just as much right&lt;/u&gt; to use the roads and streets.  If you endanger their safety by not observing road-rules, you are &lt;u&gt;just as culpable&lt;/u&gt; as any motorist who will not give you space.   Your additional attention is warranted for children, people with disabilities, animals, many seniors, and visitors who are unfamiliar with local right-of-way arrangements.  
 
* Safety is '''everybody's''' lookout.  ''It is your responsibility to be seen'' - this can mean slowing down when approaching cross-traffic; wearing highly-visible gear in poor light (fog, rain, dusk, glare) and lights visible for 100 meters when it is dark; giving indications of your intention to move in the lane or make a turn.  It is also wise to ''be aware of distractions'' that may afflict other riders, drivers, and pedestrians - these include phones and music players as well as sudden noises, flashing lights, or furious activity in the environment.  Making eye contact with drivers at junctions, etc., really helps ensure he/she has seen you, and lets you ''anticipate when someone may pull in front of you''.
 
* Streets are for riding.  Sidewalks are for walking.  Don't ride on the sidewalk, and don't ride the wrong way down a one-way street.  If a street has a bicycle lane, use it.  Follow safety rules for bikes on stairs, escalators, and public transit.  Stop at stop-lights and stop signs.  Exercise care to avoid slower-moving and halted vehicles and pedestrians.
 
* Crowded urban areas are never a place for racing or time-trials.  Many urban cyclists are goal-oriented, intense, and assertive individuals who easily transfer this attitude onto the street.  Being focussed prevents general-awareness of your surroundings, however, it is a major safety hazard.
 
* '''Do not retaliate or provoke a confrontation.''' A cyclist is much more vulnerable than a motor vehicle.  Even an exasperated gesture may provoke road rage, making a bad situation worse. Be satisfied that cycling in cities is quicker, better for your health, environmentally friendly and a social activity. If you really want to make your voice heard you can see if your city has a cyclist's association, or perhaps join a bike ride organised by the protest group Critical Mass (but avoid illegal behaviors).

[[Easy Ido/Lesson four|Lesson four]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson six|Lesson six]]

==Compound words==
* You can create compound words by combining two (or more) words. Like so: '''maro-salo''' for sea salt. The preceding word changes the meaning of the following. Just like in English, the first word describes the second one, so '''salo-maro''' would be a salt sea instead of sea salt. The hyphen between the words is not necessary: '''marosalo''' would also be correct, but it can be easier to read with the hyphens. The way you would do it in English, '''maro salo''' is, however, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; correct. If you have two nouns and it is easier to pronounce, you can take the -o off the first one, so '''mar-salo''' would be correct as well. You don't want to make a word that's impossible to say though, so you would say '''letro-buxo''' instead of '''letr-buxo''' for postbox.

==Smaller particles==
*Use '''di''' to show who owns or belongs to something. '''libro di John''' is &quot;John's book&quot;.
*Use '''de''' to show where something is from. '''libro de John''' means &quot;John's book&quot; (the book you got from John).
*Use '''da''' to show what something is by. '''libro da John''' means &quot;a book by John&quot;, (John wrote the book).
*Use '''pri''' to show what something is about. '''libro pri John''' means &quot;a book about John&quot;, (John is the subject of the book).
*Use '''a''' or '''ad''' for the English word &quot;to&quot; when talking about direction. '''De Francia a Rusia''' - &quot;From France to Russia&quot;, '''il parolis ad el''' - &quot;he spoke to her&quot;.
*Use '''per''' to show what you are using to do something. '''Li voyajas per aviono''' - &quot;They travel by aeroplane&quot;.
*Use '''kun''' to show that one thing is in company with something else. '''El iris kun sua spozo''' - &quot;She went with her husband (spouse)&quot;.
*Use '''ek''' for the word &quot;out&quot;, as in made out of something. '''shuo facita ek ledro''' - &quot;a shoe made out of leather&quot;.
*Use '''en''' for the word &quot;in&quot;. '''en mea chambro''' - &quot;in my room&quot;.
*Use '''aden''' (to + in) to mean &quot;into&quot;. '''aden mea chambro''' - &quot;into my room&quot;.
*Use '''sur''' to mean &quot;on&quot;. '''Pozez ol sur la lito''' - &quot;Place it on the bed&quot;.
*Use '''adsur''' to mean &quot;up onto&quot;. '''la kato saltis adsur la tablo''' - &quot;the cat jumped up onto the table&quot;.
*Use '''alonge''' in the same way you use English &quot;along&quot;. '''Irez alonge la rivero''' - &quot;Go along the river&quot;.

==Word order==
*You will have no problems following English word order when you write in Ido, but you can change things around a bit.
*As said before, adjectives can go before or after a noun, like in French.
*Adverbs go anywhere as long as the meaning is clear.
*The subject goes before the object, but you can put the subject after if you want by putting an -n on the object. '''Me manjas pano''' - &quot;I eat bread&quot;, but: '''Men manjas pano''' - &quot;(A) bread eats me&quot;. Of course you could just change the order and say '''Pano manjas me'''.

==Questions==
*Ask yes or no questions by using '''ka''' or '''kad''' before a sentence. '''Vu iris a la urbo''' - &quot;You went to the city&quot;. '''Ka vu iris a la urbo?''' - &quot;Did you go to the city?&quot; (NOTE: The choice between '''ka''' and '''kad''' is only about euphony. Just choose the one you think sounds better in each particular case).
*You don't change the word order when asking a question like in English.
*Other words: '''kande''' (when), '''quale''' (how), '''ube''' (where), '''quo''' (what), '''qua''' (who).

The bicycle is turned upside down and held in the jaws of the Workmate. Cheap Workmate imitations don't have a wide base, so the original device with the wide legs is handy to prevent toppling. This is used especially for adjusting the gears or for fixing punctures, when the wheels need to be removed. It is also handy for any jobs involving removing the chain or working on the gears, since it brings the workspace up off the ground, hence the repairer does not need to crouch. A car-mounted bicycle rack can be used as a repair for some activities, particularly derailleur adjustments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hooke's Law and the Modulus of Elasticity ==
&lt;!-- use H/L to relate force in an elastic string or spring to the extension or compression, and understand the term mod of elast --&gt;

The '''natural length''' is the length of an elastic string or spring when it is not stretched or compressed. An ''elastic string'' or ''spring'' experiences a tension when its length is greater than the natural length. In addition, a ''spring'' experiences a compression when its length is less than its natural length. To simplify our analysis, we use the term '''tension''' to refer to both types of forces (i.e. tension and compression). Also, we use the term '''extension''' to refer to the change in the length of the string or spring. Thus, the extension for a compressed spring is negative.

According to '''Hooke's Law''', the '''extension''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  is ''proportional'' to the '''tension''' &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; applied to the elastic string or spring. Although Hooke's Law holds only up to the ''limit of elasticity'', we may safely assume its applicability unless otherwise told. We may write this relationship in terms of the '''natural length''' &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and the '''modulus of elasticity''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (which is a property of the elastic string or spring independent of its length) as follows:

{|style=&quot;border: red 2px solid&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{\lambda}{l} x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Note that the tension and the extension are in the ''same direction'' (i.e. the variables are either both positive or both negative). This should be intuitive since we are considering the force exerted ''on'' (i.e. NOT exerted ''by'') the elastic string or spring.

[[Image:elasticstring.png|100px|right]]

If a ''mass'' attached to the end of the elastic string or spring is producing the extension, then by '''Newton's Third Law''', the elastic string or spring exerts a force on the mass equal in magnitude and ''opposite'' in direction to its tension. To illustrate this, let us consider the  system on the right.

Consider a particle P of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; suspended vertically from one end of a light (i.e. massless) elastic string of natural length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and modulus of elasticity &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The other end of the string is attached to a fixed point O. When the particle is at rest, the resultant force acting on it is zero according to '''Newton's Second Law'''. Therefore, the downward weight of the particle should balance the upward force exerted by the string on the particle (which is equal in ''magnitude'' to the tension of the string):

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{mgl}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the corresponding extension in the string.
|}

== Elastic Potential Energy ==
&lt;!-- use formula for elastic PE stored in a string or spring --&gt;

An elastic string or spring is able to store energy when it is extended (and compressed, in the case of a spring). This stored energy is termed the '''elastic potential energy (EPE)'''. The EPE in an elastic string or spring is converted from the ''work done'' (''by'' an external agent) in producing the required extension. This is just the work done ''against'' the force exerted ''by'' the elastic string or spring by virtue of its ''tension''. Therefore, the EPE can be determined by integrating the tension &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; wrt the extension &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EPE}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;Work done to produce the extension &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^x T \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^x \frac{\lambda}{l}y \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\lambda}{l} \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;border: solid red 2px&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EPE}=\frac{\lambda}{2l} x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

&lt;!-- solve probs involving forces, and work/energy --&gt;

== scaling images ==

You can scale an image using wikitext instead of uploading of a smaller version. Add something like &quot;|768px&quot; to the Image: link.
You may also add &quot;|thumb&quot; or &quot;|frame&quot; as desired. See the image instructions in the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing Editing help] for more details.

I added a note like the above the to recent image and reverted to the larger one, but I see you uploaded over that. The wiki scaling works fine; the note stem didn't disappear. You might want to revert back to the original again.

The information currently on this page (directing a user only to the manufacturers webpage) is not sufficient and not in the spirit of WikiBooks.  I understand that each brand and type of suspension will likely have differences in lubriction, but there should be enough commonality between the methods to allow a useful article to be written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Around the time of World War One and Two, Communication research largely focused on the influence of [[w:Propaganda|propaganda]]. One question that researchers sought to answer was: how can communication be utilized to create behavioral changes?  Governments felt that if they were to function efficiently, they could only do so with the coordinated cooperation of their citizens. Through the use of propaganda, governments could ensure that a nation functioned to meet its goals, but could also lead to crushing individuals' ability to shape their own lives and their own consciousness. Research into this area greatly expanded mass communication research in the twentieth century.

This chapter approaches the question of propaganda, from the perspective of someone that many have called one of the &quot;fathers of communication,&quot; [[w:Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann]].

== Early Experiences of Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) ==

Walter Lippmann was born in 1889 and spent much of his youth exploring arts such as painting and music, travelling to Europe, and acquiring a particular interest in reading, all due to his family’s secure economic status (Weingast, 1949).  By the time he entered Harvard in the fall of 1906, Lippmann had been exposed to a wide array of ideas and had been well prepared for the challenging work that lay ahead of him at school.  It was at Harvard that the first influences on Lippmann’s work and theoretical approach first appeared.

Lippmann was influenced by the social thinkers of the time such as George Santayana, William James, and Graham Wallas. It is impossible to understand Lippmann's own thought without some grounding in the perspectives popular at Harvard and elsewhere. He was influenced by the move toward an [[w:Pragmatism|American pragmatic approach]], as well as socialist thinkers of the time.

== Predecessors of Walter Lippmann ==

=== William James (1842-1910) ===

Many consider William James to be one of the most prominent influences on Lippmann while at Harvard (Weingast, 1949; Steel, 1999).  The two scholars first met when Lippmann published an article in the ''Illustrated'', a Harvard campus magazine. Lippmann's article, written as a response to a book of Barrett Wendell's, was a commentary on social justice and the plight of the common man. James was intrigued by Lippmann's article and surprised Lippmann by approaching him.  The two became friends, and Lippmann's regular conversations with James profoundly influenced his future work.

William James is perhaps best known for his theories
of pragmatism.  James (1907) defines the pragmatic
method as, &quot;The attitude of looking away from first
things, principles, 'categories,' supposed
necessities; and of looking toward last things,
fruits, consequences, fact&quot; (p. 29).  He showed how
pragmatism is related to truth, and truth is that
which can be verified.  &quot;True ideas are those that we
can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify&quot;
(James, 1907, p. 88).  In this way, James (1907)
suggested that the understanding of the world
is based on enduring, significant perceptions of
the effects of the objects that surround individuals.  Although
Lippmann strayed from the practice of pragmatism in
his own work, there were ideas that he took from
James' theories and applied to his own life.  Steel
(1999) claims that one of these ideas was that of
meliorism, or the idea that &quot;things could be
improved, but never perfected&quot; (p. 18).  Another is practicality, or
the idea that &quot;men had to make decisions without
worrying about whether they were perfect&quot; (Steel, 1999, p. 18).

The themes of meliorism and practicality are indeed
evident in Lippmann’s thought and writing.
Throughout many years of writing, Lippmann's
opinions on the issues of the public and their
relationship to government tended to waver.  For
example, according to Weingast (1949), Lippmann
initially supported the idea that government
intervention in the economy was necessary,
specifically through the provision of public projects
to support employment during times of economic
hardship.  However, when Franklin D. Roosevelt presented
his [[w:New Deal|New Deal]], which included more government
intervention in the public arena, Lippmann did not support the program (Weingast, 1949).
Lippmann (1936) wavered in his views
on socialism as well.

It is doubtful that his constant changes of opinion
were purposeful; rather they served as
evidence of James' influence on Lippmann's work.  By
accepting the ideas of meliorism and practicality, it
could potentially mean that one is always striving to
find the next best solution; that when one theory
fails, another can be developed to take its place.  By questioning himself and his beliefs,
Lippmann was advancing his own theories and
finding new ways of understanding his surroundings.

=== George Santayana (1863-1952) ===

Santayana was a philosopher at Harvard who also
influenced the work of Lippmann.  Santayana’s theories
revolved around the idea of the essence of objects,
which Munson (1962) defined as the &quot;datum of
intuition&quot; (p. 8).  Santayana was interested in uncovering the various essences that
made up human life: those values which could be
uncovered and then tied to human experience (Steel,
1999).  This outlook is a sharp contrast to the theories of
James, which Lippmann had already been exposed to.
Steel (1999) explained that while James focused on the
idea of [[w:Moral relativism|moral relativism]], or the ability to create
truth from observation, Santayana was focusing on the
&quot;search for absolute moral values that could be
reconciled with human experience&quot; (p. 21).

Santayana’s influence on Lippmann is evident in his
later work.  Tied to Santayana’s ideas of the
&quot;essence&quot; of humanity and life, were his ideas that
democracy could result in a tyranny of the majority
(Steel, 1999, p. 21).  This idea is easily related to
Lippmann's later writings in ''Phantom Public'' (1925).
''Phantom Public'' examines the American public within a
democratic system.  Lippmann (1925) expresses his
ideas that the majority of the American public is
uneducated in public issues, easily manipulated
into siding with the majority, and therefore, plays a very limited role in the democratic process.
In relation to democracy, Lippmann states, &quot;Thus the
voter identified himself with the officials.  He tried
to think that their thoughts were his thoughts, that
their deeds were his deeds, and even in some
mysterious way they were a part of him….It prevented
democracy from arriving at a clear idea of its own
limits and attainable ends&quot; (p. 148).  Lippmann (1925)
shows that within a democratic system the
majority is actually suppressed by the minority
opinion.  It is this overwhelming suppression of the
public opinion within a democratic system that seems
to represent Santayana’s influence on Lippmann.  If
Santanyana argued that democracy would result in a
tyranny of the majority,
Lippmann (1925) supported this idea by showing that
public opinion caused little influence on a democratic
system that was actually controlled by the educated
elite.

=== Graham Wallas (1858-1952) ===

Graham Wallas, a founder of the [[w:Fabian Society|Fabian Society]], was
another predecessor to Lippmann’s work (Steel, 1999).
Wallas is perhaps best known for his work ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1981). The political views
expressed in this book helped to
shape Lippmann’s later thoughts about the relationship
between the public and its environment.

Wallas (1981) expresses
his thoughts on the public’s understanding of their
surroundings.  He states that the universe
presents the public with, &quot;an unending stream of
sensations and memories, every one of which is
different from every other, and before which, unless
we can select and recognize and simplify, we must
stand helpless and unable to either act or think.  Man
has therefore to create entities that shall be the
material of his reasoning&quot; (p. 134).  In this way,
Wallas was showing that the public is incapable of
understanding their environment; the stimuli that they
are presented with are too numerous to gain a
well-versed understanding.  Steel (1999) claims that
this idea was one of Wallas’ greatest influences on
the future work of Lippmann, particularly in Public
Opinion (1922).  In this work, Lippmann (1922)
expanded upon Wallas’ original ideas about the
relationship between the public and their environment,
and was able to show that the public was not able to
take in all of the knowledge from their environment
that would truly be needed to affect their governance.

Aside from inspiring Lippmann to examine the
relationship between the public and the environment,
Wallas can also be credited with influencing Lippmann
to break his ties with the Socialist school of thought
(Steel, 1999).  Until his interactions with Wallas,
Lippmann had held strong socialist beliefs, based not
only upon his experiences at school, but also upon the
writings of Karl Marx.

=== Karl Marx (1818-1883) ===

Karl Marx was particularly concerned with explaining
the class struggles that existed in society (Rogers,
1994).  His most well-known works were ''Das Kapital''
(Capital) and ''The Communist Manifesto''.  Through these
works, Marx explained his theories about the struggle
of the working class, their alienation from their
work, and their need to rebel against the elite in
order to take ownership for their actions and gain
power (Rogers, 1994).  [[w:Marxism|Marxism]] explained the way that
economic forces create changes in society, and the
need for the creation of a communist system to restore
equality to that system (Rogers, 1994).

While at Harvard, Lippmann read Marx’s
ideas on communism, and chose to support the ideology
of [[w:Socialism|socialism]] (Steel, 1999). Lippmann also joined the Fabians
while at school. They were a group which urged for the
empowering of the middle-classes, rather than the
over-throwing of the elite, in order to create social
equality (Steel, 1999).  Unlike Marxists, however, the
Fabians still believed in the presence of an
intellectual elite (Steel, 1970).  This theme is
present in Lippmann’s ''Phantom Public'' (1925).  In this
piece of literature, Lippmann (1925) explains that
society is truly dominated by an intellectual elite,
even when they might think that they are following a
system of majority rule.  &quot;…it is hard to say whether
a man is acting executively on his opinions or merely
acting to influence the opinion of someone else, who
is acting executively&quot; ( Lippmann, 1925, p. 110).

Marx also claimed that mass media is used as a tool by
the elite social classes to control society (Rogers,
1994).  This theme is evident in Lippmann’s ''Public Opinion'' (1922), which explained that it was the mass
media who determined what information the public could
access, and how the limitation of such access could in
turn, shape public opinion.

The remnants of Marxism are present in
Lippmann’s later works, such as ''Public Opinion'' and
''Phantom Public''. By 1914, Lippmann was no longer a
supporter of the implementation of socialism on a
large scale (Steel, 1999).  With his publication of
''Drift and Mastery'' (1914), Lippmann denounced the use
of socialism (Steel, 1999).  Furthermore, his
publication of ''Good Society'' (1936) was essentially a
criticism of the very theories of socialism that he
had once supported.  By this point, Lippmann (1936)
recognized the error in the socialist theories; the
fact that even by putting an end to private ownership
and developing collective property, people still
may not know how to properly distribute resources
without exploitation.  Lippman (1936) claims &quot;This is
the crucial point in the socialist argument: the whole
hope that exploitation, acquisitiveness, social
antagonism, will disappear rests upon confidence in
the miraculous effect of the transfer of titles&quot; (p.
72).  Lippmann’s wavering views on socialism are
important. They clearly affect how Lippmann sees
the relation between man, his environment, and his
government.  These themes will be prevalent in
Lippmann’s theories, as he explains how and why the
public is subject to manipulation.

=== Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) ===

Aside from his reading of Karl Marx, Lippmann was also
influenced by the readings of other academics.  Of
particular importance to the work of the
propaganda/mass communication theorists in general was
the work of Sigmund Freud.  Freud’s influence can be
seen not only in the work of Lippmann, but also in the
work of Lippmann’s contemporaries.

Sigmund Freud was initially trained as a medical
doctor and later founded [[w:Psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalytic theory]]
(Rogers, 1994).  Of particular importance to
psychoanalytic theory was the understanding of an
individual’s mind.  According to Rogers (1994), Freud
was able to divide the human consciousness into three
states; the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.
The conscious consists of those things which we know
about ourselves, the preconscious consists of those
things which we could pay conscious attention to if we
so desired, and the unconscious consists of those
things which we do not understand or know about
ourselves (Rogers, 1994).  From these three levels of
individual analysis, Freud attempted to understand
human behavior.  Both Freud’s general theories of
psychoanalysis, as well as one of Freud’s writings in
particular, ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', came to be
of particular importance to the propaganda theorists.

''The Interpretation of Dreams'' dealt with the idea that
dreams are a form of wish fulfillment; they represent
a desire of the unconscious that can be achieved
during sleep through the creation of a dream to
fulfill a need (Levin, 1929).  Lippmann applied this
idea to his work in ''Public Opinion'' (1922).  In ''Public Opinion'', Lippmann (1922) stressed the idea of “The
World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads” (p. 3).
This concept involves the idea that a person’s
perceptions of an event or situation may not match
what is actually happening in their environment
(Lippman, 1922). This idea was influenced by ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', in that Lippmann used this
book to develop his idea of a “pseudo-environment”
that existed in the minds of individuals (Rogers,
1994, p. 234).

Bernays' (1928) understanding of human motives was
also based on the study of Freud’s work.  Bernays was Freud's nephew, and at various times in his life the American travelled to Vienna to visit with his uncle.  Bernays had a special interest in adopting psychoanalytic theory into his public relations work, and this influenced his thinking in relation to public opinion.  In
''Propaganda'', Bernays (1928) claims it is the
Freudian school of thought that recognized &quot;man's thoughts and actions are compensatory
substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to
suppress&quot; (p. 52).  Bernays (1928) goes on to show
that propagandists cannot merely accept the reasons
that men give for their behavior.  If they are truly
hiding their real motives, as Freud suggests, then
&quot;the successful propagandist must understand the true
motives and not be content to accept the reasons which
men give for what they do&quot; (Bernays, 1928, p. 52).  By
getting to the root of a man’s wants and needs,
Bernays suggests that propaganda can become more
effective and influential.

Overall, Freud’s theories were a strong guiding
framework for understanding individuals.  By helping
theorists such as Lasswell, Lippmann, Bernays, and
Ellul to understand individuals, Freud was also
helping them to understand the public that they aimed
to manipulate.

== The Theories of Walter Lippmann ==

While at Harvard, Lippmann had first-hand exposure to the theories of William James,
George Santayana, and Graham Wallas.  He had also read the works of Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx. 
While some applications of Lippmann’s predecessors’
ideas to his research have already been discussed, it
is important to examine the overall theories of Walter
Lippmann.

Following his time at Harvard, Lippmann decided to
pursue a career in journalism.  He had focused on the
study of philosophy at Harvard. By 1910 he had
dropped out of their graduate program and was ready to
pursue a career (Steel, 1999).  Lippmann started his
career by working for Lincoln Steffens, writing
primarily about socialism and issues on Wall Street
(Rogers, 1994).  Following his time with Steffens,
Lippmann began work on an elite intellectual magazine
known as the ''New Republic'' (Rogers, 1994).  Lippmann
worked on ''New Republic'' for nine years, and as his time
there came to an end, he began to publish his
most prominent pieces of literature (Rogers, 1994).

== Public Opinion ==

''Public Opinion'' (1922) is perhaps Lippmann’s most
well-known work.  It was in this piece
that Lippmann first began to develop and explain his
theories on the formation of public opinion.  Lippmann
(1922) begins this book by describing a situation in
1914, where a number of Germans, Frenchmen, and
Englishmen were trapped on an island.  They have no
access to media of any kind, except for once every
sixty days when the mail comes, alerting them to
situations in the real world.  Lippmann explains that
these people lived in peace on the island, treating
each other as friends, when in actuality the war had
broken out and they were enemies (Lippmann, 1922).

The purpose of the above anecdote is to develop the
idea of &quot;The World Outside and the Pictures in Our
Heads&quot; (Lippmann, 1922, p. 3).  Throughout ''Public Opinion'', Lippmann (1922) explains the way that our
individual opinions can differ from those that are
expressed in the outside world.  He develops the idea
of propaganda, claiming that &quot;In order to conduct
propaganda, there must be some barrier between the
public and the event&quot; (Lippmann, 1922, p. 28).  With
this separation, there is the ability of the media to
manipulate events or present limited information to
the public.  This information may not match the
public’s perception of the event.  In this way,
Lippmann was essentially presenting some of the first
views on the mass communication concepts of
gatekeeping and agenda-setting, by showing the media’s
power to limit public access to information.

Lippmann (1922) showed how individuals use tools such
as stereotypes to form their opinions.  “In putting
together our public opinions, not only do we have to
picture more space than we can see with our eyes, and
more time than we can feel, but we have to describe
and judge more people, more actions, more things than
we can ever count, or vividly imagine…We have to pick
our samples, and treat them as typical” (Lippmann,
1922, p. 95).  Lippmann shows that the public is left
with these stereotypical judgments until the media
presents limited information to change their
perception of an event.    Rogers (1994) claims that
in this way, Lippmann was showing us that &quot;...the
pseudo-environment that is conveyed to us by the media
is the result of a high degree of gatekeeping in the
news process&quot; (p. 237).  Lippmann recognized that the
media was altering the flow of information, by
limiting the media content that was presented to the
public.  Furthermore, Lippmann presents the idea of
agenda-setting, as he recognizes that the mass media
is the link between individual perceptions of a world,
and the world that actually exists (Rogers, 1994).

== Phantom Public== 

''Phantom Public''
(1925) focused on describing the characteristics of
the public itself.  Lippmann (1925) used
this book to show the public’s inability to have vast
knowledge about their environment, and therefore, to
show their failure to truly support a position.
Lippmann (1925) gives a harsh view of the general
public, stating, &quot;The individual man does not have
opinions on public affairs... I cannot imagine how he
could know, and there is not the least reason for
thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the
compounding of individual ignorances in masses of
people can produce a continuous directing force in
public affairs&quot; (p. 39).  This book seemed to show
that democracy was not truly run by the public, but
rather, was being controlled by an educated elite.
The public could not be truly well informed, so they
were easily convinced to side with an educated
minority, while convincing themselves that they were
actually in a system of majority rule.  Lippmann
(1925) claims that the book aimed to &quot;...bring the
theory of democracy into somewhat truer alignment with
the nature of public opinion... It has seemed to me that
the public had a function and must have methods of its
own in controversies, qualitatively different from
those of the executive men&quot; (p. 197).

== Other Writings ==

Lippmann also published a number of other books that
dealt primarily with his political thoughts regarding
the public.  These included ''A Preface to Politics''
(1913) and ''Good Society'' (1936).  While these works are
important toward understanding Lippmann’s thoughts on
the relation of the public to their government, ''Public Opinion'' and ''Phantom Public'' held most of Lippmann’s
theories that were relevant to mass communication
research.

== Future Career Path ==

Aside from his major works of literature, Lippmann was
perhaps best known for his &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot;
column, which he began publishing in 1931 in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' (Weingast, 1949).  This column
gave Lippmann complete freedom of expression, and the
ability to write about such topics as history,
government, economics, and philosophy (Weingast,
1949).  Although the column tended to appeal to a
limited American audience, it dealt with a wide
variety of important issues.  Weingast (1949)
estimates that only 40% of American adults could
understand Lippmann’s column, and only 24% could be
considered regular readers of the column (p. 30).
However, it is this column that still must be
recognized for helping Lippmann’s ideas to gain
popularity.

Lippmann’s various works led him to a great many
opportunities to work with important figures in
history.  In 1918, he was given the ability to assist
President Woodrow Wilson in writing the Fourteen
Points, which helped to restore peace after
World War One (Rogers, 1994).  Of more importance to
communication studies, Lippmann was also given the
opportunity to publish and present propaganda in
Europe to support the acceptance of the Fourteen
Points on an international scale (Steel, 1999).  It is
through this work that some of Lippmann’s ties to
Harold Lasswell can be observed.

== Other Propaganda Theorists == 

=== Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) ===

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell
was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda.  In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was
examining was actually being written by Lippmann
himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in
the area of propaganda research.  He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses
of propaganda, understanding the content of
propaganda, and discovering the effect of propaganda
on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994).  Lasswell is
credited with creating the mass communication
procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994).
Generally, content analysis can be defined as, &quot;...the
investigation of communication messages by
categorizing message content into classifications in
order to measure certain variables&quot; (Rogers, 1994).
In an essay entitled &quot;Contents of Communication,&quot;
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis
should take into account the frequency with which
certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in
which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s
opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used.  By
understanding the content of the message, Lasswell
(1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the
&quot;stream of influence that runs from control to
content and from content to audience&quot; (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to
Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication
which stated, &quot;Who says what in which channel to whom
and with what effects&quot; (p. 84).  Content analysis was
essentially the 'says what' part of this definition,
and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this
area during the remainder of his career.

Lasswell's most well-known content analyses were an
examination of the propaganda content during World War
One and Two.  In ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'',
Lasswell (1938) examined propaganda techniques through
a content analysis, and came to some striking
conclusions.  Lasswell (1938) was similar to Ellul, in
that he showed that the content of war propaganda had
to be pervasive in all aspects of the citizen’s life
in order to be effective.  Furthermore, Lasswell
(1938) showed that as more people were reached by this
propaganda, the war effort would become more
effective.  &quot;...[T]he active propagandist is certain to
have willing help from everybody, with an axe to grind
in transforming the War into a march toward whatever
sort of promised land happens to appeal to the group
concerned.  The more of these sub-groups he can fire
for the War, the more powerful will be the united
devotion of the people to the cause of the country,
and to the humiliation of the enemy&quot; (Lasswell, 1938,
p. 76).

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda,
Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion.  This dealt primarily with
understanding the effects of the media.  Lasswell was
particularly interested in examining the effects of
the media in creating public opinion within a
democratic system.  In ''Democracy Through Public Opinion'', Lasswell (1941) examines the effects of
propaganda on public opinion, and the effects of
public opinion on democracy.  Lasswell (1941) claims,
“Democratic government acts upon public opinion and
public opinion acts openly upon government” (p. 15).
Affecting this relationship is the existence of
propaganda.  Due to this propaganda, “General
suspiciousness is directed against all sources of
information.  Citizens may convince themselves that it
is hopeless to get the truth about public affairs”
(Lasswell, 1941, p. 40).  In this way, Lasswell has
created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the
information that is presented to them, and also
apprehensive to accept it.  However, it is still that
information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them
by the government.  This is an interesting way of
viewing the power of the media that is somewhat
similar to Lippmann’s theories.

=== Edward Bernays (1891-1995) ===

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and
Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was broabout or alter
the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be
beneficial to society’s functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are
molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,
largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of
human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are
to live together as a smoothly functioning society&quot;
(p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be
modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of
public relations.  &quot;Public relations is the attempt,
by information, persuasion, and adjustment, to
engineer public support for an activity, cause,
movement, or institution&quot; (Bernays, 1955, p. 3).  In
The Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out
the framework for understanding the public and
developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955)
claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the
attitudes of various groups in society, gathering
information to effectively express an idea, and
finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public
opinion in the intended direction.

Bernays’ theories represent a step forward for mass
communication theory.  They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda,” and
move toward a deeper understanding of the public, and
the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in
influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22).
Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his
phrase, “the engineering of consent.”  He said,
“Engineering implies planning.  And it is careful
planning more than anything else that distinguishes
modern public relations from old-time hit or miss
publicity and propaganda” (Bernays, 1955, p.22).
Furthermore, Bernays’ theories also represent a
different view of the formation of public opinion.  In
opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being
easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this.  He
claims, “The public is not an amorphous mass which can
be molded at will or dictated to” (Bernays, 1928, p.
66).  Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in
attempting to influence the public, a business must
“…study what terms the partnership can be made
amicable and mutually beneficial.  It must explain
itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in
terms which the public can understand and is willing
to accept” (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations
(1952).  Rather than merely attempting to manipulate
the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public
relations as a tool that can be used to combine the
ideas of the public and the persuader.  “The
objective-minded public relations man helps his client
adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the
public adjust to it” (Bernays, 1952, p. 9).  Bernays
view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as
he recognizes the power of society, but still also
claims that manipulation of the public is possible.
Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public
relations, “To citizens in general, public relations
is important because it helps them to understand the
society of which we are all a part, to know and
evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership
in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate
efforts being made by others, and to persuade or
suggest courses of action” (p. 10).  Under this
framework, while manipulation of the public is still
possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the
public opinion.  Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul
tended to disagree with this point.

=== Jacques Ellul (1912 – 1994) ===

Jacques Ellul’s (1912-1994) theories on propaganda
took a different view of the formation of public
opinion.  Ellul (1965) shows that propaganda is
actually a specific technique, which is both needed by
the public, and by those who create the propaganda in
the first place.  In ''Propaganda: The Formation of
Men’s Attitudes'', Ellul (1965) defines propaganda as,
&quot;a set of methods employed by an organized group that
wants to bring about the active or passive
participation in its actions of a mass of individuals,
psychologically unified through psychological
manipulations and incorporated into a system&quot; (p. 61).
In contrast to the other theorists examined in this
chapter, Ellul tends to view propaganda as a
necessary, but all-encompassing, activity.  It is not
something to be presented to the public in a single
instance, but rather, must become a consistent part of
every aspect of the public's life.

In ''The Technological Society'', Ellul (1964) categorizes
propaganda as a form of human technique.  In general,
he considers the term &quot;technique,&quot; to be referring to
the methods that people use to obtain their desired
results (Ellul, 1964).  Specifically, he claims that
human technique examines those techniques in which
&quot;man himself becomes the object of the technique&quot;
(Ellul, 1964, p. 22).  In this scenario, man is the
&quot;object,&quot; as he is constantly being exposed to, and
pressured by, various presentations of propaganda.
Ellul (1964) goes on to say, &quot;Techniques have taught
the organizers how to force him into the game... The
intensive use of propaganda destroys the citizen's
faculty of discernment&quot; (p. 276).

While ''The Technological Society'' focuses on the methods
used to create a technique, such as propaganda,
''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes'' (1965)
focuses on the specific relationship between
propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion.  As
with Lippmann, Ellul understands the lack of knowledge
that the general public holds for use in forming
public opinion.  Ellul (1965) comments on the use of
stereotypes and symbols in propaganda, as did Lippmann
in Public Opinion (1922).  Ellul (1965) states, &quot;The
more stereotypes in a culture, the easier it is to
form public opinion, and the more an individual
participates in that culture, the more susceptible he
becomes to the manipulation of these symbols&quot; (p.
111).

Both Ellul and Lippmann recognize the inability of the
public to form educated opinions as a whole.  However,
while Lippmann chose to focus on the idea that we
should accept the fact that it is truly an educated
elite that is controlling our opinions, Ellul chose to
focus on the fact that the public actually has a need
for propaganda.  Ellul contests the idea that the
public is merely a victim of propaganda.  Rather, he
states that, &quot;The propagandee is by no means just an
innocent victim.  He provokes the psychological action
of propaganda, and not merely lends himself to it, but
even derives satisfaction from it.  Without this
previous, implicit consent, without this need for
propaganda experienced by practically every citizen of
the technological age, propaganda could not spread&quot;
(Ellul, 1965, p. 121).

Through his theories in ''The Technological Society'' and
''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes'', Ellul
tends to give the media and society’s elite (the
creators of propaganda) a lot of power in shaping
public opinion.  While Bernays recognized the
importance of making propaganda appeal to the needs of
the public, Ellul claims that the public's need is
simply for propaganda in the first place.

== Recent Mass Communication Theorists ==

Based on the traditional theories of Lippmann,
Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul, more recent studies have
been able to be conducted on the use of propaganda in
creating public opinion. Lippmann (1922) was
essentially the first theorist to develop the idea of
the agenda-setting function of the media.  By 1972,
McCombs and Shaw had set out to study
this phenomenon in their work “The Agenda-Setting
Function of Mass Media.”  This study examined the 1968
presidential campaign, by asking undecided voters to
identify the key issues of the presidential campaign,
and then comparing those ideas to the issues that were
being presented by the mass media at the time (McCombs
&amp; Shaw, 1972).  McCombs and Shaw (1972) found that
there was a +0.967 correlation between voter judgment
of important issues, and media presentation of those
issues.  McCombs and Shaw used this information to
further Lippmann’s ideas that the mass media did
indeed set the agenda for what the public should think
about.

Iyengar and Kinder (1982) expanded on Lippmann’s
theories as well, by putting the idea of
agenda-setting and priming to the test.  They created
experimental situations, in which subjects were
exposed to news broadcasts that emphasized particular
events.  The results of this study both supported and
expanded upon Lippmann’s initial theories.  &quot;Our
experiments decisively sustain Lippmann’s suspicion
that media provide compelling descriptions of a public
world that people cannot directly experience&quot; (Iyengar
&amp; Kinder, 1982, p. 855).  Iyengar and Kinder (1982)
found that those news items that received the most
attention, were the news items that people found to be
the most significant.  Furthermore, Iyengar and Kinder
(1982) also found evidence of a priming effect, in
that those events that received the most attention by
a news broadcast, also weighed the most heavily on
evaluations of the president at a later time.

Lippmann’s (1922) theories in Public Opinion also
touched on the idea of a gatekeeper in the media
process.  By 1951, Kurt Lewin had expanded on this
idea, by showing that people can manipulate and
control the flow of information that reaches others
(Rogers, 1994).  Based on the ideas of both Lewin and
Lippmann, White (1950) undertook an
examination of the role of a gatekeeper in the realm
of mass media.  In The “Gatekeeper”: A Case Study In
the Selection of News, White (1950) examined the role
of a wire editor in a newspaper. He found
strong evidence that there was a gatekeeping role at
work within the mass media, as this editor rejected
nine-tenths of the articles that he received, based
primarily on whether he considered the event to be
“newsworthy,” and whether he had another article on
the same topic that he liked better. His
results were important, as they showed the subjective
judgments that an individual can exert in releasing
limited information to the public.

== Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories ==

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul,
and Bernays are important for a number of reasons.
Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was
able to bring attention to the fact that the public is
able to be influenced by the media.  The work of
Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent
research that is meant to help understand the
influence of the media on the public.  Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and
Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media
has been developed.  The public has now been made
aware various media functions such as agenda-setting,
gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects
that these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily
to both the direct effects and limited effects media
models.  Theorists such as Ellul tended to side
heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the
masses.  Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann also
noted that the media might not be influencing only
thought, but may also be influencing what people
thought about.  It was this line of thinking that
resulted in a starting point for future research in
the area of the limited effects of the media.  Such
limited effects were shown through the work of Iyengar
and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw.

Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the
understanding of the media, the manipulation of the
public, and the formation of public opinion.  While
the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us
understand the society that surrounds us today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to the Network Society ==

Information has been a central theme in 21st century research, just as capital was in the 20th century. It is frequently said that society is now living in an information age, which has provided various information technologies (i.e. the Internet and cellular phones). However the &quot;information age&quot; has not been clearly defined. Although many define the current economy as an information economy, there is still no universally accepted definition to refer to the current society. Currently, over thirty different labels for referring to contemporary society are used in academic fields and casual conversation (Alvarez &amp; Kilbourn, 2002). Some of these labels include: information society, global village, digital society, wired society, post-industrial society, and network society. Some of the terms describe the same phenomena, while others do not. 

Among the numerous scholars trying to define this new society, Manuel Castells is the most foremost and unique, in terms of at least two aspects: Firstly, he is an incredibly prolific and energetic theorist on the subject of the information age. He has written over twenty books, published over one hundred academic journal articles, and co-authored over fifteen books. He is currently a professor of Sociology and City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley. He has also served on many national and international organizations such as: the Advisory Council to the United Nations Task Force on Information and Communication Technology, the International Advisory Council to the President of South Africa on Information Technology and Development, the United Nations Secretary General's High Level Panel on Global Civil Society and the United Nations, and UNESCO. Secondly, his critical viewpoint toward networks and the information economy has made him more unique than other information economists and sociologists. Castells is distinguishable from “the Utopians who have taken over the information society camp” (Duff, 1998, p. 375), since he believes that the dark side of a new economy is embedded in the intrinsic characteristics of new technologies. Thus, Castells maintains a deterministic view of technology, whereas the Utopians regard information technologies as instruments for human evolution. 

Castells has become one of the most influential theorists over the past thirty years since his wide array of works has provided a unique and critical framework for examining contemporary society. Castells has been called the first great philosopher of cyberspace for his work on the information economy (Gerstner, 1999). His trilogy published between 1996 and 1998 is recognized as a compendium of his theory about the information age. In the trilogy, consisting of ''The Network Society'', ''The Power of Identity'', and ''End of Millennium'', Castells' analysis of the new economy colligates several strands of the new society: new technological paradigms, globalization, social movements, and the demise of the sovereign nation-state. ''The Network Society'' deals with the &quot;new techno-economic system&quot; (Castells, 2001, p. 4). ''The Power of Identity'' discusses social movements and politics resisting or adapting to the network society.  ''End of Millennium'', the last work of the trilogy, describes the results of the previous two factors in the world. This chapter thus explores what a Castellian network society is, through exploration of his trilogy and other articles.

== New Economy ==

=== New forms of time and space ===
 
The concept of an information economy or network economy is undoubtedly related to new information technologies. According to economists, the definition of an information economy can mean not only an abundant use of information technologies, but also a new something that affects the way individuals work, produce, and consume.  Human processes are changed by these technologies. Thus, to understand the information economy, one should first understand the characteristics of new information technologies, and then study the paradigm shift into the network society. 

Castells (1996, 1997a, 2000) defined the network society as a social structure which is characterized by networked communications technologies and information processing. This includes such social phenomena as economic interdependence among nations as well as globalization and social movements related to individual identity. Based on this definition, Castells (2000) hypothesized that the network society is organized around two new forms of time and space: timeless time and the space of flows. 

In terms of timeless time, new technologies, such as biotechnologies and communication networks, are breaking down the biological sense of time as well as logical sequences of time. Castells’ (1997b) example of new biological reproductive technologies blur life cycle patterns in conditions of parenting by either slowing down or speeding up the life cycle. 
         
Space of flow infers that physical distances are closer among organizations in the society, and information can be easily transmitted from one point to another point by new communication technologies. This means the annihilation of logical concept of space. For example, the hyperlink on webpage collapses succession of things in time and space span, because it brings one from one location to another location in an instant. Castells (2000) stated: “Space and Time, the material foundations of human experience, have been transformed, as the space of flows dominates the space of places, and timeless time supersedes clock time of the industrial era” (p. 1).

=== New Techno-Economy Paradigm ===
 
Castells stated that the new network society is dominated by “a new techno-economic paradigm based on information networks-informationalism” (Cabot, 2003, p.1148).  Castells (2004) definition of informationalism is “a technological paradigm based on the augmentation of the human capacity of information processing and communication made possible by the revolutions in microelectronics, software, and genetic engineering” (p. 11). Information processing and communication, like newspapers, radios, and televisions, existed in history too. However, information technologies were not fundamental materials for development in the past industrial economy. The informational economy depends on the capacity of networks. Thus, without the capacity provided by these new technologies, the new economy would not be able to operate, as the industrial society could not fully expand without electricity (Castells, 2004). 

Whereas the industrial economy was based on a value chain from manufacturers to retailers, the information economy created various positions related to information technologies and the networks in the value chain such as designers, operators, and integrators. The information economy requires a greater number of highly intelligent laborers that can manage and control the technologies than in an industrial economy. Moreover, there are comparatively more opportunities to create a profit in the network industry or information industry than in other industries. Due to the importance of the networks and communication technologies in the new economy, networks, as a new material for new economy, began to formulate social power, and the members exploiting the ability of networks began to acquire social power (Gerstner, 1999). For example, the network enterprise is the prevailing form of business organization in information economy, since it follows “a complete transformation of relationships of production and management” (Castells, 2000b, p.607).

=== Global Economy ===

Since the modern digital networks that the new paradigm emphasizes have no geographical limitation, the information economy is largely characteristic of global economy. The global economy can be defined as “a network of financial transactions, production sites, markets, and labor pools on a planetary scale” (Castells, 2000b, p.695). This definition places emphasis on the “linkages between economic agents,” which are essentially horizontal and flexible relationships in which the operating economic agents, as nodes in networks, enact a project (Fields, 2002, p.56). Thus, these linkages are not really firms, but instead can be seen as networking nodes. 

The nature of technologies and networks generally affects the structure of the economy. The flexibility of modern business organizations reflects the flexible nature of new networks, so that the linkages are occasionally transformed and reconstructed for its profitability. Since current networks have few physical limitations and open systems, they can “increase their value exponentially as they add nodes” (Castells, 2000c, p.698) and can create infinite linkages among other agents for their goals. Thus, the structure of information economy is not constrained by geographical restrictions. At the definition of the global economy, the planetary scale does not require highly internationalized organizations or wide geographical ranges. Rather, in terms of the space of flows made of bits and pieces of places, global economy exists in the reconstructed time and space. Gupta (2003) uses the example of NASDAQ, an electronically wired stock market, for the case of global economy. The global economy is a concept that values the speed with which knowledge, goods, and people are transacted. Spatial distance is no longer significant. 

On the contrary, rails and telegraph have also influenced the structure of the past industrial economy. Richard R. Jone (2000) estimated that new digital revolution in the past half century is comparable to the role of railroads and telegraphy in the 19th century, in terms of “information infrastructure” (pp. 68-86). In the case of the 19th century, the railroad and telegraph, as new networks, contributed to compress geographical distance, which accelerated industrial development. However, since the networks were less flexible under their physical limitations, the industrial structure, based on the networks, was less flexible than today. In the 19th century, the structure of business was generally vertically integrated, relying on mass-production systems, and mass-distribution networks. In sum, new technology alters the structure of society and industry by its inherent nature, so that the structure in the new economy is flexible and horizontal with production and consumption relying on the new global and digital networks.

== Main Features of New Economy ==

=== Individualization of Work ===
 
In the new global economy, a cleavage or gap seems to increase between &quot;'generic labour' (casual substitutable labour) and 'self-reprogrammable labour' (those with the ability to adapt their skills throughout their lives)&quot; (Kaldor, 1998, p. 899). Generic labour refers to a person who is unskilled or possesses lower skills or has a low level of education. These individuals usually work for low-wage labor, and according to Castells (2004) can be, &quot;disposable, except if they assert their right to exist as humans and citizens through their collective action&quot; (p. 40). On the contrary, self-reprogrammable labour refers to highly educated people who manage and control information with high creativity. Castells (2004) states: 

: &quot;The more our information systems are complex, and interactively connected to data bases and information sources, the more what is required from labor is to be able of this searching and recombining capacity. This demands the appropriate training, not in terms of skills, but in terms of creative capacity, and ability to evolve with organizations and with the addition of knowledge in society&quot; (p. 40). 

Since the matter of labour in the global economy is related to capacity and creativity, Castells (2001) suggests that education is a more important solution today.

Another problem in the cleavage between both types of labours is that labor organizations cannot function properly, and rather divide the self-reprogrammable labour from the generic labour. Another example of the cleavage is that within the industrial system, the employment of &quot;flexible woman&quot; increased, but that of &quot;organized man&quot; decreased, over the last couple of decades. The more valuable segments in the value chain of global economy can survive. 

Since the global economy allows flexible and arbitrary linkage between nodes, a business organization can easily redeploy their labour sources from one market to the other market in a planetary scope. Thus, globalization of the economic activities enables the situation that one labour market is supplied for abundant works, but, at the same time, one market experiences a serious unemployment. The other problem of labour in global economy is that new technologies increase the productivity of blue-collar worker, so that the network enterprises downsize its own system. This is reminiscent of the mass layoffs in the 19th century. 

Castells (1997b) views these trends as &quot;the reversal trend of socialization of labour that characterized the industrial age&quot; (p. 9). He warns of the alienation of workers in the network society by using Carnoy's terms of &quot;individualization of work&quot;. 

: &quot;Networking and individualization of work leaves workers to themselves. Which is all right when they are strong, but becomes a dramatic condition when they do not have proper skills, or they fall into some of the traps of the system (illness, additions, psychological problems, lack of housing, or of health insurance)&quot; (Castells, 1999).

=== Inequality in the Global Economy === 

The central point of Castells' information economy is that the inherent logic of the system is exclusionary, and the gap is increasing (Gerstner, 1999). Castells (2000a) defines the global economy as “still-capitalism”, since the purpose of production in the new economy is still for profit and the economy system is still based on property rights (p. 373). Castells (2004) states: &quot;Capitalism has not disappeared, but it is not, against the ideologically suggested perception, the only source of value in the global town&quot; (p. 39). 

Castells suggests that Africa, as the fourth world, is “dropping further and further behind the global economy with each leap forward by the techno-elite” (Gerstner, 1999). This is not because of political purposes, but because of the inherent nature of technology. Why does the inequality increase if tremendous technological advancements are supplied to society? New networks and communication technologies enable people or nodes to build relations with others. However, the decision of making relations is up to the comparative value of each node. Thus, Africa, which has no legacy from an industrial era, is composed of less valuable segments, which remain isolated or utilized for cheap wage labor in the new economy. Poor children in Africa and Latin America are still exploited at work by global business organizations. 

The inequality occurs in information consumption. Alvin Toffler and Nicolas Negroponte believed that the new information technologies would lead a radical, positive change in the economy. Castells foresees that technical changes are not equally beneficial to everyone in the global economy. His attention is focused on the digital divide, which refers inequitable distribution or access to information. Wireless communication, Broadband cable, and other new technologies made it possible to hyperlink instantly among multiple spots. However, the majority of the populations remain unwired. According to Castells, information, like the capitals in industrial economy, is always insufficient to all the people. 

Since Castells considers the new techno-economic paradigm in network society a &quot;socially embedded process, not as an exogenous factor affecting society,&quot; he can be categorized as a technology determinist. However, he has never blamed the technology itself, even if he thinks that the nature of modern technology increases the inequity of global societies. Castells states: &quot;This is not an opinion. It's an empirical observation. However, this is not the fault of technology, it is the way we use it.... Unequal, undemocratic, exclusionary societies, on the contrary, will see the power of technology dramatically increases social exclusion&quot; (Gerstner, 1999).

=== The demise of the Sovereign Nation-State ===
 
Another main trend of the new economy is the “demise of the sovereign nation-state&quot; (Castells, 2000c, p. 694). Since both global networks and communication technologies have increased the strength and frequency of transforming information, capitals, and labour among other nodes in the networks, all nations and states have become more interdependent. The increased relations stimulate the necessity of transnational institutions such as the EU, NATO, ASEAN, and UN. Castells (2001) argues that the degree of freedom of nation states has shrunk to an extraordinary degree in the last ten years, because of the European Union. Member nations in the European Union have decentralized markets in order to strengthen their bargaining power and socio-economic control. Consequently, each member state in the Union has experienced diminishing social power over their national issues and more complex relations with each other. Nodes in information economies or network economies do not necessarily exist in the form of an organization, but occasionally exist as a individuals, such as Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of Federal Reserve Board (Castells, 2001). 

However, the demise of sovereignty for Castells does not mean that the current nations or states will disappear through global networks, but that their social power should be shared or restricted by other institutions, nations, or states.

== Skepticism ==

Castells’ theory revisits Marxist skepticism regarding industrialism. The theory of the network society uses many concepts and viewpoints traditionally held by Marxists. Castells replaces the position of capital in industrialism by the concept of information. In his analysis, Castells recognizes that the rise of informationalism and the nature of networks has led global societies toward inequality and social exclusion, widening the cleavage between &quot;generic labour&quot; and &quot;self-reprogrammable labour,&quot; global city and local city, information-rich and information-poor. Thus, Tony Giddens, Alain Touraine, Peter Hall, and Chris Freeman compare Castells to such sociologists of importance as Marx and Weber (Cabot, 2003).  During the 1970s, Castells exhibited a Marxist intellectual trajectory, and he confessed that he felt the need of Marxism for probing political change in information age.

== Legacy ==

Castell's most important contribution was that he attempted to build a grand theory of the information age in macro-perspective. Even though his work is still progressing, his wide ranging analysis has provided an in-depth, yet macro understanding about the information society. The majority of his approach has been empirical in an attempt to diagnose the contemporary problems in the information society. Castells states his high dissatisfaction with the apparent superficiality of the prophecies that futurists such as Toffler and Gilder had announced for the &quot;new&quot; society. Although there are some criticisms that Castells overemphasized the negative effects of the information economy, his analysis for each case, such as the collapse of Soviet Union, was empirical and very accurate. 

In addition, Castells analysis is globalized, even if he warns of the dark side of globalization. As most information infrastructures are centralized on U.S. or Western European nations, most of the academic analysis on information economy concerns those countries. However, Castells’ empirical studies range from the fourth-world countries to the European Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Historiography has moved beyond the old schoolmasters' adage that, &quot;Geography is about maps; history is about chaps.&quot; While it is undoubtedly true that certain individuals have had the good fortune to be associated with the introduction of major technological innovations, one ought to remember that even the most isolated inventor must work within the limits of the social, financial, political and technological resources available to him (or her). Consequently, technological advances ought to be viewed within contexts that extend beyond the people that invented them if they are to be understood in a balanced fashion.

Technolgical determinists are those individuals who believe that technology is the major cause of events. Canadian scholar Marshall McLuhan is most often placed in this category. His pronouncements such as &quot;the medium is the message&quot; is typical of the determinist stance. More significant, however, are his four laws of media: enhance, obsolesce, retrieve and reverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==
Assyrians lived in northern Mesopotamia from 1900 – 612 BC. During the height of its power (8th – 6th centuries BC), it expanded to cover the whole of Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Syria, Palestine and Cyprus) as well as northern Arabia and north-eastern Egypt.

== The History of Assyria ==
The history of the Assyrian Empire can be divided into  three segments, the Old Assyrian Empire, the Middle Assyrian Empire, and the New Assyrian Empire.  The Old Assyrian Empire was formed around 1900 B.C. and lasted until around 1363B.C.  

The Old Assyrian Empire was a time of conquest.  The Assyrians attacked their neighbors, such as Sumer and Akkad, and grew more powerful, though still not as powerful as some of their neighbors.

During Middle Assyrian Empire,the Empire was very powerful and still growing.  This stage in the life of the empire lasted from  4000 - 1000 B.C.

The New Assyrian Empire occurred during the pinnacle (or top) of the empire's power.  The Assyrians owned most of their known world.  In fact, the kings thought that the gods chose them to rule, and that made them representatives of the gods on earth.  Thus, they were given titles, names, like,&quot;King of the Universe.&quot;  Because of their power they were not only in charge of the army but the temples too.  During this time magnificent palaces and temples were constructed, partly to show off the wealth of the kings.  The last great king during the entire history of Assyria was Ashurbanipal (pronounced Ash-er-ban-ee-pol).  He ruled from 668-627 B.C. After his rule the country soon fell.  The Medes and Babylonians invaded and finally defeated the nation in 612 B.C.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|thumb|right|A winged bull in bas-relief 713-716 B.C.]]
Assyrians built magnificent temples and palaces, decorated with beautiful reliefs and statues of winged bulls, known as cherubs (though you must be careful not to confuse these with angels of the same name).

== What did they eat? ==
Assyrians ate a platter of ground lamb, wheat, pine nuts, and other middle eastern spices.
This was called Kidbei (Kid-be). Their bread was called lehmo or pita. Yogurt was a main part of the Assyrians diet. Assyrians had two main desserts one is a pastry filled with a buttery paste. This is called Kadee.  The other dessert is called Baklava.  Baklava is a dessert found in many other middle eastern civilizations.  Richta, an Assyrian rice dish is tasty.  Booshala is a creamy soup with many delicious ingredients one of which is ground lamb.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|left|Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin]]
The men wore long coatlike garments and were bearded. Women wore  a sleeved tunic and a shawl over their shoulders.
Knee-length and full-length tunics (a garment like a shirt) with short sleeves were the most common types of clothing worn. They were worn along with some type headdress. Shawls were also worn.  The two were generally worn together, but sometimes not.

Though there are no actual pieces of clothing around today, archeologists can still infer with some help from the Old Testament of the Bible that rich coloring was prominent. Colors probably included:

* Blue: dark indigo, though sometimes lighter.
* Red: A lot Indian red.
* Yellow
* Green
* Purple: Dark, and a little brownish.

== What did their writing look like? ==
Assyrian writing was called cuneiform (kU-nee-u-form).The cuneiform is one of the oldest known forms of writing. Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. Over time, however, its letters simplified and became less of a picture.

Cuneiform was written upon clay tablets, on which symbols were drawn with a blunt reed called a stylus. The indentations left by the stylus were wedge shaped, which gave rise to its name, cuneiform (&quot;wedge shaped&quot;).

== What did they believe? ==
[[Image:Ishtar.jpg|thumb|right|Ishtar An Assyrian God]]
Babylonian and Assyrian religion had much in common: most of the myths and the gods were the same. One difference though was that in Assyria the king of gods was Assur, the patron god of the city of Assur, unlike Babylonian Marduk, the patron of Babylon.

The following is a list of gods worshipped by the Assyrians:
* Ishtar, the goddess of love
* Adramelech A sun god
* Anshar, the national God
* As Shalla, the Assyrian goddess of grain
* Anasas, God of medicine
* Nishraeli
* Nisroch god of farming
* Nimrod
* Oannes
* Nabu god of Wisdom and Writing
* Samnuha
* Gubaba

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
King Ashurbanipal is known for his library of cuneiform tablets. It was the largest collection of the books in the ancient world. Many masterpieces of ancient literature and many facts from ancient history are known to us from the documents of Ashurbanipal’s library. Also, the Assyrians are mentioned in the [[wikipedia:Bible|Bible]] as the people who conquered Israel over a hundred years before Judah's conquest. We can also see, in the Bible, that the Assyrians were conquered by the Babylonians, who conquered Judah later on.

== What is left of them today? ==
Assyrian people still live in northern Iraq, Syria,Palestine (specially Jerusalem) Jordan (Medaba), Australia, and the US. They speak Aramaic language and most of them are Christians.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Interesting outline, but use caution ==

It would be indeed interesting to see a full diagram that shows the heritage of all operating systems and what previous operating systems had a substantial influence on the subsequent design methologies for ease OS.

You had Microsoft Windows as a CP/M derivitive, but Windows NT has a much different history than Windows 98, even though technically you can run the same executable file on both and generally have it run the same (there are some special differences between the two, however.)  In this case Windows NT in many ways has heritage to both CP/M-86 and VMS (the OS for the VAX-11 and MicroVAX systems) in several aspects.  The fundimental kernel in Windows NT, however, is almost exclusively similar to VMS, with even the same variable names and naming conventions as VMS.  This is no coincidence as Microsoft hired some people from DEC to write the NT Kernel and adopted some of the ideas from the VMS kernel (with appropriate royalties to DEC as well).

OS/2 was written under the continum as having some code sharing with the early versions of Windows NT, and was a joint project between IBM and Microsoft.  The Portable Execution file format is even idental between the two operating systems, although it would be a mistake to believe that you can take an OS/2 executable and run it on Windows NT without some serious changes in the NT kernel.  The API layer is quite a bit different between the two.

Unix history is even more convoluted and substantial cross-pollination between different Unices was quite common, especially with the &quot;free&quot; Unix OS varities that shared just about everything between each other at least for basic ideas, and was often copied into propritary Unix systems as well.

Thanks for putting this together.  If you turn this into a genuine article rather than an outline, I'm willing to help out as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:07, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:Windows NT versions up to 4.0 were able to run OS/2 binaries. Especially in the early releases, NT has many references to OS/2. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:Microsoft licensed UNIX to create Xenix, a crummy UNIX for the PC. They then redid much of the DOS kernel using that code. This gave DOS version 2 support for directories, mount points (subst and join commands), and an environment variable that would allow UNIX-style &quot;/&quot; paths and &quot;-&quot; options. Thus Windows is a direct descendent of UNIX while Linux is not! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

Robert, thank you for your additions.

I completely forgot where VMS fit into everything. It's been maybe a decade since I read anything about it, but I recall an article comparing Unix -&gt; Plan 9 by Dennis Ritchie and VMS -&gt; NT by whomever was responsible for it. The OS/2 -&gt; NT relation, I discovered when I researched the joint development agreement for [[The Computer Revolution/Timeline]].

I do intend to expand on the historiography. I think that someone will eventually have to create a graphic we can upload, unless one can be found. Personally though, I'm more interested in the esoteric OSes like Smalltalk, LispM, Grasshopper and so on. Plan 9 is barely unconventional enough to hold my interest and things like Mach simply don't interest me. So the vagaries of a single OS (Unix) under random evolutionary development? Not my cup of tea, no matter how very topical it is. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 10:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Linux, QNX, and IBM OS's. ==

First I think it would be more correct to assign Linux its own heading.  While it looks and feels a lot like Unix, it is technically not.  The Kernel is similar in structure, but of course was written from scratch. Unix is a proprietary trademark, I believe still owned by AT&amp;T.  

With respect to QNX, there are actually three very different variants.  The authors rewrote it from scratch twice.  All versions share the similar architecture of a small message passing kernel and a Unix like programming and user interface. All three versions provide hard real time. Here is a short summary of the three.

; QNX 1-2(3):  A very early version that ran on 8088-486 processors. It was the least Unix like. It ran in real memory mode, and 286 protected mode. Networking was mostly limited to Arcnet.  Lack of support once version 4 appeared makes it hard to run on faster processors.  Version 3 was just a programming artifact indicating that the OS was running in protected mode.  Surprisingly enough, most load modules could run in either real or protected mode if there was enough memory.  The last versions supported a GUI called QNX Windows.  QNX 2 has been found to function reasonably well under various VM environments, although usually at the cost of real time performance.

; QNX 4, the first rewrite: Support was dropped for real mode.  Both 286 and 386 protected modes were supported.  The interface was Posix conforming. Networking was expanded to include ethernet, and other hardware.  The QNX Windows GUI was ported, but then a newer GUI &quot;Photon&quot; was added. X-Windows was also available. The OS supported only x86 processors and never supported SMP.  Instead the OS (like versions 1-2) had a very transparent resource model, later called VLAN.  

; QNX 6, the latest version:  The kernel was rewritten to be processor independent.  Support for SMP and threads was also added.  Support for a wide variety of processors is now available.

In the early 60's IBM built the 360 series of computers.  The unifying feature of this series was the machine language.  I'm not sure if IBM's TOS (Tape operating system) ran on this series.  If not, then it first appeared with DOS for Disk operating system.  This was commonly refered to as Dummy operating system  by programmers.  This was followed by a series of &quot;OS&quot; versions.  The variants I know of were OS/PCP (A single threaded OS for scientific computers), versions with a fixed number of partitions with fixed sizes, a fixed number of partitions of variable sizes, and then OS/VS1 which had both items variable.  This was followed by OS/VS2 and OS/MVS.  Initially programs were started by loading JCL (Job Control Language) punched cards into a card reader.  The JCL would specify which program, where to find it, and which I/O devices to access.  Files could be on Tape, Disk, punched cards, or other devices.  Output was often to high speed printers.  Later IBM added a terminal based progammer interface called TSO (Time Sharing Option).  This allowed programmers to submit jobs from a 3270 terminal.  The first of these terminals were B&amp;W (green actuall) had 25 lines x 80 columns, and were buffer oriented.  You entered data on the terminal and then pressed a SEND button, and waited for the results.  Later a fancier front end was put on top of TSO called SPF.  This included one of the first full screen text editors.  

On a parallel track, IBM built a meta-OS called VM.  VM virtualized the hardware, so it could run multiple OS's.  This was valuable to the business community because while hardware was replaced every few years, daily production programs were not.  A VM machine could be running DOS, and MVS simultaneously.  To provide progammer support, IBM included a special single threaded OS called CMS, so the system was often refered to as VM/CMS.  CMS was, like TSO accessed from 3270 terminals.

This takes us up to about 1980 where my knowledge of IBM OS's ends.

== Graph ==

I think that a timeline as tree is not sufficient to represent the OS-Timeline. What we need is a general graph - sadly MediaWiki has no support for general graphs.

Martin

== CP ==

The first multi-user operating system was CP short for control program it was the first operating system to be given Virtualization, which later became VM. Essentially what Virtualization allowed was for CP to run on CP, so that each terminal could be fooled into thinking it was running its own separate operating system. CP/M is actually a derivative for mini-computers so CP/M should be seen as a derivative of CP, rather than the start of derivatives for it's branch. There is some question in my mind if CP did not come before unix. I also added vista to the NT branch. It should also be known that Mac OSX was derived partly from the operating system of the CUBE which was a Unix variant.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 23:05, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

== Risc OS ==

In what way is Risc OS an [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Historiography#IBSYS derivatives|IBSYS derivative]]? [[:w:en:MIPS RISC/os|en:MIPS RISC/os]] doesn't indicate this to be the case. And [[:w:en:RISC OS|en:RISC OS]] isn't either. --[[User:Trevj|Trevj]] ([[User talk:Trevj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Trevj|contribs]]) 09:45, 3 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Inspiration''' establishes that the Bible is a divine product. In other words, Scripture is divinely inspired in that God actively worked through the process and had his hand in the outcome of what Scripture would say. Inspired Scripture is simply written revelation. &quot;Scripture is not only man's word, but also, and equally God's word, spoken through man's lips or written with man's pen&quot; (J.I. Packer, The Origin of the Bible, p. 31). 

The term comes from Latin and English translations of the Greek word theopneustos in 2 Timothy 3:16. The KJV renders it &quot;inspiration&quot;, while the RSV uses &quot;inspired of God&quot;. However, the word literally means &quot;God-breathed&quot;. 

==Important passages in the Bible==
2 Peter 1:19-21 (ESV) 
* And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. 
2 Timothy 3:16 (ESV) 
* All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.

==Four things inspiration is not==
1) The idea is not of mechanical dictation, or automatic writing, or any process which involved the suspending of the action of the human writer's mind. Such concepts of inspiration are found in the Talmud, Philo, and the Fathers, but not in the Bible. The divine direction and control under which the biblical authors wrote was not a physical or psychological force, and it did not detract from but rather heightened the freedom, spontaneity, and creativeness of their writing. 

2) The fact that in inspiration God did not obliterate the personality, style, outlook, and cultural conditioning of his penmen does not mean that his control of them was imperfect, or that they inevitably distorted the truth they had been given to convey in the process of writing it down. B.B. Warfield gently mocks the notion that, when God wanted Paul's letters written, 

He was reduced to the necessity of going down to earth and painfully scrutinizing the men He found there, seeking anxiously for the one who, on the whole, promised best for His purpose; and then violently forcing the material He wished expressed through him, against his natural bent, and with as little loss from his recalcitrant characteristics as possible. Of course, nothing of the sort took place. If God wished to give His people a series of letters like Paul's, He prepared a Paul to write them, and the Paul He brought to the task was a Paul who spontaneously would write just such letters (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible). 
3) Inspiredness is not a quality attaching to corruptions that intrude in the course of the transmission of the text, but only to the text as originally produced by the inspired writers. The acknowledgement of biblical inspiration thus makes more urgent the task of meticulous textual criticism, in order to eliminate such corruptions and ascertain what the original text was. 

4) The inspiredness of the biblical writing is not to be equated with the inspiredness of great literature, not even when (as is often true) the biblical writing is in fact great literature. The biblical idea of inspiration relates not to the literary quality of what is written, but to its character as divine revelation in writing. 

: ''The above four points are taken from J.I. Packer's &quot;The Origin of the Bible&quot;, p. 35-36''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This paper serves as an analysis of the contribution of Walter J. Ong, S. J. It serves as an overview of his work as it relates to the discipline of Communication. The chapter draws heavily from the work of Soukup (2004) and Farrell (2000) as their contribution to the scholar is impressive and thorough. Specifically, the chapter draws from the framework of contribution from Soukup’s (2004) article, which identifies Ong’s contribution in five specific ways throughout a 60 year academic career. In addition to Ong’s contribution to the discipline, the paper also serves to examine the influence wielded by Ong over his career on other scholars. It also serves to examine the influence peers on Ong’s career.

== An Historical Review of Ong ==

His background includes the following: B. A. in Classics (Rockhurst College, 1933); B. A. in Philosophy (St. Louis University, 1941); Theology degree (St. Louis University, 1948); M. A. in English (St. Louis University, 1941); Ph. D. in English (Harvard, 1954) (Soukup, 2004). The resume of degrees is worth mentioning because it provides a backdrop of the diversity of formal education that Ong had achieved throughout his lifetime. According to Wikipedia, Reverend Ong was, “a world-class thinker known today as an honorary guru among technophiles, was a Jesuit priest, professor of English literature, cultural and religions historian, linguist, and philosopher” (Retrieved September 30, 2005, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Ong). White (as cited in Farrell, 2000) further identified that Ong’s contribution to scholarship touched on five specific areas: literary studies, communication, theology and religious studies, psychology, intellectual history, and linguistics. The broad spectrum of knowledge produced by such a unique individual is what further promotes conversation about his influence and his legacy over time.

== Framing the Chapter ==

Ong’s many contributions to the discipline over his 60-year career cannot be easily condensed into a brief chapter. Soukup (2004) identified five specific parameters of his contribution that this chapter will adopt for framing purposes: historical studies of rhetoric; visual images and habits of thought; the word; stages of communication media; and finally, digital media and hermeneutics. These contributions tie into the study of communication. In addition to the work of Soukup, the chapter will also draw from the insight of Farrell (2000). Both scholars provide excellent commentary on Ong and his influence on communication and related disciplines. Interwoven within the chapter will be the mention of other scholars who were seen to be influences, peers, and understudies of Ong. The reality of Ong’s legacy is a strong testament to a solid career in scholarship.

== Ong and His Historical Studies of Rhetoric ==

In an interview with Soukup (personal communication, September 16, 2005) it is clear that the framed parameters of Ong’s contribution to the discipline are connected to the development of his academic career. It is important to note at this point that mapping Ong’s career academically through an historic paradigm would serve the reader best. One can get a better feel for the development of his thought processes over time as well as an understanding of those who influenced (or were influenced by him) along the way. A starting point would bring us to Ong’s examination of rhetoric through historical frames. Ong’s Harvard dissertation focused on scholar Peter Ramus (1515-1572), a 16th century Parisian professor and educational reformer (Soukup, 2004). While at Harvard, Ong focused on Ramus’ interest in the development of the printing press and his focus on the question of if we should be re-thinking the way in which rhetoric was taught. Soukup summarized Ong's focus on Ramus and his studies of rhetoric:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The study of Ramus plays a central role in Ong’s thinking about communication, one that extends far beyond the history of rhetoric. From classical times through the Renaissance, rhetoric defined not only how people spoke, but how people analyzed and solved problems. In many ways, because rhetoric more or less defined education, it defined, through education, the dominant ways of thinking. Several changes occurred shortly before or during Ramus’s lifetime. Ong noticed two key changes in western thought, manifest in Ramus’s writing: a shift away from rhetoric (with its emphasis on probable knowledge) to logic (with its emphasis on proofs and truth); a shift from hearing spoken argumentation to see a written demonstration. And Ong noticed how printing changed the school environment. It was here that Ong first made the connection between communication form (hearing, seeing), communication media, and thought processes. (2004, p. 4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ramus was a part of something that Ong found interesting. Western thought was making a transition away from rhetoric that could be seen in terms of logical probability in discussion, to logic that was grounded more in seeking concrete truth and proof for reasoning. A good resource concerning the history of rhetoric and Western thinking comes from the work of the editors Golden, Berquist, Coleman &amp; Sproule (2004). The text maps the development of rhetoric within a western context of thinking, providing a great overview of the history of rhetoric in the west.  Further, the idea of written demonstration as opposed to spoken argumentation was in some ways a shift of preference. A review of Ramist Rhetoric from Ong (1958a) demonstrated a sort of mapped explanation of the transition of rhetoric (specifically, Ramist Rhetoric is Chapter Twelve). Soukup (2004) mentioned it extensively. The transitional development of rhetoric in comparison to logic was anything but a source of absolute clarity. Farrell (2000) further noted that such an analysis from Ong was focused on the contrast of expression that dealt with both sound and sight. It would be foolish to consider the transition smooth and marked. The shift in cultural learning is one that mapped over time. It was more a process than a marked chasm or divide. Ong (1971a) stated that, “there is no total theoretical statement of the nature of either rhetoric or logic, much less their interrelation. Conceivably such a statement might finally be achieved at the end of history, when rhetoric and logic would be outmoded” (p. 7). Ong’s comment seemed more in line with the idea that hindsight and retrospect will have the final say when either of the approaches to knowledge and learning would seem obsolete.

Historically, Ramus derived a good deal of thought strongly relative to the transitional shift from that of logic to proof. In some respects, Ong saw Ramus as a product of the times in which he lived. Soukup (2004) commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ramus was above all a teacher and that shaped his approach to developing both his dialectic and his rhetoric in an age when printing changed the school environment. He lived at a time when science also changed the learning environment. (p.6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ong (1958a, 1958b) noted the transition of Ramus away from knowledge through the traditional form of instructional teaching to that of objects and diagrams. The thought of knowledge derived through diagrams and objects is the direction that Ramus seemed headed toward. Inclusive within this shift is the awareness of how we arrive at knowledge. The pedagogical shift here is important. In the transition, knowledge can be derived from the visual perspective as well as that of the oral perspective. Seeing diagrams, objects, and symbols in print to arrive at knowledge is what ultimately what Ong focused in on. Much of this can be attributed to the development an invention that rocked society in its ability to learn, distribute, and store knowledge in Ramus’s lifetime—the printing press. 

Printing was changing how people learned, and it was happening in Ramus’s lifetime. In terms of why Ong focused in on this particular aspect, something from his cultural/spiritual background began to emerge. Ong had a background in biblical studies (he was a Roman Catholic priest). He was interested with the difference in learning attributed to Hebrew culture and to Greek and Latin culture (P. Soukup, personal communication, September 16, 2005). Soukup commented on the idea that Hebrew culture was much more focused on sound and the spoken word. He further mentioned that the Greek and Latin culture of learning was more visual, focused on image. Ong focused in on how Ramus analyzed the transition away from oral as a primary form of comprehension to literate and the incorporation of visual images. Ramus became entrenched with the aspect of printing and was widely seen as a publishing and pedagogical guru (Soukup, 2004). This focus of transformation of knowledge became a continued theme that he would work closely with and develop further throughout his career. A brief quote from Ong (1968) made this apparent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have reached a period today when the accumulation of knowledge has made possible    insights of new clarity and depth into the history of knowledge itself. Growth of knowledge soon produces growth in knowledge about knowledge, its constitution, and its history, for knowledge is of itself reflective. Given time, it will try to explain not only the world but itself more and more. (p. 8)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ong's assessment of Ramus is exhaustive. It is strongly encouraged that if the reader finds a greater interest in this particular area of commentary, they should seek out Soukup’s (2004) article as well as a copy of Ong’s dissertation and additional commentary. His contribution to the examination of rhetoric is amazing. Ong was impressive in his analysis of Ramus and the contribution he made to the development of knowledge, primarily through a transition from orality to literacy via the significant development of the printing press. So powerful and striking was Ong’s analysis of Ramus that McLuhan (1962) cited him extensively in his influential book, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''. McLuhan is a central figure in the discipline, and was instrumental in guiding Ong in the move to Harvard where he pursued his Ph.D. in English. Refer to the work McLuhan (1962, 1964) and Neil (1993) regarding McLuhan, as he is widely instrumental in advancing the field.

The influence of Ong’s thoughts relative to the history of rhetoric can be felt even today. The work of Poster (2000), Moss (2004), Youngkin (1995), Kaufer &amp; Butler (1996) serve as examples of many scholars who have followed and contributed further to Ong’s assessment of rhetoric. There is much more that could be said regarding this section of Ong’s influence and scholarship. However, there is more that must be said in different areas regarding Ong’s influence in 60 years of work.

== Visual Images and Habits of Thought ==

Ong went on from his dissertation to leave a rather large impression on the discipline. As touched upon briefly in the commentary of his analysis of Ramus, Ong began to focus on the shift from oral to visual in learning. As Soukup (2004) notes, rhetoric shaped the thought process of society through its use in education. As a pedagogical tool, it helped people create and transmit knowledge. Over time however, the process of learning and obtaining knowledge and information began to look different. This section will focus on the transformation of learning and knowledge throughout time.

Over time, the way we learn has changed. Ong (1962a) was very interested in this, particularly when it came to analyzing a transformation of knowledge from that of spoken word to that of text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many ways, the greatest shift in the way of conceiving knowledge between the ancient and the modern world takes place in the movement from a pole where knowledge is conceived of in terms of discourse and hearing and persons to one where it is conceived of in terms of observation and sight and objects. This shift dominates all others in Western intellectual history, and as compared to it, the supposed shift from a deductive to an inductive method pales into insignificance. For, in terms of this shift, the coming into prominence of deduction, which must be thought of in terms of visual, not auditory, analogies—the ‘drawing’ of conclusions, and so on, not the ‘hearing’ of a master—is already a shift toward the visual and a preparatory step for induction, from which deduction was never entirely separated anyhow. Stress on induction follows the stress on deduction as manifesting a still further visualization in the approach to knowledge, with tactics based on ‘observation,’ and approach preferably through sight. (pp. 70-71)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Learning in the Western tradition shifted from being centered on discourse to observation and sight, bringing rhetoric and logic together. Rhetorical pedogogy relied on discourse and apprenticeship with a master teacher. The shift to observational approaches allowed for collective growth of knowledge, rather than reliance on a group of earlier &quot;masters.&quot; As the process of learning develops, the ability for those to not simply learn from a master, but to learn from observation and drawing conclusions promotes logic rather than discourse. Likewise, there evolves a shift in focus from the guiding teacher to the autonomous learner. This analysis was only one of a number of reformist critiques of education; such reforms are common throughout history. As Ong (1962b) pointed out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everybody today, it seems, wants to reform education. It would be interesting if this ambition were a mark of our times. But it is not, for an ambition to reform education is found in most of the ages known to civilization. (p. 149)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Ong analyzed Ramus in terms of the transition of knowledge from that of rhetoric to logic, there is a sense of understanding that knowledge framed in rhetoric must cause the learning culture to remember words. In other words, when cultures are primarily learning through words, the importance of holding to words is imperative. Havelock (1963), a contemporary of Ong, commented on repetition as of extreme importance in oral culture. Ong would agree with Havelock’s assessment (Soukup, 2004). When cultures emphasize rhetoric as the primary form of learning, it is of absolute importance that the words of importance be seized upon and remembered, for that is where learning takes place. An analysis of where Ong draws this transition of learning seems most prominent in the Renaissance (That this is a commentary on Western learning. The writer acknowledges a variety of other types of learning, but Ong’s commentary on the Renaissance focuses on Western learning). The main transition of learning that takes place here is one from the emphasis of recall to the ability to refer to text (Soukup, 2004). The emphasis on text as opposed to oral recall could serve to expand the base of knowledge in an exponential way. The process of communicating and retaining information was not about what one might be able to store within the individual mind, but the idea of referring to text as a source of information and knowledge truly served to change a culture making such a transition. This was the case of the Renaissance. Learning took on new forms of visual recognition and recall which Ong (1977a) elaborated on further and termed as being a sort of visual retrieval.

As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed. The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus. In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge. In a rather interesting sort of commentary, Ong (1977b) wrote about how our expression of words has changed to indicate that we are more of a visual culture. Soukup (2004) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ong summarizes the effects of visualism on thinking, going so far as to show its history in the vocabularies we use. As with rhetoric, the way we talk reveals, in some ways the way we think. His list of visual words ‘used in thinking of intellect and its work’ includes ‘insight, intuition, theory, idea, evidence, species, speculation, suspicion, clear, make out, observe, represent, show, explicate, analyze, discern, distinct, form, outline, plan, field of knowledge, object’ and many others. (p. 8)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of such words reflects the visual and logical frame of learning in Western society. The words are marked with visual representation of obtaining knowledge. They reflect a sort of mapping out that takes place in providing a framework of learning and comprehension. Realizing the thought process that goes into mapping this sort of differentiation in learning and fostering knowledge causes one to appreciate the mind that Ong possessed in coming to such a conclusion.

Faigley (1998) mentioned Ong and the works of others mapped to the development of visual thought and the dichotomy of oral versus visual. Within the article, Faigley cited the works of other scholars linked to Ong and this particular subject matter worth noting.  The work of Goody (1977), Goody &amp; Watt (1963), Innis (1951), and Havelock (1982) are worth noting. When it comes to idea of the communication and learning (particularly the development of the visual), Goody, Innis, and Havelock come up as well and could be seen as peers working in and around the same time as one another in these particular areas. The work attributed to the scholars above syncs well with the development of culture from oral (learning through sound) to literate (learning through sight and print), which is at the heart of Ong’s (1982) text.

== The Word ==

While much of the focus in the first couple of sections of this chapter focuses in on a sort of transformation from oral to visual, Ong maintained a steadfast appreciation for the importance of the word and what surrounds it. The sound associated with our use of words is still a focal point of scholarship. Ong was quite particular in focusing on words, their sound, and what they in fact seemed to reveal about the interior condition of the individual (Soukup, 2004).  Ong (1962c) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, indeed, no way for a cry to completely exteriorize itself. A mark made by our hand will remain when we are gone. But when the interior—even the physical, corporeal interior, as well as the spiritual interior of consciousness—from which a cry is emitted ceases to function as an interior, the cry itself has perished. To apprehend what a person has produced in space—a bit of writing, a picture—is not at all to be sure that he is alive. To hear his voice (provided it is not reproduced from a frozen spatial design on a phonograph disc or tape) is to be sure. (p. 28)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soukup (2004) pointed out the significance of the interior as it related to Ong. Essentially, the interior refers to what is happening within the individual. A glimpse of the interior can be revealed to us as a society through the words and sounds coming up from out of the individual. It may not completely reflect the condition within the individual, but it serves to give us insight. Ong’s commentary of the word is occurred during a period of time when other scholars were touching on similar ideas. Lord (1960) and Havelock (1963) were mentioned in Farrell’s (2000) commentary of Ong, seeing him as a sort of cultural relativist. Lord (1960) visited the issue of performance relative to storytelling in an oral tradition. Havelock’s (1963) work dealt with issues very similar to Ong and the word, but more applied to the area of poetics. Heavily entrenched in the work is an emphasis on the oral, which relates to Ong’s commentary about the word. Soukup (2004) mentioned that Ong (1962a) produced striking commentary on the human voice as being one of an invasion into the atmosphere. The thought of the voice and word through this line of thinking is one that is rather self-revealing. Essentially, the voice coming from out of the interior of the individual reveals something of that person. It is through such revealing that individuals connect with one another. This is an important aspect that Ong would not have us miss. This commentary of interiority and sound of the word probes the issue of authenticity. How something comes out is telling of the feeling or mood associated with the word. When considering prior Ong commentary relative to Ramus and the development of learning from sound to visual, it is interesting to see that Ong went back to the perspective of language and sound and stressed the importance of investigating sound associated with the word. This is a good reminder of the idea that sound is still a relevant and important point of study. While stressing that such focus is not semantics or wordplay, Ong acknowledged that while one can draw out a lot from the process and experience of communication through investigating sound, voice, word, and interiority, the fact that there could be more going on than what he could conclude is something that he sensed (Soukup, 2004). This area of focus for Ong revealed his linguistic side of scholarship. Given discipline cross-over in communication, it still serves as a relevant piece of discussion and contribution.

Further advancing the concept of word and sound, Ong began to draw from a couple of scholars (some already mentioned above) who would prove to be peers. The work of Havelock (1963) and Lord (1960) was mentioned earlier, but it is also worth noting Ong’s draw from McLuhan (1962) and Parry (1928). Soukup (2004) identified the contribution of such scholars to Ong’s work. Havelock (1963) reinforced Ong’s assessment of the development of learning in his analysis of Ramus. The idea that the transition of learning went from that of oral to written is something that Havelock noticed. From that, he commented on how that essentially changed the pattern of thought process. This idea ties back into Ong’s (1958a) assessment of the transitional development of rhetoric to logic. While the shift seemed to be a gradual one without an absolute mark of distinction, it still impacted the process of thought. Parry (1928) and Lord (1960) studied the process of thought and recall in poetics, the way in which Ong studied rhetoric (Soukup, 2004). Finally, as a testament to Ong earning the respect of fellow scholars, McLuhan (1964) drew heavily from Ong’s (1958a) work on Ramus. Mentioned briefly earlier in the chapter, McLuhan is widely seen as an influential scholar in the discipline of Communication. McLuhan, in some respects, was an influential factor in pushing Ong forward in his research endeavors. In tracing the scholarship of Ong, his input on the work of McLuhan (Ong, 1952) was substantial. McLuhan saw a good deal of potential in the work of Ong. He supervised Ong’s thesis and at the beginning of Ong’s (1958b) close follow-up to his dissertation, he pays tribute to McLuhan by writing, “For Herbert Marshall McLuhan who started all this” (dedication). While they were similar in age, McLuhan was seen as an influential factor in encouraging Ong in the direction that he did (P. Soukup, personal communication, September 16, 2005).

Ong continued further in his commentary on the word. As he probed the word and investigated further, Soukup (2004) pointed out that he introduced the concept of “the sensorium.” Essentially, this dealt with using human senses and experience to communicate. This was introduced by Ong (1967a) in what was known as his Terry Lectures at Yale University. The lectures (oral) were bound and put into print. In some respects, that statement is a humorous sort of irony. The focus of Ong (1967b) was to set apart the oral when considering human senses and communication. Ong further exercised a commentary about cultural awareness. He acknowledged the idea that when it comes to expression, specifically with the oral, it looks different within other cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cultures vary greatly in their exploitation of the various senses and in the way in which they relate to their conceptual apparatus to the various senses. It has been a commonplace that the ancient Hebrews and the ancient Greeks differed in the value they set on the auditory. The Hebrews tended to think of understanding as a kind of hearing, whereas the Greeks thought of it more as a kind of seeing, although far less exclusively as seeing than post-Cartesian Western man generally has tended to do. (pp. 3-4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this was the case for Ong in assessing Western culture, he clearly pointed out that not all cultures adhere to an oral standard of such importance.

Continuing with the word, there are two other aspects to touch on relative to Ong—the use of words and stages of communication consciousness. Ong’s focus on the use of words for debate and argumentation are worth noting. In some respects, an investigation of Ong and pedagogy reveals the setup of the education system with regard to debate and argumentation as being structured more for men than for women. Such an analysis makes sense when one considers the history of the system of Western education. As touched upon in Soukup (2004), Ong’s (1967a) work on the word revealed that people within oral cultures use words as a potential alternative to calling up arms against one another. In essence, words insert themselves into a sort of combat. One could draw from this the study of argumentation and debate. In many respects, this could be seen as and advantage to developing as an oral culture. For more commentary relative to this particular area, see Soukup (2004).

Communication and consciousness is the last area to touch upon in dealing with Ong and the word. In many respects, this is where one of Ong’s most famous works, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982) is considered. Ong noted the development of consciousness through stages within culture. Inclusive within this consciousness is the idea of knowledge and learning. How cultures develop in the area of consciousness is what Ong sought to provide commentary on in the text. Ultimately, Ong sees communication gradually developing from an oral stage into a stage of print. In his thought on Western society, Ong noted the development of a third stage of communication consciousness known as electronic communication (Soukup, 2004). Ong’s (1982) book is certainly popular, but does not provide an accurate picture of the vast amount of work covered over his career. Farrell (2000) noted that it does not serve to provide a general overview of the scholar. There is much more to his line of thought than simply this one text. While there are many to applaud the commentary of Ong in this particular text, there are also those who see it as lacking. Montenyohl (1995) took Ong to task, citing a sort of generalization about orality that was not comfortable to him as a scholar. Farrell (2000) defended Ong from Montenyohl’s criticism, citing that he was not sure that Montenyohl had done enough background research on Ong to provide just criticism of his work. With such a successful text as Ong’s (1982) was, it is hard for many not to simply read the text and see it as a fair representation of all of Ong’s work. To back Farrell, simply reading Ong (1982) does an injustice to the vast amount of work that he had contributed over a long career. While it is an excellent book and provides substantial commentary for discussion, Ong did much more as a scholar years before penning that text in the later part of his academic career.

An examination of the word relative to Ong deserves even further investigation. However, the goal of the chapter is to consider the impact of a particular scholar in communication, in terms of both scholarship and in influencing scholars. If the interest in Ong is peaked at this point, it is strongly encouraged that the reader investigates the work of Farrell (2000), Soukup (2004) for commentary.

== Stages of Communication Media, Consciousness, Digital Media and Hermeneutics ==

While mentioning the development of communication in stages in the prior section, there is further commentary that Ong produced. He became interested in the aspect of technology and its application to the idea of its particular stage in communication. There had been the development in Western culture from oral to literate, but what came next? Ong (1971, 1982) directed his focus to the concept of secondary orality. Soukup (2004) and Farrell (2000) touched upon this. The focus was directed toward mediums of communication in literate cultures like that of radio, television, and telephones in particular. Basically, one begins to examine the mediums of communication that are oral, but set within a literate culture. New forms of communication build on old forms. What is the effect? Ong was interested in such a question.

There are many scholars who have followed Ong in asking this question, specifically as it relates to secondary orality. Gronbeck (1991) examined the aspect of consciousness within a culture. He also examined rhetoric gets applied over different mediums, specifically focused on the idea of a one-to-many type of communication. Farrell (1991) examined the issue of secondary orality and consciousness. Silverstone (1991) developed a slightly different article relative to media studies in examining television, rhetoric, and the unconscious as it related to secondary oraltiy. Media Studies is an area of study that has taken a good look at Ong and secondary orality. In keeping with Media Studies, Sreberny-Mohammadi (1991) provided a unique perspective when examining the integration of media into Iran. Not only was the issue of media integration focused on, consciousness was part of the examination as well.

Consciousness is an area of focus as well, that ties into Ong. A number of scholars study consciousness and have, in some ways, been influenced by Ong. Swearingen (1991) looked at Ong’s contribution to Feminist Studies. Payne (1991) examined the consciousness of media and rhetoric while examining characterology. Finally, El Saffar (1991) examined the issue of consciousness as it related to language and identity.

The stages at which cultures developed were of particular interest to Ong. Regardless of the transition from one stage to another, Ong keyed in on questions of transformation, medium incorporation (specifically as it related to secondary orality), and consciousness.

As we conclude the areas of influence attributed to Ong, we close with one quite relative to the advent and exponential growth of new technology. Digital or computer-based communication was an area that caught Ong’s eye, particularly at the latter stages of his academic career. Soukup (2004) commented:
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Modern, electronic communications help us in yet another way to understand what is going on with texts. The sense of immediacy of electronics gives readers a sense of proximity to events reported. That too, occurs with texts. With a text that works well, readers enter into the text, ‘into the immediacy of the writer’s experience’ (p.499). But electronic communication also reveals that this immediacy is highly mediated and thus somewhat artificial. (pp. 18-19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soukup (2004) further noted that understanding code and speed of transmission helps us to understand how communication works in a digital realm. Many shy away from understanding transmission, which, ironically touches on the issue of consciousness (or lack of). Welch (1999) wrote about electronic rhetoric and new literacy as it specifically to computers and their implementation into society and looked at understanding their impact.

Most important within this final section is the issue of interpretation and comprehension. As we continue to emerge in an age of digital transmission of information, the word hermeneutics comes up continuously within Ong’s work. We have technologies growing at rather quick rates that transmit data digitally. While we understand much of what we see on the front end of a technology, the ability to understand how we arrive at transmitting such information is of importance for Ong. It is a challenge, but the process of encoding and decoding information is something to be interpreted and understood. Capurro (2000) focused on the subject of hermeneutics and the process of storage and retrieval of information. While understanding that a technological structure emerges in the subject of digital communication, Ong also noted that there is still a need to deal with social structure as well (Soukup, 2004). Essentially, understand the technology and understand social structure. The requirement to do so is interpretation. Soukup (2004) noted that the process of interpretation summarized much of Ong’s thoughts about communication. This has to do with everything, particularly in dealing with orality, literacy, secondary orality, and digital communication.

== Conclusion ==

The impact of Walter Ong is significant. Not only did he produce excellent scholarship in the areas mentioned above, he made a significant impact on scholars. From his early research of the history of rhetoric to his analysis of digital hermeneutics, his thoughts provoked further scholarship from those mentioned above. It is worth noting that many others have been influenced by the contribution of Ong. For the purpose of this chapter, the selection of scholars touched by his scholarship had to be limited. Refer to the references list below for further inquiry into the above concepts. With all that had been accomplished in his career, it is clear that Ong was clearly an influential scholar in the twentieth century. Further research continues in many areas relative to the trail paved by scholars like Ong.

There are many Web sites about bartending and especially mixed drinks.  Although much good information is on the Internet, a large grain of salt must be taken when it comes to recipes, especially cocktails.

Many Web sites such as iDrink, BarMeister, and DrinkMixer accept user submissions for drinks.  With this being the case, as with most recipes, users submit whatever they feel is their way of making the drink.  What this means is that the information is commonly wrong, being invented by the user.  This occurs for various reasons; either the user has no idea what he's talking about, or has put his own 'spin' on a drink.

{{Bartending:BookCite|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, Third Edition|0-312-25286-2}}
For quality assurance reasons, the WikiBook on Bartending tries to cite research from reputable sources very blatantly.  Reputable sources may include [[Bartending:Books:The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course]], [[Bartending:Books:Mr. Boston|Mr. Boston]], [[Bartending:Books:The Playboy Bartender's Guide|The Playboy Bartender's Guide (Deluxe Edition)]], or others.  Sections and pages may be headed with such citations, as this pragraph is.  Notice that both the name of the book, including its release edition, and the ISBN of the book are given.  The ISBN can be used to find the book on sites such as Amazon, or to have your local bookstore order it.

{{Bartending:Web warning}}
By contrast, Web sources are lumped together and warned about as a whole.  Above is shown a Web source warning box.  All such warning boxes lead back to this page.

{{Bartending:Field research}}
Finally, sometimes field research is used in the WikiBook.  Bartenders with first-hand experience may write or contribute to various sections of the WikiBook; or field researchers may explore bars and collect input from interviews with bartenders.  In this case, the information is much more trustworthy than a Web site, but still should be duly noted to have come from a human source.  In these cases, the field research tag above is used.  If no citation is given, then it can be assumed that the text is exclusively field research and collected knowledge; no Web sources are used, and the information comes from prior experience and possibly previously read literature that is not cited.

{{Bartending:BookCite|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, Third Edition|0-312-25286-2}}
{{Bartending:Field research}}
In some cases, a combination of research materials may be used.  For these cases, before the first paragraph containing such information, a combination of tags will be used.  This is shown above.

It should also be noted that these tags lose their meaning at the beginning of any new section.  The exception of this is when these tags appear at the TOP of the page; if they are at the top, it means the entire entry is based by default on the cited source primarily.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mixers''' are non-alcoholic ingredients in cocktails.  Mixers include things like grenadine, soda, non-liqueur syrups, and juices.

==Carbonated mixers and sodas==
Carbonated mixers are based on carbonated water.  Due to certain properties of gas-liquid solutions and gas solubility, carbonated water does not stay carbonated for long; it quickly goes flat.  Because heat decreases solubility of gases, and because an open container allows the pressure on top the solution to stay below the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide, you should always make sure carbonated mixers are kept in a keg or cold, closed bottle.

For soda fountains and soda guns (automated soda fountains), carbonated water is mixed for soda, colas, and tonic water by passing water through syrup and introducing carbon dioxide gas into the line from a pressurized tank.  This ensures that the carbonation is always fresh, not weak or flat.  Kegs usually come with a pump to allow them to be pressurized; you can purchase small pumps to replace soda bottle caps for the same reason, but they're rarely worth the effort except for very rarely used bottles.  Remember, gases evaporate from water under low pressure; high pressure fixes this.

For carbonated mixers in bottles, try keeping smaller bottles for mixers that are used slowly throughout the night; use bigger bottles only for really popular mixers that run out fast.  In either case, try to keep the cap on when not in use.

*[[Bartending/Mixers/Carbonated water#Club soda|Club Soda]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Cola-flavored soda|Cola]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Tonic water|Tonic water]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Citrus-flavored soda|Citrus soda]]

==Juices==
Whenever possible, use fresh squeezed citrus juices.  These juices degrade quickly after being squeezed, and cocktails will not have the expected flavour or balance with sweet and sour mix or commercial bottled juices.  For less easily made juices such as pomegranate or pineapple, the drink recipe is likely balanced for bottled juice, so feel free to use those, as long as they are 100% juice without added sweeteners or artificial flavourings.

* '''Cranberry juice'''
* '''Grapefruit juice'''
* '''Lemon juice'''
* '''Orange juice'''
* '''Pineapple juice'''
* '''Lime juice''': Lime juice is one of the most common juices found in classic cocktails, as its tart flavor is very effective at balancing sweet liqueurs like [[Bartending/Alcohol/Triple sec|triple sec]], and its character has a natural synergy with the aromatic botanicals of dry gin.  If used in a cocktail without a sweeter liqueur or juice, it is often sweetened with a small amount of simple syrup so as not to be unpleasantly tart.  Lime juice is also a bit inconsistent compared to other citrus juices, so one must be sure to taste a cocktail and balance for it before serving.
* '''Rose's lime juice''': Rose's is a lime juice cordial, with sugar and preservatives added.  It is a very specific flavor, which is often specified in Gimlet recipes.  However, given the current availability of fresh limes in most parts of the developed world, it should never be substituted in recipes calling for &quot;lime juice&quot;, only those calling for lime juice cordial or Rose's specifically.

==Syrups==
* '''Grenadine'''
* '''Peach nectar'''
* '''[[Bartending/Mixers/Simple syrup|Simple syrup]]'''
* '''Orgeat'''

==Bitters==
''Cocktail bitters'' (usually called just ''bitters'') are highly concentrated liquids with a strong bitter flavor. They are used as a flavoring agent in small quantities of drops or dashes. Though they are typically made with an alcohol base, they are not intended to be drunk on their own and are usually not considered an alcoholic beverage. Cocktail bitters should not be confused with bitter liqueurs such as Campari or Chartreuse, which are considered alcoholic beverages and can be drunk on their own. Though there are numerous formulations of bitters with a wide variety of flavors, the three most commonly used in cocktails are:
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Angostura bitters|Angostura bitters]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Orange bitters|Orange bitters]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Peychaud's bitters|Peychaud's bitters]]

==Other==

*Cream
*Ice
*Milk
*Water
*Egg White

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Something seem a bit off about the information in this chapter? You may be running Simple Finder, a severely stripped-down Finder that requires the Administrator (owner) of your computer to activate. Read the section in this chapter about the Simple Finder to find out more.}}
==Introduction==
Now that you've learned how to use the Dock, windows, palettes, and various other elements of the Mac interface, it's finally time to put your newfound knowledge to work and start to learn how to put your Mac to use in real-life situations. You'll start by learning how to use your first application, which is called the Finder.

The Finder is an application that lets you browse and manipulate all of the folders and files on your Mac, similar to &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; in Microsoft Windows. Since the Finder is so important, it gets special treatment:

*It's always running.
*You can't manually quit it; it quits only when you log out.
*You won't find it in the Applications folder along with all of your other applications.
*Its icon is permanently glued into the far left of the Dock.

This chapter will show you how to browse your Mac's disks, manipulate files, and even how to use Spotlight, Tiger's whiz-bang new search feature. If you have an appetite for advanced Finder tricks, see the next chapter.

==The Finder Window==
Look at your desktop, and find the icon for your internal hard drive. By default, this is called Macintosh HD, although this can easily be changed. Now double-click this icon. A brushed-metal window should appear containing your hard drive's contents.

This window is a Finder window, used to browse through the files and folders stored on your hard drive. Let's dissect a Finder window piece by piece.

[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Screen.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 1 - A Mac OS X Finder Window.]]


*'''Toolbar''' - Remember learning about toolbars in Chapter 2? The Finder window has a toolbar right under its title bar, containing the buttons and controls you need to use the Finder. You can even customize it, as you'll learn below.
*'''Sidebar''' - The Sidebar is a white column running along the left side of the Finder window, divided into two parts by a thin grey line. The upper part of the Sidebar provides links to important things like disks, networked computers, etc. As you insert disks, they automatically appear here. The lower part of the Sidebar displays quick links to folders of your choice. To add a folder, drag and drop it into the sidebar. To remove one, drag it out, and it will dissappear in a puff of smoke.
*'''Divider''' - Remember dividers from Chapter 2? In the Finder window, a thin metallic divider seperates the Sidebar from the Contents Pane. Grab and drag the dot in the middle to resize the two. Dragging to the left will make the contents pane larger but the sidebar smaller. Dragging to the right does the opposite. You'll feel the divider &quot;snap&quot; into position when it reaches a reccomended size.
*'''Contents Pane''' - The Contents Pane, the main white area to the right of the sidebar and seperator, shows the contents of the current disk or folder you're viewing.
*'''Status Bar''' - The Status bar is a metallic strip running along the bottom of the window. A snippet of text in the middle gives you a bit of information about the folder you are viewing, e.g. the number of items inside it and the available free space on the &quot;volume&quot; (disk) you are browsing. Symbols sometimes appear on the left side to indicate certain properties of the folder. You'll learn more about these in the next chapter.

==Getting Around==
Now that you know what the different parts of the Finder window are called, it's time to learn how to browse folders! Mac OS X, like most modern operating systems, keeps files in a nest of folders. While it takes a bit of practice to find your way around, the structure is actually much more logical than that of Microsoft Windows, once you learn how it works.

===Internal Hard Drive===
If you followed along with the section above, you should have double-clicked the icon on the desktop for your internal hard drive (called &quot;Macintosh HD&quot; by default). You are now looking at a window that contains the following folders:
*'''System''' - Marked with a big blue X logo, this very important folder contains all of the inner workings of Mac OS X itself. Since the files in here are so important to your Mac's operation, Apple has made most of its contents invisible.
*'''Library''' - Marked with a stack of books, this folder contains the fonts, screensavers, desktop pictures, graphics, and support files that all users share. Only enter this folder if you know what you're doing.
*'''Applications''' - Indicated by an &quot;A&quot; made out of various artist's tools, this folder contains the applications, or programs, that ''all users'' have access to. This also contains another folder called &quot;Utilities&quot;, which, oddly enough, contains all Utilities.
*'''Users''' - Marked by a few silhouettes of people, this folder contains a &quot;home folder&quot; for each account (covered in just a bit).

In addition, you may find one or two other folders:
*'''User Guides and Information''' - This contains a digital manual for your computer.
*'''Developer''' - Marked with a hammer, the Developer folder appears if you have installed Apple's &quot;Developer Tools&quot; for making Mac applications. It is not covered in this wikibook.

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If you are the administrator (owner) of your Mac, you can theoretically add your own folders directly inside your hard drive's window, but it's best not to.}}

===The Users Folder===
You can open any folder you see in the Finder by double-clicking on its icon. Double-click on the Users folder icon.

The Users folder contains a private folder for every user account set up on your Mac. These private folders are called &quot;Home Folders&quot;. The one for ''your'' account doesn't look like a folder at all: it looks like a little house, making it easy to spot in a crowd. There's one special folder in here, called Shared, which contains files available to ''all'' users. Remember to save files here if you want to make them available to all users of your Mac.

===Your Home Folder===
Double-click on your home folder, which looks like a house, to open it.

Your Home folder contains your very own private stash of files. While it can be viewed by other users, most of the folders inside it cannot. Apple includes nine folders for organizing your stuff, and assumes you will follow this organizational structure. The folders are:

*'''Applications''' - While it looks just like the Applications folder that is in your internal hard drive's window, it is in fact very different! The applications in this folder are for you and you only - other users can't see, much less use them.
*'''Desktop''' - This folder is a mirror image of your desktop: add a file to this folder, and it appears on your desktop. It also works in reverse: add a file to the desktop and it appears in this folder. Please note that inserted disks (which also appear on the desktop) do ''not'' also appear in this folder.
*'''Documents''' - This folder is for keeping word processor documents, presentations, spreadsheets, etc. Feel free to create your own organizational nest within.
*'''Library''' - Like the library folder in Macintosh HD, this contains the support files for your computer. However, ''this'' library contains the files needed only by your account.
*'''Movies''' - Keep your home movies and QuickTime clips organized in this folder. Like the Documents folder, you are encouraged to organize it any way you want.
*'''Music''' - This folder was intended to hold your digital music collection. If you have iTunes set to &quot;Keep iTunes Music Folder Organised&quot; and the path folder set to your Music folder, all the music in iTunes will be neatly organised by Artist and Album in a sub-folder. Otherwise it is mainly used for storing Garageband compositions. 
*'''Pictures''' - Like the music folder, the pictures folder is no longer very important now that Mac users keep photos in an app called iPhoto. These days, most people use the pictures folder for desktop backgrounds and pictures they didn't take themselves.
*'''Public''' - This is the only folder in your Home folder that other users can view. Use it to share files with other users. It also contains another folder, called Drop Box, which other users can drop files into but can't view themselves.
*'''Sites''' - This is used in running a website from your Mac, which is not covered in this wikibook.

==Using the Toolbar==
The Finder window's toolbar contains important buttons and controls you'll need to browse your Mac. By default, the toolbar has four buttons:

*'''Back/Forward''' - The Back Button allows you to go back to the last folder you were viewing in the window. For instance, if you are in your home folder and you open the &quot;Pictures&quot; folder, you can ''return'' to your home folder by clicking the back button. The Forward Button reverses the effect of the Back button and takes you to the folder you came &quot;back&quot; from.
*'''Window View Buttons''' - You'll learn about these three conjoined buttons later on.
*'''Action Button''' - This button menu with a gear on it shows a contextual menu for the selected file; the exact same menu you'd see if you were to right-click or control-click the file's icon itself.
*'''Search''' - This Spotlight-powered search field is amazingly good at finding files. It's discussed in the next chapter.

==Manipulating Individual Files==
As you use your Mac, you'll want to create your own folders and move files into them. This section explains how.
*'''Selecting''' - Click once on a file or folder's icon to select it. The selected file or folder appears highlighted. Some actions performed in the Finder are applied to the selected file.
*'''Opening''' - To open a file, simply double-click it.
*'''Moving''' - To move a file, simply drag and drop it from its current location to its new one. There are a few different ways to do this:
**If you have two Finder windows open at the same time, you can simply drag a file from one to the other. You can open extra Finder windows by choosing &quot;File &gt; New Finder Window&quot; (⌘N).
**If you drag and drop a file over a folder icon, then the file will be put ''inside'' the folder.
**If you drag a file over a folder icon and hold it in place (without dropping) for a few seconds, the folder will open automatically. This is because folders in the Mac OS are &quot;spring-loaded&quot;. You can repeat this multiple times to drag a file deeper and deeper into the file hierarchy without ever releasing the mouse.
*'''Making a New Folder''' - To create a folder inside the current one, choose &quot;File &gt; New Folder&quot; (⇧⌘N).
*'''Renaming''' - You can rename a file or folder by clicking once on its icon, then once on its name, typing a new name, and pressing return. 
*'''Duplicate''' - To make a duplicate of a file, click it and choose &quot;File &gt; Duplicate&quot; (⌘D).
*'''Deleting''' - To remove a file from your Mac, you must first put it in your Mac's &quot;Trash&quot; folder. To do so, drag and drop the file you wish to delete over the trash can icon glued into the far right side of the Dock. However, the file is still on your Mac. Read the note box below for more information.

{{Mac Note Box|The Trash is a temporary holding place for files that you want to delete. Much like a real trash can, you can fish out a file you want to take a look at again. However, the file is still taking up space on your disk. To view the contents of the Trash, click the trash can icon.  When you're sure you want to get rid of the Trash's contents forever, choose &quot;Empty Trash&quot; from the Finder menu, and it (and all other files in the Trash) will be removed from your Mac.}}

==Manipulating Groups of Files==
Sometimes it is convenient to manipulate a group of two or more files at the same time. All you have to do is select the group, and then perform the action as you would with a single file. These two tricks work no matter what:

*To select a contiguous group of files, click on the first file in a group, and then SHIFT-click the last file. Every file in between is automatically selected.
*To select a non-contiguous group of files, hold down ⌘ as you click on each file.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can combine tricks; for instance, you can hold down ⌘ and SHIFT at the same time to select multiple contiguous groups.}}

==Window Views and How to Use Them==
Using the toolbar's view controls, you can switch between different &quot;Window Views&quot;. These are different ways of visualizing files in the current folder. Each view also behaves differently, so you'll need to know how to interact with items in each one. 

===Icon View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Icon_View.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 3 - Icon View.]]
In Icon view, your files and folders are represented by a grid of pictures (called icons). Advantages of this view include the easier renaming of files and easy-to-see file types, but the disadvantage is that the large and colorful icons take up a lot of space, so you can't see as many files and folders on the screen at the same time. 

{{Mac Note Box|There's a  special way to select a group of files that works only in icon view. Click and drag a &quot;box&quot; around them (you must start dragging the box in the empty space between icons).}}

===List View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_List_View.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 4 - List View.]]
In list view, files and folders are displayed in a table. The rows in the table are different items, and columns are different types of information: the file's name, size, type, etc. While you can see much more information than other views, some find this view too dense.

You can organize the items in the table by any piece of information. Click on a collumn heading and the items will appear ordered according to that heading, which glows blue. An arrow inside the heading points to show that the items are either arranged from lowest to highest (A to Z) or vice versa; clicking the heading again reverses the order.

You can also see a folder's contents ''in the same window'' by clicking the flippy triangle next to its name. Nifty, eh? As always, double-clicking a folder will make it take over the entire window.

===Column View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Column_View.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 5 - Column View.]]
Column view is the most visible, to the user, aspect of Mac OS X's NeXTSTEP heritage. It helps you see the hierarchy of nested folders on your Mac in a way rather similar to how music is browsed on an iPod. At the far left is a column that shows a folder's contents. Clicking on a folder in this column creates another column to the right of the first, which displays the contents of that folder. You can continue as far as you like; the farther right the column, the deeper it is in your Mac's nest of files. Selecting a file will cause an information pane to appear in the next column, including a large preview.

Another advantage of column view is that you can move files easily between two folders. Just drag and drop from one column to another! As always, folders are &quot;spring-loaded&quot;, so you can move files with the utmost ease.

==Spotlight==
Spotlight, Tiger's most groundbreaking new feature, is an advanced search technology that can help you find files quickly. Unlike most desktop search features, it runs blindingly fast— almost as fast as you can type. It also searches inside the body of your files; that is, it can find that document you have hidden away by the word you know is inside it. You'll find Spotlight fields in many applications. Each one searches inside that application only. However, there is a way to search all files, regardless of which application they're in.

===The Spotlight Menu===
[[Image:Spotlight_Menu_Anemone.png|thumb|400px|Fig. 6 - The Spotlight Menu searching for Anemone.]]
At the far right side of the menu bar is the Spotlight menu, marked with a little white magnifying glass in a blue circle. This menu provides quick access to a system-wide Spotlight search field that is the equivalent of typing the same thing into every search field in Mac OS X and combining the results.

When you type a query, the results appear instantly. You don't even have to press enter! The results are automatically lumped together according to where they came from. The types are marked along the left side of the menu in grey text. Types vary, but include things like Folders, Mail Messages, Documents, Bookmarks, Images, Music, etc. There's also an item marked with &quot;Top Hit&quot;, indicating it best matches your criteria.

Simply click on an item to open it. If you want to see an item in its location, revealing where it is stored, hold down the ⌘ key while clicking an item.

You can control the Spotlight menu from the keyboard as well. Clicking ⌘-Space opens the Spotlight menu, and holding ⌘ selects the &quot;Top Hit&quot;.

===The Spotlight Window===
The Spotlight menu is great for displaying the top 20 results, but what if you want to dig deeper? This is when the Spotlight ''window'' comes in handy. In many ways, the Spotlight window works like the Spotlight Menu; it pools results from all Spotlight-enabled search fields throughout Tiger. However, the Spotlight window lets you view ''all'' results for your query, as well as manage the results much more powerfully. Let's take a look.

====Opening the Spotlight Window====
Opening the Spotlight window is easy enough. When you do a search in the Spotlight menu and want to see more results, choose &quot;Show All&quot;. The number listed next to &quot;Show All&quot; is the number of results you'll see in the Spotlight window.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can also open the Spotlight window by pressing ⌘⌥-Space.}}

====Using the Spotlight Window====
[[Image:Spotlight_Window_Anemone.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 7 - The Spotlight Window.]]
Now we'll break down the Spotlight window into parts, and cover each one as we go along.

=====Toolbar=====
The Spotlight window toolbar isn't much to look at. The toolbar contains a lone search field. As you type, progress spinner appears to indicate that Tiger is busy searching. The toolbar also displays the number of results once the search is complete.

=====Contents Pane=====
This main area contains all of the results for your query. The results are split into groups according to how you choose in the sidebar (explained below). These groups are marked by blue strips, and can be hidden and shown by using the flippy triangles on their left side.

Integrated into the right side of ''some'' of these blue strips are view controls, for choosing how you wish to view the items in a particular group. The views offered are:

*List - This button, marked by a stack of four horizontal lines, organizes items into a table, much like List View in the Finder. Each row shows (from left to right) the name of the item, the date it was last opened, the time it was last opened, and an &quot;i&quot; button for displaying a complete list of information and about the item, as well as a large icon or preview. As you can see in Fig. 7, this information is often quite extensive.

*Icon - This button, marked with a grid of four squares, lets you see previews of images and PDF files before opening them. Below each icon is the item name, date last opened, and time last opened.

*Slideshow - This button, marked with a &quot;play&quot; triangle in a square, displays all of the group's contents in a slideshow.

=====Sidebar=====
This white column that runs along the right of the Spotlight window lets you adjust what is searched and how it is displayed.

*Group by - This changes how the Spotlight window groups results. Kind shows the results Spotlight-menu style, and is the most popular option. Date groups files by when you last opened them, People groups files by who created them, and Flat List eschews groupings all together for a very confusing mess of files, in case you're into that sort of thing.
*Sort Within Group by - These options let you set how results are ordered within each group.
*When - The &quot;When&quot; section lets you narrow results down to a specific time you last opened the file. This comes in handy if you know you opened the file you're looking for yesterday.
*Where - Another handy option, the &quot;Where&quot; section lets you select where Spotlight should look for files. The options are your entire Computer, your personal Home folder, or any disk currently inserted.

==The Simple Finder==
If you have only two menus in your Menu Bar, your Dock contains very few items, and you are thoroughly confused about why nothing in this wikibook matches what you are seeing on your screen, then your computer's administrator (owner) has turned on the &quot;Simple Finder&quot; for you.  The Simple Finder is a drastically simplified version of the Finder, so you can forget pretty much all of this book. Differences between the two Finders are:

*The left side of the Dock contains open applications only (the Finder and the Dashboard are always running). Therefore, the left side of the Dock in the Simple Finder is not a Launcher; only a Switcher.
*As far as you're concerned, your computer has only three folders on it.
**My Applications - Your Mac's administrator has complete control over which apps you can use. This folder contains links to the apps which administrator has approved of.
**Documents - A place for all your files.
**Shared - This is the Macintosh HD &gt; Shared folder.
*All three of these folders are in the right side of your Dock. You can't move them.
*The Simple Finder has no scroll bars... instead, the Simple Finder has forward and back buttons to &quot;page&quot; through the contents of a folder.
*You cannot minimize or resize a Simple Finder window.
*You can only have one window open at a time.
*The Simple Finder has only two menus, both of which are sparsely populated with commands.
*The Simple Finder does not support Spotlight search or Smart Folders.
*There is no way to delete a file in the Simple Finder. Deletion requires an Administrator use the File menu option to upgrade to the standard Finder. The inability to delete a file rules out the use of Simple Finder for most of the people who could benefit from it such as the elderly, the young, and persons of all ages who may be overwhelmed by the complexity of OS X.

The Simple Finder would be fine for most kindergartners, if it allowed them to delete the files they created. In its current state, it is almost worthless. It should not be confused with the far more valuable Simple Finder UI that was introduced in Mac OS 8. It is true that even a working version of Simple Finder would still leave the user to face the complexities of Mail.app, Safari, and other OS X applications, but in practice many of these can be configured to be relatively approachable. Apple did do some work on Simple Finder for OS X 10.4, but it is clear that they are still far from matching the functionality of ten years ago.

Should we frickin' have a separate page for each juice?  I vote we have things like [[Bartending:Mixers:Grapefruit juice]] redirect to [[Bartending:Mixers:Juices#grapefruit]] to keep the semantics nice yet consolodate onto one page.

* I agree.  There's not much to say about them, might as well just put a little description on this page and link here from the recipes.  Of course, for most of them it might as well say &quot;squeeze it fresh; sweet and sour is awful&quot; [[User:Catscandal|Catscandal]] 10:55, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

* For now, I'm going to make the juices into a definition list, and make the individual pages redirect to the section.  Hope that works for everyone. [[User:Catscandal|Catscandal]] 11:25, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

I don't see why these can't just link to the relevant articles on Wikipedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The best way to understand torts is to know a bit of history of England.  When the Normans conquered England in 1066, they did not have the manpower to colonize and occupy the entire country.  Rather, the new king imposed his land system by appointing barons, and his legal system by appointing judges.  These judges would move from town to town (in &quot;circuit&quot;), hearing disputes and applying the king's law.  However, at the beginning, the king's law (or &quot;common law&quot;) was very skeletal.  If the dispute was not an area within the jurisdiction of the judge, then the judge could not decide the dispute.  The way to know if the dispute was an area within the jurisdiction of the judge was to read certain pre-approved &quot;writs&quot;.  If the writ described the circumstances of the dispute, then the dispute could be heard.  Each writ developed its own rules on how disputes of that kind should be resolved.

One of the most often used of these writs was known as &quot;trespass vi et armis&quot;.  That is, the defendant used physical force against the plaintiff.  As the king had a monopoly on the legal use of force, the king wished to punish anyone who used force without his authorization.

In the course of history, more writs were created and those that existed became more loosely interpreted, so that common law judges were able to hear almost any dispute.  However, the principle remained that common law judges hear certain types of disputes.  Each type of dispute has its own set of rules.

A tort, then, is an act committed by one person with negative consequences for another, and which fits in a certain category and judged according to the rules prescribed by the common law.  Types of torts include assault, battery, trespass to land, false imprisonment

Up until the 1930s, the only torts recognized in the common law were &quot;intentional torts&quot; (aka. &quot;direct torts&quot;).  An intentional tort meant that the plaintiff was the victim of a direct act by the defendant.  In 1932, a new tort was recognized in the common law world: negligence.  A direct act of the defendant was not a requirement for negligence; all that was required was that the defendant did something that he or she could have reasonably foreseen would harm the plaintiff.  Negligence has since become the most litigated tort.

In Quebec, which did not have a common law tradition, the avoidance of actions that the common law would define as torts are considered to be &quot;Obligations&quot;.  Every person has certain obligations, including the obligation to avoid causing harm to others and the obligation to honour contracts.  The Civil Code has a general provision requiring people to avoid harming others, as well as several specific obligations (e.g., parents are responsible for their children, employers for their employees, owners for their pets, etc.)  While this is a philosophically different way of approaching torts, and although the reasons judges give for their decisions are remarkably different in Quebec, the end results are strikingly similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Libel and Slander ==

Libel is the writing of something that one knows to be untrue or shows reckless disregard for whether it was true or not, which causes harm to the victim's reputation.  Slander is to do the same thing, only orally instead of in writing.  While separate torts, in Canada they are often conceptually brought together under the name of &quot;defamation&quot; or &quot;defamation of character.&quot;  

An essential element of defamation is that it brings the defendant into hatred, contempt, or ridicule.  Therefore, a third party must have heard or seen the defamatory material.  The defamatory material must be aimed at the plaintiff (e.g., &quot;all lawyers are incompetent&quot; would not be a defamation of any particular lawyer).  There must usually also be real harm to a reputation.  An imagined slight that only hurts the feelings of the victim, while causing no actual lowering of esteem in the eyes of others, is not defamation.

Another variation of defamation is the intentional speaking or writing of something that may be true, but with the sole purpose of causing harm to the victim's reputation.  For instance, revealing that the victim has a debilitating disease may be defamation, if it was done solely to hurt the person's reputation, can be defamation.  Therefore, &quot;truth&quot; is not always a complete defence to defamation in Canada (this is especially so in Quebec; other provinces are more likely to find truth to be a complete defence.)  


Another defence to defamation is privilege.  Some writing and speech has &quot;absolute privilege&quot;, that is, in no circumstances can the author be sued.  For instance, Members of Parliament have absolute privilege while in the House of Commons, as do court judgments.  &quot;Qualified privilege&quot;  is where the speech or writing is an honest opinion expressed for non-malicious reasons.  For instance, a financial adviser gives a negative assessment on a company based on faulty information that he nonetheless thought was accurate does not defame the company.  Closely related to &quot;qualified privilege&quot; is &quot;fair comment&quot;, where people are allowed to express honestly-held opinions on issues of public interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Private Nuisance ==
Nuisance is the frustration of someone's reasonable use of their property.  Nuisance can be any sort of interference.  For instance, a defendant can cause nuisance to the use of someone's house by playing music too loudly, putting obstacles to their entranceway, or causing foul odours to spread onto their property. 

The nuisance must be substantial and be an unreasonable interference.  These two criteria make nuisance one of the most context-specific torts.  A 60 decibel noise coming from the neighbours may or may not be a nuisance, depending for instance, on whether the neighbourhood was usually quiet or noisy, and whether the plaintiff used the property for sleeping or for drum practice.   

The simple fact that the defendant was &quot;there&quot; before the plaintiff is not a defence to nuisance.  If someone builds their home beside a factory, the smells and noise of the factory may still cause a substantial interference on the reasonable use of the plaintiff's house, depending on the facts.  Neither is &quot;lawful use&quot; necessarily a defence to nuisance.  The construction of a new factory near houses may be legal according to zoning laws, but may still constitute a nuisance to those houses.  Of course, the judge may take into account such things as the layout of the town in determining what constitutes a nuisance.  

The tort of nuisance is an interference is to someone's lawful use of property, not its ownership.  Therefore, a tenant of a building could sue for nuisance.  

In the case of a continued nuisance, the court may award a lump sum in advance as damages for future harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Glasses''' are used to serve drinks in. Below are outlined some of the different glass styles you may see.

==List of glasses==

====Beer====
*Pint: A standard, all-purpose beer glass with slightly tapered walls. Used primarily for English- and American-style lagers and ales ranging from light lagers to imperial stouts.  Pint glasses come in two sizes: Imperial 20 ounce (570 mL) or US 16 ounce (470 mL) pints.
*Pilsener: A long, narrow glasses with walls that taper towards the base. Used to consolidate volatiles and support delicate heads of pilseners and other lagers.
*Weizen: A large, curvaceous glass, bulbous near the mouth to support and showcase the heads of weizens and other wheat beers.
*Seidel: A German-style mug, often of great volume, with handles and thick walls to help maintain a cool temperature. An earthenware, ceramic, or metal version is called a stein.
*Tulip: A bulbous glass with a trumpeted mouth and short stem used to capture aromas and support large heads of artisanal Belgian ales. They are ideal for swirling beer to release volatiles. Many have etchings on the bottom of the inside of the glass to stimulate carbonation, aiding in head retention. A tulip glass may be substituted with an oversize snifter.
*Chalice or goblet: A wide-mouthed, bowl-like, stemmed glass, often with metal linings.  Used for serving Trappist ales and other abbey-style ales. Like tulip glasses, they are often etched to stimulate carbonation. Chalices may be substituted with an oversize red wine glass.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Brandy Snifter/Balloon====
Similar to a wine glass, the brandy glass has a shorter stem and a wider bowl. The purpose is opposite of the wine glass — the brandy glass is designed to be cupped in the hand to warm the brandy.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Snifter Glass (Brandy).svg|Brandy Snifter
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Casablanca Glasses====

Often referred to as 'Rocks' glasses, Casablanca glasses are used in professionally and domestically globally due to their sturdiness, versatility and cheap pricing. Their distinctive octagonal shape comes as a result of the mold involved in the fabrication process. Today Casablanca glasses are the go-to functional glass for the average bartender in place of fashion when preparing, mixing and serving beverages. They can come in a wide range of sizes but the most common being:

*5oz - Juices, Minerals and Dining
*7oz - Liquor Sipping Glass, Bomb Glass
*10oz - Versatile Glass, Often a Standard for Mixers, Half Pint Equivalent for Beers
*13oz - Also &quot;Cooler&quot; Glass, Traditionally Gin &amp; Tonic, Long Island Ice Tea or other Similar Cocktails
*15oz - Fits Well Into Most Boston Tins, Ideal for Large Drinks, Cocktail Preparation and Serving

&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/Gallery&gt;

====Cocktail====
*Martini
*Double cocktail
*Hurricane
*Margarita
*Poco/Piña Colada
*Champagne/Daiquiri saucer
*Whiskey Sour
*Zombie
''Cocktail'' and ''whiskey sour'' glasses are 4 fl oz (120 mL) glasses used for cocktails and whiskey sours.  Martinis and [[Bartending/Cocktails/Manhattan|Manhattan]]s are examples of cocktails that are served in a cocktail glass; these cocktails are prepared with ice and then strained into the 4 fl oz (120 mL) vessel. Similarly, Sours are prepared in ice and strained into a 4 fl oz (120 mL) sour glass.  The stems of these glasses allow the drinker to hold the glass without warming the contents.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Collins====
Collins glasses are straight-sided narrow glasses, traditionally wrought of frosted glass, primarily designed for long drinks (namely the fizz and Collins family of drinks), and typically holding around 10 fl oz (300 mL) each.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Collins_Glass.gif|Collins Glass
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Highball====
Highball glasses are tall, 8 or 9 fl oz (240 or 270 mL) glasses designed to hold highball drinks — iced drinks containing liquor along with water and/or a carbonated mixer. Highball glasses may in some parts also be known as a cooler or a slim jim.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Liqueur====
*Pousse-café
This type of liqueur glass has straight sides and is designed for drinks prepared using the pousse-café method.
*Irish Coffee
*Toddy Mug
*Absinthe or Pastis glass
*Specialty
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Two-absinthe-glasses.jpg|Swirl (left) and Pontarlier Reservoir (right) Glasses
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Lowball====
A 4-6 oz (120-180 mL) lowball glass is designed to hold iced drinks without additional liquids, such as various on-the-rocks drinks.

====Pint====
A large glass, typically used for beer and related drinks. It is often used as a mixing vessel by customers when a cocktail is not offered at the bar. For example the 'Cheeky Vimto'.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Port/London Dock====

====Punch Cup====
Small cup used to serve eggnog and other punches.
&lt;gallery&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Rocks/Old Fashioned====
Usually used for whiskeys and gin.  A perfect rocks glass has a perfect round bottom, and when the ice is dropped from the correct height a &quot;ting&quot; can be heard. Rocks glasses got their name as most of these drinks are served over ice (on the rocks).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Sherry====
Small, narrow stemmed glasses with a wider rim than a cordial glass.
Holds 2 ounces (60 mL).  Ideal for liqueurs and aperitifs.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Sherry Glass.svg|Sherry Glass
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Shot====
A shot glass is a small glass that holds approximately 1.5 oz (45 mL), made for drinks intended to be consumed in one quaff. Shots are also used as volume measurements in cocktail and espresso recipes. A jigger is a metal, hourglass-shaped measure; the larger cup of the jigger measures one shot, and the smaller, one ounce (30 mL). The shooter or double-shot is the shot glass's larger cousin, and holds three ounces (90 mL).

Image:Shooters Glass (Double).svg|Shooters Glass (Double)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Wine====
Although wine glasses can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes, they all consist of three primary elements: the bowl, the stem and the base. The base and stem serve to weight the glass and provide support for the bowl. Wine glasses are stemmed so the drinker's hand does not warm the bowl and thus the drink. The bowl is the primary distinguishing factor of wine glasses.  Different wines are best served in a specific style of glass so as to best release the aromas and flavors of the wine.

General Wine Glass Styles 
*Red wine
**Burgundy
**Bordeaux
*White wine
**Chardonnay 
**Champagne flute
:**In America this has 4-6oz (120-180 mL) volume; in Europe 210 mL-330 mL (7-11 oz.)

Riedel has designed an extensive collection of wine glass styles based on the characteristics of specific grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah or common blends such as Burgundy &amp; Bordeaux.  The designs are based on the theory that wine can be delivered via the shape of the bowl to the taste buds in a way to accentuate the flavors specific to the grape variety or common to a standard blend.  For blends that do not have a specifically designed glass the style designed for the predominate varietal in the blend is often used.  A number of other stemware companies have extended their lines beyond basic Red/White dichotomies as well into less common blends in a similar fashion.

'''Garnishes''' include things like fruit wedges and onions.

==Lemon slices==
A good supply of lemon slices is a must.Generally a slice of lemon is added to gin and tonics but can be requested for various other drinks.

==Lemon twists==
You should cut up at least one peel for lemon twists at the beginning of each night.

Generally, you won't need many more than a peel's worth if that much.  You should keep a few lemon wedges around as well, for the occasional lemony-fresh patron.

To use a lemon twist, twist the peel skin side down over the drink to release the essential oils into the drink and rub the skin side around the lip of the glass not the white part and drop it in the drink.

==Lime wedges==
Cut your wedges from a Persian lime, the most common type, not a key lime which is smaller and yellower.  The reason for this is because while they are similar, two different flavors are produced.  

Always keep your limes refrigerated to ensure the customer, or friend for that matter, is getting the best quality lime.  Also, cut the limes as you need them, not before hand.  Unless you know you are going to need a lot, cutting them fresh is a must.

==Cherries==
Use stemmed [[Bartending:Garnish:Maraschino cherry|maraschino cherries]], because they're easier to get out of the glass; some bar patrons may also enjoy tying the stems in knots inside their mouths.  ''Do not'' get cherries soaked in rum or other alcohols; make sure your cherries are alcohol-free, as even small bits of alcohol can be extremely dangerous for drinkers with alcohol allergies.

Keep a lot of cherries around.

==Orange Flag==
This is a cherry speared onto an orange slice. A &quot;sex on the beach&quot; uses this garnish as do many other mixed drinks.

==Olives==
Olives should be green, pitted, and without pimento.

If Martinis are very popular at your bar, you want to keep a good supply of olives in stock.

Nowadays it is common to find olives stuffed with different cheeses, such as [[Cookbook:Gorgonzola Cheese|gorgonzola]], blue cheese, and provolone. Jalapeño stuffed olives are also gaining popularity in the South-West region of the United States.

==Onions==
Small cocktail [[Bartending:Garnish:Onions|onions]], the size of marbles, are used for Gibsons.  Not many people order Gibsons; you should make sure you're prepared, but not over prepared.

==Orange slices==
[[Bartending:Garnish:Orange slices|Orange slices]] are another popular garnish.

==Mint Leaves==
Mint leaves are required to make certain mixed drinks such as a [[Mojito]] and a [[Mint Julep]]. Mint leaves should be fresh, wrapped in a damp papertowel and refrigerated.

==Spices==
Some drinks can use spices, such as cinnamon or nutmeg, as a garnish.  These are particularly common in dairy-based drinks, like egg nogs, white russians, and alexanders, among others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Readers,

I am a security researcher.....well more correctly white hat by day and black hat by night.
In my day job i fix bugs and make small enhancements to the software i am maintaining. Sounds
ok but not exciting does it ? .....with night comes the excitement ...when i light up in fornt of 
my laptop and do my security research. i never know how time flies by when i sit there and try and 
decode the mysteries of the security world. Its always always that i end up re-inventing the wheel 
but in my opinion its all about getting the basics straight before starting on the real job. 

I have coded everything from a silly connect() port scanner to an experimental worm 
which i proudly displayed as part of my final year project at IIT. I remember how proud i was
....to see that i had breathed life into this digital creature, which solely existed because
of me, its code a representation of my thought, both conscious and the sub-conscious. I could control it and it was my digital slave forced to do my bidding. Only a hacker can understand the true pleasure which one can derive out of a really &quot;cool&quot; hack. Of course there have been very few who have been appreciative of my work till now, largely because they understand nothing of it. The Indian internet
revolution has just begun and largely security unaware.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Effects of alcohol on the body==
'''Alcohol''' is a very potent and potentially dangerous drug. It affects many systems of the body, especially the nervous and excretory systems. These effects can be dangerous if alcohol is used in excess. However, there are a number of benefits to alcohol, so it is important to understand its effects before consumption. Refer to the wikipedia [[w:Effects of alcohol on the body|article]] for additional information but ultimately [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer|consult your doctor]] on health issues.

===Positive Effects===
Beers and wines have beneficial antioxidants in them. Non-alcoholic beers have become ever increasing in popularity, partially due to the fact that these benefits can be received without the effects of alcohol. Many people also find that alcohol and drinking are ways to relax and to socialize. These positive effects can easily be outweighed by excessive drinking, so it is important to remember moderation.

===Negative Effects===
Alcohol has a profound effect on the nervous system, and intoxication can result in severe degradation of one's ability to make sound decisions. Effects of these bad judgments can range anywhere from self injury to death of one's self and others. It is important to understand the dangers of alcohol, and of drinking in general. Beyond the short term effects of intoxication, there are dangers in general with drinking over long periods of time in excess. Prolonged drinking can lead to obesity, alcoholism, liver and kidney damage, brain damage, circulatory and heart problems, and many other dangers. Those who have allergies to alcohol face dangers vastly magnified in comparison to others and must regulate their alcohol intake accordingly.

In addition to alcohol, there are dangers with specific drinks and the way that they are prepared. Flaming cocktails can cause damage to those who attempt to ingest them, and can lead to fires that may harm others and property. Other dangers include broken glass from glasses or bottles, as well as other dangers not listed. It is important that one remains coherent enough to understand these dangers, as a lack of cognizance can only magnify these problems.

===Safe Usage===
By '''drinking responsibly''', alcohol can be served, enjoyed, and used safely. It is important to remain aware of one's alcohol tolerance, and to know when to move to non-alcoholic beverages. As well as knowing one's own tolerances, it is important to keep a designated driver. Driving after consuming alcohol is under no circumstances safe, even if one is under the legal limit for intoxication.

==Discontinuing service==
At the end of the night, it is important that bartenders stop selling alcohol before the time designated by the licence e.g. 3am. This of course depends on the bar's individual licence and/or special circumstances e.g. a festival. For example during the Edinburgh International Festival, Bars, Pubs and Clubs can have extended licences. 
Also it may also be necessary to discontinue service due to an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. There patrons must be politely  informed of these circumstances as much as is in the interest of the company.

==Serving a person already under the influence==
When bartending, precaution must be taken when serving customers that are already intoxicated or who are possibly below the age of consent. Each bartender must decide whether serving the customer more, or in fact any alcohol is responsible and legal.

Sushi rice, termed ''sushi meshi'' or ''shari'' in Japanese, is a key ingredient for sushi and a staple of Japanese cooking. It consists of short-grain rice dressed with seasoned vinegar called ''sushisu''. The rice is then cooled and dried for easy manipulation and to give a glistening appearance.

==Ingredients==

* 2 [[w:Gō_(volume)|Gō]] (300 g) of uncooked, washed, short-grain Japanese [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
(The Japanese measure their uncooked rice using a measurement called a Gō. This is roughly equivalent to 150 grams when used to measure Japanese rice. One Gō is also the standard size of a rice cooker's measuring cup)
* 400 mL of water
* 1 small sheet of ''[[Cookbook:Kombu|Kombu]]'' (optional)
* 1 metric tablespoon (15 mL) of [[Cookbook:Sake|Sake]] (optional)


Sushisu (Seasoned rice vinegar dressing):
:* 3 metric tablespoons (45 mL) of rice vinegar
:* 1 to 2 metric tablespoons (12 to 24 g) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (depending on how sweet you prefer it)
:* 1 to 1.5 metric teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Salt|sea salt]]

==Utensils==
* Rice cooker
* [[w:Hangiri|Hangari]] (rice barrel), ''optional''
* [[w:Shamoji|Shamoji]] (rice paddle), ''optional''
* [[w:Fukin|Fukin]] (cloth), ''optional''
* [[w:Sensu|Sensu]] (fan), ''optional''


===Procedure===
About 30 minutes before starting, fill the ''hangiri'' with water and let it stand. The water saturates the wood, which prevents the rice from sticking to it.

# Make the sushisu 
## Mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt.
## Heat the mixture in a sauce pan until everything is dissolved, but do not [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
## Set aside to cool.
# Cook the rice
## Rinse the rice. Put the rice in the cooking pot, half filled with cold water, and swirl it around with your hand. The water will turn chalky white. Carefully drain off the water, and repeat the process several times, until the water remains clear.
## Allow the rice to stand for 30 minutes. Some recipes say the rice should remain in the cooking pot submerged in its cooking water; others say to transfer it temporarily to a colander to drain.
## Add a 8cm-sized sheet of ''kombu'' to the cooking pot, and the sake if you are using it.
## Boil the water in the cooking pot.
## Remove the ''kombu'' from the cooking pot just as the water boils, and reduce the heat.
## Simmer the water and rice in the cooking pot for 20 minutes.
## Turn off the heat but do '''not''' remove cover from the cooking pot for 10 minutes (no peeking).
##: '''Note:''' A rice-cooker is often used instead of a cooking pot; these generally produce good, consistent results. The manufacturer's directions will generally be similar to the above.
# Add the dressing to the rice. The rice and sushisu should be mixed immediately after the rice is finished cooking with sushisu at room temperature.
## Transfer the rice from the cooking pot to the hangiri; if you do not have one, use a large bowl or [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]].
## Cut the sushisu gently into rice with the paddle, trying not to break the kernels. (For Western chefs: this &quot;cutting&quot; motion is similar to the [[cut-and-fold]] used for gentle treatment of egg whites.) When finished, the rice is evenly coated with the dressing, giving it a shiny appearance.
## Cover the rice with a cloth for a couple of minutes so the dressing is absorbed.
## Cool the rice to body temperature by fanning it, while continuing to cut it with the spatula. A traditional hand fan or modern battery-powered fan may be used. '''Note:''' Some sushi chefs prefer natural cooling, rather than fanning, and instead let the rice rest in the hangiri for fifteen minutes, then re-cut the rice, and continue with this process until the rice is cool.

According to some, the faster the rice cools, the better (but see above about natural cooling, which yields a slightly different texture). The rice is best if used quickly: you can use it to make sushi for a few hours; it certainly cannot be prepared a day early.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|Sushi rice]] (all of it prepared directly beforehand)
* Fish/vegetables (this may consist of either raw/smoked [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], etc or perhaps [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] or [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]])
* Sheets of [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]] (red algae [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] paper). 
* You must also have a makisu or [[Cookbook:Sushi Roller|sushi roller]] (bamboo sticks strung together with string)
* Wasabi paste, powders should say how to make them into paste.
* Water
* Plastic wrap, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside
* Sesame seeds, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside (optional)

==Instructions==

#Take the roller and place it on top of a cutting board.  If making inside out rolls with rice on the outside, make sure your makisu (roller) is completely wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap. this task is simple and effective in keeping rice from sticking to where it shouldn't and especially sanitation. Finally, put a sheet of nori shiny side down on top of the makisu.  lengthwise or longwise depends both on the roll and amount of ingredients are being rolled.
#Dampen your hands before applying the rice.  This will prevent clumping and the rice sticking to your hands, but may also make the rice less sticky, so don't go overboard.  Grab the rice with one hand and put a fistful on the center of the nori.  When spreading this, leave a 2 centimeter gap on the side parallel to the bamboo.  As a general rule, if you can't see the nori through the rice, you have too much. A 6mm layer has been recommended.
#If making an inside out roll, flip over the nori and rice quickly onto the makisu. So as the rice is now on the surface of the mat and the nori is facing you.
#Next place the primary ingredients in a row in the middle. Then, slowly use the roller to push the nori against itself (rolling it away from you), using your thumbs and heels of hands for stability. Be careful when you reach the row of ingredients, making sure that it goes underneath the roll rather than just being pushed along.
#When you reach the end of the nori sheet, use the roller to compact the roll a little, making sure the rice is making it all stick together. Trying to even out a bumpy roll is simple, and it's really just a matter of hand pressure. Don't squeeze too hard on the sides and don't flatten the roll from the top.  If you want to fix the ends of the roll, just poke about 1/2 an inch out from one side of mat and while gently holding it in place, press it with the heel of your hand a little. 
#Next remove the maki from the sushi roller, and put it on the cutting board below.  
#Before you cut, wet your knife every time to reduce sticking (don't do it sparingly this time).  This can be done using a sink, a large bowl, or a large plastic cup.  A knife with dimples supposedly works well for cutting sushi.  Slice the rolls from the inside out, into sections of 5, 6, or 8 (depending on roll).  Cutting from the inside first will ensure that all ingredients that shift shift towards the outside two pieces. For the rolls of 6 or 8, cut from the center, then put one roll behind the other, and cut each half in half.  If you were making an inside-out roll, you may wish to put on a line of sesame seeds primarily for garnish.
#Serve with soy sauce and something shallow for dipping.  You may also want chopsticks, pickled ginger, and wasabi if culture allows.  Sashimi, Miso soup, other sushi, or just general Japanese food is also often served alongside it.  Green Tea is considered the drink of choice to have with sushi.

==Things to remember about guest habits==
Don't be surprised if someone asks for wasabi with their soy sauce.  Although this might be rare or offensive in your culture, it's very common in North American and European cultures.  Also don't be surprised if someone eats it without chopsticks.  This is also very common, this time in east Asia.  Sushi was originally designed to be eaten that way, until someone discovered how yummy soy sauce made it taste, reducing its portability.  It's a clean way to eat maki (not for other types of sushi), you don't need to eat them with a fork or chopsticks.  This phenomenon is similar to some cultures eating pizza with their hands, others with a fork and knife.  It can be seen as unnecessary and idiotic, two good ways to eat food, or the sanitary and polite way.

==Common sushi rolls== 
[[Image:Sushi5.jpg|thumb|right]]
* California Roll: [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]] meat or imitation crab, [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]].

* Tuna Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], wrapped in [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Nori|seaweed]].  This same combination is used to make plain rolls with any other type of fish.

* Spicy Tuna Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], spicy sauce (mixture of Japanese [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and [[Cookbook:Sriracha|sriracha]])

* Kamikaze Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], [[Cookbook:Yellowtail|yellowtail]], spicy sauce

* Philadelphia Roll: [[Cookbook:Salmon|Salmon]] (either raw or smoked), [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]

* Cucumber Roll: Sliced cucumber.  Vegan.

* Egg Roll: Sliced Egg Yellow. Vegetarian.

I was given this recipe in college, roughly in late 1998.  My friend who was teaching me to make sushi, and taught me this.  I liked it as an appetizer to help introduce Japanese flavors to those who were not used to them. I've found success with it also as a type of sushi that those who are vegan, anti-seafood, or just squeamish will eat.  It's non traditional - but very good.  Please enjoy.

==Ingredients==
* 1/4 cup (60ml) fine shredded carrot
* 1/4 cup (60ml) thin julienned onion
* 1/4 cup (60ml) fine diced celery
* 1/4 cup (60ml) thin julienned daikon
* 2 tablespoons miso
* 2 oz (55g) sake
* 1/2 cup (120ml) water
* 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon wasabi
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) sushi rice
* 2 nori

==Procedure==
#In a wok or saucepan (I suggest a saucepan, personally) combine vegetables and sake. 
#Bring to a simmer and let cook until most of the sake is gone, stirring often. 
#Now add the water and miso, bring this to a simmer, and let it cook until the vegetables are soft (but not mushy) stirring often. 
#Next remove the vegetables from the pan and reduce the remaining liquid to a thick sauce consistency. 
#Pour the 'sauce' over the vegetables and mix thoroughly.  Let cool. 
#Mix in vinegar. 
#Evenly spread rice over nori, dab half the wasabi across each, then place the vegetable mix across this.  Roll tightly.

Should serve 3-4.

{{recipe}}

All [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] has rice in it, but not all sushi uses ''nori'' as a wrapper. ''Inarizushi'' (稲荷寿司, &quot;stuffed sushi&quot;) encloses the rice and filling in a pocket made of paper-thin [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelet]], [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], or a [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaf. What follows is the recipe for a version of the recipe which uses omelet(egg) as a wrapper instead of the traditional fried tofu (Japanese: abura a-ge).

==Ingredients==
* 4 extra-large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 teaspoons (8 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/8 teaspoon (1/2 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1 tablespoon (12 mL) cold water

==Utensils==
* mixing bowl
* mixing cup, for the cornstarch thickener
* [[Cookbook:Makiyakinabe Pan|makiyakinabe pan]] (a Japanese rectangular omelet pan), or a regular frying pan

==Procedure==
# Break the eggs into the bowl. Removing the egg white clinging to the yolk will make for a smoother and more uniform surface.
# Add the sake, sugar, and salt.
# Beat the mixture to produce a smooth, consistent texture, but not so much as to create a foam. If you accidentally get air bubbles, let the bowl sit for a few minutes while they pop.
# Dissolve the cornstarch in the water &amp;mdash; it will be closer to a paste than a fluid &amp;mdash; and then add it to the egg mix.
# Heat the pan over medium heat. If you are not using a non-stick pan, you will need to oil the surface.
# Pour three or four tablespoons (40 to 50 mL) of the egg mixture all at once onto the pan.
# Swirl the pan to spread the mixture thinly and evenly.
# Allow the mixture to cook until the edge start to dry out. Remove the pan from the heat, and let the egg mixture continue to cook for 30 seconds from the heat in the pan.
# Flip the omelet over and return the pan to the heat for 30 seconds.
# Remove the omelet from the pan, and allow it to cool.

You can store these omelets in the refrigerator for a few days.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|sushi rice]]
* topping
* [[Cookbook:Wasabi|Wasabi]] (as needed)
* nori (as needed)

==Procedure==
* For nigirizushi requiring a band of nori to hold the sushi together, cut the nori into strips about 1/4 inch wide and long enough to wrap around the finished sushi with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap.  Place one such strip on the preparing surface.
* Hand form the sushi rice into suitable sized sushi bases.  Generally, this means a rectangular block from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch long (2.5 cm to 4 cm), and 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch high (1.5 - 2 cm).  It takes considerable experience to form pleasing sushi bases by hand (beginners may find a plastic sushi mold helpful for forming the bases).  Wetting the hands in water prior to forming each sushi base keeps the rice from sticking to the hands.
* For nigirizushi requiring wasabi between the rice and topping, add a small dab of wasabi on the rice.
* Add the selected topping on top of the sushi rice.
* If nori is used, wrap one of the nori band ends up and over the nigirisushi topping firmly, so that it sticks to the rice and topping.  Wet the other nori band end with a small amount of water, and wrap it up and over the topping so that it overlaps the other nori end.  The water causes the nori ends to stick together.

==Common nigirizushis==
* Broiled eel: sushi rice, broiled eel, nori band. Top with eel sauce and bonito and/or sesame seeds.
* Salmon: sushi rice, salmon.
* Shrimp: sushi rice, shrimp.  Clean and butterfly the shrimp prior to using.
* Mackerel: sushi rice, mackerel.
* Tuna: sushi rice, tuna.

Hi,

thanks for showing me how to make the word a link to the vocab list. When I get time I'll probably use it extensively.

'''Gunkanmaki''' (battleship roll)

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|Sushi rice]]
* Topping
* [[Cookbook:Nori|Nori]]

== Procedure ==
# Cut nori into strips 1 inch wide and long enough to surround the desired sushi rice piece with at least 1 inch of overlap.
# Form the sushi rice into oval pieces.  A common size would be 1&quot; wide, 1 1/4&quot; inch long, and 1 inch high.  
# Start with one end of the nori band and surround the rice piece.  Wet the inside of the other end of the nori and press over the first end.  The nori will stick together this way.

==Common gunkanmakis==

* Uni (''sea urchin'') roe (eggs): roll sushi rice in nori.  Cut into serving sizes and stand up, add sea urchin roe on the top of each piece.

* Quail egg:  Form a small nugget of sushi rice.  The nugget should be approximately 1-1/4 inches long and 3/4 inches wide and 0.5 inches high (3.2 cm x 1.9 cm x 1.3 cm).  Take a piece of nori and cut it into a strip approximately 1-1/4 inches wide (3.2 cm) and 4.5 inches long (11.5 cm).  Roll the nugget in the nori.  The nori should create a band around the circumference of the nugget.  The band will be taller than the nugget and will thus form a cup-shape, where the nugget is the base of the cup and the nori is the sides of the cup.  Fill one side of the cup with fish roe (orange fish eggs) and fill the other side of the cup with one quail egg.  Serve and enjoy.

The change commands all select text to be removed, the end of which is indicated by a '''$'''. Insert mode is entered and new text overwrites or extends the text. When the &lt;ESC&gt; key is pressed to terminate the insert, any remaining original text is deleted.

Text deleted during a change is placed into the buffer, replacing any text already there. Buffered text can be retrieved by '''p''' or '''P'''.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''C'''
| Change from the cursor position to the end of the line. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5C''' changes 5 lines, the current line and the next 4 lines.
|-
| 
| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
| valign=top | '''c'''''M''
| Generally the same as '''d'''''M'''''i''', where ''M'' is any movement command.
|-
| valign=top | '''cc'''
| Change the current line. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5cc''' changes 5 lines, the current line and the next 4 lines.
|-
| valign=top | '''ce'''
| Change the current word. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5ce''' changes five words. '''c5e''' is the same as '''5ce'''.
|-
| valign=top | '''cw'''
| Exactly the same as '''ce'''. &lt;br&gt;
This command is inconsistent with the usual vi moving: '''cw''' and '''ce''' is the same as '''dei''' but '''dwi''' removes also the spaces until the next word.
|-
| valign=top | '''ct'''''c''
| Changes from the cursor position to the first instance of the character.
* '''cta''' changes text up and to, but not including, the first letter 'a'.
|-
| valign=top | '''cf'''''c''
| Changes from the cursor position to the first instance of the character (including the character ''c'').
|-
| valign=top | '''cG'''
| Changes from the start of the current line to the end of the file.
|-
| 
| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
| valign=top | '''s'''
| Change the character underneath the cursor. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5s''' changes 5 characters, the one under the cursor and the next 4.
|-
| valign=top | '''S'''
| Change the entire line. Same as '''ddO''' (uppercase letter &quot;O&quot;).
|}

=== Cut and Paste ===

The ''yank'' commands copy text into the ''vi'' buffer. Text is also copied into the buffer by delete and change commands. The ''put'' or ''place'' commands retrieve text from the buffer.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''yy'''
| Yanks the current line into the buffer. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5yy''' yanks five lines.
|-
| valign=top | '''Y'''
| Same as '''yy'''.
|-
| valign=top | '''yw'''
| Yanks from the cursor to the start of the next word into the buffer. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5yw''' yanks five words.
|-
| 
| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
| valign=top | '''p'''
| If the buffer consists of whole lines, they are inserted after the current line. If it consists of characters only, they are inserted after the cursor.
|-
| valign=top | '''P'''
| If the buffer consists of whole lines, they are inserted before the current line. If it consists of characters only, they are inserted before the cursor.
|}

=== Searching ===

Searching uses [[w:regular expression|regular expression]]s.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|}}
| Searches for the string, which could be a regular expression. Searching is from the cursor position downwards, stopping at the first match. If not found, it will continue from the start of the file to the cursor position.  The trailing slash character is optional.
* {{Vi/Pattern|abc|}} seaches for the first occurrence of ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|+}}
| Goes to the line after the one containing the search string.
* {{Vi/Pattern|abc|+3}} goes to the third line after the one containing ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|e}}
| Leaves the cursor on the last character of the string that ''pattern'' matched.* By adding '''+'''''num'' or '''-'''''num'' after '''e''' you can supply an offset in characters to where the cursor gets left.  For example: {{Vi/Pattern|foo|e+3}} will leave the cursor 3 characters past the next occurrence of '''foo'''.* By using '''b''' instead of '''e''' you can specify a character offset from the beginning of the matched string.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|'''\c'''''pattern''|}}
| Does a case insensitive search.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/RPattern|''pattern''|}}
| As {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|}} but searches upwards.  The trailing question mark character is optional.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/RPattern|''pattern''|-}}
| Goes to the line above the one containing the search string.
* {{Vi/RPattern|abc|-3}} goes to the third line above the one containing ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|n}}
| Repeat last search.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|N}}
| Repeat last search but in the opposite direction.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|f}}''char''
| Search forward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|F}}''char''
| Search backward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|t}}''char''
| Search forward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char'' and leave the cursor on the character before ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|T}}''char''
| Search backward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char'' and leave the cursor on the character after ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|;}}
| Repeat the last '''f''' or '''F''' search.
|}

=== Search and Replace ===

Search and replace uses [[w:regular expression|regular expression]]s and the Ex command {{Vi/Ex|:substitute}} &lt;small&gt;(short {{Vi/Ex|:s}})&lt;/small&gt; which has syntax similar to the [[w:sed|sed]] utility - which is not surprising [[w:sed|sed]], [[w:Ex (text editor)|Ex]] and [[w:Vi]] have common roots - the [[w:Ed (text editor)|Ed]] editor.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|.|''pattern''|''replacement''| }}
| Replaces the first occurrence of ''pattern'' on the current line with ''replacement''.* If ''pattern'' contains '''\(''' and '''\)''' they are used to remember what matched between them instead of matching parenthesis characters.  For example ''':.s/\(\d*\)-\(\d*\)/\2:\1/''' could match the string '''12345-6789''' and substitute '''6789:12345''' for it.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|.|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' on the current line with ''replacement''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|%|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' in the whole file with ''replacement''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|x,y|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' on lines ''x'' through ''y'' with ''replacement''.* For example: {{Vi/Replace|14,18|foo|bar|g}} will replace all occurrences of '''foo''' with '''bar''' on lines 14 through 18.
* The character '''.''' can be used to indicate the current line and the character '''$''' can be used to indicate the last line.  For example: {{Vi/Replace|.,$|foo|bar|g}}  will replace all occurrences of '''foo''' with '''bar''' on the current line through the end of the file.
|}
The following meta-characters have special meaning in the replacement pattern:
{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''&amp;'''
| Replaced by the text that matched the search pattern.
|-
| valign=top | '''\n'''
| Replaced by the text matching the search pattern between ''\('' and ''\)'', where ''n'' is in the range of 1 through 9 with ''\1'' being replaced by the match from the first set.
|-
| valign=top | '''\u'''
| Capitalize the next character (if the character is a letter).
|-
| valign=top | '''\l'''
| Lowercase the next character (if the character is a letter).
|-
| valign=top | '''\U'''
| Turn on capitalization mode, where all of the following characters are capitalized.
|-
| valign=top | '''\L'''
| Turn on lowercase mode, where all of the following characters are lowercased.
|-
| valign=top | '''\E'''
| Turn off capitalization or lowercase mode.
|-
| valign=top | '''\e'''
| Turn off capitalization or lowercase mode.
|}
For example '''.:s/\(foo\) \(bar\) \(baz\)/\u\1 \U\2\E \3/''' could match the string '''foo bar baz''' and substitute '''Foo BAR baz''' for it.

=== Mark Text ===

Marked lines can be used when changing or deleting text.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|m}}''m''
| Mark the current line with the letter.
* {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|a}} marks the current line with the letter ''a''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|'}}''m''
| Move to the line marked by the letter.
* {{Vi/key|'}}{{Vi/key|a}} moves to the line marked by ''a''.
|}

=== Screen Refresh ===

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''{{Vi/key|Ctrl-L}}'''
| Refresh the screen.

|-
| valign=top | '''z&lt;CR&gt;'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is at the top. Can be preceded by a line number.
* '''35z''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is at the top.
|-
| valign=top | '''/pattern/z'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is at the top.
|-
| valign=top | '''z.'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is in the middle of the screen. Can be preceded by a line number, in which case the line is at the middle.  The sequence '''zz''' also has the same effect.
* '''35z.''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is in the middle.
|-
| valign=top | '''/string/z.'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is in the middle.
|-
| valign=top | '''z-'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is at the bottom. Can be preceded by a line number, in which case the line is at the bottom.
* '''35z-''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is at the bottom.
|-
| valign=top | '''/string/z-'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is at the bottom.
|}

=== Others ===

{| cellpadding=5

|}

==vi Options==

All options are ''ex'' options, and so require an initial colon.

Default options may be placed into a file in the user's home directory called '''.exrc'''. Options in this file do not have the initial colon, e.g.
:'''set ic'''

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':set all'''
| Displays all the current settings.
|}

{| cellpadding=5 border
|-
|! Set on
|! Set off

| ''':set noignorecase'''&lt;br&gt;''':set noic'''
       &lt;td valign=top&gt;Ignore case. Makes searching case insensitive.
|-
| valign=top | ''':set list'''
       &lt;td valign=top&gt;''':set nolist'''

|-
| valign=top | ''':set hlsearch'''
| ''':set nohlsearch'''
       &lt;td valign=top&gt;Highlights searches matched by /term/. It's a visual aide.
|}

==ex Commands==
'''ex''' commands start with ''':''', which puts ''vi'' into ''last line mode'', entered on the last line of the screen. Spaces within the command are ignored.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':! command'''
| Executes the named operating system command and then returns to '''vi'''.
* ''':! ls''' runs the UNIX ''ls'' command.
|-
| valign=top | ''':sh'''
| Starts up a shell. '''exit''' returns to the '''vi''' session.
|-
| valign=top | ''':vi'''
| Exit ''last line mode'' and return to normal ''command mode''.
|}


=== ex line commands ===
These commands edit lines and have the following syntax:
# No line number, meaning work on the current line.
# With '''%''', meaning work on all lines.
# A pair of line numbers, such as '3,5' meaning work on lines 3 to 5 inclusive. Either number can be replaced with '''.''', standing for the current line or '''$''' standing for the last line. So '''.,$''' means from the current line to the end of the file and '''1,$''' means the same as '''%'''. Additionally simple arithmetic may be used, so '''.+1''' means the line after the current line, or '''$-5''' means 5 lines before the last line.


{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''co'''
| Copy, followed by the line position to copy to.
* ''':co 5''' copies the current line and places it after line 5.
** ''':1,3 co 4''' copies lines 1 to 3 and places after line 4.
|-
| valign=top | '''d'''
| Delete.
* ''':d''' deletes the current line.
** ''':.,.+5d''' delete the current line and the next 5 lines.
** ''':%d''' deletes all lines.
|-
| valign=top | '''m'''
| Move, followed by the line position to move to.
* ''':m 10''' moves the current line and places it after line 10.
** ''':1,3 m 4''' moves lines 1 to 3 and places after line 4.
|}

=== Mapping / Remapping vi Commands ===

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':map'''
| Create new command or overwrite existing in vi command mode.
* ''':map v i--{{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}}''' new command '''v''' will insert ''--'' and return to command mode. {{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}} is the escape character typed as &lt;CTRL-V&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;.
|-
| valign=top | ''':map!'''
| Create new command in both command and insert mode.
* ''':map! ;r {{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}}''' typing '';r'' in insert mode will return to command mode.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== About BEER ===

'''BEER''' stands for '''Block Extensible Exchange in REBOL'''.
It is a framework to implement application protocols and solves the encapsulation, extensibility, and flow control problems.
'''BEER''' is essentially a [http://www.rebol.com REBOL] implementation of the
[http://www.beepcore.org BEEP Protocol] plus additional features.

BEER offers simple framing, robust flow control, asynchrony and extensibility through profiles which permit direct implementation of the semantics of the problem domain.

It was inspired by IETF RFC 3080 and 3081, and it is fully asynchronous allowing for non-blocking user-interfaces.

Each API is called a '''Profile'''.

[http://polly.rebol.it/test/test/beer/BEER-SDK/BEER/docs/API.html Principles and API of BEER foundation] are documented here.

==== Async Operation ====

BEER can give you fully asynchronous operation, which means you can do GUI operations and networking operations simultaneously.

Division is not commutative.  That means usually a ÷ b is not equal to b ÷ a, and can be demonstrated simply by example.

&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 2 \ne  \frac 2 1 &lt;/math&gt;

While division itself is not commutative, there ''are'' two special cases where the answer is the same if you reverse the order of operation.  These cases occur when the answer (quotient) is 1 or when the answer is -1:

&lt;math&gt;
a \div b = b \div a \iff \mbox{(rewrite as fractions)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac a  b = \frac b a \iff \mbox{(multiply both sides by} \ ab)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = b^2 \iff \mbox{(take both square roots)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a = \sqrt{b^2} \quad\mbox{ or }\quad  a = -\sqrt{b^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a = b \quad\mbox{ or }\quad a = -b 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a \div b = 1 \quad\mbox{ or }\quad a \div b = -1 
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measurement is among the most important tasks in bar-tending and due to the diverse systems of measurement around the world perhaps the most confusing for a project such as ours. This page lists common liquid measurements in terms of fluid ounces and their metric equivalents.

: (*) The &quot;dash&quot; and &quot;splash&quot; are variable measurements with no formally agreed upon definition.
: (†) A &quot;shotglass&quot; is usually 1.5 ounces, but sometimes 2 ounces with a measuring line at 1.5 ounces. You can also buy (in US) &quot;short shot&quot; glasses or &quot;pony shots&quot; which are 1 ounce. Pony shots are usually used with martinis, manhattans, and rob roys.


===Dash and fill===
Some recipes call for a small amount or &quot;dash&quot; to taste. A dash can be loosely defined as 1/6 teaspoon or about 1 mL, essentially the smallest amount one is able to pour from a dasher (a device which fits in the mouth of a bottle to slow the flow of liquid) or dasher bottle (a bottle equipped with such a device).

When instructed to 'fill' with a given spirit or mixer it is presumed that you are working in a glass of the given size and should, after adding the cocktail's other ingredients, 'top off' or fill the glass as instructed. If your recipe lists no specific glassware it ''may'' assume a standard highball glass of eight to ten ounces.

It is important to know the difference between a baseband signal, and a broad band signal. In the Fourier Domain, a baseband signal is a signal that occupies the frequency range from 0Hz up to a certain cutoff. It is called the baseband because it occupies the '''base''', or the lowest range of the spectrum.

In contrast, a broadband signal is a signal which does not occupy the lowest range, but instead a higher range, 1MHz to 3MHz, for example. A wire may have only one baseband signal, but it may hold any number of broadband signals, because they can occur anywhere in the spectrum.


{{Wikipedia| Baseband}}

== Wideband vs Narrowband ==
in form of frequency modulation.
wideband fm has been defined as that in which the modulation index normally exceeds unity.

Consider a situation where there are multiple signals which would all like to use the same wire (or medium). For instance, a telephone company wants multiple signals on the same wire at the same time. It certainly would save a great deal of space and money by doing this, not to mention time by not having to install new wires. How would they be able to do this? One simple answer is known as '''Time-Division Multiplexing'''.



== Time Division Multiplexing ==

{{wikipedia|Time-division_multiplexing}}

'''Time-Division Multiplexing''' (TDM) is a convenient method for combining various digital signals onto a single transmission media such as wires, fiber optics or even radio. These signals may be interleaved at the bit, byte, or some other level. The resulting pattern may be transmitted directly, as in digital carrier systems, or passed through a modem to allow the data to pass over an analog network.
Digital data is generally organized into frames for transmission and individual users assigned a time slot, during which frames may be sent. If a user requires a
higher data rate than that provided by a single channel, multiple time slots can be assigned.

Digital transmission schemes in North America and Europe have developed along two slightly different paths, leading to considerable incompatibility between the networks found on the two continents.

BRA (basic rate access) is a single digitized voice channel, the basic unit of digital multiplexing.


:::[[Image:BRA_comparison.gif]]


:::[[Image:digital_transmission_systems.gif]]


===North American TDM===

The various transmission rates are not integral numbers of the basic rate. This is because additional framing and synchronization bits are required at every multiplexing level.


:::[[Image:north_american_TDM.gif]]


In North America, the basic digital channel format is known as DS-0. These are grouped into frames of 24 channels each. A concatenation of 24 channels and a start bit is called a frame. Groups of 12 frames are called multiframes or superframes. These vary the start bit to aid in synchronizing the link and add signaling bits to pass control messages.

{{wikipedia|Digital_Signal_1}}


:::[[Image:DS_framing.gif]]


====S Bit Synchronization====

The S bit is used to identify the start of a DS-1 frame. There are 8 thousand S bits per second. They have an encoded pattern, to aid in locating channel position within the frame.


:::[[Image:s_bits.gif]]


This forms a regular pattern of 1 0 1 0 1 0 for the odd frames and 0 0 1 1 1 0 for the even frames. Additional synchronization information is encoded in the DS-1 frame when it is used for digital data applications, so lock is more readily acquired and maintained.

For data customers, channel 24 is reserved as a special sync byte, and bit 8 of the other channels is used to indicate if the remaining 7 bits are user data or system control information. Under such conditions, the customer has an effective channel capacity of 56 Kbps.

To meet the needs of low speed customers, an additional bit is robbed to support sub-rate multiplexer synchronization, leaving 6 x 8 Kbps = 48 Kbps available. Each DS-0 can be utilized as:

::• 5 x 9.6 Kbps channels or
::• 10 x 4.8 Kbps channels or
::• 20 x 2.48 Kbps channels.
In the DS-2 format, 4 DS-1 links are interleaved, 12 bits at a time. An additional 136 Kbps is added for framing and control functions resulting in a total bit rate of 6.312 Mbps.


====Signaling====

Signaling provides control and routing information. Two bits, called the A and B bits, are taken from each channel in frames 6 and 12 in the multiframe. The A bit is the least significant bit in each channel in frame 6, and the B bit is the least significant bit in each channel in frame 12. This provides a signaling rate of 666 2/3 bps per channel.

The quality of voice transmission is not noticeably affected when 2% of the signal is robbed for signaling. For data, it may be a different story. If the data is encoded in an analog format such as FSK or PSK, then robbing bits is of no consequence, but if the data is already in digital form, then robbing bits results in unacceptable error rates. It is for this reason that in North America, a 64 Kbps clear channel cannot readily be switched through the PSTN. This means that data customers are limited to 56 Kbps clear channels. This simple condition has a profound effect on the development of new services such as ISDN. In most facilities, the A and B bits represent the status of the telephone hook switch, and correspond to the M lead on the E&amp;M interface of the calling party.


====ESF====

CCITT has modified the North American digital hierarchy for the deployment of ISDN, by means of recommendation G.704. ESF consists of 24 DS-0
channels in a frame, but groups them into a 24-frame multiframe instead of the usual 12-frame multiframe.

The S bit is renamed the F bit, but only 1/4 of them are used for synchronization. This is possible because of improvements in frame search techniques and allows more signaling states to be defined.

Bit robbing is still used for signaling over an ESF link, but with the advent of ISDN, it will not be permitted. Instead, channel 24 is used to support a D channel.


:::[[Image:ESF.gif]]


====Typical T1 CPE Application====

The large telecom carriers are not the only ones who deploy high-speed TDM facilities. In many cases, heavy users of voice or data services can reduce their transmission costs by concentrating their numerous low speed lines on to a high speed facility.

There are many types of T1 multiplexers available today. Some are relatively simple devices, while others allow for channel concatenation, thus supporting a wide range of data rates. The ability to support multiple DS-0s allows for easy facilitation of such protocols as the video teleconferencing standard, Px64.


::[[Image:T1_mux.gif]]


====Multiplexers====

Multiplexing units are often designated by the generic term M&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; where'' a'' is input DS level and ''b'' is the output DS level. Thus, an M13 multiplexer combines 28 DS–1s into a single DS–3 and an M23 multiplexer combines 7 DS–2s into a single DS–3.


::[[Image:M13_mux.gif]]


====ZBTSI====

ZBTSI (zero byte time slot interchange) is used on DS–4 links. Four DS-1 frames are loaded into a register, and renumbered 1–96. If there are any empty slots [all zeros], the first framing bit is inverted and all blank slots are relocated to the front of the frame. Channel 1 is then loaded with a 7-bit number corresponding to the original position of the first empty slot. Bit 8 used to indicate whether the following channel contains user information or another address for an empty slot.

If there is a second vacancy, bit 8 in the previous channel is set, and the empty slot address is placed in channel 2. This process continues until all empty positions are filled.

The decoding process at the receiver is done in reverse. Borrowing 1 in 4 framing bits for this system is not enough to cause loss of synchronization and provides a 64 Kbps clear channel to the end-user.


===European TDM Carriers===

European systems were developed along slightly different principles. The 64 Kbps channel is still the basic unit, but signaling is not included in each channel. Instead, common channel signaling is used. In a level 1 carrier, channels 0 and 16 are reserved for signaling and control. This subtle difference means that European systems did not experience the toll fraud and 56 k bottlenecks common to North American systems, and they experience a much larger penetration of ISDN services. 

::[[Image:European_TDM.gif]]

::[[Image:E1_frame.gif]]

==Zero Substitutions==

In order to prevent transmission systems from loosing lock on the data stream, it is necessary to avoid long strings of zeros. One of the most effective ways of doing this is to replace the zeros with a predetermined code. This substitution must be done in such a way that the receiver can identify it and strip it off before passing the data stream to the client.

AMI provides a simple means of detecting substitutions. In the normal course of events, alternate marks are inverted. Therefor, deliberately inducing a bipolarvariation at the transmitter can alert the receiver of a substitution. However, a single violation is indistinguishable from a transmission error. Consequently, some additional condition must also occur.

There are two common methods to create a second condition:

:· Create a second bipolar violation in the opposite direction, within a specified time. This has the effect of keeping the average signal level at zero.
:· Count the number of marks from the last substitution to predict the next type of violation


===B6ZS===

B6ZS (binary six zero substitution) is used on T2 AMI transmission links.

Synchronization can be maintained by replacing strings of zeros with bipolar violations. Since alternate marks have alternate polarity, two consecutive pulses of the same polarity constitute a violation. Therefore, violations can be substituted for strings of zeros, and the receiver can determine where substitutions were made.

Since the last mark may have been either positive (+) or negative (-), there are two types of substitutions:


::[[Image:B6ZS substitutions.gif]]


These substitutions force two consecutive violations. A single bit error does not create this condition.


::[[Image:B6ZS_example.gif]]

===B8ZS===

This scheme uses the same substitution as B6ZS.


:: [[Image:B8ZS_substitutions.gif]]

===B3ZS===

B3ZS is more involved than B6ZS, and is used on DS–3 carrier systems. The substitution is not only dependent on the polarity of the last mark, but also on the number of marks since the last substitution.


::[[Image:B3ZS_substitutions.gif]]

::[[Image:B3ZS_example.gif]]


===HDB3===

HDB3 (high density binary 3) introduces bipolar violations when four consecutive zeros occur. It can therefore also be called B4ZS. The second and thirds zeros are left unchanged, but the fourth zero is given the same polarity as the last mark. The first zero may be modified to a one to make sure that successive violations are of alternate polarity.

::[[Image:HDB3_substitutions.gif]]


HDB3 is used in Europe. Violation, or V pulses are injected after three consecutive zeros. The fourth zero is given the same polarity as the last mark. In the event of long strings of zeros occurring, a succession of single polarity pulses would occur, and a dc offset would build-up.

To prevent this, the first zero in a group of 4, may be modified to a 1. This B or balancing pulse assures that successive violations are of alternate polarity.

::[[Image:HDB3_waveform.gif]]



===Block Code Substitution===

These schemes operate on bytes rather than a bit at a time. Some transmit the signal as binary levels, but most use multi-level pulses. Some authors categorize these as line codes.

A binary block code has the designation ''n''B''m''B, where ''n'' input bits are encoded into ''m'' output bits. The most common of these is the 3B4B code.


::[[Image:3B4B_coding.gif]]


In Europe 4B3T, which encodes 4 binary bits into 3 ternary levels, has been selected as the BRA for ISDN. In North America, 2B1Q which encodes 2 binary bits into 1 quaternary level has been selected for BRA.


::[[Image:2B1Q_coding.gif]]


Some block codes do not generate multilevel pulses. For example, 24B1P or 24B25B simply adds a P or parity bit to a 24 bit block.

== Benefits of TDM ==

TDM is all about cost: fewer wires and simpler receivers are used to transmit data from multiple sources to multiple destinations. TDM also uses less bandwidth than Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) signals, unless the bitrate is increased, which will subsequently increase the necessary bandwidth of the transmission.

== Synchronous TDM ==

Synchronous TDM is a system where the transmitter and the receiver both know exactly which signal is being sent. Consider the following diagram:

 Signal A ---&gt; |---| |A|B|C|A|B|C|   |------| ---&gt; Signal A
 Signal B ---&gt; |TDM| --------------&gt; |De-TDM| ---&gt; Signal B
 Signal C ---&gt; |---|                 |------| ---&gt; Signal C

In this system, starting at time-slice 0, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal A; starting at time-slice 1, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal B; and starting at time-slice 2, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal C. In this situation, the receiver (De-TDM) needs only to switch after the signal on each time-slice is received.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data flow of each input connection is divided into units where each input occupies one input time slot. Each input connection has a time slot alloted in the output irrespective of the fact whether it is sending data or not.

       A -----|A3|A2|A1|---&gt; |---| .............|C3|B3|A3|C2|B2|A2|C1|B1|A1|   |------| ---&gt;  A
              |  |  |  |                        |        |        |
       B -----|B3|B2|B1|---&gt; |MUX| -------------|--------|--------|----------&gt; |De-MUX| ---&gt;  B
              |  |  |  |                        |        |        |
       C -----|C3|C2|C1|---&gt; |---|              |        |        |            |------| ---&gt;  C
                    &lt;--&gt;                                 &lt;--------&gt;
                   Bit Interval                       Frame (x seconds)

Sync TDM is inefficient when one or more input lines have no data to send. Thus, it is used with lines with high data traffic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sampling rate is same for all signals.
Maximum sampling rate = twice the maximum frequency all the signals.

== Statistical TDM ==

Synchronous TDM is beneficial because the receiver and transmitter can both cost very little. However, consider the most well-known network: the Internet. In the Internet, a given computer might have a data rate of 1kbps when hardly anything is happening, but might have a data rate of 100kbps when downloading a large file from a fast server. How are the time-slices divided in this instance? If every time slice is made big enough to hold 100Kbps, when the computer isn't downloading any data, all of that time and electricity will be wasted. If every time-slice is only big enough for the minimum case, the time required to download bigger files will be greatly increased.

The solution to this problem is called '''Statistical TDM''', and is the solution that the Internet currently uses. In Statistical TDM, each data item, known as the payload (we used time-slices to describe these earlier), is appended with a certain amount of information about who sent it, and who is supposed to receive it (the header). The combination of a payload and a header is called a '''packet'''. Packets are like envelopes in the traditional &quot;snail mail&quot; system: Each packet contains a destination address and a return address as well as some enclosed data. Because of this, we know where each packet was sent from and where it is going.

The downside to statistical TDM is that the sender needs to be smart enough to write a header, and the receiver needs to be smart enough to read the header and (if the packet is to be forwarded,) send the packet toward its destination.



===Link Utilization===

{{Wikipedia|Queuing_theory}}

Statistical multiplexing attempts to maximize the use of a communication path. The study of this is often called ''queuing theory''.  A queue is simply a line of customers or packets waiting to be served. Under most circumstances, the arrival rate is unpredictable and therefor follows a random or Poisson distribution pattern, whereas the service time is constant.

The utilization or fraction of time actually used by a packet multiplexing system to process packets is given by:


::[[Image:Utilization.gif]]


The queue length or average number of items waiting to be served is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{{\rho ^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}} + \rho &lt;/math&gt;


::[[Image:Queue_length.gif]]


::'''Example'''

::A T1 link has been divided into a number of 9.6 Kbps channels and has a combined user data rate of 1.152 Mbps. Access to this channel is offered to 100 customers, each requiring 9.6 Kbps data 20% of the time. If the user arrival time is strictly random find the T1 link utilization.

::'''Solution'''

::The utilization or fraction of time used by the system to process packets is given by:


::::&lt;math&gt;\rho  = \frac{{\alpha NR}}{M} = \frac{{0.2 \times 100 \times 9.6 \times 10^3 }}{{1.152 \times 10^6 }} = 0.167&lt;/math&gt;


::A 24 channel system dedicated to DATA, can place five 9.6 Kbps customers in each of 23 channels, for a total of 115 customers. In the above statistical link, 100 customers created an ''average'' utilization of 0.167 and were easily fitted, with room to spare if they transmit on the average 20% of the time. If however, the customer usage were not randomly distributed, then the above analysis would have to be modified.


This example shows the potential for statistical multiplexing. If channels were assigned on a demand basis (only when the customer had something to send), a single T1 may be able to support hundreds of low volume users.

A utilization above 0.8 is undesirable in a statistical system, since the slightest variation in customer requests for service would lead to buffer overflow. Service providers carefully monitor delay and utilization and assign customers to maximize utilization and minimize cost.

== Packets ==

Packets will be discussed in greater detail once we start talking about digital networks (specifically the Internet). Packet headers not only contain address information, but may also include a number of different fields that will display information about the packet. Many headers contain error-checking information (checksum, Cyclic Redundancy Check) that enables the receiver to check if the packet has had any errors due to interference, such as electrical noise.

== Duty Cycles ==

Duty cycle is defined as &quot; the time that is effectively used to send or receive the data, expressed as  a percentage of total period of time.&quot; The more the duty cycle , the more effective transmission or reception.

We can define the pulse width, &amp;tau;, as being the time that a bit occupies from within its total alloted bit-time ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. If we have a duty cycle of ''D'', we can define the pulse width as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = DT_b&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \tau \le T_b&lt;/math&gt;

The pulse width is equal to the bit time if we are using a 100% duty cycle.</text>

== Data Coding Theory ==

I have started a new outline for a book that will serve as a continuation of this one, [[Data Coding Theory]]. The new book will cover a number of topics specific to binary data encoding, for the purposes of error correction, spectrum spreading, interference reduction and immunity, etc... This new book is an outline only right now, and will likely not be introduced onto a bookshelf for a long time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:03, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Cleanup ==

I went through and cleaned up this book alot today. I flattened out the book so that we don't have nested page names. This makes linking easier and cleaner. I also went through, and made sure that every page has at least 4 headings in it. If a page has less then 4 headings in it, it won't automatically generate a table of contents. More importantly, if we don't have 4 things to say about a subject, I think the page becomes a good candidate for merging. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== Book split, addition of new material, etc ==

I would like to split this book into two books, [[Communication Systems]], which will be mostly theoretical, and [[Communication Technology]] that will reference the first book to discuss actual implementations and communication standards/protocols. '''Section 5''', '''section 6''', '''section 7''', and '''section 8''' will be split out into the new book. To replace these sections, we will expand the area of data coding, and include new information on channel equalization, adaptive filters, and even some basics of analog signal processing (perhaps the start to a new book in it's own right). If nobody objects to this motion, I would like to start on it this winter break. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

This page will discuss the OSI Reference Model

== OSI Model ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 ! Layer !! What It Does
 |-
 ! Application Layer
 | The application layer is what the user of the computer will see and interact with. This layer is the &quot;Application&quot; that the programmer develops.
 |-
 ! Presentation Layer
 | The Presentation Layer is involved in formatting the data into a human-readable format, and translating different languages, etc...
 |-
 ! Session Layer
 | The Session Layer will maintain different connections, in case a single application wants to connect to multiple remote sites (or form multiple connections with a single remote site).
 |- 
 ! Transport Layer
 | The Transport Layer will handle data transmissions, and will differentiate between Connection-Oriented transmissions (TCP) and connectionless transmissions (UDP)
 |-
 ! Network Layer
 | The Network Layer allows different machines to address each other logically, and allows for reliable data transmission between computers (IP)
 |-
 ! Data-Link Layer
 | The Data-Link Layer is the layer that determines how data is sent through the physical channel. Examples of Data-Link protocols are &quot;Ethernet&quot; and &quot;PPP&quot;.
 |-
 ! Physical Layer
 | The Physical Layer consists of the physical wires, or the antennas that comprise the physical hardware of the transmission system. Physical layer entities include WiFi transmissions, and 100BaseT cables.
 |}

== What It Does ==
{{Wikipedia|OSI model}}

The OSI model allows for different developers to make products and software to interface with other products, without having to worry about how the layers below are implemented. Each layer has a specified interface with layers above and below it, so everybody can work on different areas without worrying about compatibility.

== Packets ==

Higher level layers handle the data first, so higher level protocols will touch packets in a descending order. Let's say we have a terminal system that uses TCP protocol in the transport layer, IP in the network layer, and Ethernet in the Data Link layer. This is how the packet would get created:

1. Our application creates a data packet
:|Data|

2. TCP creates a TCP Packet:
:|TCP Header|Data|

3. IP creates an IP packet:
:|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

4. Ethernet Creates an Ethernet Frame:
:|Ethernet Header|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

On the receiving end, the layers receive the data in the reverse order:

1. Ethernet Layer reads and removes Ethernet Header:
:|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

2. IP layer reads the IP header and checks the CRC for errors
:|TCP Header|Data|

3. TCP Layer reads TCP header
:|Data|

4. Application reads data.

It is important to note that multiple TCP packets can be squeezed into a single IP packet, and multiple IP packets can be put together into an Ethernet Frame.

== Network layer ==
=== Introduction ===
Network Layer is responsible for transmitting messages hop by hop.  The major internet layer protocols exist in this layer.  Internet Protocol (IP) plays as a major component among all others, but we will also discuss other protocols, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
Network layer does not guarantee the reliable communication and delivery of data.

=== Network Layer Functionality ===

Network Layer is responsible for transmitting datagrams hop by hop, which sends from station to station until the messages reach their destination.  Each computer should have a unique IP address assigned as an interface to identify itself from the network.  When a message arrives from Transport Layer, IP looks for the message addresses, performs encapsulation and add a header end to become a datagram, and passes to the Data Link Layer.  As for the same at the receive side, IP performs decapsulation and remove network layer header, and then sends to the Transport Layer.  The network model illustrates below:

[[Image:Network Layer.jpg]]

''Figure 1 Network Layer in OSI Model''

When a datagram sends from the source to the destination, here are simple steps on how IP works with a datagram travels:

# Upper-layer application sends a packet to the Network Layer.
# Data calculation by checksum.
# IP header and datagram constructs.
# Routing through gateways.
# Each gateways IP layer performs checksum.  If checksum does not match, the datagram will be dropped and an error message will send back to the sending machine.  Along the way, if TTL decrements to 0, the same result will occur. And, the destination address routing path will be determined on every stop as the datagram passes along the internetwork.
# Datagram gets to the Network Layer of destination.
# Checksum calculation performs.
# IP header takes out.
# Message passes to upper-layer application.

[[Image:IP Characteristic.jpg]]

''Figure 2 IP Characteristic in Network Layer''

In Network Layer, there exist other protocols, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), but, however, IP holds a big part among all.  

[[Image:IP Network.jpg]]

''Figure3 Internet Protocol in Network Layer''

In addition, IP is a connectionless protocol, which means each packet acts as individual and passes through the Internet independently.  There is sequence, but no sequence tracking on packets on the traveling, which no guarantee, in result of unreliable transmission.

== Introduction ==

It turns out that many wires have a much higher bandwidth than is needed for the signals that they are currently carrying. Analog Telephone transmissions, for instance, require only 3 000 Hz of bandwidth to transmit human voice signals. Over short distances, however, twisted-pair telephone wire has an available bandwidth of nearly 100000 Hz!

There are several terrestrial radio based communications systems deployed today. They include:

* Cellular radio
* Mobile radio
* Digital microwave radio

Mobile radio service was first introduced in the St. Louis in 1946. This system was essentially a radio dispatching system with an operator who was able to patch the caller to the PSTN via a switchboard. Later, an improved mobile telephone system, IMTS, allowed customers to dial their own calls without the
need for an operator. This in turn developed into the cellular radio networks we see today.

The long haul PSTNs and packet data networks use a wide variety of transmission media including

* Terrestrial microwave
* Satellite microwave
* Fiber optics
* Coaxial cable

In this section, we will be concerned with terrestrial microwave systems. Originally, microwave links used FDM exclusively as the access technique, but recent developments are changing analog systems to digital where TDM is more appropriate.


===Fixed Access Assignment===

Three basic methods can be used to combine customers on to fixed channel radio links:

* FDMA - (frequency division multiple access) analog or digital
* TDMA - (time division multiple access) three conversation paths are time division multiplexed in 6.7 mSec time slots on a single carrier.
* CDMA - (code division multiple access) this uses spread spectrum techniques to increase the subscriber density. The transmitter hops through a pseudo-random sequence of frequencies. The receiver is given the sequence list and is able to follow the transmitter. As more customers are added to the system, the signal to noise will gradually degrade. This is in contrast to AMPS where customers are denied access once all of the frequencies are assigned code division multiple access [digital only]


::::[[Image:Fixed_assgnment_access.gif]]

== What is FDM? ==

{{Wikipedia| Frequency-division_multiplexing}}

'''Frequency Division Multiplexing''' (FDM) allows engineers to utilize the extra space in each wire to carry more than one signal. By frequency-shifting some signals by a certain amount, engineers can shift the spectrum of that signal up into the unused band on that wire. In this way, multiple signals can be carried on the same wire, without having to divy up time-slices as in Time-Division Multiplexing schemes.In analog transmission, signals are commonly multiplexed using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), in which the carrier bandwidth is divided into subchannels of different frequency widths, each carrying a signal at the same time in parallel

{{info|Broadcast radio and television '''channels''' are separated in the frequency spectrum using FDM. Each individual channel occupies a finite frequency range, typically some multiple of a given base frequency.}}

Traditional terrestrial microwave and satellite links employ FDM. Although FDM in telecommunications is being reduced, several systems will continue to use this technique, namely: broadcast &amp; cable TV, and commercial &amp; cellular radio.


===Analog Carrier Systems===

The standard telephony voice band [300 – 3400 Hz] is heterodyned and stacked on high frequency carriers by single sideband amplitude modulation. This is the most bandwidth efficient scheme possible.

::::[[Image:Single_voice_channel.gif]]

The analog voice channels are pre-grouped into threes and heterodyned on carriers at 12, 16, and 20 kHz. The resulting upper sidebands of four such pregroups are then heterodyned on carriers at 84, 96, 108, and 120 kHz to form a 12-channel group.

Since the lower sideband is selected in the second mixing stage, the channel sequence is reversed and a frequency inversion occurs within each channel.

::::[[Image:12_channel_group.gif]]


This process can continue until the available bandwidth on the coaxial cable or microwave link is exhausted.

::[[Image:Analog_carrier_systems.gif]]


In the North American system, there are:

* 12 channels per group
* 5 groups per supergroup
* 10 super groups per mastergroup
* 6 master groups per jumbogroup

In the European CCITT system, there are:

* 12 channels per group
* 5 groups per supergroup
* 5 super groups per mastergroup
* 3 master groups per supermastergroup

There are other FDM schemes including:

* L600 - 600 voice channels 60–2788 kHz
* U600 - 600 voice channels 564–3084 kHz
* L3 - 1860 voice channels 312–8284 kHz, comprised of 3 mastergroups and a supergroup
* L4 - 3600 voice channels, comprised of six U600s

== Benefits of FDM ==

FDM allows engineers to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously over the same channel, at the expense of bandwidth. To that extent, FDM provides a trade-off: faster data for less bandwidth. Also, to demultiplex an FDM signal requires a series of bandpass filters to isolate each individual signal. Bandpass filters are relatively complicated and expensive, therefore the receivers in an FDM system are generally expensive.

== Examples of FDM ==

As an example of an FDM system, Commercial broadcast radio (AM and FM radio) simultaneously transmits multiple signals or &quot;stations&quot; over the airwaves. These stations each get their own frequency band to use, and a radio can be tuned to receive each different station. Another good example is cable television, which simultaneously transmits every channel, and the TV &quot;tunes in&quot; to which channel it wants to watch.

== Orthogonal FDM ==

{{Wikipedia|Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing}}

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a more modern variant of FDM that uses orthogonal sub-carriers to transmit data that does not overlap in the frequency spectrum and is able to be separated out using frequency methods. OFDM has a similar data rate to traditional FDM systems, but has a higher resilience to disruptive channel conditions such as noise and channel fading.</text>

Modulation is a term that is going to be used very frequently in this book. So much in fact, that we could almost have renamed this book &quot;Principals of Modulation&quot;, without having to delete too many chapters. So, the logical question arises: What exactly is modulation?

== Definition ==

'''Modulation''' is a process of mixing a signal with a sinusoid to produce a new signal. This new signal, conceivably, will have certain benefits over an un-modulated signal.

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that this sinusoid has 3 parameters that can be altered, to affect the shape of the graph. The first term, A, is called the magnitude, or amplitude of the sinusoid. The next term, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is known as the frequency, and the last term, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is known as the phase angle. All 3 parameters can be altered to transmit data.

The sinusoidal signal that is used in the modulation is known as the '''carrier signal''', or simply &quot;the carrier&quot;. The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal(or sinusoidal signal) is known as the &quot;data signal&quot; or the &quot;message signal&quot;. It is important to notice that a simple sinusoidal carrier contains no information of its own.

In other words we can say that modulation is used because some data signals are not always suitable for direct transmission, but the modulated signal may be more suitable.

== Types of Modulation ==

There are 3 basic types of modulation: Amplitude modulation, Frequency modulation, and Phase modulation.
;amplitude modulation
: a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier signal is modulated (changed) in proportion to the message signal while the frequency and phase are kept constant.
;frequency modulation
: a type of modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is modulated (changed) in proportion to the message signal while the amplitude and phase are kept constant.
;phase modulation
: a type of modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is varied accordance to the low frequency of the message signal is known as phase modulation.

== Why Use Modulation? ==

Clearly the concept of modulation can be a little tricky, especially for the people who don't like trigonometry. Why then do we bother to use modulation at all? To answer this question, let's consider a channel that essentially acts like a bandpass filter: both the lowest frequency components and the highest frequency components are attenuated or unusable in some way, with transmission only being practical over some intermediate frequency range. If we can't send low-frequency signals, then we need to shift our signal up the frequency ladder. Modulation allows us to send a signal over a bandpass frequency range. If every signal gets its own frequency range, then we can transmit multiple signals ''simultaneously'' over a single channel, all using different frequency ranges.

Another reason to modulate a signal is to allow the use of a smaller antenna.  A baseband (low frequency) signal would need a huge antenna because in order to be efficient, the antenna needs to be about 1/10th the length of the wavelength.  Modulation shifts the baseband signal up to a much higher frequency, which has much smaller wavelengths and allows the use of a much smaller antenna.

== Examples ==

Think about your car radio. There are more than a dozen (or so) channels on the radio at any time, each with a given frequency: 100.1MHz, 102.5MHz etc... Each channel gets a certain range (usually about 0.22MHz), and the entire station gets transmitted over that range. Modulation makes it all possible, because it allows us to send voice and music (which are essential baseband signals) over a bandpass (or &quot;Broadband&quot;) channel.

== non-sinusoidal modulation ==

A sine wave at one frequency can be separated from a sine wave at another frequency (or a cosine wave at the same frequency) because the two signals are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.

There are other sets of signals, such that every signal in the set is orthogonal to every other signal in the set.

A simple orthogonal set is time multiplexed division (TDM) -- only one transmitter is active at any one time.

Other more complicated sets of orthogonal waveforms -- Walsh codes and various pseudo-noise codes such as Gold codes and maximum length sequences -- are also used in some communication systems.

The process of combining these waveforms with data signals is sometimes called &quot;modulation&quot;, because it is so very similar to the way modulation combines sine waves are with data signals.

There is lots of talk nowadays about buzzwords such as &quot;Analog&quot; and &quot;Digital&quot;. Certainly, engineers who are interested in creating a new communication system should understand the difference. Which is better, analog or digital? What is the difference? What are the pros and cons of each? This chapter will look at the answers to some of these questions.

== What are They? ==

What exactly is an analog signal, and what is a digital signal?

;Analog : Analog signals are continuous in both time and value. Analog signals are used in many systems, although the use of analog signals has declined with the advent of cheap digital signals. All natural signals are Analog in nature. 

;Digital : Digital signals are discrete in time and value. Digital signals are signals that are represented by binary numbers, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. The 1 and 0 values can correspond to different discrete voltage values, and any signal that ''doesn't quite fit'' into the scheme just gets rounded off.

Digital signals are sampled, quantized &amp; encoded version of continuous time signals which they represent. In addition, some techniques also make the signal undergo encryption to make the system more tolerant to the channel.

== What are the Pros and Cons? ==

Each paradigm has its own benefits and problems

;Analog : Analog systems are less tolerant to noise, make good use of bandwidth, and are easy to manipulate mathematically. However, analog signals require hardware receivers and transmitters that are designed to perfectly fit the particular transmission. If you are working on a new system, and you decide to change your analog signal, you need to completely change your transmitters and receivers.

;Digital : Digital signals are more tolerant to noise, but digital signals can be completely corrupted in the presence of excess noise. In digital signals, noise could cause a 1 to be interpreted as a 0 and vice versa, which makes the received data different than the original data. Imagine if the army transmitted a position coordinate to a missile digitally, and a single bit was received in error?  This single bit error could cause a missile to miss its target by miles.  Luckily, there are systems in place to prevent this sort of scenario, such as checksums and CRCs, which tell the receiver when a bit has been corrupted and ask the transmitter to resend the data.  The primary benefit of digital signals is that they can be handled by simple, standardized receivers and transmitters, and the signal can be then dealt with in software (which is comparatively cheap to change).

;Discrete Digital and Analogue:
Discrete data has a fixed set of possible values.&lt;br /&gt;
Digital data is a type of Discrete data where the fixed value can either be 1 or 0.&lt;br /&gt;
Analogue data can take on any real value.&lt;br /&gt;

== Sampling and Reconstruction ==

The process of converting from analog data to digital data is called &quot;sampling&quot;. The process of recreating an analog signal from a digital one is called &quot;reconstruction&quot;. This book will not talk about either of these subjects in much depth beyond this, although other books on the topic of EE might, such as [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Digitisation]].

Signals need a channel to follow, so that they can move from place to place. These '''Communication Mediums''', or &quot;channels&quot; are things like wires and antennae that transmit the signal from one location to another. Some of the most common channels are listed below:

== Twisted Pair Wire ==
{{Wikipedia|Twisted Pair}}
'''Twisted Pair''' is a transmission medium that uses two conductors that are twisted together to form a pair. The concept for the twist of the conductors is to prevent interference. Ideally, each conductor of the pair basically receives the same amount of interference, positive and negative, effectively cancelling the effect of the interference. Typically, most inside cabling has four pairs with each pair having a different twist rate. The different twist rates help to further reduce the chance of crosstalk by making the pairs appear electrically different in reference to each other. If the pairs all had the same twist rate, they would be electrically identical in reference to each other causing crosstalk, which is also referred to as capacitive coupling. Twisted pair wire is commonly used in telephone and data cables with variations of categories and twist rates.

{{Wikipedia|Shielded Twisted Pair}}
Other variants of Twisted Pair are the '''Shielded Twisted Pair''' cables. The shielded types operate very similar to the non-shielded variety, except that Shielded Twisted Pair also has a layer of metal foil or mesh shielding around all the pairs or each individual pair to further shield the pairs from electromagnetic interference. Shielded twisted pair is typically deployed in situations where the cabling is subjected to higher than normal levels of interference.

== Coaxial Cable ==
{{Wikipedia|Coaxial Cable}}
Another common type of wire is '''Coaxial Cable'''. Coaxial cable (or simply, &quot;coax&quot;) is a type of cable with a single data line, surrounded by various layers of padding and shielding. The most common coax cable, common television cable, has a layer of wire mesh surrounding the padded core, that absorbs a large amount of EM interference, and helps to ensure a relatively clean signal is transmitted and received. Coax cable has a much higher bandwidth than a twisted pair, but coax is also significantly more expensive than an equal length of twisted pair wire. Coax cable frequently has an available bandwidth in excess of hundreds of megahertz (in comparison with the hundreds of kilohertz available on twisted pair wires).

Originally, Coax cable was used as the backbone of the telephone network because a single coaxial cable could hold hundreds of simultaneous phone calls by a method known as &quot;Frequency Division Multiplexing&quot; (discussed in a later chapter). Recently however, Fiber Optic cables have replaced Coaxial Cable as the backbone of the telephone network because Fiber Optic channels can hold many more simultaneous phone conversations (thousands at a time), and are less susceptible to interference, crosstalk, and noise then Coaxial Cable.

== Fiber Optics ==
{{Wikipedia|Glass Fibers}}
'''Fiber Optic''' cables are thin strands of glass that carry pulses of light (frequently infrared light) across long distances. Fiber Optic channels are usually immune to common RF interference, and can transmit incredibly high amounts of data very quickly. There are 2 general types of fiber optic cable: single frequency cable, and multi-frequency cable. single frequency cable carries only a single frequency of laser light, and because of this there is no self-interference on the line. Single-frequency fiber optic cables can attain incredible bandwidths of many gigahertz. Multi-Frequency fiber optics cables allow a Frequency-Division Multiplexed series of signals to each inhabit a given frequency range. However, interference between the different signals can decrease the range over which reliable data can be transmitted.

== Wireless Transmission ==

In '''wireless transmission systems''', signals are propagated as Electro-Magnetic waves through free space. Wireless signals are transmitted by a transmitter, and received by a receiver. Wireless systems are inexpensive because no wires need to be installed to transmit the signal, but wireless transmissions are susceptible not only to EM interference, but also to physical interference. A large building in a city, for instance can interfere with cell-phone reception, and a large mountain could block AM radio transmissions. Also, WiFi internet users may have noticed that their wireless internet signals don't travel through walls very well. 

There are 2 types of antennas that are used in wireless communications, '''isotropic''', and '''directional'''.

=== Isotropic ===

People should be familiar with isotropic antennas because they are everywhere: in your car, on your radio, etc... Isotropic antennas are omni-directional in the sense that they transmit data out equally (or nearly equally) in all directions. These antennas are excellent for systems (such as FM radio transmission) that need to transmit data to multiple receivers in multiple directions. Also, Isotropic antennas are good for systems in which the direction of the receiver, relative to the transmitter is not known (such as cellular phone systems).

=== Directional ===

Directional antennas focus their transmission power in a single narrow direction range. Some examples of directional antennas are satellite dishes, and wave-guides. The downfall of the directional antennas is that they need to be pointed directly at the receiver all the time to maintain transmission power. This is useful when the receiver and the transmitter are not moving (such as in communicating with a geo-synchronous satellite).</text>

Old folks may very well remember the first incarnation of the telephone networks, where an operator sitting at a desk would physically connect different wires to transmit a phone call from one house to another house. The days however when an operator at a desk could handle all the volume and all the possibilities of the telephone network are over. Now, automated systems connect wires together to transmit calls from one side of the country to another almost instantly.

== What is Circuit-Switching? ==

Circuit switching is a mechanism of assigning a predefined path from source node to destination node during the entire period of connection. Plain old telephone system (POTS) is a well known example of analogue circuit switching.

== Strowger Switch ==
Strowger Switch is the first automatic switch used in circuit switching. Prior to that all switching was done manually by operators working at various exchanges. It is named after its inventor  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almon_Brown_Strowger Almon Brown Strowger].

I quite agree. [[User:Professoryak|Professoryak]] ([[User talk:Professoryak|talk]]) 16:14, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

: Well, fair use isn't forbidden at Wikibooks. But I'm not sure if taking images from printed books can be qualified as fair use. Using logos and screenshots - yes - but schemas? I think the best solution would be redrawing them. Fair use makes problems with f.e. printing a book. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:34, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Halavais. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Halavais~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the beginning of the book, Brown claims that &quot;references to all works of art, tombs, tunnels, and architecture in Rome are entirely factual (as are their exact locations). They can still be seen today. The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual.&quot;  While the book does not specifically say that all of its apparently factual statements are true, Brown's assertions regarding his extensive research have led some readers to take the fictional universe of the book to be congruent to reality.

However, in many ways the fictional universe of the book's storyline significantly diverges from reality.

== Historical Divergences ==
* Langdon asserts incorrectly that Michelangelo designed the outfits for the Swiss Guards, though this is a common misconception. According to its official site, Commandant Jules Repond (1910-1921) designed the uniforms influenced by the Renaissance artist Raphael.
* Even though they do have a security as well as ceremonial role inside the Vatican, Brown's depiction of the Swiss Guard as a crack special ops squad, along the lines of the SAS, carrying out operations around the city of Rome (outside Vatican jurisdiction) is inaccurate.  
* In a flashback, Langdon recalls a lecture he gave in his ''Symbology 212'' class where he tells his class that &quot;The practice of 'god-eating' &amp;mdash; that is, Holy Communion &amp;mdash; was borrowed from the Aztecs.&quot; It's unclear how this could have occurred, as communion has its roots in the Last Supper (ca. AD 30) and the Aztec culture did not rise until the 14th century. Even if the Aztecs had been around when the practice of communion began, there is no evidence of contact between Europeans and the inhabitants of Central America at that time. The first clear evidence of European contact with these people occurred after Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492. 
*Brown states that Winston Churchill was a Roman Catholic. Churchill was an non-observant member of the Church of England. He was not a &quot;pillar of the church&quot; but a &quot;flying buttress&quot;. &quot;I support it from the outside.&quot;
* Langdon recalls &quot;that much of Galileo's legal trouble had begun when he described planetary motion as elliptical. The Vatican exalted the perfection of the circle and insisted that heavenly motion must be only circular.&quot; In reality Galileo famously refused to believe in his friend Kepler’s elliptical orbits and Galileo's clash with the Vatican was a result of his support for Heliocentrism, that is claiming that the Earth orbited the Sun and not vice versa. Galileo's support for heliocentricity might not have caused such a fuss if the Church hadn't needed to present a unified front against the threat of the Protestant Reformation, and Galileo causing dissent at home in Rome only made the Church respond more finally to the new science.   
*Glick explains that George H.W. Bush must be a member of the Illuminati because he was a 33° Freemason. Neither Bush has ever been a Freemason, though both were members of the Skull &amp; Bones fraternity at Yale.
*Brown mentions in a dialogue between Langdon and Kohler that Copernicus was 'murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths'. Copernicus, as a matter of fact, was a Polish priest and was encouraged by other clergymen to publish his findings. He died a natural death, and there is no evidence suggesting that he was murdered. 
* The [[w:Hashshashin|Hashshashin]] hired by the novel's villains refers to Christians as playing a critical role in the downfall of his sect. This is inaccurate; the Hashshashin were crippled by invading Mongols when their fortress of [[w:Alamut|Alamut]] in modern-day Iran was destroyed in 1256.        
*There is no such publication as the ''British Tattler''. ''The Tatler'', note the spelling, is well known and would not need to be described as &quot;British&quot; to be identified.
* Brown states that the Isola Tiberina was thought to have healing powers ever since 1656. However, the people of ancient Rome had already built a temple to Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, on the island in the third century BC.

== Location Divergences ==
* CERN does not have a private airport or any aeroplanes especially an X-33 spacecraft. In fact, the X-33 was only produced as a sub-scale technology demonstrator and was never actually built full-scale.     
* Dan Brown claims that &quot;[[w:Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]]'s city-wide cross of obelisks marked the fortress in perfect [[w:Illuminati|Illuminati]] fashion; the cross’s central arm passed directly through the center of the castle’s bridge, dividing it into two equal halves.&quot; In fact, neither of the two arms of the cross go through the [[w:Castel Sant'Angelo|Castel Sant'Angelo]]. In all likelihood, Brown was using a topographical tourist map to design this plot element and had not realised that the physical layout was different (and such a map would not have been in print for the designers of the city).
* While in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, Langdon thinks, &quot;Renaissance cathedrals invariably contained multiple chapels, huge cathedrals like Notre Dame having dozens.&quot;  This leads the reader to believe that the architecture of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is of the Renaissance period.  In fact, Notre Dame is the most famous example of Gothic architecture in the world, which pre-dates the Renaissance period. (Brown also seems to assume that all churches in Rome are cathedrals. The term &quot;cathedral&quot; is reserved for those churches where a bishop has his throne (or &quot;cathedra&quot;). The one (Roman Catholic) cathedral in Rome is St John Lateran--and not St Peter's in the Vatican).
* A straight line extending south west of Piazza del Popolo does not pass through the centre of St. Peter's Square, nor does it even pass through Vatican City.
* The Saint Peter's Basilica's crypt (''Grotte Vaticane''), where most Popes are entombed, is open to the public.
* The BBC headquarters is not (as the novel states) located in Piccadilly; the main BBC headquarters is Broadcasting House in Langham Place, just north of Oxford Circus, and there are also headquarters buildings for the BBC World Service (Bush House, in Aldwych) and for BBC Television (the Television Centre, in White City). Although the latter is in a sense &quot;west of Piccadilly Circus&quot;, it is several miles to the west, not immediately west as the novel's wording implies.

== Religious Divergences ==
* Brown claims that hatha yoga was an ancient Buddhist art. Although influenced by Buddhism, Hatha Yoga pre-dates Buddhism. It was, and is, a Hindu art.   
 
*In examining the body of the previous Pope, the Swiss Guard simply slide back the marble top of the tomb and they check the tongue of the Pope.  In fact, Popes are buried in three nested coffins, which would have made this task somewhat more difficult.  
 
* The novel asserts several non-facts about the process of a Papal conclave. It is suggested that only cardinals may be elected in a conclave. This is not true, any male Roman Catholic may be elected. It is further suggested that four candidates are semi-formally chosen, including a head, to become the candidates for papacy, thus making the Conclave obsolete. This is again not true; although there are ''papabili'' (generally, cardinals considered to have a chance of being elected), there are no formal candidates before the beginning of the conclave. Further, ballots are restricted to two in the morning and two in the evening, each group is burned together. Dan Brown indicates they are burned individually and indicates that more than two may occur in a single evening. The ballots are read out by one cardinal, verified by another, and pierced by a third; the book suggests that a single person does all of these. The Cardinals do not stay in the Sistine Chapel overnight. They go back to Domus Sancta Marta after two ballots in the morning and two ballots in the evening (in the case a pope hasn't been elected in those ballots). Brown gives the role of camerlengo to the late Pope's secretary. The camerlengo does organize the Conclave but he is never the pope's secretary. In fact, the camerlengo is a member of the College of Cardinals and is pre-chosen by the pope to take charge of the affairs during the Sede Vacante. The late Pope's secretary has no authority over anyone in the Vatican, as he loses his job when the pope dies. Also, the book states that the &quot;Dean of the College of Cardinals&quot; of the conclave cannot be elected; in fact, he can, and he actually was in the 2005 conclave (then Cardinal Ratzinger was the Dean of the College of Cardinals). It should also be noted that the &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot; has nothing to do with the papal election but with the process of beatification. Langdon's encounters with the camerlengo take place in the Papal Apartments, while in fact the rules order that the apartments be sealed during the Conclave and the late Pope's staff has to live somewhere else.

* At the end of the novel, Glick reports that the camerlengo was elected pope for a short time through something called &quot;election by adoration.&quot;  This is probably meant to refer to the process of election &quot;by acclamation or inspiration&quot; (Latin: ''per acclamationem seu inspirationem''), which was explicitly prohibited as a form of Papal election in 1996, when [[w:Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul II]] released the apostolic constitution [[w:Universi Dominici Gregis|Universi Dominici Gregis]].  This document also forbids the election of a pope by compromise or committee (Latin: ''per compromissum''), leaving only the secret balloting of conclave as a legitimate form of election.

* Concerning Cardinal (Kardinal) Ebner from Frankfurt (the first victim): There are two major cities in Germany that are called Frankfurt (in addition to small one(s)): Frankfurt am Main and Frankfurt an der Oder. None of them are one of Germany's dioceses and therefore none of the Frankfurts have a bishop. It is not a necessity to be a bishop in order to be chosen to become a cardinal, but that is of course with absolute majority the case. In Germany there are two theologians who became cardinals (the rest were bishops): Alois Kardinal Grillmeier and Leo Kardinal Scheffczyk. So theoretically it is possible that there is someone from Frankfurt who was chosen to become a cardinal. But more likely is that Dan Brown made a rather common mistake: Frankfurt am Main has a big church in its center called &quot;Dom&quot; (cathedral). A cathedral (German: &quot;Dom&quot; or &quot;Kathedrale&quot;) is the central church of a diocese and the bishop's seat. Therefore it is not uncommon that people think Frankfurt is a diocese and has a bishop. But in this case the term &quot;Dom&quot; was used as a general description of a large and historically important church. The name of the Frankfurt Dom is &quot;St. Bartholomäus&quot; (Bartholomew) (see: [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Dom Kaiserdom St. Bartholomäus]). Everyone refers to that church though as &quot;Dom&quot; or &quot;Kaiserdom&quot; (Emperor's Cathedral), because from 1562 to 1792 ten German emperors were crowned in that church. Strictly speaking though the use of the word &quot;Dom&quot; is wrong. 

* Cardinal's cassocks are not black as those of ordinary priests, but scarlet.

* Brown refers to the Biblical Book of Judges as the Book of Judgments.

* In a flashback in the novel, the late pope confesses to Carlo Ventresca that he, the pope, has a son. Ventresca, waiting for no further explanation, rushes out, distraught at his mentor's broken vows (see &quot;vows&quot; below). Later in the novel, Cardinal Mortati tries to reassure Ventresca that the pope's love (and that of his beloved, the nun, Sister Maria) was chaste, since Ventresca was conceived without sexual intercourse, by means of artificial insemination, thereby ensuring that both parents remained faithful to their vows. This explains the former pope's love of and support for science, since it enabled him to remain a celibate priest whilst becoming a father. Artificial insemination is forbidden by the Catholic Church and is considered sinful, since it separates conception from the sex act, and also (usually) requires masturbation for the gathering of sperm.

* Strictly speaking, nuns, monks, friars, etc (i.e., all those consecrated to religious life), take &quot;vows&quot; to God, while diocesan clergy make &quot;promises&quot; (including celibacy), to their bishop.

* Italian Laws do not allow singles to adopt a child; a catholic priest like Leonardo Vetra could not adopt Vittoria as a daughter giving her his surname.

== Scientific Divergences ==
* The proton is not, as stated in the book, the antiparticle of the electron. The proton is the antiparticle of the antiproton; the electron is the antiparticle of the positron.
* The process of creating antimatter described in the book is inaccurate. Instead of colliding two particles moving in opposite directions, CERN smashes protons into a stationary block of copper or iridium.      
* It is impossible to create and sustain the densities of antimatter described in the book. In fact, it takes 2 billions years to create that much of antimatter. Similarly, antimatter could never be used as a source of power. Antimatter has to be created since it is found nowhere on Earth naturally. The amount of energy required to operate the particle accelerator would be far greater than (or, ideally, equal to) the energy the antimatter-matter reaction would produce. To produce antimatter with less energy than it released would be in violation of the 1st law of Thermodynamics, so even a &quot;ground breaking discovery&quot; as described in the book occurred, it would not be physically possible.
*Brown writes that the antimatter canister will detonate with the energy of a 5 kiloton bomb.  However, the energy released will be from the total consumption of 0.5g of material; 0.25g of antimatter, and 0.25g of normal matter.  This has the energy equivalent of about 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Joules, or about 10 kilotons of TNT. The Hiroshima bomb was about 20 kilotons. The Nagasaki bomb was 13 kilotons.
*Containment of hydrogen (anti- or otherwise) in a magnetic field would not be possible in a small portable container.  For the hydrogen to form a droplet at normal temperatures and in a vacuum (as would be necessary to isolate it from normal matter) would require a magnetic field of extraordinary strength, beyond the power of a portable power source.  This magnetic field would have to extend well beyond the canister and would cause vigorous effects on ferromagnetic materials nearby.  Furthermore, hydrogen in its conventional liquid state is diamagnetic, and would be difficult to suspend unless the compression induced by the magnetic field caused the hydrogen to become metallic (as in the core of gas giant planets).
* Having jumped out of a helicopter seconds before a ten kiloton antimatter annihilation, Camerlengo Ventresca would most likely have been vaporised. If not, then the explosion would have propelled him at such a speed that there would be absolutely no chance of his slowing enough to land safely.    
* Annihilation of protons and anti-protons would generate energy primarily in the form of 900 [MeV gamma rays. These gamma rays would easily penetrate the matter surrounding the bomb and deliver a lethal dose of radiation to any exposed person standing closer than 2-3 km from the point of explosion.         
* Near the end of the novel, Brown repeats the popular notion that humans only use a small percentage of their brains.  In fact, this is a myth. [http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percnt.htm]

== Technological Divergences ==
* The pilot explains Langdon's nausea is altitude sickness from flying at 60,000 ft (18,288 m).  &quot;Altitude sickness&quot; is not due to altitude but to (lack of) air pressure. A properly pressured aircraft should not induce altitude sickness. Many Concorde passengers flew at 60,000 ft without experiencing altitude sickness.  
* Rather than being the mature transport system described in the book, the Lockheed Martin X-33 is, in fact, a small unmanned technology-demonstration vehicle. Intercontinental hypersonic spaceplanes are planned, but none exist. 
* Arguably the most blatant and central error made in the book concerns the wireless camera which occupies a central role in the search for the antimatter canister. In the book, the canister is supposedly being filmed by a wireless camera and that signal is being displayed on a large screen in St. Peter's square. In order to find this camera, the Swiss Guard needs to shut off every electronic device to and conduct a painstaking search for the camera, which is eventually found, with the canister, deep underground in a labyrinth of tombs beneath the Vatican. There are several problems with this plot line. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; First, if the wireless camera's signal is being received and the picture displayed in St. Peter's Square, then it would not take more than a few minutes for a trained team of engineers to triangulate the position of the transmission. Indeed, consider the countless movies about World War II clandestine radio operators who could not transmit more than a few minutes at a time so as not to be detected by the counter-intelligence triangulation teams. Here we have a camera that is transmitting for ''hours''. The rule is: if you can receive the signal, it is very easy to find out where it comes from. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The other, second and perhaps greater error is the fact that this wireless camera is transmitting from underground. Transmission of a video signal takes a lot a bandwidth and hence must have a relatively high carrier frequency (such as VHF, UHF, or SHF). In the book we are told that we can see the canister's display counting down in ''seconds'' in real-time, which means that we are indeed talking about a relatively high bandwidth signal, and hence, the assumption of a high carrier frequency is a good one. Such carrier frequencies cannot penetrate any significant obstacles and hence it is simply impossible for the signal of such a camera to be received if it were transmitting from deep underground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Indeed, it would be virtually impossible to receive a signal from deep underground even if a very low frequency carrier were to have been used. &lt;br/&gt; In conclusion, the whole premise of the plot, namely a laborious search for a canister which is being filmed by a wireless camera from deep underground, does not stand the scrutiny of basic radio transmission principles. ''
* There is the lack of a method for recharging the anti-matter canister. A container requiring electrical power to function designed both to be easily portable and to hold such quantities of dangerous material would have the option to use an alternate method to recharge the on-board battery, preferably one that can be as easily employed as a standard &quot;wall wart&quot; power adapter and an electrical outlet. Without a similar option, the canisters themselves are shockingly unsafe for their stated function from an engineering standpoint and pay little heed to Murphy's Law.
* The author appears to confuse the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the 1980s with the invention of the Internet mainly in the US in the 1960s. Far from being unrecognised for his work as is implied in the book Tim Berners-Lee has received numerous awards including appointment to the Order of the British Empire as a Knight Commander (KBE). He is also head of the W3C which manages and defines the most popular WEB standards.
* Cellular phones do not have dial tones.  Furthermore, cellphone calls cannot be made untraceably as suggested in the book; whenever a cellphone is switched on, even if it is in standby mode, the service provider can detect which cell it is in and hence where it is to within a few metres.
*&quot;Illuminati: New World Order&quot;, the game mentioned in the book, is a Collectible card game, not a computer game. Steve Jackson Games is not a computer game company. It is not playable on the internet, and one does not score points by killing opponents.

== Cultural Divergences ==
* Gunther Glick, the supposedly &quot;British&quot; journalist, has speech and thoughts which are riddled with Americanisms (e.g. &quot;gas&quot; instead of &quot;petrol&quot;, &quot;anchormen&quot; instead of &quot;presenters&quot;), and in a fantasy about future success, he likens himself to [[w:Dan Rather|Dan Rather]] — who is relatively unknown in Britain. A real British journalist would probably most likely liken himself to [[w:Trevor McDonald|Trevor McDonald]].

== Translation Errors ==
* Langdon states at one point that the phrase ''[[w:Novus Ordo Seclorum|Novus Ordo Seclorum]]'', found on American currency, translates as &quot;New Secular Order.&quot; The correct translation is &quot;New Order of the Ages.&quot;  
* Langdon tells Kohler that the Church declared the Illuminati &quot;Shaitan,&quot; which he identifies as an &quot;Islamic word.&quot;  In fact, the word &quot;Shaitan&quot; (Arabic ''شيطان'') comes from ancient Hebrew &quot;ha Satan,&quot; (standard Hebrew {{unicode|שָׂטָן}} In Hebrew, Shaitan translates to &quot;adversary&quot;. In Islamic culture, the word refers to anyone who has rebelled against God.  
* Robert Langdon incorrectly translates Seraphim as &quot;The Fiery One&quot;. In reality, Seraphim is the plural form of Seraph. This is a commonly made error.        
* The assassin uses a word, &quot;Tabban&quot;, that is meant to be a curse in Arabic but in fact is simply a commonly used emphatic statement meaning 'of course'

== Internet vs the WWW. ==

While Tim Berners-Lee did not invent the Internet, the book never claimed that he did. It merely referenced the World Wide Web. (You can check pages 7 and 20-21 of the book, depending on which version you have.)

May I suggest we bring this paragraph over from Wikipedia:

::CERN states another often-percieved misunderstanding in the book is the reference to CERN as the organization that invented the Internet, when in fact, Tim Berners-Lee and a small team at CERN invented the hypertext transport protocol that led to the World Wide Web, not the Internet, which was engineered in the United States by DARPA. However, the character Maximilian Kohler claims only that CERN indeed invented the Web, and a plaque later repeats this point. The book never mentions CERN as the inventor of the Internet.

== Incorrect wording?  Precision vs. resolution ==

One of the technical errors reads as follows:

:It is impossible yet to create a device that would measure the charge remaining in a battery so accurately, that it could show the time remaining to battery exhaust with the precision of 1 second.

Surely that should read &quot;...with a resolution of 1 second&quot;?  (Or better still, &quot;one second&quot;.)  My understanding of the terms &quot;precision&quot;, &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;resolution&quot; is that although related, they are different; the smallest unit of measurement an instrument can discern is the resolution of the instrument, whilst if one were to do a series of tests with the instrument and then subtract each result obtained from the result which ''should have been'' obtained, the accuracy of the instrument is given by the arithmetic mean of the differences whilst the precision is given by the standard deviation. -- [[Special:Contributions/92.40.32.106|92.40.32.106]] ([[User talk:92.40.32.106|talk]]) 13:21, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

== Cellular phones ==

what does the sentence &quot;Cellular phones do not have dial tones&quot; means?
:&quot;Cellular phones&quot; is another name for the devices which are also called &quot;cellphones&quot; or &quot;mobile phones&quot; (the latter being the most common name for them in the UK). — [[Special:Contributions/92.40.6.56|92.40.6.56]] ([[User talk:92.40.6.56|talk]]) 12:18, 15 July 2009 (UTC)
We in law enforcement only wish we could locate a cell phone within a few meters in seconds. Sorry, that is just not true.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who Were They? ==
The Hittites were a group of Indo-European people whose empire stretched across Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. Most of modern Turkey is considered to be the home land of the Hittite people. The peak of their civilization was reached from 1600 to 1200 BC. Their civilization ended as suddenly as it started. Originally the Hittites spoke a language similar to Sanskrit, a dead language of India. They were a warrior race notorious for their ferocity and brutality. Because of them Mesopotamia lost its honor as the cradle land of civilization and never emerged at its full strength again.

== What Country Did They Live In? == 
The Hittites were unknown to the modern world until 1900 AD, when a tablet with an unknown inscription was excavated. The tablet was later translated and gave the world the information of their existence. Hattie was their home land and Hattusas was the name of their capital. It is situated in Central Anatolia region of modern Turkey and in the town of Boghazköy about 210 kilometres east of Ankara.

The Hittite lived in present-day Turkey. The Hittite capital was near a village that is now called Bogazkoy. It was between the Mediterranean sea and the Black Sea and known as the Near East. They spread into North Syria from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. 
[http://archaeology.about.com/od/ancientcivilizations/ig/Hittite-Capital-of-Hattusha/]

== What Did They Eat? ==
Hittites ate similar food as other Mediterranean people. Their chief food was bread. Meat was also a part of their day to day menu. Rich people used to satisfy their appetite with homemade cheese and various other milk produced delicacies.  They also had barley, wheat grapes, and lots of other meats.

==What Did They Wear? ==

Hittites were strongly influenced by Babylonians; it is easily conceivable that they used to wear similar clothes as the Babylonians. Picture that we have added with this article supports our view. Hittite men wore long cloaks and women had a dress which consisted of two parts similar to a blouse and knee-long skirt. These dresses are still common in Turkey and Middle East

== What Did Their Writing Look Like? ==
Hittites spoke a language belonging to the Indo-European linguistic family. They used Akkadian’s cuneiform writing system to write their language.  The first Hittite tablets were discovered in 1906 by German excavators. Within ten years the language had been deciphered, and a sketch of its grammar published. Gradually, the international community of scholars, led by the Germans, expanded the knowledge of the language. The number of common Hittite words that one could translate with reasonable certainty increased gradually. Now we have a good collection of Hittite words that tells us how closely it was related to Indo-Europeans languages.

== What Did They Believe? ==
[[Image:hititMountainGod.jpg|left|thumbnail]]
Hittites were very generous in adopting other people’s religions. Most of the Hittites deities were from Babylonian and Sumerian origins.  Whichever nation they have conquered they had included their gods with gods of Hittites, looks like they believed that gods whoever their worshipper are all legitimate therefore worthy of getting their allegiance. In fact the Hittites probably were the world’s first nation having an attitude of religious tolerance.

== What Did Their Buildings Look Like? ==
Art and architecture of Hatti was strongly influenced by neighbouring countries. They used stone and brick as well as wooden columns to erect their houses and temples. The Hittites built large palaces, temples and fortifications, where carved reliefs adorned walls, gates and entrances. The style was very solid and they tended to go for a massive look. The cities were usually mapped out in a rectangular format.

== When did their civilization exist?==
The Hittites were a warlike empire that was in existence from 1600 BC until they were raided and destroyed by The sea people in 1200 BC

== *Finding the square root* ==

== Legendre Symbol ==
''.. to be expanded''
There is actually a simple way to determine whether ''a'' is square 

Let ''g'' be a generator of ''G'' where ''G'' is the multiplicative group mod ''p''. Since all the squares form a group therefore, if ''a'' is a square, then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
and if ''a'' is not a square then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv -1&lt;/math&gt;
we shall use these facts in the next section.
''.. to be expanded''

== *Finding the square root* ==
We aim to describe a way to find a square root in mod ''m''. Let's start with the simplest case, where ''p'' is prime. In fact, for square root finding, the simplest case also happens to be the hardest.

If ''p'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod ''4'') then it is easy to find a square root. Just note that if ''a'' has a square root then
:&lt;math&gt;(a^{\frac{p + 1}{4}})^2 \equiv a^{\frac{p + 1}{2}} \equiv a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}a \equiv a &lt;/math&gt;

So let us consider primes equivalent to 1 mod 4. Suppose we can find the square root of ''a'' mod ''p'', and let
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
With the above information, we can find the square of ''a'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We let
:&lt;math&gt;x = x_0 + x_1p \!&lt;/math&gt;
we want ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; a (mod  ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = x_0^2 + 2x_0x_1p + x_1^2p^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a + kp + 2x_0x_1p \pmod{p^2} \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''k'' as &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 = a + kp&lt;/math&gt;, we see that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a + p(k + 2x_0x_1) \pmod{p^2} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so if we need to find &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k + 2x_0x_1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;, we simply need to make &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; the subject
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \equiv -k(2x_0)^{-1} \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;.

These drinks are prepared directly in a 9 oz (270 mL) highball glass.

==Making a highball==

* Fill a highball glass two-thirds full with ice.  Use an ice scoop or your hands; ''never'' use the glass.  If the glass breaks in the ice, it will leave shards indistinguishable from ice.  This makes it impossible to locate all of the shards; it is likely that small chips will be scattered through the ice as well as the big pieces.  It may be illegal in your area to use anything but an ice scoop for this reason.
* Pour in one jigger (45 mL) of liquor.  ''Note'':  some bars save money by putting in 1 oz (30 mL) instead of a whole jigger (45 mL).
* Pour mixer to the top.
* If the mixer is non-carbonated, stir it; or stick a straw in it and let the drinker stir.  If it's carbonated, the bubbles do the stirring for it.
* Garnish, if necessary.
Otherwise, if you feel that you're ready for a genuine Spanish &quot;cubata&quot; (rum &amp; coke), you should pour both liquor and mixer 50%-50%. It gives a much stronger taste. It is not really recommended because customers will get drunk fairly quickly, and will stop ordering drinks. It is the usual mix in Spain.

=Learning objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to answer the following questions:
* What is WDDX?
* What are the uses of WDDX?
* What are Web Syndicate Networks?
* What are the benefits of WDDX?

=Introduction=
&lt;b&gt;WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange)&lt;/b&gt; was created by Allaire, now known as [http://www.macromedia.com Macromedia], to solve the problem of exchanging data between different web applications. It was originally intended to be used to exchange data between [http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/ ColdFusion] and other web application languages. This XML-based technology enables complex data to be exchanged between totally different Web programming languages by creating 'Web Syndicate Networks.' WDDX consists of a language-independent representation of data based on an XML 1.0 DTD, and a set of modules for a wide variety of languages that use WDDX. 

==Features==

* can be used with HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP and other Internet protocols that support transferring textual data
* must be using Netscape 3.0+ or Internet Explorer for Windows or any versions for Unix and Mac platforms
* supports boolean, number, date-time, and string data types
* supports complex data types like arrays, structures, and recordsets
* not a formal standard, but is free and widely distributed and is based on standard-base technologies like XML 1.0

=How it Works=
The way that the web distributed data exchange works is by assigning a specific module for the given programming language to translate the data into an abstract XML format. Another specific module then translates the XML back into another programming language for another web application.  For example, if you had an array in a ColdFusion program that you wanted to send to an ASP program, it would first be serialized into XML and sent to the ASP server.  The ASP server would then deserialize it and convert it to VBScript for use in the ASP program.

=Web Syndicate Networks=
The term 'Web Syndicate Network' refers to a group of websites that share their content and transactions.  This allows for economies of scale as each site can use shared database content or even transactions and procedures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==''' Origins of the diffusion paradigm''' ==

According to Rogers (1995), the study of the diffusion of innovations (DOI) can be traced back to the investigations of French sociologist Gabriel Tarde (p. 52). Tarde attempted to explain why some innovations are adopted and spread throughout a society, while others are ignored. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Tarde was witness to the development of many new inventions, many of which led to social and cultural change. In his book ''The Laws of Imitation'' (1903), Tarde introduced the S-shaped curve and opinion leadership, focusing on the role of socioeconomic status (for example, a cosmopolitan individual is more likely to adopt new products). Even though he did not specify and clarify key diffusion concepts, his insights affected the development of many social scientific disciplines such as geography, economics, and anthropology. Sociologist F. Stuart Chapin, for example, studied longitudinal growth patterns in various social institutions, and found that S-shaped curves best described the adoption of phenomena such as the commission form of city government (Lowery &amp; Defleur, 1995, p. 118).

== The basic research paradigm for the diffusion of innovations ==

The fundamental research paradigm for the diffusion of innovations can be traced to the Iowa study of hybrid seed corn. Bryce Ryan and Neal C. Gross (1943) investigated the diffusion of hybrid seed corn among Iowa farmers. According to Lowery and DeFleur (1995), the background of rural sociology should first be understood before one can discuss how and why the hybrid seed corn study was conducted. The [[w:Morrill Act|Morrill Act]] helped “the states establish educational institutions that would be of special benefit to rural youth” (p. 120). Federal funds and other financial supports were given to these land-grant institutions in order to increase the development of the nation’s agricultural industry (p. 120). After World War II, rural sociologists changed their research focus on human problems among farmers because new agricultural technology such as new pesticides, new farm machine, and hybrid seed corn appeared. But in spite of these developments, some farmers ignored or resisted these new innovations. Rural sociologists at land-grant universities in the Midwestern United States such as Iowa State, Michigan State, and Ohio State Universities, performed many diffusion studies to find out the causes of adoption of innovations. One of these efforts was the hybrid seed corn study conducted by Ryan and Gross (1943). These researchers attempted to explain why some farmers adopted the hybrid seed corn, while others did not.

== Bryce Ryan and Neal C. Gross ==

Bryce Ryan earned a Ph. D in sociology at [[w:Harvard|Harvard University]]. During his doctoral studies, Ryan was required to take interdisciplinary courses in economics, anthropology, and social psychology. This intellectual background helped him conduct the diffusion studies. In 1938, Ryan became a professor at [[w:Iowa State|Iowa State University]] which is known for its agricultural focus. At that time, Iowa State administrators were worried about the slow rate at which the hybrid seed corn was being adopted. Despite the fact that the use of this new innovation could lead to an increase in quality and production, an advantageous adoption by Iowa Farmers was slow. Ryan proposed the study of the diffusion of the hybrid seed corn and received funding from Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, Iowa State University’s research and development organization. Contrary to previous research, which employed anthropological style approaches using qualitative methods, Ryan employed a quantitative survey method in his study. According to Rogers (1996), Ryan was encouraged to use this quantitative method by “professors in the Department of Statistics, such as Paul G. Homemeyer, Ray J. Jessen, and Snedecor” (p. 415). 

When Ryan arrived at Iowa State University, Neal C. Gross was a graduate student who was soon assigned as Ryan’s research assistant. Ryan asked him to conduct interviews with Iowa farmers through survey research. Gross gathered the data from the Iowa communities of Jefferson and Grand Junction. Rogers (1996) mentioned that “by coincidence, these communities were located within 30 miles of where he grew up on a farm” (p. 415). It is also interesting to note that Rogers earned a Ph. D. in sociology and statistics at Iowa State University in 1957.

== The Iowa Study of Hybrid Seed Corn: The Adoption of Innovation ==

As noted above, the hybrid seed corn had many advantages compared to traditional seed, such as the hybrid seed's vigor and resistance to drought and disease. However, there were some barriers to prevent Iowa farmers from adopting the hybrid seed corn. One problem was that the hybrid seed corn could not reproduce (p. 122). This meant that the hybrid seed was relatively expensive for Iowa farmers, especially at the time of the Depression. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, despite the economic profit that the hybrid seed corn brought, its high price made a adoption among Iowa farmers remain slow.

According to Lowery and DeFleur (1995), Ryan and Gross sought to explain how the hybrid seed corn came to attention and which of two channels (i.e., mass communication and interpersonal communication with peers) led farmers to adopt the new innovation. They found that each channel has different functions. Mass communication functioned as the source of initial information, while interpersonal networks functioned as the influence over the farmers’ decisions to adopt (p. 125). One of the most important findings in this study is that “the adoption of innovation depends on some combination of well-established interpersonal ties and habitual exposure to mass communication” (p. 127). Ryan and Gross also found that the rate of adoption of hybrid seed corn followed an S-shaped curve, and that there were four different types of adopters. According to Rogers (1995), Ryan and Gross also made a contribution by identifying the five major stages in the adoption process, which were awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. After Ryan and Gross’s hybrid corn study, about 5,000 papers about diffusion were published in 1994 (Rogers, 1995).

== Medical innovation: Diffusion of a medical drug among doctors ==

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion theory became more widely accepted after James S. Coleman, Elihu Katz, and Herbert Menzel conducted a study on the diffusion of tetracycline, a new medical drug, in 1966. The Pfizer drug company invented this successful new drug and wanted to investigate the effectiveness of their tetracycline advertisements, which were placed in medical journals. The company asked three professors at Columbia University to find out how physicians adopted the new innovation and how mass communication influenced this adoption process. They conducted a survey to gather accurate and reliable data. Different with previous diffusion research that relied on respondents’ recall of how they adopted new technology, this study gathered data both from physicians' responses and pharmacies' prescription. In addition to this, Coleman et al. (1966) asked their respondents to list their interpersonal connections in order to investigate the effect of interpersonal network links with the new drug adoption.
The result shows that the percentage of adoption of the new drug followed an S-shaped curve, but that the rate of tetracycline adoption was faster than the rate of other innovations adoption. The researchers also found that doctors who are cosmopolite were likely to adopt the new drug. One of the most important findings was that doctors who had more interpersonal networks adopted the new medical drug more quickly than those that did not. This meant that interpersonal communication channels with peers had a strong influence on the adoption process. Rogers (1996) noted that this Columbia University study is “one of the most influential diffusion studies in showing that the diffusion of an innovation is essentially a social process that occurs through interpersonal networks” (p. 419). In fact, Rogers (1996) mentioned that even though the study of Ryan and Gross became a milestone in diffusion paradigm, they did not measure the interpersonal network links among farmers. In this case, the Columbia University Drug Study made a contribution to identify the importance of social networks in the diffusion process.

== Everett M. Rogers ==

Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. 

One interesting thing worthy mentioning is that Rogers’ father was a farmer who resisted adopting the hybrid seed corn (Singhal, 2005, p.287). Due to the drought in Iowa in 1936, the Rogers’ farm withered, which made Rogers personally involved in the diffusion research. In the 1950's, Iowa State University was a perfect place for studying the diffusion of innovations, as the school's program focused on a rural sociology, agriculture, and statistics. The experience there led Rogers to dive into the research about why some innovations are adopted while others are ignored. Employed by Michigan State University in 1962, Rogers obtained opportunity to study diffusion in developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Meanwhile, he published the book, ''Diffusion of Innovations'', which earned him his academic reputation. Rogers’ comprehensive insights in the book helped to expand diffusion theory. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease.  He died on October 21, 2005.

== Overview of the diffusion of innovations ==

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption.
 
Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet. According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: “(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn) can have their own different rates in diffusion.

When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that there are five stages. 

# Knowledge + or – (selective exposure or awareness of news)
# Attitudes + or – (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
# Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
# Implementation (regular or standard practice)
# Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)

Rogers introduced perceived characteristics of innovations that consist of (1) relative advantage (2) compatibility (3) complexity (4) triability (5) observability. Based on these five criteria, individuals perceive an innovation as new or useful and decide to adopt it. For example, Rogers (1995) defined relative advantage as “the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes” (p.15).” New media such as the mp3 will displace conventional media such as CDs or tapes when people perceive new media as advantageous (e.g., low cost or means to be cool). When an individual decides to adopt new media or switch old media with new media, the perceived characteristics of innovations play an important role in reducing some uncertainty about the innovations.

== Unit of analysis on diffusion theory ==

Diffusion of innovation theory attempts to explain how an innovation is spread and why it is adopted at both the micro and macro levels of analysis.  Rogers (1996) mentioned, “the individual is usually the unit of analysis, although in recent years a number of studies have been conducted in which an individual organization is the unit of analysis (Wildemuth, 1992; Zaltman, Duncan, &amp; Holbek, 1973)” (p. 418). This characteristic of unit of analysis is due to research methods, such as utilizing a survey to study diffusion. Many studies have focused on individual decisions or adoption. In contrast, diffusion theory considers analysis at both the micro-individual and macro-social levels.  This is because studies of diffusion include both an innovation at the micro level, as well as its influence, such as social change, at the macro level.

Rogers (1995) suggested that the four main elements in the diffusion of innovation process were innovation, communication channels, time, and social system.  Individuals’ innovativeness, or psychological factors such as communication needs, are analyzed as micro-independent variables. At the macro-social level, this theory assumes that social systems, such as norms, can affect an individual’s adoption or use of an innovation. In terms of communication channels, diffusion of an innovation involves both interpersonal channels (micro) and mass communication channels (macro). By utilizing both mass and interpersonal communication channels, people can get information about an innovation and perceive its usefulness. Therefore, diffusion theory requires both micro-individual and macro-social analysis.

== Several diffusion research streams ==

According to Rice &amp; Webster (2002), [&quot;research and models of the adoption, diffusion, and use of new communication media in organizational settings have arisen from several research streams -- diffusion of innovations, media choice, and implementation of information systems.&quot;  According to the previous writer of this Wikibook,] we can classify diffusion research and models into three categories: (1) diffusion of innovations (e.g., Rogers, 1995), (2) media choice (e.g., Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986), and (3) implementation of information systems (e.g., Saga &amp; Zmud, 1994). [Unfortunately, one cannot generalize all diffusion research and models with an explanation of diffusion of new communication media.] Table 1 shows that each dependent variable, according to three primary streams of diffusion studies.

That is, the ‘diffusion of innovations’ studies emphasize characteristics of an innovation and the role of communication channels in adopting the innovation, the ‘media choice’ studies focus on the interaction between individual characteristics and social influences in choosing some innovations, and the ‘implementation’ studies assume that the variables such as technology design or ease of use will affect media use (Rice &amp; Webster, 2002, p.192). 

The diffusion tradition has classified people, in terms of demographics, in explaining the variables that influence the adoption of an innovation. For that reason, some scholars often criticize that this theory may not provide a causal explanation of why and how people adopt certain technologies. Nevertheless, when it comes to the use and choice of old and new media, diffusion theory will be suited for explaining why some people prefer to use the old media or new media, because this theory provides some conceptual guidance for understanding the adoption of some technologies or innovations. According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences or channels are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required to many users for getting efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. Markus (1987) proposed that the value of an interactive communication medium is associated with the number of other users. For example, in the case of the mp3, a social influence such as peer pressure that interacts with young generation needs to be cool or to gain status drives young people to adopt the mp3 as an innovation. Besides, when it comes to the emergence of interactive communication such as the new communication technologies, Rogers (1996) mentioned, “a critical mass occurs when the diffusion process becomes self-sustaining. After the critical mass point, individuals in a system perceive that “everybody else” has adopted the interactive innovation. With each successive adopter of an interactive innovation, the new idea becomes more valuable not only for each future adopter, but also for each previous adopter” (p. 418-419). When it comes to the future of diffusion theory, we expect that the popularity of diffusion research will increase because as in recent years, new communication technologies have increased and proliferated.

== Diffusion study and Two-Step Flow study ==

According to Lowery and Defleur (1995), since diffusion study emphasizes the role of interpersonal communications, the diffusion study by Ryan and Gross “parallels what was independently found by Lazarsfeld and his associates in the discovery of the two-step flow process in the very different setting of The People’s Choice” (p. 132).  &quot;The People’s Choice” showed that audiences are not powerless and passive. The study showed that interpersonal channels, such as opinion leaders, are more important than the mass media. Unlike magic bullet theory, both of these studies emphasized the role of the opinion leaders and interpersonal communication, such as face-to-face interactions influencing decision-making.

[[Image:Tonic_water_uv.jpg|thumb|Tonic Water containing quinine. Note that quinine is fluorescent.]]
'''Tonic water''' is a carbonated mixer containing [[w:quinine|quinine]].  It is carbonated water flavored like a bitter lemon or lime, with a little sugar.

Tonic water generally is marked on a [[Bartending:Soda gun|soda gun]] with a 'Q'; and in bottles by a yellow label.  This is different from plain [[Bartending:Club soda|soda water]], which is under 'S', or in a bottle with a blue label.

An interesting trait of tonic water is that quinine is fluorescent.  By using a black light, you can make the liquid glow; your bar setup may be interestingly enhanced by stocking extra tonic water in clear bottles at strategic locations, and using a blacklight to produce the interesting glow.  A clear-top bar with fluorescent tube blacklights run under it would also make certain drinks glow.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tobin Richard. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tobin Richard~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Dynamics: Velocities in a Four Dimensional Universe==

Many students of consciousness studies are unaware of the modern derivations of physical theories. Nowhere is this more evident than in the belief that Newtonian Physics is a complete description of physics. However, this belief is incorrect, the concept of Kinetic Energy that underlies Newtonian Dynamics is due to relativistic mass increases as a result of the existence of a four dimensional universe and the invariance of physical laws. The mass increase, although a relativistic effect, is noticeable as kinetic energy because it is equivalent to an energy of &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; where the speed of light squared is a huge number. What we call classical physics is in fact relativistic physics.
(See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity_for_beginners special relativity for beginners] for an introduction). Contrary to popular belief our observation must be described using four interrelated coordinate axes, not three.

===Relativistic transformation of velocity===

If time and space are affected by the four dimensional nature of the universe then velocity, which is the ratio of distance travelled to time taken, should also be affected.
In the simplest case, where Bill and Jim are travelling towards each other they both obtain the same value for the velocity of approach. This is because Bill and Jim are symmetrical, either can consider either to be moving. The symmetry disappears however if both Bill and Jim are observing an object moving relative to both of them. Suppose there is an object moving at v relative to Jim and Jim is moving at J relative to Bill, what is the velocity of the object relative to Bill?

[[Image:Constudtheoryvel.png]]

The illustration above shows that time dilation and phase are going to be involved in the comparison of Bill and Jim's estimate of the velocity of the moving object. If &lt;B&gt;B&lt;/B&gt; is Bill's estimate of the velocity and &lt;B&gt;J&lt;/B&gt; is Jim's estimate then, for an object moving along the x axis:

&lt;B&gt;B = (J + v)/(1 + Jv/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

&lt;/B&gt;Derivation:

:&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt;From the Lorentz transformation equations:

:Distance travelled by object as observed by Jim = (x-vt)/&amp;#8730;(1-v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

:Time taken observed by Jim = (t - (v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)x)/ &amp;#8730; (1-v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

:Where x and t are distance and time observed by Bill.

:Velocity observed by Jim is distance/time: J = (x-vt) / (t - (v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)x)

:Therefore x-vt = J (t - v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;x)

:So x/t, the velocity measured by Bill is: &lt;B&gt;B = (J + v)/(1 + Jv/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)


&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The equation given above only applies to observers moving in the directions shown. The involvement of time dilation and the fact that an object that is stationary for one observer will be moving for the other means that even velocities at right angles to the direction at which Jim and Bill approach each other will be affected (although a different equation must be applied).

===Conservation of Momentum in a 4D Coordinate System===

The conservation of momentum is a basic empirical law of Newtonian physics. It states that the products of the masses and velocities of a set of particles is constant. The way that Bill and Jim record different velocities for the same objects around them means that the Newtonian conservation of momentum law does not apply and is only an empirical approximation for low velocities. Most importantly, if Newtonian momentum is conserved for one observer it is not conserved for another observer moving relative to the first. Einstein originally formulated Relativity Theory using an axiom that the laws of physics are the same for all observers and amended the conservation of momentum law so that it applied in a 4D universe. Modern physics relies on Noether's Theorem:

&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;CMTI12&quot;&gt;To every symmetry corresponds a conservation law. Conversely, for every conservation law there is a corresponding type of symmetry.

&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The symmetrical nature of translations in space implies conservation of linear momentum.&lt;BR&gt;

Rotational symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum.&lt;BR&gt;

Time symmetry implies conservation of energy.&lt;BR&gt;

Invariance with respect to gauge transformations implies conservation of electric charge.
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. If Newtonian momentum, where mass is a constant, is not conserved because the velocity is variable between observers then perhaps the mass changes to compensate for the velocity.&amp;nbsp; If conservation of momentum is expressed as:

Mass(1) x Velocity(1) = Mass(2) x Velocity(2)

Then it can be shown that the conservation equation is true if:

Mass(2) = Mass(1)/&amp;#8730;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;(1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

Where u is the &lt;B&gt;speed&lt;/B&gt; of the object, not the velocity.

In general the mass, m, of an object travelling at speed, u, is: 

&lt;B&gt;m = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;/&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;#8730; (1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

&lt;/B&gt;Where m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt; is the mass of the object when it is at rest relative to the observer. 

In other words, the momentum of an object is conserved but its mass is variable. The variation of mass with speed is a direct consequence of translational symmetry and the existence of a four dimensional universe. This variation in mass with speed is easy to demonstrate in relatively simple particle accelerators because even at half the speed of light the mass is 1.15 times the rest mass.

The new form of the conservation of momentum law suggests that the Newtonian formula for force must be replaced. Force is rate of change of momentum, in Newtonian physics this is the product of a constant mass times a change in velocity (acceleration). In 4D physics this must be calculated in terms of both the change in velocity and the change in mass.

Force = d(m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;B&gt;u&lt;/B&gt;/&amp;#8730;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;(1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;))dt

Where &lt;B&gt;u&lt;/B&gt; is velocity and u is speed.

The kinetic energy of a particle accelerated from rest to velocity u is:

K = &amp;#8747; F dx

But F = d(mu)/dt

K = &amp;#8747; d(mu)/dt dx

K = &amp;#8747; d(mu) dx/dt

dx/dt = u

K = &amp;#8747; (mdu + udm) u 

K = &amp;#8747; (mudu + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm)

In the discussion of momentum above it was shown that the mass of a moving object is related to its mass at rest by:

&lt;B&gt;m = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;/&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;#8730; (1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)
&lt;/B&gt;This can be rewritten as : m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Taking differentials:

2mc&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm - m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;2udu - u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;2mdm = 0

Dividing by 2m:

mu du + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm = c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm

But:

K = &amp;#8747; (mudu + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm)

Therefore, integrating between mass at rest and mass at u:

K = &amp;#8747; c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm = c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; (m-m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)

So :

&lt;B&gt;Kinetic energy = mc&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;The kinetic energy is present as the extra mass due to motion. 

&lt;B&gt;Total energy = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + Kinetic energy = mc&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;The rest mass energy is given by: 

&lt;B&gt;E = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;A result that is amply demonstrated in atomic bombs where the mass of uranium is greater than the mass of the products generated by fission (cesium and rubidium). The excess mass being converted into a cataclysmic release of energy.


&lt;B&gt;The Binomial Expansion of (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

The binomial theorem can be used to expand any expression of the form (a + x )&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; so, (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2
&lt;/SUP&gt;can be expanded by substituting 1 for a and - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; for x.

(a + x )&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; = a&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; + na&lt;SUP&gt;n-1&lt;/SUP&gt;x + n(n-1)/2! na&lt;SUP&gt;n-2&lt;/SUP&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + ...

therefore:

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + (-1/2)(-3/2)/2! v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; + ...

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + 3/8 v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; + 5/16 v&lt;SUP&gt;6&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;6 &lt;/SUP&gt;...

If the velocity is small compared with the speed of light the terms from 3/16 v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; onwards become negligible so:

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; &amp;#8776; 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;


===The Newtonian Approximation for Kinetic Energy===

The kinetic energy of the particle (the energy due to motion) is:

KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;v&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;But it was seen earlier that
m&lt;SUB&gt;v&lt;/SUB&gt; = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2
&lt;/SUP&gt;

So: 

KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;


KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; ((1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; - 1)

But (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; &amp;#8776; 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;

So

&lt;B&gt;KE &amp;#8776; m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; /2

&lt;/B&gt;Which is the Newtonian empirical approximation for kinetic energy. Notice that the full result is derived from symmetries in a 4D universe whereas the Newtonian result is derived from empirical formulae.

==Electricity and Magnetism in a 4D Universe==

One of the greatest achievements of Relativity Theory was to unify electricity and magnetism. These two effects can be seen to be the same phenomena observed in different ways. This is shown in the illustration below.

[[Image:Constudrelmag.png]]

It can be seen that once the idea of space-time is understood the unification of the two fields is straightforward. Jim is moving relative to the wire at the same speed as the negatively charged current carriers so Jim only experiences an electric field. Bill is stationary relative to the wire and observes the electrostatic attraction between Jim and the current carriers as a magnetic field. Bill observes that the charges in the wire are balanced whereas Jim observes an imbalance of charge.

Incidently, the drift velocity of electrons in a wire is about a millimetre per second but the electrons move at about a million metres a second between collisions (See link below).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember! No one has proof that Atlantis really existed. Some people believe that Atlantis is a myth or legend, while others believe it really existed. Like any very old story, there may be some bits that have been made up over the years and other bits that are true. No one can be certain of the truth yet, but maybe one day evidence will be found and we'll find out for sure if the Atlanteans exist 

== Who might they have been? ==
[[File:Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens, by italian Rafael.jpg|thumb|left|Plato, on the left, with his most famous student Aristotle]]
There was a Greek philosopher named Plato who told us the amazing story about the Atlanteans. His stories are our only source for knowing about these people. He said they lived somewhere on an island continent &quot;Beyond the Pillars of Hercules&quot;. The Pillars of Hercules is an old name for the gap between Europe and Africa where the Atlantic Ocean joins the Mediterranean Sea. This would mean that Atlantis was somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.

[[File:De Zuilen van Hercules Gibraltar en Ceuta.jpg|thumb|right|The Pillars of Hercules, seen from the European side]]

Plato said that the Atlanteans first walked into this world 11,000 years ago - that's a pretty long time ago! He also said that they were a very powerful, rich, noble race and that they were very clever scientists knowing things that nobody else did.

Some people think that the legend of the Atlanteans could have been based on the city of Minoans. Atlantis is a European myth so it is likely that the Atlantis stories were based on a European people. The Minoans lived near to Greece and volcanic activity in the area may have &quot;destroyed&quot; Minoan cities in historical times in a similar way to the destruction of Atlantis that Plato described.

Before Plato, even a simple bronze sword might have looked like cutting edge technology, so this may be where the part of the legend that says the Atlanteans were advanced came from. Minoan cities also saw a lot of technology from the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians because these people had to travel through the Minoan cities on their way to Greece. The knowledge and writing of these countries would have made the Minoans quite advanced in their learning as well. This theory seems to fit the legend well.

== Which country they might lived in ==
[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|right|Athanasius Kircher's map of Atlantis, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean]]


We do not know where Atlantis, the homeland of the Atlanteans was. There are many theories and speculations about its location and a lot of people from Europe and Africa claimed Atlantis was located in their land. What we know about Atlantis is that Plato described the Atlanteans' home as beyond the &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; (known as 'Straits of Gibraltar' now) on an island in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlanteans may have lived on Thera an island off the coast of Greece.

==What Plato said==
Plato was a Greek scholar, and also like a student crossed with a teacher. He said that...

&quot;Atlantis was established by the sea god Poseidon. Poseidon had ten sons. Poseidon's eldest son became the ruler of Atlantis. Atlantis was divided into ten sections and each of Poseidon's sons got the kingship of one. The capital city, also known as the City of Atlantis, was renowned for its excellence in science and engineering. The city was circular and surrounded by land and water. At the center of the city was a high mountain called Olympus where there was a temple dedicated to the god of the sea, Poseidon, with a golden statue of him driving a six winged horse.&quot;

This was the way Plato described the city of Atlantis. According to this description some think Atlantis was somewhere near the Azores Islands and that the Azores are the leftovers of destroyed Atlantis. However there are an almost limitless number of places that people think it could be, some claim Cyprus is the remnants of Atlantis, while others claim it to be New Zealand, Tahiti , Cuba or one of many other possible locations.

==The Legend==

The original legend of Atlantis says that the City of Atlantis sank beneath the sea. Many scientists and treasure hunters say that this is possible, but most people think this is just a story. Since 1960 many divers and submarines have looked for this ancient city but so far nobody has found it.

== Missing Japanese ==
There are a few sub-pages with stories in English. If anyone can find the Japanese, we can turn these into Japanese Readers.
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/The Grateful Crane]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/The Bamboo Princess]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/The Tongue-cut Sparrow]]

== Found Japanese texts ==

I found these books which were requested. If I  ever find out how to make these, I will :&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1p36 Deletion Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself and acknowledge that I will be involved in their visit today.
*Let them know that Counselor1 and Dr. Doktour will also be visiting with them today.
*Small talk while walking to the room.
*&quot;What are your main concerns or questions that you would like addressed today?&quot;

==Interim History==
*Explain that all of their concerns will be addressed later in the session, but that I would like to update the medical and developmental history from her last visit in February.
*Who is her pediatrician? Any other physicians?
*Any serious illnesses, hospitalizations or surgeries since February?
*Current Medications?
*Immunizations up to date?

==Review of Systems==
*Any diet or feeding concerns?
*Any changes in skin pigmentation or birth marks?
*Any heart concerns? (cardiologist found none)
*Any bladder problems?
*Any concerns about her hearing? Ear infections? PE tubes?
*Any concerns with her behavior or sleep?
*Any bowel problems? Constipation?
*Any allergies?
*Any concerns about vision or eyes?
*Any concerns about seizures? Starring spells or repetitive behaviors?
*Any other medical concerns (difficulty breathing)

==Developmental Assessment==
*Language
**How many words does she have in her vocabulary?
**Is she learning to sign? How many signs does she know?
**Does she combine words into two word sentences?
**Does she follow one or two step commands?
**Can she point to any body parts?
**How well is she able to indicate her wants?
*Gross Motor
**Is she standing independently?
**Is she cruising?
**Is she walking? Up stairs?
*Visual Motor
**How well does she hold and manipulate a crayon?
**Drink from a cup?
**Uses a spoon to feed? Started using a fork?
**Can she help undress or dress herself?
*Social
**Imitates housework?
**Behavior? (Rocking)

*How do you feel her development compares with other children?
*Do you feel she is making progress?

==Early Intervention==
*Ask about OT, PT and speech therapy.
*How often?
*Where is she receiving services?
*What are they working on and what are the goals?
*Is insurance covering these costs?
*How do you think she is progressing?

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Are all your other children living at home?
*Things must be really hectic attending all her appointments and services on top of having ____ other children at home. How does it all work out?
*Do you have help from other family members or others?
*Do you have contact with any other families with 1p36 deletion syndrome?

==Etiology of 1p36 deletion syndrome (monosomy 1p36)==
*Caused by deletion of the most distal band of the short arm of chromosome1.
*Most clinical manifestations are probably caused by the absence of one copy of a dose-sensitive gene and it is not possible to replace missing genes from chromosomes at this time.
*Prevalence of this deletion is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to as high as 1 in 5,000 (making it the most common terminal deletion)
*Most cases result from sporadic deletions and are not inherited
*1p36 deletion syndrome is usually diagnosed through recognition of the symptoms and characteristics as well as lab testing. This is done using high resolution chromosome analysis, or FISH with a chromosome 1-specific subtelomeric probe. The deletion often doesn't show up clearly with standard cytogenetic banding techniques. (In one group studied, about half were missed with chromosome analysis)
*Patients with a 1p36 deletion have different sized pieces of the chromosome missing and may result in phenotype variability
*Severity of associated disorders varies, but the physical features are very similar
*Degree of MR and ability to acquire complex speech is somewhat dependent on deletion size
*Most deletions affect the chromosome inherited from the mother (68%), but there doesn't seem to be differences in the clinical manifestations based on whether the deletion is on the paternal or maternal chromosome.
*Those with paternally derived deletions tend to have larger deletions than those with maternally derived deletions
*Mechanism causing chromosome breakage is unknown

==Characteristics==
*Children with 1p36 deletion syndrome are all unique individuals, but do have some common characteristics.
*Distinct facial features including: small and pointed chin, flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, ear asymmetry, thickened ear helices, small head, deep-set eyes, large anterior fontanel, clinodactyly and/or short fifth finger
*Most patients have mental retardation
*Most patients have delayed growth and/or difficulty gaining weight. Some have difficulty with sucking and swallowing while others may not grow well even though they eat well. Some older children may become obese.
*Most young children with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development.
*They sit up, walk and talk later than typical children.
*Speech is severely affected with many patients learning only a few words
*Other medical problems: hypotony (which may explain delayed motor skills), hearing loss, seizures, eye/vision problems, hypothyroidism, increased risk for neuroblastoma, heart defects (which have included cardiomyopathy, ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, VSD), and orofacial clefting abnormalities,

==Recurrence Risk for next pregnancy==
*The majority of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome are isolated cases resulting from a de novo deletion. There have been reports of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome whose parents have a balanced translocation.
*Parents should be tested for chromosomal rearrangements because about 6% of parents with an affected child have a balanced translocation
*Translocation increases the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion.
**If no translocation is found the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion are very small

==Prenatal Diagnosis==
*In 1999 a case was reported in which a 1p36 deletion in a fetus was detected when an amniocentesis was performed due to detection of multiple malformations on ultrasound
*Another case was picked up prenatally because of the presence of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound).
*Another was diagnosed prenatally because the mother was known to have a balanced translocation between the short arms of chromosome 1 and 20 that was picked up after their first child had inherited an unbalanced product. (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound)

==Medical Treatment==
*Seizures can usually be controlled with medication
*Medical interventions and feeding therapy may be needed to manage feeding issues
*Early Intervention for developmental delay
*Surgery may be necessary to correct heart defects, cleft lip, cleft palate if present
*A urine screen for neuroblastoma should be performed every 6 months
*Physical examinations should involve palpating the abdomen for lumps which might be neuroblastomas
*There are no clear indications on whether they should continue to be followed by a cardiologist or whether the cardiomyopathy is limited to a congenital form.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Initially parents may experience denial about how severe the developmental delay and mental retardation will be
*Blaming of self or partner may occur
*Stress of having a child with developmental delays and mental retardation
*Stress associated with having a child with serious medical problems especially if they have heart malformations or seizures
*Fear that the child might develop a neuroblastoma or seizures
*Time commitment involved with early intervention services (OT, PT, speech therapy)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1p36 Deletion Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Mental retardation affects 2-3% of the population and chromosome abnormalities account for about 20% of cases
*Improved techniques in cytogenetics (FISH) have helped to identify submicroscopic deletions at the cytogenetic level
*Syndrome is characterized by distinct facial features, mental retardation, and delayed growth
*This condition is likely a contiguous gene deletion syndrome
**There is no uniform region of deletion but rather a spectrum of different deletion sizes with a common minimal region of deletion overlap
**Genotype/phenotype comparisons can help researchers to start to define a region in which to search for candidate genes for specific features

==Etiology of 1p36 deletion syndrome (monosomy 1p36)==
*Caused by deletion of the most distal (telomeric) light band of the short arm of chromosome 1
*Most clinical manifestations are probably caused by the absence of one copy of a dose-sensitive gene
*Patients with a 1p36 deletion have different sized pieces of the chromosome missing and may result in phenotype variability
**Mechanism causing chromosome breakage is unknown
**Severity of associated disorders varies, but the physical features are very similar
**Degree of MR and ability to acquire complex speech is somewhat dependent on deletion size
*Most deletions affect the chromosome inherited from the mother (68%), but there doesn't seem to be differences in the clinical manifestations based on whether the deletion is on the paternal or maternal chromosome.
*Those with paternally derived deletions tend to have larger deletions than those with maternally derived deletions

==Prevalence==
*Prevalence of this deletion is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to as high as 1 in 5,000 (making it the most common terminal deletion)
*Most cases result from sporadic deletions and are not inherited
*1p36 deletion syndrome is usually diagnosed through recognition of the symptoms and characteristics as well as lab testing.
**This is done using high-resolution chromosome analysis or FISH with a chromosome 1-specific subtelomeric probe.
**The deletion often doesn't show up clearly with standard cytogenetic banding techniques.

==Characteristics==
*Children with 1p36 deletion syndrome are all unique individuals, but do have some common characteristics.
*Distinct facial features including:
**Large anterior fontanel (~100% of patients)
**Small and pointed chin (~80%)
**Flat nasal bridge (~65%)
**Clinodactyly and/or short fifth finger (~64%)
**Low-set ears, ear asymmetry (~59%)
**Thickened ear helices (~53%)
**Small head
**Deep-set eyes (~50%)
*Most patients have mental retardation
*Most patients have delayed growth (~85%) and/or difficulty gaining weight
**Some have difficulty with sucking and swallowing while others may not grow well even though they eat well.
**Some older children may become obese.
*Most young children with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development.
**They sit up, walk and talk later than typical children.
*Speech is severely affected with many patients learning only a few words
*Other medical problems:
**Hypotony (which may explain delayed motor skills) (seen in ~92%)
**Hearing loss (~56%)
**Seizures (~72%)
***KCNAB2 is a voltage-gated K+ channel beta-subunit gene that has been localized to 1p36 and thought to be associated with the epilepsy phenotype of 1p36
**Eye/vision problems (~75%)
**Hypothyroidism
**Increased risk for neuroblastoma
**Heart defects (which have included cardiomyopathy, ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, VSD)
**Orofacial clefting abnormalities
***SKI, a proto-oncogene located at distal 1p36.3 has been found to be deleted in a number of patients tested and may contribute to facial clefting seen in this syndrome
***SKI overexpression has suggested that the gene is involved in neural tube development and muscle differentiations.

==Recurrence Risk for next pregnancy==
*The majority of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome are isolated cases resulting from a de novo deletion. There have been reports of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome whose parents have a balanced translocation.
*Parents should be tested for chromosomal rearrangements because about 6% of parents with an affected child have a balanced translocation
*Translocation increases the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion.
**If no translocation is found the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion are very small

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''18q Deletion Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Caused by the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18 (or, more often, a section of it)

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*The estimated frequency of the deletions syndromes of chromosome 18 (18p- &amp; 18q-) is about 1/40,000 births. This would mean that about 100 babies per year in the United States are born with 18p- and 18q-. 

*80% of cases occur due to de novo mutations; 10% of cases are due to a parental translocation; the remaining 10% are mosaic, usually resulting in a less severe phenotype

==Clinical Features==
This syndrome is variable in its severity. The symptoms usually correlate with the size of the deletion.

Key features:

*Genu varum (9%)
*Brachycephaly (8%)
*Umbilical hernia (7%)
*Coloboma (4%)
*Eczema (4%)
*Inguinal hernia (4%)
*Large protruding forehead (4%)
*Dysplastic teeth (4%)
*Delayed fontanel closure (4%)
*Chorea (3%)
*Low posterior hairline (3%)
*Scoliosis (3%)
*Strawberry birthmark on face  (3%)
*Short neck  (3%)
*Severe feeding problems (3%)

==Age of onset, natural history, life span==
*Symptoms are apparent from birth in most cases
*Natural history: Most patients have IQs between 40 and 85, normal IQ (100 or above) has also been reported. Short stature is common, as are various hearing and vision problems. Behavioral problems can occur, sometimes causing patients to exhibit autistic-like behaviors. These symptoms are variable, so a patient with a smaller deletion will have a milder phenotype than will a patient missing all of 18q.
*Life span is variable, but may be decreased from the general population, depending upon severity of deletion and various congenital diseases or defects.

==Testing==
Diagnosis is confirmed by chromosome studies

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
Patients should be monitored by endocrinology, audiology, ophthalmology, genetics, neurology, orthopedics, immunology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and Early Intervention.

Recent research has uncovered potential treatment for short stature and dysmyelination caused by 18q-.  Growth hormone treatment has been shown to potentially increase IQ in children with 18q-.  A 2005 study performed by Cody ''et al.'' showed that over a treatment period of 37 months an average nIQ increase of 17 pts, and an increase in height standard deviation score of 1.7.  All but one of the children who tested within measureable range (&gt;50) to the nonverbal IQ test had, at the end of the study, an IQ within normal range (i.e., &gt;70).

==Psychosocial issues==
Guilt, fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, and disbelief are common emotions associated with this diagnosis. Parents may feel overwhelmed. Financial concerns, issues affecting family dynamics, and what care may be needed for the individual with 18q- are all things that should be addressed with parents.

Amplitude modulation is one of the earliest radio modulation techniques.
The receivers used to listen to AM-DSB-C are perhaps the simplest receivers of any radio modulation technique; which may be why that version of amplitude modulation is still widely used today.
By the end of this module, you will know the most popular versions of amplitude modulation, some popular AM modulation circuits, and some popular AM demodulation circuits.

== Amplitude Modulation ==

{{Wikipedia|Amplitude_modulation}}

Amplitude modulation (AM) occurs when the amplitude of a carrier wave is modulated, to correspond to a source signal. In AM, we have an equation that looks like this:

::::&lt;math&gt;A_{signal}(t) = A(t) \sin (\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also see that the phase of this wave is irrelevant, and does not change (so we don't even include it in the equation).

{{Info|AM Radio uses AM modulation}}

AM Double-Sideband (AM-DSB for short) can be broken into two different, distinct types: Carrier, and Suppressed Carrier varieties (AM-DSB-C and AM-DSB-SC, for short, respectively). This page will talk about both varieties, and will discuss the similarities and differences of each.
::[[Image:Amfm2.gif|left|thumb]]

===Characteristics===

====Modulation Index====

Amplitude modulation requires a high frequency constant carrier and a low frequency modulation signal.

:A wave carrier is of the form &lt;math&gt;e_c  = E_c \cos \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:A wave modulation signal is of the form &lt;math&gt; e_m  = E_m \cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the amplitude of the high frequency carrier takes on the shape of the lower frequency modulation signal, forming what is called a modulation envelope.

::[[Image:Am_envelope.jpg|left|thumb]]

The modulation index is defined as the ratio of the modulation signal amplitude to the carrier amplitude.

::::&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = \frac{{E_m }}{{E_c }}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le m_{am}  \le 1&lt;/math&gt;


The overall signal can be described by:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{am}  = \left( {E_c  + E_m \cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)\cos \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


More commonly, the carrier amplitude is normalized to one and the am equation is written as:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m_{am} \cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)\cos \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:In most literature this expression is simply written as: 

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \left( {1 + m\cos \omega _m t} \right)\cos \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;


:If the modulation index is zero (&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;) the signal is simply a constant amplitude carrier.

:If the modulation index is 1 (&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;), the resultant waveform has maximum or 100% amplitude modulation.

::[[Image:AM signals.svg|left|thumb]]

====Sidebands====

Expanding the normalized AM equation:

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \sin \omega _c t + \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- 
See: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrigonometricAdditionFormulas.html --&gt;

where:

:::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt; represents the carrier

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; represents the lower sideband

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; represents the upper sideband


The sidebands are centered on the carrier frequency. They are the sum and difference frequencies of the carrier and modulation signals. In the above example, they are just single frequencies, but normally the baseband modulation signal is a range of frequencies and hence two bands are formed.

=== AM Modulator ===

The standard amplitude modulation equation is:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;


From this we notice that AM involves a multiplication process. There are several ways to perform this function electronically. The simplest method uses a switch.


====Switching Modulators====

Switching modulators can be placed into two categories: unipolar and bipolar.


=====Bipolar Switching Modulator=====

The bipolar switch is the easiest to visualize. Note that an AM waveform appears to consist of a low frequency dc signal whose polarity is reversing at a carrier rate.

::[[Image:Bipolar_modulator_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]

The AM signal can be created by multiplying a dc modulation signal by ±1. 

::[[Image:Bipolar_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]

However, since the square wave contains lots of harmonics, the resulting multiplication will contain lots of extraneous frequencies. Mathematically, the spectrum of the square wave signal (given by the Fourier Transform) is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{4}{{n\pi }}} \sin \left( {\frac{{n\pi }}{2}} \right)\cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:This seems complicated but, if the square wave switching function has a 50% duty cycle, this simplifies to:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \frac{4}{\pi }\sum\limits_{n = 1,3,5...}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}} \cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:This tells us that the square wave is actually composed of a series of cosines (phase shifted sines) at odd multiples of the fundamental switching frequency. Therefore, using this signal to multiply the baseband signal results in AM signals being generated at each of the odd harmonics of the switching (carrier) frequencies. Since the amplitude of the harmonics decreases rapidly, this technique is practical for only the first few harmonics, and produces an enormous amount of unwanted signals (noise).

::[[Image:Switching_mod_spectrum.gif|left|thumb]]


:A band pass filter can be used to select any one of the AM signals. The number of different output frequencies can be significantly reduced if the multiplier accepts sinewaves at the carrier input.

{{wikipediapar||Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission}}
:Removing the DC component from the input eliminates the carrier signal and creates DSBSC modulation.

Physically this is done by reversing the signal leads:

::[[Image:Switching_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


The process of reversing the polarity of a signal is easily accomplished by placing two switch pairs in the output of a differential amplifier. The [http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/MC1496-D.PDF Mc1496 Balanced Modulator] is an example of such a device.

::[[Image:Transistor_switching_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Unipolar Switching Modulator=====

As previously mentioned, an AM signal can be created by multiplying a dc modulation signal by 0 &amp; 1.

::[[Image:Pulse.gif|left|thumb]]


:The spectrum of this signal is defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \frac{1}{2} + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{2}{{n\pi }}\sin \left( {\frac{{n\pi }}{2}} \right)} \cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


Physically this is done by turning the modulation signal on and off at the carrier rate:

::[[Image:Gated_carrier.gif|left|thumb]]


A high amplitude carrier can be used to turn a diode on and off. A dc bias is placed on the modulation signal to make certain that only the carrier (not the modulation signal) can reverse bias the diode.

::[[Image:Gated_carrier_circuit.gif|left|thumb]]  
::[[Image:Unipolar_mod_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]


It may not seem obvious, but the output of this circuit contains a series of AM signals. A bandpass filter is needed to extract the desired one. Normally it is the 1st or 3rd harmonic of the fundamental. (The 1st harmonic is the fundamental.)


=====Collector Modulator=====

The diode switching modulator is incapable of producing high power signals since it is a passive device. A transistor can be used to overcome this limitation.  A collector modulator is used for high level modulation.

::[[Image:Collector_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Square Law Modulator=====

The voltage-current relationship of a diode is nonlinear near the knee and is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = av\left( t \right) + bv^2 \left( t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:The coefficient ''a'' and ''b'' are constants associated with the particular diode.


::[[Image:Diode_curve.gif|left|thumb]]


Amplitude modulation occurs if the diode is kept in the square law region when signals combine.

::[[Image:Square_law_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


:Let the injected signals be of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;k = {\rm{ dc}}\;{\rm{bias}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;e_m  = E_m \sin \omega _m t = {\rm{modulation}}\;{\rm{signal}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;e_c  = E_c \sin \omega _c t = {\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{signal}}&lt;/math&gt;


:The voltage applied across the diode and resistor is given by:


::::&lt;math&gt;v\left( t \right) = k + e_m  + e_c &lt;/math&gt;


:The current in the diode and hence in the resistor is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = a\left( {k + e_m  + e_c } \right) + b\left( {k + e_m  + e_c } \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;


: Which expands to:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = \underbrace {k\left( {a + bk} \right)}_{{\rm{dc}}} + \underbrace {\left( {a + 2bk} \right)e_m }_{{\rm{original}}\;{\rm{modulating}}\;{\rm{signal}}} + \underbrace {\left( {a + 2bk} \right)e_c }_{{\rm{carrier}}} + \underbrace {2be_m e_c }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{sidebands}}} + \underbrace {be_m^2 }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{x}}\;{\rm{modulating}}\;{\rm{frequency}}} + \underbrace {be_c^2 }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{x}}\;{\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Modulation Index Measurement====

It is sometimes difficult to determine the modulation index, particularly for complex signals. However, it is relatively easy to determine it by critical observation.&lt;br /&gt;
There are two practical methods to derive the modulation index:&lt;br /&gt;
# By representing an AM wave as it is in time domain.(using maxima - minima terms.)
# By Trapezoidal method.
# 
::[[Image:Am_modulation_setup.gif|left|thumb]]


The trapezoidal oscilloscope display can be used to determine the modulation index.

::[[Image:Trapazoidal_display.gif|left|thumb]]

::AM modulation index: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{{E_{\max }  - E_{\min } }}{{E_{\max }  + E_{\min } }}&lt;/math&gt;

The trapezoidal display makes it possible to quickly recognize certain types of problems, which would reduce the AM signal quality.

::[[Image:Trapezoidal_displays.gif|left|thumb]]


The highest authorized carrier power for AM broadcast in the US is 50 kilowatts, although directional stations are permitted 52.65 kilowatts to compensate for losses in the phasing system. The ERP can be much higher

====C-QUAM====

The basic idea behind the C-Quam modulator is actually quite simple. The output stage is an ordinary AM modulator however; the carrier signal has been replaced by an amplitude limited vector modulator. Therefore, the limiter output is really a phase-modulated signal.

::[[Image:C-QUAM_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

A standard AM receiver will detect the amplitude variations as L+R. A stereo receiver will also detect the phase variations and to extract L-R. It will then process these signals to separate the left and right channels.

To enable the stereo decoder, a 25 Hz pilot tone is added to the L-R channel.



===AM Receivers===

The most common receivers in use today are the super heterodyne type. They consist of:

::*Antenna
::*RF amplifier
::*Local Oscillator and Mixer
::*IF Section
::*Detector and Amplifier

The need for these subsystems can be seen when one considers the much simpler and inadequate TRF or tuned radio frequency amplifier.

====TRF Amplifier====

It is possible to design an RF amplifier to accept only a narrow range of frequencies, such as one radio station on the AM band.


::[[Image:TRF_amplifier.gif|left|thumb]]

By adjusting the center frequency of the tuned circuit, all other input signals can be excluded.

::[[Image:Channel_selection.gif|left|thumb]]

The AM band ranges from about 500 kHz to 1600 kHz. Each station requires 10 kHz of this spectrum, although the baseband signal is only 5 kHz.

Recall that for a tuned circuit: &lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The center or resonant frequency in an RLC network is most often adjusted by varying the capacitor value. However, the Q remains approximately constant as the center frequency is adjusted. This suggests that as the bandwidth varies as the circuit is tuned.

:For example, the Q required at the lower end of the AM band to select only one radio station would be approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B} = \frac{{500\;kHz}}{{10\;kHz}} = 50&lt;/math&gt;


:As the tuned circuit is adjusted to the higher end of the AM band, the resulting bandwidth is:

::::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{{f_c }}{Q} = \frac{{1600\;kHz}}{{50}} = 30\;kHz&lt;/math&gt;


A bandwidth this high could conceivably pass three adjacent stations, thus making meaningful reception impossible.

To prevent this, the incoming RF signal is heterodyned to a fixed IF or intermediate frequency and passed through a constant bandwidth circuit.


====Superheterodyne Receiver====

::[[Image:Heterodyne.gif|left|thumb]]

The RF amplifier boosts the RF signal into the mixer.  It has broad tuning and amplifies not just one RF station, but many of them simultaneously. It also amplifies any input noise and even contributes some of its own.

The other mixer input is a high frequency sine wave created by a local oscillator. In AM receivers, it is always 455 kHz above the desired station carrier frequency. An ideal mixer will combine the incoming carrier with the local oscillator to create sum and difference frequencies. . 

A real mixer combines two signals and creates a host of new frequencies:

::• A dc level
::• The original two frequencies
::• The sum and difference of the two input frequencies
::• Harmonics of the two input frequencies
::• Sums and differences of all of the harmonics

Since the RF amplifier passes several radio stations at once, the mixer output can be very complex. However, the only signal of real interest is the difference between the desired station carrier frequency and the local oscillator frequency. This difference frequency, also called the IF (intermediate frequency) will alway be 455 kHz. By passing this through a 10 kHz BPF (band pass filter) centered at 455 kHz, the bulk of the unwanted signals can be eliminated.


=====Local Oscillator Frequency=====

Since the mixer generates sum and difference frequencies, it is possible to generate the 455 kHz IF signal if the local oscillator is either above or below the IF. The inevitable question is which is preferable.


::'''Case I The local Oscillator is above the IF.''' This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 + 455) kHz to (1600 + 455) kHz or approximately 1 to 2 MHz. It is normally the capacitor in a tuned RLC circuit, which is varied to adjust the center frequency while the inductor is left fixed. 

::Since &lt;math&gt;f_c  = \frac{1}{{2\pi \sqrt {LC} }}&lt;/math&gt; 


::solving for ''C'' we obtain &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{{L\left( {2\pi f_c } \right)^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


::When the tuning frequency is a maximum, the tuning capacitor is a minimum and vice versa. Since we know the range of frequencies to be created, we can deduce the range of capacitance required.

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \frac{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\max } } \right)^2 }}{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\min } } \right)^2 }} = \left( {\frac{{2\;MHz}}{{1\;MHz}}} \right)^2  = 4&lt;/math&gt;


Making a capacitor with a 4:1 value change is well within the realm of possibility.


::'''Case II The local Oscillator is below the IF'''. This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 - 455) kHz to (1600 - 455) kHz or approximately 45 kHz to 1145 kHz, in which case:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \left( {\frac{{1145\;kHz}}{{45\;kHz}}} \right)^2  \approx 648&lt;/math&gt;


It is not practical to make a tunable capacitor with this type of range. Therefore the local oscillator in a standard AM receiver is above the radio band.

=====Image Frequency=====

Just as there are two oscillator frequencies, which can create the same IF, two different station frequencies can create the IF. The undesired station frequency is known as the image frequency.

::[[Image:Image_frequency.gif|left|thumb]]

If any circuit in the radio front end exhibits non-linearities, there is a possibility that other combinations may create the intermediate frequency. Once the image frequency is in the mixer, there is no way to remove it since it is now heterodyned into the same IF band as the desired station.

== AM Demodulation ==
====AM Detection====

There are two basic types of AM detection, coherent and non-coherent. Of these two, the non-coherent is the simpler method.

::*Non-coherent detection does not rely on regenerating the carrier signal. The information or modulation envelope can be removed or detected by a diode followed by an audio filter.
::*Coherent detection relies on regenerating the carrier and mixing it with the AM signal. This creates sum and difference frequencies. The difference frequency corresponds to the original modulation signal.

Both of these detection techniques have certain drawbacks. Consequently, most radio receivers use a combination of both.


=====Envelope Detector=====

::[[Image:Envelope_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

When trying to demodulate an AM signal, it seems like good sense that only the amplitude of the signal needs to be examined. By only examining the amplitude of the signal at any given time, we can remove the carrier signal from our considerations, and we can examine the original signal. Luckily, we have a tool in our toolbox that we can use to examine the amplitude of a signal: The Envelope Detector.


An envelope detector is simply a half wave rectifier followed by a low pass filter. In the case of commercial AM radio receivers, the detector is placed after the IF section. The carrier at this point is 455 kHz while the maximum envelope frequency is only 5 kHz. Since the ripple component is nearly 100 times the frequency of the highest baseband signal and does not pass through any subsequent audio amplifiers.

:An AM signal where the carrier frequency is only 10 times the envelope frequency would have considerable ripple:

::[[Image:Exagerated_am_ripple.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Synchronous Detector=====

In a synchronous or coherent detector, the incoming AM signal is mixed with the original carrier frequency.

::[[Image:Synchronous_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

If you think this looks suspiciously like a mixer, you are absolutely right! A synchronous detector is one where the difference frequency between the two inputs is zero Hz. Of in other words, the two input frequencies are the same. Let's check the math.

Recall that the AM input is mathematically defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \underbrace {\sin \omega _c t}_{{\rm{Carrier}}} + \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Lower}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}} - \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Upper}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}}&lt;/math&gt;


:At the multiplier output, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;{\rm{mixer}}\;{\rm{out  =  }}e_{am}  \times \sin \omega _c t = \underbrace { - \frac{m}{2}\sin \omega _m t}_{{\rm{Original}}\;{\rm{Modulation}}\;{\rm{Signal}}}\underbrace { - \frac{1}{2}\sin 2\omega _c t - \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t + \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{AM}}\;{\rm{signal}}\;{\rm{centered}}\;{\rm{at}}\;{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{times}}\;{\rm{the}}\;{\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}}&lt;/math&gt;


The high frequency component can be filtered off leaving only the original modulation signal.

This technique has one serious drawback. The problem is how to create the exact carrier frequency. If the frequency is not exact, the entire baseband signal will be shifted by the difference. A shift of only 50 Hz will make the human voice unrecognizable. It is possible to use a PLL (phase locked loop), but making one tunable for the entire AM band is not trivial.

As a result, most radio receivers use an oscillator to create a fixed intermediate frequency. This is then followed by an envelope detector or a fixed frequency PLL.

=====Squaring Detector=====

The squaring detector is also a synchronous or coherent detector. It avoids the problem of having to recreate the carrier by simply squaring the input signal. It essentially uses the AM signal itself as a sort of wideband carrier.

::[[Image:Squaring_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

:The output of the multiplier is the square of the input AM signal:

::::&lt;math&gt;{\left( {e_{am} } \right)^2  = \left( {\sin \omega _c t + \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t} \right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;


Since the input is being multiplied by the  &lt;math&gt;{\sin \omega _c t}&lt;/math&gt; component, one of the resulting difference terms is the original modulation signal.
The principle difficulty with this approach is trying to create a linear, high frequency multiplier.

== AM-DSBSC ==

AM-DSB-SC is characterized by the following transmission equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A s(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to notice that s(t) can contain a negative value. AM-DSB-SC requires a coherent receiver, because the modulation data can go negative, and therefore the receiver needs to know that the signal is negative (and not just phase shifted). AM-DSB-SC systems are very susceptible to frequency shifting and phase shifting on the receiving end. In this equation, A is the transmission amplitude.

Double side band suppressed carrier modulation is simply AM without the broadcast carrier. Recall that the AM signal is defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t = \sin \omega _c t + \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The carrier term in the spectrum can be eliminated by removing the dc offset from the modulating signal:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{DSBSC}  = m\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;



=== Double Balanced Ring Modulator ===

One of the circuits which is capable of creating DSBSC is the double balance ring modulator.

::[[Image:Ring_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


If the carrier is large enough to cause the diodes to switch states, then the circuit acts like a diode switching modulator:

::[[Image:Ring_modulator_2.gif|left|thumb]]

The modulation signal is inverted at the carrier rate. This is essentially multiplication by ±1. Since the transformers cannot pass dc, there is no term which when multiplied can create an output carrier. Since the diodes will switch equally well on either cycle, the modulation signal is effectively being
multiplied by a 50% duty cycle square wave creating numerous DSBSC signals, each centered at an odd multiple of the carrier frequency. Bandpass filters are used to extract the frequency of interest.

Some IC balanced modulators use this technique, but use transistors instead of diodes to perform the switching.


=== Push Pull Square Law Balanced Modulator ===

::[[Image:Push_pull_mod.gif|left|thumb]]


This circuit uses the same principles as the diode square law modulator. Since dc cannot pass through the transformer, it would be expected that there would be no output signal at the carrier frequency.

The drain current vs. gate-source voltage is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_d  = i_0  + av_{gs}  + v_{gs}^2 &lt;/math&gt;


:The net drain current in the output transformer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = i_{d1}  - i_{d2}  = i_0  + av_{gs1}  + bv_{gs1}^2  - \left( {i_0  + av_{gs2}  + bv_{gs2}^2 } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = a\left( {v_{gs1}  - v_{gs2} } \right) + b\left( {v_{gs1}  + v_{gs2} } \right)\left( {v_{gs1}  - v_{gs2} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:By applying KVL around the gate loops we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;v_{gs1}  = \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c \quad \quad \quad \quad v_{gs2}  =  - \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c &lt;/math&gt;


:Putting it all together we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = a\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  + \frac{{e_m }}{2} - e_c } \right) + b\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  - \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c } \right)\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  + \frac{{e_m }}{2} - e_c } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = ae_m  + 2be_c e_m &lt;/math&gt;


:From this we note that the first term is the originating modulation signal and can easily be filtered off by a high pass filter. The second term is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:which is AM DSBSC.

== AM-DSB-C ==

In contrast to AM-DSB-SC is AM-DSB-C, which is categorized by the following equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A [s(t) + c] \cos (2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where c is a positive term representing the carrier. If the term &lt;math&gt;[s(t) + c]&lt;/math&gt; is always non-negative, we can receive the AM-DSB-C signal non-coherently, using a simple envelope detector to remove the cosine term. The +c term is simply a constant DC signal and can be removed by using a blocking capacitor.

It is important to note that in AM-DSB-C systems, a large amount of power is wasted in the transmission sending a &quot;boosted&quot; carrier frequency. since the carrier contains no information, it is considered to be wasted energy. The advantage to this method is that it greatly simplifies the receiver design, since there is no need to generate a coherent carrier signal at the receiver. For this reason, this is the transmission method used in conventional AM radio.

AM-DSB-SC and AM-DSB-C both suffer in terms of bandwidth from the fact that they both send two identical (but reversed) frequency &quot;lobes&quot;, or bands. These bands (the upper band and the lower band) are exactly mirror images of each other, and therefore contain identical information. Why can't we just cut one of them out, and save some bandwidth? The answer is that we can cut out one of the bands, but it isn't always a good idea. The technique of cutting out one of the sidebands is called '''Amplitude Modulation Single-Side-Band''' (AM-SSB). AM-SSB has a number of problems, but also some good aspects. A compromise between AM-SSB and the two AM-DSB methods is called '''Amplitude Modulation Vestigial-Side-Band''' (AM-VSB), which uses less bandwidth then the AM-DSB methods, but more than the AM-SSB.

=== Transmitter ===

A typical AM-DSB-C transmitter looks like this:

              c    cos(...)
              |       |
 Signal ----&gt;(+)----&gt;(X)----&gt; AM-DSB-C

which is a little more complicated than an AM-DSB-SC transmitter.

=== Receiver ===

An AM-DSB-C receiver is very simple:

 AM-DSB-C ----&gt;|Envelope Filter|----&gt;|Capacitor|----&gt; Signal

The capacitor blocks the DC component, and effectively removes the +c term.

== AM-SSB ==

To send an AM-SSB signal, we need to remove one of the sidebands from an AM-DSB signal. This means that we need to pass the AM-DSB signal through a filter, to remove one of the sidebands. The filter, however, needs to be a very high order filter, because we need to have a very aggressive roll-off. One sideband needs to pass the filter almost completely unchanged, and the other sideband needs to be stopped completely at the filter.

To demodulate an AM-SSB signal, we need to perform the following steps:

#Low-pass filter, to remove noise
#Modulate the signal ''again'' by the carrier frequency
#Pass through another filter, to remove high-frequency components
#Amplify the signal, because the previous steps have attenuated it significantly.

AM-SSB is most efficient in terms of bandwidth, but there is a significant added cost involved in terms of more complicated hardware to send and receive this signal. For this reason, AM-SSB is rarely seen as being cost effective.


Single sideband is a form of AM with the carrier and one sideband removed. In normal AM broadcast, the transmitter is rated in terms of the carrier power. SSB transmitters attempt to eliminate the carrier and one of the sidebands. Therefore, transmitters are rated in PEP (peak envelope power).

::::&lt;math&gt;PEP = \frac{{\left( {{\rm{peak}}\;{\rm{envelope}}\;{\rm{voltage}}} \right)^2 }}{{2R_L }}&lt;/math&gt;

::With normal voice signals, an SSB transmitter outputs 1/4 to 1/3 PEP.

There are numerous variations of SSB:

::*SSB - Single sideband - amateur radio
::*SSSC - Single sideband suppressed carrier - a small pilot carrier is transmitted
::*ISB - Independent sideband - two separate sidebands with a suppressed carrier. Used in radio telephony.
::*VSB - Vestigial sideband - a partial sideband. Used in broadcast TV.
::*ACSSB - Amplitude companded SSB

There are several advantages of using SSB:

::• More efficient spectrum utilization
::• Less subject to selective fading
::• More power can be placed in the intelligence signal
::• 10 to 12 dB noise reduction due to bandwidth limiting


===Filter Method===

The simplest way to create SSB is to generate DSBSC and then use a bandpass filter to extract one of the sidebands.

::[[Image:Filter_sideband.gif|left|thumb]]


This technique can be used at relatively low carrier frequencies. At high frequencies, the ''Q'' of the filter becomes unacceptably high. The required ''Q'' necessary to filter off one of the sidebands can be approximated by:


::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where:

::::&lt;math&gt;f_c  = {\rm{ carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = {\rm{ sideband}}\;{\rm{separation}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;S = {\rm{ sideband}}\;{\rm{suppression}}\;{\rm{(not}}\;{\rm{in}}\;{\rm{dB)}}&lt;/math&gt;


Several types of filters are used to suppress unwanted sidebands:

::*LC - Maximum Q = 200
::*Ceramic - Maximum Q = 2000
::*Mechanical - Maximum Q = 10,000
::*Crystal - Maximum Q = 50,000

In order to reduce the demands placed upon the filter, a double heterodyne technique can be used.

::[[Image:SSB_double_heterodyne.gif|left|thumb]]


The first local oscillator has a relatively low frequency thus enabling the removal of one of the sidebands produced by the first mixer. The signal is then heterodyned a second time, creating another pair of sidebands. However, this time they are separated by a sufficiently large gap that one can be removed by the band limited power amplifier or antenna matching network.


::'''Example'''

::Observe the spectral distribution under the following conditions:

:::• Audio baseband = 100 HZ to 5 KHz
:::• LO1 = 100 kHz
:::• LO2 = 50 MHz

:The spectral output of the first mixer is:

::[[Image:First_mixer.gif]]

::If the desired sideband suppression is 80 dB, the ''Q'' required to filter off one of the sidebands is approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;S = \log ^{ - 1} \left( {\frac{{80}}{{20}}} \right) = 10^4&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}} = \frac{{100 \times 10^3 \sqrt {10^4 } }}{{4 \times 200}} = 12500&lt;/math&gt;


:It is evident that a crystal filter would be needed to remove the unwanted sideband.

:After the filter, only one sideband is left. In this example, we’ll retain the USB. The spectrum after the second mixer is:

::[[Image:SSB modulator second mixer output.gif]]

:The ''Q'' required to suppress one of the side bands by 80 dB is approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}} = \frac{{50 \times 10^6 \sqrt {10^4 } }}{{4 \times 200.2 \times 10^3 }} = 6244&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus, we note that the required Q drops in half.

This SSB filter technique is used in radiotelephone applications.


===Phase Shift Method===

::[[Image:SSB_phase_shift.gif|left|thumb]]


The output from the top mixer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The output from the bottom mixer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\cos \omega _m t\cos \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t + \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The output of the sumer is:

::::&lt;math&gt;\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; 

:which corresponds to the lower sideband.

The major difficulty with this technique is the need to provide a constant 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; phase shift over the entire input audio band. To overcome this obstacle, the Weaver or third method uses an audio sub carrier, which is phase shifted.


===Weaver Method===

The Weaver or ‘third’ method places the baseband signal on a low frequency quadrature carrier.

::[[Image:SSB_Weaver.gif|left|thumb]]


This has the advantage of not requiring a broadband phase shifter however; the use of four mixers makes it awkward and seldom used.

::[[Image:AM_waveforms.gif|left|thumb]]

=== SSB Transmitter ===

AM-SSB transmitters are a little more complicated:
            
           cos(...)
              |
 Signal ----&gt;(X)----&gt;|Low-Pass Filter|----&gt; AM-SSB

The filter must be a very high order, for reasons explained in that chapter.

=== SSB Receiver ===

An AM-SSB receiver is a little bit complicated as well:

           cos(...)
              |
 AM-SSB ----&gt;(X)----&gt;|Low-Pass Filter|----&gt;|Amplifier|----&gt; Signal

This filter doesnt need to be a very high order, like the transmitter has.

These receivers require extremely stable oscillators, good adjacent channel selectivity, and typically use a double conversion technique. Envelope detectors cannot be used since the envelope varies at twice the frequency of the AM envelope.

Stable oscillators are needed since the detected signal is proportional to the difference between the untransmitted carrier and the instantaneous side band. A small shift of 50 Hz makes the received signal unusable.

SSB receivers typically use fixed frequency tuning rather than continuous tuning as found on most radios. Crystal oscillators are often used to select the fixed frequency channels.

== AM-VSB ==

As a compromise between AM-SSB and AM-DSB is AM-VSB. To make an AM-VSB signal, we pass an AM-DSB signal through a lowpass filter. Now, the trick is that we pass it through a low-order filter, so that some of the filtered sideband still exists. This filtered part of the sideband is called the &quot;Vestige&quot; of the sideband, hence the name &quot;Vestigial Side Band&quot;.

AM-VSB signals then can get demodulated in a similar manner to AM-SSB. We can see when we remodulate the input signal, the two vestiges (the positive and negative mirrors of each other) over-lap each other, and add up to the original, unfiltered value!

AM-VSB is less expensive to implement then AM-SSB because we can use lower-order filters.

== Definition ==

What is PAM? Pulse-Amplitude Modulation is &quot;pulse shaping&quot;. Essentially, communications engineers realize that the shape of the pulse in the time domain can positively or negatively affect the characteristics of that pulse in the frequency domain. There is no one way to shape a pulse, there are all sorts of different pulse shapes that can be used, but in practice, there are only a few pulse shapes that are worth the effort. These chapters will discuss some of the common pulses, and will develop equations for working with any generic pulse.

== Square Wave ==

The most logical way to transmit a digital signal is through a stream of pulses. One distinct pulse for a digital &quot;1&quot;, and another distinct pulse for a digital &quot;0&quot;. Intuitively, a square pulse will transmit this data, and there are a number of different ways to transmit the data using

The square wave is a basic choice for transmitting digital data because it is easy to transmit, and is generally easy to receive. If we take the fourier transform of a square wave, we get a sinc function. A sinc function is a never-ending function, which means that a square wave in the time domain has a very wide bandwidth. When using a square wave, there will always be a trade-off, because high-frequency components of the square wave will be attenuated by the channel, and the resultant waveform will be more prone to error on the other end.

=== Unipolar Square Wave ===

A unipolar square wave is a wave where a logical 1 is transmitted using a square pulse of height A. Then a logical 0 is transmitted with a 0 voltage.

=== Bipolar Square Wave ===

A bipolar square wave is a square wave where a 1 is transmitted with a pulse of height A/2, and a 0 is transmitted with a pulse of -A/2.

== Other pulses ==

It turns out that simply by changing the shape of the pulse (changing it away from a square wave), we can create a signal with better properties: lower bandwidth, lower error rate, etc... This section will talk about a few different pulses.

== Sinc ==

By the property of duality, however, we can see that if we have a sinc wave in the time domain, we will have a square-shape in the frequency domain. This is an interesting result, because it means that we can transmit a sinc shape with definite bandwidth bounds, and it can travel through a channel in its entirety without being attenuated, or losing any harmonics!

== Comparison ==

Here we will show a basic comparison between square pulses and sinc pulses:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 | '''Metric''' || '''Square Pulse''' || '''Sinc Pulse'''
 |-
 | Bandwidth || Large bandwidth || Small bandwidth
 |-
 | Jitter || Not susceptible to Jitter || Very susceptible to Jitter
 |-
 | Noise || Very susceptible to Noise || Susceptible to Noise
 |-
 | ISS || Not affected by ISS|| Affected heavily by ISS
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

== slew-rate-limited pulses ==

Most systems that use RS232, RS485, or high speed clocks use slew-rate-limited drivers.
Some use driver chips with integrated slew-rate limiting; other systems use digital driver chips that put sharp square pulses on their output pins, then an external slew-rate-limiting resistor&lt;ref&gt;
[http://massmind.org/techref/electips.htm#series_resistor slew-rate-limiting resistor]
&lt;/ref&gt; between that output pin and the rest of the system.

== Raised-Cosine Rolloff ==

Sinc pulses use less bandwidth, but they are very susceptible to jitter. Conversely, Square pulses have a large bandwidth, but are very resistant to jitter. The decision seems hopeless, but the intrepid communications engineer will try to find a 3rd option. The 3rd option is called the &quot;Raised-Cosine Rolloff&quot; pulse, and has the best characteristics of each wave. Raised Cosine Rolloff (RCR) pulses are resistant to jitter, and at the same time have reasonably good bandwidth. Granted the bandwidth of an RCR pulse is wider than a sinc pulse, and the jitter resistance isn't as good as with a square wave, but this is a compromise, after all. 

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 | Pulse || Bandwidth || Jitter Resistance
 |-
 | Rectangular || rb/2 || Excellent
 |-
 | Sinc || || Bad
 |-
 | RCR || || Good
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Binary symmetric pulses ==

A system uses binary symmetric pulses if it transmits only 2 kinds of pulse, s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = -s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''. In a symmetric case, our comparator circuits are very easy: If the correlator outputs a positive value, it's a binary 1. If it outputs a negative value, it's a binary 0.

== Asymmetric Pulses ==

Asymmetric pulses are more difficult for many reasons:

#The threshold where the comparator should test the value may not be zero
#The correlation receiver needs to correlate ''two different signals''.
#The different pulses may have different power, and they may be different susceptible to noise.

== Asymmetric Correlation Receiver ==

When asymmetric pulses are used, the receiver system must actually employ 2 coherent optimal receivers, each one tuned to receive one of the pulses. When two coherent optimal receivers are used, the receiver that is outputting the highest voltage value at the end of time T has received it's pulse.

''... why not employ only 1 coherent optimal receiver, tuned to receiver neither s0 nor s1, but instead tuned to receive the difference (s1 - s0) ? ...''

''Some PAM systems, such as Ethernet 100BASE-T2, use PAM-5 ...''

= Timeline =

The development of the internet is filled with currents and counter-currents, repression, dissension and rebellion. It isn't a simple story of success after success but rather includes missed opportunities, projects that were feasible and still haven't been achieved, and futile efforts, projects that were repeatedly attempted despite being provably impossible. The history of the internet is filled with individual events, none of them meaningful without context. This is the story of the internet, not one of heroic god figures walking upon the Earth but of human beings who dream and act upon those dreams.

Recurring threads to be coded:

* discussion networks; human-nets
* archives / engines
* protocols / technologies
* multimedia

== The 80's ==
*1980 - Making use of Unix v7's UUCP facility, A News sees the birth of Usenet between UNC and Duke universities. At this time, the ARPANET is a tightly-controlled self-contained network under the regulation of the US Defense Communications Agency. In contrast, the UUCPnet is quickly conceived of as a self-regulated public network mostly kept hidden from management. After all, management does have to approve hundreds of 1980 dollars in monthly phone bills and possibly several thousand in initial equipment expenditures.
*1980 - Mark Horton feeds the human-nets ARPANET mailing list into the FA.Human-nets Usenet newsgroup. Human-nets discusses the implications of a worldwide computer communications network, usually referred to as WorldNet. The connection is strictly one-way but the ability to eavesdrop on ARPANET discussions provides critical incentive to join Usenet.
*1981 - UCB's ucbvax is used as a gateway between the ARPANET and Usenet for various mailing lists. This initial breach in the iron curtain is precarious. MIT loses several months fighting legal battles after being threatened off of the ARPANET for serving as a gateway from Usenet. It remains impossible for a UUCPnet user to send email to an ARPANET user.
*1982 - The word &quot;cyberspace&quot; is coined by [[w:William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]] in his novelette [[w:Burning Chrome|&quot;Burning Chrome&quot;]] and will subsequently be popularized in his novel [[w:Neuromancer|&quot;Neuromancer&quot;]] (1984).
*1983 - Usenet gets its first cross-Atlantic link using a dialup modem connecting DEC's decvax and Mathematisch Centrum's mcvax in the Netherlands.
*1983 - TCP/IP replaces the ARPANET's NCP. It will not be adopted in Europe where OSI models are considered sacred despite the hatred of the users they are imposed on.
*1984 April 1 - Piet Beertema of MC forges a news article from President Chernenko of the USSR announcing the Soviet Union's entry on the Usenet. Some people caught in the hoax respond that it was in bad taste to raise their hopes of much improved US-USSR relations. The Pentagon will investigate &quot;how to deal with&quot; this breach in national security, the USSR's entry on Usenet. The USA maintains an embargo of advanced computing technology.
*1984 June - FidoNet is created over version 7 of Fido.
*1985 April - The WELL (originally Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) goes online.
*1987 May - [[w:John Gilmore (advocate)|John Gilmore]], Brian Reid and Gordon Moffett unilaterally create the alt. hierarchy of Usenet, starting with alt.drugs.
*1988 April - Gene Spafford unilaterally refuses to create soc.sex, prompting the creation of alt.sex and alt.rock-n-roll. It will be some time before anyone realizes that alt. newsgroups are immortal.
*1988 August - The first [[w:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network, EFnet, goes online.
*1988 November 2 - Robert Morris unleashes the [[w:Morris worm|first ever internet worm]]
*1988 November 17 - EUnet gets its first open transatlantic connection with the internet.
*1989 Tim Berners-Lee created HTML as everyone knows and loathes. He is credited with inventing the web, despite the fact that he did not.

== The 90's ==
*1990 July - Mitch Kapor, John Perry Barlow, and John Gilmore found the [[w:Electronic Frontier Foundation|Electronic Frontier Foundation]] to protect civil liberties on the internet in response to the US Secret Service's seizure of Steve Jackson Games' computers (no charges were filed, the company was nearly ruined).
*1990 October - Col Needham releases shell scripts that allow searching of rec.arts.movies' datafiles. This will eventually become the IMDB (Internet Movie Database).
*1991 - [[w:MP3|MP3]] is defined and standardized.
*1991 - [[w:Gopher|Gopher]] is released.
*1992 - The Lynx browser is released to work over Gopher and native markup.
*1993 - The US government announces the Clipper chip as a means to promote encryption breakable by the government. The proposal is roundly condemned.
*1993 [[w:Mosaic web browser|Mosaic]] version 1.0 is released. It was described as &quot;the killer application of the 1990s&quot; because it was the first program to provide a slick multimedia graphical user interface to the Internet.
*1994 January - [[w:Yahoo!|Yahoo.com]] is founded.
*1994 July 7 - The [[w:Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Society]] released the first MP3 encoder called [[w:L3enc|l3enc]].
*1994 December - [[w:Netscape|Netscape]] releases [[w:Netscape Navigator|Netscape Navigator 1.0]]
*1995 - [[w:Amazon.com|Amazon.com]] goes online.
*1995 - Deja News' searchable Usenet archive goes online.
*1995 September - [[w:EBay|Ebay]] goes online out of Pierre Omidyar's living room.
*1995 August - Infoseek goes online as a directory service, available on a paid subscription basis.
*1995 December - DEC labs' Altavista research project goes online, available for free.
*1996 - The Internet Archive is founded. The Wayback Machine's archive dates back to 1995.
*1996 November - [[w:ICQ|ICQ]] was introduced by [[w:Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]], an Israeli start-up company. The first general instant messenger for non-UNIX computers.
*1996 December - [[w:Macromedia Flash|Macromedia Flash]] version 1.0 is released. (Source: [http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/john_gay/page04.html The History of Flash])
*1997 - [[w:Winamp|Winamp]] is released.
*1997 September - Stanford University's Google research project goes online
*1998 January - the Drudge Report initiates the Clinton sex scandal
*1998 - [[w:PHP|PHP]] version 3.0 is released.  The first version that closely resembles PHP as we know it today
*1998 - Audiogalaxy started.
*1999 - [[w:Napster|Napster]] is released. It was the first [[w:Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer]] music sharing service. It led audiogalaxy to create its famed P2P satellite.

== The 00's ==

*2001 February - Google acquires Deja's Usenet archive
*2004 February - [[w:Facebook|Facebook]] is founded.

= Special Topics = 

== Killer applications ==

A killer application is an application which justifies in everyone's minds their acquisition of an entire computer. The first killer internet application was email. The second was the web. The third was peer to peer file sharing.

== Eras ==

The internet has experienced distinct eras, rarely associated with any particular event. The earliest era was one of '''shared computing'''. This was the era of shell accounts, before home computers, and SLIP/PPP over phone lines became ubiquitous. 

The beginning of the new era coincided with the rise of the graphical web browser. Before presentation was offloaded to home computers using '''SLIP/PPP dialup''', it simply wasn't feasible to allow each user to run a graphical application on the central servers.

(Note that this new era was just a new paradigm and hardly an advance in every way. With the demise of shell accounts, it is no longer possible to search Usenet articles without downloading their contents to one's home computer. This was a significant problem before broadband.)

This third era we are in is simply the '''broadband''' era. Whether it is from the cable, phone or electric utility company, broadband provides enough network bandwidth that users make use of the network in a qualitatively different way (music and video swapping, and Voice over IP).

The fourth era just now beginning is one of not wireless but '''mobile networking'''. The hallmarks of this era are MP3 players, cell phones and to some extent PDAs. Electronic paper, if it ever actually gets built, would be symbolize the peak of this era.

The fifth era being planned in research labs like Xerox PARC's is one of '''ubiquitous computing''' and will require that the current transition from personal computers back to social computers be complete.

== Peer to peer ==

The original peer to peer application was Usenet. Almost from the first, Usenet was conceived as a way of sharing files (articles) and directories (newsgroups) between peers. Further, Usenet has a long history of being used to distribute movies, pictures, music and software. Software in particular has been distributed on Usenet from its very beginning and was one of the reasons given to management to justify the enormous expense of joining Usenet. When Napster came along in 1999, it was structured differently from Usenet for the simple reason of the very different demands of music users.

In particular, music users were unwilling, and quite unable, to carry the entire load of every other music users' library. But more importantly, analogues to newsgroups were deemed unacceptable from the first. With no way to structure or fraction users' libraries of music, being able to search for individual objects (songs or albums) and keeping track of individual users became key requirements. These requirements served as constraints that naturally enough gave rise to very different architectures from Usenet's.

== Web-based applications ==

Web-based applications follow a venerable history of running a low-availability service on top of a high-availability service in order to increase the availability of the former.

In the 90s, FTP and even Web services were available through email since email was by far the most widely available service. In fact, even some Usenet newsgroups were available through email through the intermediary of newsgroup to mailing list gateways. The greatest problem involved providing anonymous email services over email. Remailers largely died off after [[w:penet| anon.penet.fi]] was forced to hand over users' information by the Finnish government at the behest of the [[w:Church of Scientology|Church of Scientology]].

In that era, PPP and SLIP were hardly ubiquitous and not everyone had a shell account at their ISP, if the ISP even provided shell accounts. Nowadays, the most widely available service is the web and so other services run on top of it. With this history behind it, the minor innovation of putting services on the web hardly merits the appelation of an innovation.

* email
* newsgroups, of both the Usenet and non- varieties
* wikis
* blogs
* bookmarks

== Privacy Protection: Europe vs Anglo-American attitudes ==

ECHELON is an international electronic espionage network that aims to tap into all communications lines. ECHELON is maintained by the Anglo-American (USA, Canada, UK and Australia) governments and is unaccountable to anyone else. The Anglo-American governments are routinely accused of spying on their own citizens using ECHELON.

While the European Union is routinely betrayed by the United Kingdom (which supplies up to the minute information of confidential meetings to the USA), the EU has seen enough threat in ECHELON to fund the development of unbreakable quantum cryptography technology in 2004.

It is against this broader background that any issues of privacy protection must be evaluated.

The Anglo-American governments' attitudes to privacy is roughly summed up as 'you don't have any'. In 1993, the US government introduced the Clipper chip in order to be able to break into citizens' cryptographically secured communications. In 2000, the UK government passed an Act enabling police to demand a citizen's cryptographic keys without a warrant.

The response of Anglo-American governments towards corporate intrusions of privacy is characterized by appeals to self-regulation. Corporate powers are simply expected to refrain from doing so. This contrasts with European attitudes towards violations of privacy which is criminal legislation.

It's only in response to the &quot;War on Terror&quot; and at the behest of the United Kingdom that the European Union expanded police espionage powers. Needless to say, this doesn't apply to corporate intrusions on privacy ... in Europe. In fact, the European Union is set to cease transacting personal information with the USA if it continues to refuse to enact legislation.

Only with this context in mind is it possible to understand certain American citizens' fanatical commitment to absolute privacy. Their governments' hostile actions has led them to quite justified paranoia. It is why the Electronic Frontier Foundation is headquartered in San Francisco and not in Brussels.

= Deletion of Internet Acquisitions List =

The Internet Acquisitions list is deleted from the module for the simple reason that it is:

* completely useless (is this of interest to anyone? does it educate anyone? I know the answer is a resounding NO to the second question)
* extremely misleading (it gives the utterly retarded impression that the dot-com bubble explosion was the internet, or at least the web's, revolution; exactly how stupid does one have to be to countenance such a belief?)
* it is '''grossly incomplete''. Hell, Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive didn't even show up there.

The nail in the coffin of my decision to delete the list instead of archiving it as junk is my conviction that ''it can never be complete''. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 05:10, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== The commercialization of the Internet ==

One thing that most people may even have a hard time believing now is that commercial activity on the internet not only didn't happen, it was '''prohibited'''.  The first &quot;crack&quot; in the commercial aspects of the internet was the beginning of a non-profit &quot;classified ad&quot; type notice that was sent out on Usenet.  It is hard to imagine now, but there was a time that Usenet didn't have spam and was generally a useful discussion forum for many topics.  E-mail spam also at one time didn't exist either, as commercial activity would have not only cut off the internet access for the institution contributing the spam, but the user himself would have faced the equivalent of the internet death penalty.  The majority of internet users were also, on the whole, much more skillful with operating systems and it is likely that the person sending spam would have found their hard drive wiped or been subject to a malicious hacker attack.  Now it seems as though nobody cares.

The other aspect with the commercialization of the internet was the introduction of America On-Line to the internet.  Once upon a time AOL was not connected to the internet and was not an ISP.  Oh, they had &quot;talk rooms&quot; and information pages, as well as an internal e-mail system between different AOL subscribers.  When AOL became connected to the rest of the internet, there was in some circle a general dread that the internet would never be the same again.  And it was changed forever.  Typically the cycle was that each fall semiester there would be a new group of new internet users (typically college freshmen trying out the internet for the first time) that would seemingly mangle everything on the internet.  After some patience, the earlier group of internet users would try to teach some 'netiquette to these new users and generally these new users would become veterans with the whole process repeating itself each year.  When AOL became a part of the internet, all hope was lost.  A huge torrent of new users would simply overwhelm the internet and no 'netiquette could ever be taught again.

While not strictly true in practice, the tight-knit community of internet users trying on new ideas just because it was something cool to experiment on ceased to happen in general.  Before the commercialization of the internet, all internet practicies were &quot;legislated&quot; from within the community by general concensus.  After that commercialization, the legislation happened in national/state legislatures and became issues discussed in the general news media like television and newspapers.  Issues like the role of domain naming became something that was commented on by the President of the USA and the UN Secretary-General.  In the 1980's that would have been inconcievable to have occured, or even that the President would have even been aware that the internet existed at all.

Another big milestone development in the internet was the establishment of the e-mail address of president@whitehouse.gov

This was established by Al Gore when he became Vice-President, and one of the things I will actually give him credit for.  Gore may not have invented the internet, but he did help invent the internet connection to the White House and the Executive branch of the U.S. government.  Prior to the Clinton administration, nobody in the White House used the internet at all.  After Clinton came into the White House, it became the #1 medium for exchanging memos and daily policy discussions.  So much that Congress passed a law (see above) that required the White House to retain all e-mails as official correspondance, which is why President Bush can't send a private e-mail to his daughters.

I hope these details help out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:58, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

I don't have trouble believing it since I lived through it. But I was astonished to find out there was a period of time early on when ARPANET was xenophobic with dictators in charge of it all. The &quot;internet was created by the Pentagon to survive nuclear attack&quot; myth also needs to be countered, especially since the internet couldn't survive a targeted attack.

== Channels ==

A '''channel''' is a communication medium, the path that data takes from source to destination. A channel can be comprised of so many different things: wires, free space, and entire networks. Signals can be routed from one type of network to another network with completely different characteristics. In the Internet, a packet may be sent over a wireless WiFi network to an ethernet lan, to a DSL modem, to a fiber-optic backbone, et cetera.
The many unique physical characteristics of different channels determine the three characteristics of interest in communication: the latency, the data rate, and the reliability of the channel.

== Bandwidth and Bitrate ==

Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of, for example, a filter, a communication channel, or a signal spectrum. Bandwidth, like frequency, is measured in hertz (Hz). The bandwidth can be physically measured using a spectrum analyzer.

Bandwidth, given by the variables ''B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W'' is closely related to the amount of digital bits that can be reliably sent over a given channel:

:&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2W&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the bitrate. If we have an M-ary signaling scheme with ''m'' levels, we can expand the previous equation to find the maximum bit rate for the given bandwidth.

:&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2Wm&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Bandwidth and Bitrate ===

{{TextBox|1=
Let's say that we have a channel with 1KHz bandwidth, and we would like to transmit data at 5000 bits/second. We would like to know how many levels of transmission we would need to attain this data rate. Plugging into the second equation, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{r_b}{2W} = \frac{5000}{2000} = 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

However, we know that in M-ary transmission schemes, ''m'' must be an integer. Rounding up to the nearest integer, we find that ''m = ''3.}}

== Channel Capacity ==

The &quot;capacity&quot; of a channel is the theoretical upper-limit to the bit rate over a given channel that will result in negligible errors. Channel capacity is measured in bits/s.

Shannon's channel capacity is an equation that determines the information capacity of a channel from a few physical characteristics of the channel. A communication systems can attempt to exceed the Shannon's capacity of a given channel, but there will be many errors in transmission, and the expense is generally not worth the effort. Shannon's capacity, therefore, is the theoretical maximum bit rate below which information can be transmitted with negligible errors.

The Shannon channel capacity, ''C'', is measured in units of bits/sec and is given by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C = W \log_2 (1 + SNR)&lt;/math&gt;

''C'' is the maximum capacity of the channel, ''W'' is the available bandwidth in the channel, and SNR is the signal to noise ratio, '''not in DB'''.

Because channel capacity is proportional to analog bandwidth, some people call it &quot;digital bandwidth&quot;.

=== Channel Capacity Example ===

{{TextBox|1=
The telephone network has an effective bandwidth less then 3000Hz (but we will round up), and transmitted signals have an average SNR less than 40dB (10,000 times larger). Plugging those numbers into Shannon's equation, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;C = 3000 \log_2 (1 + 10000) = 39863.569...&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that the theoretical maximum channel capacity of the telephone network (if we generously round up all our numbers) is approximately 40Kb/sec!. How then can some modems transmit at a rate of 56kb/sec? it turns out that 56k modems use a trick, that we will talk about [[Communication Networks/Analog and Digital Telephony |in a later chapter]].}}

== Acknowledgement ==

Digital information packets have a number of overhead bits known as a '''header'''. This is because most digital systems use statistical TDM (as discussed in the Time-Division Multiplexing chapter). The total amount of bits sent in a transmission must be at least the sum of the data bits and the header bits.
The total number of bits transmitted per second (the &quot;throughput&quot;) is always less than the theoretical capacity.
Because some of this throughput is used for these header bits, the number of data bits transmitted per second (the &quot;goodput&quot;) is always less than the throughput.

In addition, since we all want our information to be transmitted reliably, it makes good sense for an intelligent transmitter and an intelligent receiver to check the message for errors.

An essential part of reliable communication is '''error detection''', a subject that we will talk about more in depth later. Error detection is the process of embedding some sort of checksum (called a CRC sum in IP communications) into the packet header. The receiver uses this checksum to detect most errors in the transmission.

== forward error correction ==

Some systems use '''forward error correction''' (FEC), a subject that we will talk about more in depth later. In such a system, the transmitter builds a packet and adds error correction codes to the packet.
Under normal conditions -- with very few bit errors -- that gives the receiver enough information to not only determine that there was some sort of error, but also pinpoint exactly which bits are in error, and fix those errors.

=== ARQ: ACK and NAK ===

In addition, since we all want our information to be transmitted reliably, it makes good sense for an intelligent transmitter and an intelligent receiver to communicate directly to each other, to ensure reliable transmission. This is called '''acknowledgement''', and the process is called '''hand-shaking'''.

In an '''acknowledgement request''' (ARQ) scheme, the transmitter sends out data packets, and the receiver will then send back an acknowledgement. A positive acknowledgement (called &quot;ACK&quot;) means that the packet was received without any detectable errors. A negative acknowledgement (called &quot;NAK&quot;) means that the packet was received in error. Generally, when a NAK is received by the transmitter, the transmitter will send the packet again.

If the transmitter fails to receive a ACK in a reasonable amount of time, the transmitter will send the packet again.

=== Streaming Packets ===

In some streaming protocols, such as RTP, the transmitter is sending time-sensitive data, and it can therefore not afford to wait for acknowledgement packets. In these types of systems, the receiver will attempt to detect errors in the received packets, and if an error is found, and it cannot be immediately corrected with FEC, the bad packet is simply deleted.

Now what if try to cram more information into a single bittime? If we take 2 bits at a time, and arrange them together, we can assign each set of 2 bits to a different symbol, and then we can transmit the different symbols.

== Pronunciation ==

 &quot;M-ary&quot; is pronounced like &quot;em airy&quot;.

== Example: 4-ASK ==

Let us use the following scheme:

*&quot;00&quot; = +5V
*&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
*&quot;10&quot; = -1.66V
*&quot;11&quot; = -5V

we can see now that we can transmit data ''twice as fast'' using this scheme, although we need to have a more complicated receiver, that can decide between 4 different pulses (instead of 2 different pulses, like we have been using).

== Bits Per Symbol ==

All popular communication systems transmit an integer number of bits per symbol.
We can relate the number of bits (&quot;k&quot;) and the number of different symbols (&quot;m&quot;) with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;

This causes the number of symbols to be a power of two.

With M-ary modulation techniques, the &quot;symbols per second&quot; rate can be much slower than the &quot;bits per second&quot; data rate.

== QPSK ==
Quadrature phase shift keying (aka 4-PSK) is PSK modulation that has four points in the constellation.
[[File:QPSK modulator.png|thumbnail|QPSK Modulator]]
[[File:QPSK demodulator.png|thumbnail|QPSK Demodulator]]
There are several variations on this technique:
* simple QPSK
* DQPSK (differential QPSK)
* OQPSK (offset QPSK)
* SOPSK (shaped offset QPSK)
* π/4 QPSK (shifted  constellation QPSK)

== CPFSK (MSK) ==
[MSK]minimum shift keying

== DPSK ==

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Internet ==
The Internet has become, arguably, the most important and pervasive example of a network on the planet. The Internet connects people from across a street, and from around the globe at nearly the speed of light. The sections in this chapter will discuss some fundamentals about the internet, and some more advanced chapters on the subject will be discussed later in the book.

== Client-Server ==
The exact relationship between a client and a server in the traditional '''Client-Server''' relationship can be complicated, and in today's world, the distinctions are more hazy still. This page will attempt to define what a client and a server are, how they are related, and how they communicate.

;Client : A client is a communications entity that requests information
;Server : A server is a communications entity that supplies information, or responds to a request.

== Packet-Switching Networks ==
{{Wikipedia|Packet Switching}}
In the page on Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), we talked about how we can use a method of breaking information up into chunks, and prefixing that data with address information to send multiple streams of data over a single channel. These chunks of data with their headers are called '''packets''', and are the basis for communication in the Internet.
{{Wikipedia|LAN}}
In '''local area networks '''(LAN), packets are sent over baseband channels for very short distances. These networks use Statistical TDM (packets) to control access to the channel, and to control the process of moving information from its source to its address. This process of gettings things where they need to go is called '''routing'''. Devices that route packets are called (surprise!) '''routers'''. 

Over larger networks such as '''Wide Area Networks''' (WAN), high-capacity broadband channels such as fiber optic cables connect different local LANs. Over a WAN network, packets are then Frequency Division Multiplexed (FDM) to flow simultaneously over these broad channels. At the other end, these packets are moved back down to a baseband system, and routed using TDM techniques again.

When talking about the different components in a computer network, a lot of different words fly around: Routers, Hubs, Switches, and Gateways, are some example. This page will talk about some of the different pieces of hardware that make the Internet possible. This page will only offer brief explanations of each component, opting instead to save complex discussions on the workings of each for later chapters (or even later books!).

== Hubs ==
An Ethernet hub, normally just called a hub, is a networking device used to connect multiple Ethernet segments in order to create a primitive LAN. They are primarily connected using unshielded twisted pairs/shielded twisted pairs (UTP/STP) or Fiber Optic wires, and require no special administration to function. Hubs operate on the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model, and indiscriminately forward frames to every other user in the domain. 

Hubs perform a variety of tasks, including:

&lt;li&gt;Acting as a multi-port repeater,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forwarding frames to all users,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing for connectivity to networks using 10base2 or 10base5 media,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partitioning ports when excessive collisions occur, which isolates the affected segments,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And broadcasting a &quot;jam&quot; signal when collisions take place on Ethernet media.&lt;/li&gt;

Hubs also extend but do not control collision domains, absorbing bandwidth and allowing excessive collisions to occur and hinder performance, when switches or bridges can effectively break up a network.

Despite the increase of switches as the connection medium for workgroups, hubs can still operate in a number of situations:

&lt;li&gt; Small computer clusters,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Careless users/saboteurs cannot interfere with a hub's function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Connecting outdated networks to newer methods of data transmission,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And when budget is a priority over functionality.&lt;/li&gt;

== Modems Introduction ==

'''The telephone network was originally designed to carry voice data. The human ear can only really hear sounds up to the 15kHz range, and most of that is just high-frequency fluff noise that isn't needed to transmit human voice signals. Therefore, the decision was made to limit the telephone network to a maximum transmission frequency of 3400Hz, and a minimum frequency of 400Hz (to limit the passage of DC signals, which could damage the circuit). This gives the telephone network an effective bandwidth of 3000Hz, which is perfect for transmitting voice, but which isn't that good for transmitting anything else.

Original telephone modems would use the existing telephone network to carry internet signals to a remote ISP. However, new DSP modems use a much larger frequency band, and this information is separated from the phone network almost as soon as it leaves your house. New voice technologies, such as VoIP completely bypass the old telephone infrastructure, and instead transmit voice signals over the internet. 

The chapters in this section will talk about the analog and digital hybrid nature of the telephone network.'''

== Modems ==

Modems were the original widespread method for home users to connect to the internet. Modems modulated digital data according to different schemes (that changed as time passed), and transmitted that data through the telephone network. 

The telephone network was originally designed to only transmit voice data, so most of the network installed a series of low-pass filters on the different lines, to prevent high-frequency data or noise from damaging the circuits. Because of this, the entire telephone network can be seen as having a hard bandwidth of 3000Hz. In reality, the lines used have a much higher bandwidth, but the telephone network cuts out all the high-frequency signals. DSL modems make use of that &quot;lost bandwidth&quot;, but the original modems had to work within the 3000Hz limit.

If we take the shannon channel capacity of a telephone line (assuming a signal SNR of 40db, which is nearly impossible), we can get the following result:

&lt;math&gt;C = 3000 \log_2 (1 + 10000) \approx 40Kbps&lt;/math&gt;

If we then plug this result into Nyquist's equation, we can find how many levels of transmission we need to use to get this bitrate:

&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2W log_2(m)&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

&lt;math&gt;m = 2^{\frac{r_b}{2W}} = 2^{\frac{40000}{6000}} = 2^6.67 &lt; 2^7 = 128&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, using a 128-level transmission scheme, we can achieve a theoretical maximum bitrate of 40Kb/sec through a modem.

== 56k Modems ==

If the theoretical Shannon capacity of the telephone network is 40Kbps, how can modern modems achieve a speed of 56Kb/sec? The V.42 modem standard (which is what a 56k modem is) utilizes a standard implementation of the Lemple-Ziv compression algorithm, to shrink the size of transmitted data, and therefore apparently increase the transmission speed. The telephone companies aren't magically breaking the Shannon bound, they are just finding an interesting path around it.

== DSL ==

A single strand of twisted-pair telephone wire has a bandwidth of nearly 100kHz, especially over short distances. Over longer distances, noise will play a much bigger role in the received signal, and the wire itself will attenuate the signal more with greater distance. This is why DSL is only offered in locations that are close to the telephone office, and not in remote areas.

DSL signals require the addition of 2 new pieces of hardware: The DSL modem, and the DSL splitter, which is located at the telephone company, and splits the DSL signal (high frequencies) from the voice signal (low frequencies). Also, some houses may require the installation of additional filters, to prevent cross-talk between DSL and voice signals.

== VoIP ==

With the advent of modems and DSL technology, telephone companies have become an integral part of the internet. It's no surprise then, when phone calls start getting digitized, and sent through the internet, instead of the old telephone network. Voice over IP (VoIP) is the logical conclusion to this train of thought.

== Coaxial Cable ==

Coaxial cable has an incredibly high bandwidth (compared to twisted pair), and it distorts very little over long distances. For this reason, coax is able to carry a large number of analog television channels to a very large audience.

== Bi-Directional Cable ==

The original implementation of the television network only needed to move data in one direction: from the station to the homes. For this reason, a number of amplifiers were installed in the network that take the signal from the base station, and amplify that signal towards the homes. However, a problem arises when cable internet users want to transmit data back to the base station (upload). 

The original cable TV network had a very large amount of available bandwidth, but it wasn't designed to transmit data from the user back to the network. Instead, the entire network was set up with directional amplifiers, that would amplify data going to the user, but wouldnt affect data coming back from the user.

== HDTV ==

HDTV is the next generation of television, and actually allows better resolution, larger frame size, and ''lower bandwidth'' then the traditional analog signals. Also, digital signals are less prone to cross-talk between channels, so channels don't need to be spaced as far apart in the frequency domain as analog signals are.

This chapter will discuss the next generations of the cable TV network.

== Channels ==

The TV channels in an analog TV scheme carry channels spaced every 6MHz from about 150MHz to 500MHz. Below 150MHz was considered originally to be too susceptible to noise, and there was simply no need to expand above 500MHz. However, with the advent of cable internet, the system needed to be revamped.

== Bandwidth ==

A new band was set aside, from 55MHz to 75MHz, to allow traffic to be uploaded from the user. Also, another band was set aside, from 550 to 750MHz to allow for cable internet downloads. A cable modem would be able to demodulate these two bands of data, without interfering with the TV signal.

== Problems ==

200MHz of download bandwidth seems like a lot, but every household on a given line (and there could be 100 or more) all need to share this bandwidth, which can slow down the system, especially in heavily populated areas.

The cable television network is something that is very near and dear to the hearts of many people, but few people understand how cable TV works. The chapters in this section will attempt to explain how cable TV works, and later chapters on advanced television networks will discuss topics such as cable internet, and HDTV.

coax cable has a bandwidth in the hundreds of megahertz, which is more than enough to transmit multiple streams of video and audio ''simultaneously''. Some people mistakenly think that the television (or the cable box) sends a signal to the TV station to tell what channel it wants, and then the TV station sends only that channel back to your home. This is not the case. The cable wire transmits every single channel, simultaneously. It does this by using frequency division multiplexing.

== TV Channels ==

Each TV channel consists of a frequency range of 6MHz. Of this, most of it is video data, some of it is audio data, some of it is control data, and the rest of it is unused buffer space, that helps to prevent cross-talk between adjacent channels. 

Scrambled channels, or &quot;locked channels&quot; are channels that are still sent to your house on the cable wire, but without the control signal that helps to sync up the video signal. If you watch a scrambled channel, you can still often make out some images, but they just don't seem to line up correctly. When you call up to order pay-per-view, or when you buy another channel, the cable company reinserts the control signal into the line, and you can see the descrambled channel.

A '''descrambler''', or &quot;cable black box&quot; is a machine that artificially recreates the synchronization signal, and realigns the image on the TV. descrambler boxes are illegal in most places.

== NTSC ==
NTSC, named for the National Television System Committee, is the analog television system used in most of North America, most countries in South America, Burma, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and some Pacific island nations and territories (see map). NTSC is also the name of the U.S. standardization body that developed the broadcast standard.[1] The first NTSC standard was developed in 1941 and had no provision for color TV.

In 1953 a second modified version of the NTSC standard was adopted, which allowed color broadcasting compatible with the existing stock of black-and-white receivers. NTSC was the first widely adopted broadcast color system. After over a half-century of use, the vast majority of over-the-air NTSC transmissions in the United States were replaced with ATSC on June 12, 2009, and will be, by August 31, 2011, in Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abnormal Triple Screen and Family History of PKD'''

==Introduction==
*What have you been told about why you are here today?
*We want to discus the triple screen results and what they really mean
*We want to get a family history to assess for any other risks related to pregnancy
*We want to talk about the different testing options available to you.

==Family history update (at beginning depending on level of anxiety)==
*Who in the family has been diagnosed with PKD?
*What age were they diagnosed?
*Do any of your family members have high blood pressure?
*Do any other people in your family have kidney problems?

==Medical History (related to PKD)==
*Do you see a doctor regularly?
*Are you currently on any medication?
*Have you had a renal ultrasound or CT scan?
*Have you experienced any urinary tract infections?
*Have you had high blood pressure?
*Have you experienced any pain in your stomach or back?

==Pregnancy History==
*Verify dates
*Any exposures?
*Any cig/alcohol/drug use?
*Any increase in blood pressure?
*Any ultrasounds so far? When is the next one scheduled?

==Triple screen info.==
*The test itself
**Best results at 16-18 weeks gestation (can be done from 15-22 weeks)
**Tests mother's blood
**NOT diagnostic...simply an indication for additional testing
**Uses three markers to determine indicators for certain fetal problems
*The three markers
**produced by the fetus and the placenta
**Alpha feto protein(AFP)
**Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HcG)
***Most sensitive risk factor for DS
***Greater than 2.5 MOM indicated risk for DS
**Estriol
***Median of 0.5 MOM in Trisomy 18

== Serum markers results ==
*AFP &gt;2.5 MoM indicates a normal AFTN
*AFP &lt;0.75 MoM indicates a Trisomy 21

----

*hCG &gt;2.5 MoM indicates a Trisomy 21
*hCG &lt;0.55 MoM indicates a Trisomy 18

----

*E3 &lt;0.8 MoM indicates a Trisomy 18 or 21

==Patient's results==
*AFP =1.oo , HcG=2.21 , UE3=0.99
*Increased risk for Down syndrome

==Explain chromosomes and what Down syndrome is==
*Trisomy 21 (usually - every cell of body)
*Characteristics
**mental retardation (mild to moderate)
**heart difficulties
**ear infections
**Do everything a regular kid can…ride a bike, walk, talk
**Slower to reach milestones
**Facial features
*There is no cure

==Calculating risk for Down Syndrome (explain how they determine num.)==
*Look at maternal age + AFP MoM + hCG MoM + uE3 MoM = Down Syndrome Risk
*Risk ³ 1/270 is considered screen positive
**This is equal to the midtrimester DSR for 35 year-old women
**AMA woman's risk may be made less by the triple screen results, but it is still considered a test positive because of her age.

==Recommendations for abnormal tests==
*Ultrasound for examination of physical abnormalities
**Down Syndrome
***Nuchal fold (2nd trimester)
****detects 34%
***Nuchal translucency (1st trimester)
****detects 77%
***Short femur/humerus (detects 80-90% when combined with one of the following two)
***Echogenic bowel
***Short ear
*Amniocentesis
**Explain procedure
**1/200 risk for complications
**Can't detect all problems with the baby BUT will determine chromosome status
**Fetal karyotype
***Down Syndrome
***Triploidy
***Trisomies 13, 18
***Other chromosomal abnormalities

==The Basics of PKD==
*Definition (Polycystic Kidney Disease)
**Multiple cysts in the kidney leading to kidney dysfunction
*Prevalence = 1/400 - 1/1000
*Characteristics
**90% penetrant
**initial signs = high blood pressure, blood in urine (50%), pain in side, back or abdomen, UTI, kidney stones (20-30%)
**Final stage = renal failure (60%) after age 40
**Mitral valve prolaspse (26% compared to gen pop 2-3%)
**aneurysms (5-10%) - occurs in familial clusters
**liver cysts are possible
*Diagnosis/medical management
**renal ultrasounds
***only after age 30 is a negative ultrasound = 5% risk of disease
**computed tomography (CT) - to detect aneurysm
**MRI
*Prevention
**Diet control = avoid red meat, eat low protein diet, less salt, fresh fruits and veggies, drink lots of water, avoid caffeine
*Treatment
**For pain
***acetaminophren may help
***laparoscopic surgery to &quot;unroof&quot; cysts
**For renal failure
***dialysis
***renal transplant (75-80% of kidneys work for 5 years)
*Inheritance (dominant more commonly - recessive is RARE)
**Description of autosomal dominant and why this is the type
**Chance of recurrence if the mother has it = 50% chance
**Chance of recurrence if the mother doesn't have it same as population risk= &lt;1%???? approximately 10% of the PKD patient community became infected through spontaneous mutation, and not through inheritance.
*Genetics
**Two genes identified (a third suspected)
**PKD1 - 16p (90% of PKD) DX is earlier, progresses more rapidly, more likely to be hypertensive
**PKD2 - chromosome 4
**Testing is done through linkage

==Her options==
*A amniocentesis for chromosome risk
*A renal ultrasound for herself (PKD surveillance)
**If it is negative and she is 30+, chance of having PKD is &lt;5%
*Testing by linkage analysis for herself and family
**Costs approx. $2200 per family
**&gt;95% accurate in families
*Prenatal determination (preferably after linkage has been established)
**CVS testing for linkage studies (9-15 weeks)
**Amniocentesis for linkage studies (15+ weeks)

==Psychosocial issues==
*How her brothers illness has affected her
*Scared about the possibility of having PKD?
*Worried about PKD for baby?
*Would a diagnosis of PKD influence a pregnancy decision?
*How would having a child with DS feel?
*Support and resources at home?
*Would the dx of DS influence pregnancy planning?

==Resources for patient==
*[Polycystic kidney disease access center http://www.nhpress.com/pkd/]
*[www.adam.com http://www.adam.com]
