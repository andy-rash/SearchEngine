==Driver observance of road markings at stop street intersections, in the South Metropole==

===INTRODUCTION=== 
This project involved ten committed educators from the EMDC, South Metropole (Mitchell's Plain and surrounding areas). The objective of the project was to engage their learners in science process skills and empowering them in facilitating investigative skills in their classrooms. Educators from different schools were at different stages within their learning programmes. In order to choose a common topic to advance the project it was decided to select a topic that could easily be done in the different classes, without undue disruption of the learning programmes in progress. 

Another reason was to focus on skills, values and attitudes in the broader society and that in using science skills, everyday issues within our communities could be highlighted. The assumption was that learners would take to the topic because it has direct bearing on their own attitude in getting safely to school and back. 

In choosing the topic in terms of mentioned reasons, it was also realised that road safety was a major concern with government, nationally and provincially. We are reminded daily about road safety with projects like &quot;ARRIVE ALIVE&quot; that was instituted by the ministry of transport. In an address to mourners at a memorial service of victims who lost their lives on South African roads, the Minister of Transport said the following: 

&quot;I urge you to make road safety an issue within your communities. Identify places where accidents 
happened and the causes of the accidents and bring them to the attention of your local authorities. 
Give your children the tools to be safe on the roads by teaching them how to behave as pedestrians 
and cyclists. Buckle up on front and back seat of cars. We can reduce our risks on the road by 
obeying traffic rules and regulations. Let us all undertake to be law abiding road users-life is 
too valuable not to&quot;. (10 October 2003) 

Media reports on &quot;road accidents&quot; also show a keen awareness by members of the public as reported in the CAPE ARGUS, 19 April 2004, when a reader reacted to the comments made by the MEC for Transport. The reader commented that &quot;most deaths on our roads are not `accidents', a term which should be avoided. In collisions, crashes or smashes are a result of negligence and non-compliance with traffic regulation and normal civilised behaviour&quot;. 

Literature also shows that the issue of road safety is being addressed at various levels of town planning. Ribbens (1996) states that the accident rate amongst children in Mitchell's Plain, a less spacious town, is higher compared to older, more spacious towns. 

A vast majority of South Africans, urban and rural, are pedestrians (Ribbens,1996). In &quot;ROAD TRAFFIC&quot;, the recommendation is made that &quot;road user knowledge, skills and attitudes&quot; should be enhanced through formal and non-formal education. 

==METHODS AND MATERIALS== 
===Choosing the site=== 
The sites were restricted to the South Metropole, easily accessible by members of the individual schools. The road markings initially included the solid stop line, directional arrows and the channelling lines at both robotic intersections and stop streets.

===Designing the instrument=== 
The initial discussion around designing the instrument included the type of road surface markings as mentioned above, the gender of driver/road-user, and the vehicle type (commercial, private, government and public). We also considered the time allowed for gathering data, using the instrument at a specific time and date. The instrument was to be used by the learners and needed to be of a simple format. The number of learners used to collect data was not specified. Participants felt that they would adopt a system to suit their situation. Pilot projects were conducted at robotic intersections and stop streets. Table 1 shows the proposed data collection instrument.

===Refining the instrument/ limiting the variables=== 
We considered all the recommendations made by the learners and ourselves after conducting pilot investigations. It was decided that observers needed to be inconspicuous so as to allow road users to respond as normally as possible. 

K53 considers &quot;stopping&quot; in relation to the surface marking as &quot;bringing your vehicle to a complete stop, with the front before the white stop line&quot; (Gibson, et al, 1999). However for the purpose of this investigation and for the sake of simplicity, stopping was considered to be bringing the vehicle to a complete halt with the wheels before the stop line (RTM1 &amp;iuml &amp;iquest &amp;frac12  see addendum). A further recommendation was that the stop line be an extension of the observer. Due consideration was given to the complexity of the different sites, which includes safety aspects and effective recording of data. The sample size per site was limited to 50 cars irrespective of the time taken to collect the data. The investigation was further limited to stop streets only, making data collection and recording easier. 

===RESULTS=== 
The sample contained a cross section of vehicle types used in townships. Mitchell's Plain was created in the apartheid era as a residential area, away from big business and industrial areas. Table 2 shows that the private vehicle count overshadows the other vehicle types. The number of public transport vehicles indicates that a large percentage of residents are dependent on public transport and therefore there is a large amount of pedestrians on Mitchell's Plain roads.

The gender composition is somewhat expected, 291 male drivers and only 68 female drivers. The K53 booklet, used by learner drivers defines the broad white line (RTM ) as the stop line mark 1 and the other two lines (RTM3) as the pedestrian crossing lines. These being regulatory traffic signs at a crossing, it is expected to be religiously observed by all drivers. 

'''Figure 1:''' Driver Observance of Stop street regulatory traffic road markings

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_science_2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

In figure 1 above it is clear that a majority of drivers in this sample do not observe road markings at stop streets. Gender Male Female Stopped 37 15 Stopped on line 6 4 Stopped over line 60 12 No Stopping 188 37

The patterns in Table 4 show an alarming tendency amongst both male and female drivers not to stop at stop streets and/or not to observe RTM3 lines. Only a small number, both genders, do observe the road markings. 

Another important pattern show n in this study is that a large number of commercial and government vehicle drivers do not observe stop street road markings as seen from Table 5 below.

===Discussion=== 
Due to the nature and objectives of this limited study no definitive conclusions could be made. However, patterns observed with this small sample may serve as a basis for further investigation. The safety of learners, on their way to and from school, is influenced by driver observance of traffic signs and signals, and an extension of such a study in the area may just arouse community interest. Results of such a study might serve as interesting discussions at SGB meetings. 

===Concluding remarks=== 
The project had twofold objective namely empowering participants in investigative skills and to involve learners as far as possible. The success rate of the project will only surface once participants initiate new projects within their respective classrooms. The input from learners during the pilot was essential in refining the data collecting instrument. This once again underlines the fact that learners do bring `something' to the education table and that educators should not underestimate the abilities of their learners.

I think that the two word &quot;gnat make&quot; is better suited for beginners. Partly because of the better help screen:

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community.

== Inclusion != transcusion ==
Transclusions between Wikibooks aren't helpful, they break several subsystem, including book renames, even deletion, categories and ultimately make edits problematic (edits can break one of the books sharing the same content by using transclusion), you should copy the content and give attribution to the original book if the size of used content is relevant, Wikibooks should be self containing...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:07, 19 December 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;

= Classical Quenya Mode =
At least in that Age, we see the Tengwar Table divided in Series (Témar) and Grades (Tyeller) as found in '''Appendix E'''. It was divided in two parts: the 24 “primary” letters, those composed by a telco and lúvar, and 12 “additional”. There was applied a number to each of them, Tinco being the #1 and Úrë the #36, making the glyphs useable as numbers.

A number of tehtar are described by Tolkien concerning the modes used near the end of the Third Age (which doesn’t mean they hadn’t been invented as early as in 2nd Age, or even since Fëanor’s time): The two dots of Tyelpetéma were now considered separate tehtar, able to be imported by other letters (like Anna and Hyarmen as we saw). A 'hook' is known (a small version of Silmë?) called Sa-rince in Quenya and Gammas in Sindarin, that indicates “following ''s''” in the clusters ''ts, ps'' and ''ks/x''. An under-tilde was used to indicate long consonants.

We can state with certainty at last, that Yanta and Úrë were now used only for for dipthong compounds.

Tyelpetéma was discarded, as well as the grade with extended stems, although they were used in various ways according to each one’s needs.

The names of the tengwar were now regularised, their Quenya names being the official ones. It is also stated that the Númen, Formen, Rómen, Hyarmen were used as direction marks even in maps written in other languages.

=== Notes ===
*'''Aha''': This letter, previously used for initial and afterwards for medial ''ch'', softened even more and became a breath ''h'' in all cases (with few exceptions: between ''e/i'' and a consonant or the end of a word it is still pronounced ''ch''; the word ''tehta'' was pronounced ''techta''). 
*'''Hyarmen''': Initial breath ''h'' is now written with Hyarmen, which replaced Halla.
*'''Wilya''': Some evidence (like ''vende &lt; wende'') show us that by the late 3rd Age, ''w-'' had merged with ''v-''. So Wilya changed to Vilya, but Wilya used still instead of Vala for older ''w'' (like ''vende'').
*'''Ñoldo/Ñwalme''': In 3rd Age ''ñ-'' merged with ''n-'' and words like ''nolme (&lt; ñgolme), nwalca (&lt; ñgwalca)'' were still written with Noldo and Nwalme. ''ñw-'' became ''nw-'' in the same way.
*'''Hwesta Sindarinwa''': This letter had no value in Quenya mode, but was a fixed part of the table since it was useful in the General Use modes.
*'''Rómen/Óre''': Rómen was used for ''r'' followed by a vowel in the same word and Óre any other ''r'' (like final or before consonants) even though there was no difference in pronunciation.
*'''Halla''': This letter now was reduced for use only for initial ''hr-/hl-''.

It is interesting to compare the 3rd Age with earlier spelling:

Tolkien has written Namárie in Tengwar. Some inconsistencies with other rules and sample are found, like non-constant use of Esse and Silme nuquerne, Vala where Wilya would be expected and absence of Súle (''súrinen'' and ''hísie'' with Silme although &lt; ''thúrinen'' and ''híthie''). That means maybe that some rules weren't followed strictly by the end of the 3rd Age. He has also forgot the ‘following ''y''’ underdots in ''maryat'', the first ''a'' of the first ''namárie'' and he provides an alternate spelling of the dipthong in ''caita''.

= &quot;General Use&quot; =
In [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS58 '''The Howlett Rivendell Inscriptions'''], Tolkien affirms that there was a &quot;general use (applicable to both S[indarin] and Q[uenya]) of the period of the tale&quot; (which refers to '''The Lord of the Rings'''). He provides three samples: The Sindarin name ''Imladrist'' [sic] &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;`Btj#27T81&lt;/em&gt; and two versions of the English name ''Rivendell'' &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;7Tr2{$j&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;7r%2{j$&lt;/em&gt;. Possibly, this mode already existed as early as the [[../Second Age/]], and used in Eregion.

No other samples are explicitly called &quot;general use&quot;. There is however a mode that is attested with Sindarin, Quenya and English: A tehtar mode where the Quessetéma is a ''k''-series while Calmatéma is used for postalveolar/palatal sounds. This matches also with the &quot;Westron mode&quot; as described in '''Appendix E''' and with the [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS52 '''Numenian Mode Chart''']. So we can consider all these modes to represent applications of the &quot;general use&quot; to different languages.

The &quot;general use&quot; was mainly used by men. It is attested primarily with English, which supposedly corresponds to the Westron (or Numenian) language, and the Elvish texts attested in this mode relate closely to men: '''Elendil's Oath''' seen behind the throne of Gondor on [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS38 '''The Return of the King''' Jacket (draft)], and the letter of Aragorn to Samwise seen in the [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS49 '''King's Letter''', Third Version].

The vowel placement in the &quot;general use&quot; seems to be variable: either on the preceding or on the following tengwa. The main Quenya text places them on the following tengwar. Most English texts place them on the preceding tengwar, but there are also contrary samples. The inclusion of the letters Yanta (named &quot;Ai&quot;) and Úre (named &quot;Au&quot;) in the '''Numenian Mode Chart''' may be a hint that the usual Westron placement was with the vowel tehtar on the preceding tengwar.

== &quot;General Use&quot; Sindarin (Sindarin Tehtar Mode) ==

This mode is attested in the [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS49 King's Letter, Third Version]. Therefore this mode was probably used mainly by Men, and not by Elves.

The main difference between this mode and other varieties of the &quot;general use&quot; is the representation of the semivowel /j/, which is not represented with the letter Anna, but with the letter Yanta. The distribution of the letters Óre and Rómen is also special, the former only being used at word endings.

When an article causes mutation to the following consonant, the whole cluster is written as one word (transcribed with a hyphen by Tolkien: ''i-Varanduiniant'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;r%7#2{#hU5`C1[E&lt;/em&gt;). A new tehta appears, for the Sindarin vowel ''y'', which is 2 amatixi (overdots) over a consonant. The bar of nasalisation (seen in ''i-Varanduiniant'') except ''d, t'' and ''g'', is used also over ''n'', to double it (''annon'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;5{#5^&lt;/em&gt;) and maybe this could be applied to ''m'' as well. We also see the ''w''-tilde used in words like ''edwen'', and the under-bar of doubling consonants. There appears the letter ''mh''. This sound became ''v'' in 3rd Age, and in other cases we see it transcribed as ''v'', but as it seems the traditional spelling was kept in tengwar.

Most of the tengwar are not attested in that text, and their value is guessed by analogy, but many of them seem to have been useless for this mode.

=== Notes ===
*'''Yanta''': This letter is used both as a diphtong part (''ae, oe'') and as an initial ''y-'' (spelled ''i-'' in Sindarin by Tolkien)
*'''Óre''': it is used for final ''–r'', as in Quenya, even if it belongs to a word which is the first part of a compound (like in ''Perhael &lt; per+sael'').
*'''Ñwalme''': Maybe is used for the final nasal sound transcribed by Tolkien as ''–ng''.
*'''Anna''': used in diphthongs like ''ai, ei'' etc.
*'''Vala''': this letter is not attested but analogy to other &quot;general use&quot; samples suggests that it is used for semivowel ''w'' and a diphthong compound ''–u''

===Examples===

The '''King’s Letter''' is the longest Sindarin text, and its written in this mode.

==Sindarin &quot;Full Writing&quot; with &quot;General Use&quot; Consonants==

This Mode appears in another version of the '''King’s Letter'''. Probably used by the Dûnedain of Arnor and came to Gondor when Aragorn ascended the throne. It derived from the Mode of Beleriand used in Imladris, but keeps some Adunaic elements.

It differs from the tehta-mode, as well as the Mode of Beleriand. The rules are the same that apply to the Mode of Beleriand, but now Númen and Malta have the value of ''n'' and ''m'' as in Quenya, and Óre is interchangable with Rómen (no constant rules appear for when each one should be used).

In the '''King’s Letter''', two different ways are found for the diphthong ''ae'': Yanta can be written as an overposed tehta above ''a'' (''Iorhael'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;~h79]âj&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;~h79]lj&lt;/em&gt;).

There are two similar &quot;full writing&quot; modes where the k-series is repsented by the quessetéma and not by the calmatéma as in the Elvish modes (classical Quenya and Sindarin mode of Beleriand). One of them is attested with Sindarin, the other with English translations of Westron texts. The were used by Westron speakers, Gondorian men and dwarves from the Erebor. The Sindarin version may be deprecated.

== &quot;General Use&quot; Westron ==
The Westron speakers seem to have fitted perfectly the sounds of their language in the table, according to the shapes of each letter, better than any elvish language did. The main reason was maybe the wider variety in Westron phonology.

The names of the letters may be a sound game. They used the vowel ''o'' for dental names, ''i'' for labial, ''e'' for palatal and ''a'' for alveolar. It seems they considered ''o'' a frontal vowel, ''a'' a back vowel and ''i'', ''e'' their intermediate.

=== Notes ===
*'''Ós/Oza''': they seem to had same function as the nuquerne tengwar, as the inverted form of their name indicate
*'''&amp;rsquo;á''': Maybe indicates a glottal stop (never attested in Westron words) or maybe an ommited consonant (like an apostrophe)
*'''Whi''': This letter, also known as Hwesta Sindarinwa, was used to indicate the sound ''hw'' of Sindarin in modes where Hwesta has another value.
*'''Ar/Aro''': Seems to had the same use as their Quenya ancestors. If we take example of the words themselves, Ar indicates a final/preconsonantal ''r'' (hence its name which is different from the other of its Series, or it would rather be **Ró instead) while Aro for medial/intervocal.
*'''Aha/Oha''': Two different sources name this letter with two different names. Its not sure which one is a misreading/mistyping, but more probably the true form is Aha.
*'''Aha/Há''': Looking at their names, maybe Aha used medially and Há initially?
*'''Ai/Au''': Those names seem like the known Quenya diphthongs. Maybe they were used in diphthongs as in Quenya.

=== Examples ===
There are of course no Westron texts by Tolkien, or even single Westron words written in the Numenian mode, but our best examples of this mode are the English Tengwar transcriptions (like the '''Title Page''') and the '''Ring Inscription''' that both used a mode similar to Numenian (where the tehtar were placed above maybe the preceding consonant). Following this, we will try to represent a few known Westron (Hobbitish) names as they could be written.

&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;w#1'T ,Tjw%7~CeD&lt;/em&gt;	''Batti Zilbirâpha'' (Barney Butterburr)

&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;7E,D5&amp;6 1~Mz&lt;/em&gt;	''Razanur Tûc'' (Peregrin Took)

&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;m^37Et&lt;/em&gt;	''Hlothram'' (cottager)

==Northern Numenian Mode==
This mode is a Westron convention in its northern variety. It is exemplified (as English texts) in the '''King’s Letter''' and the '''Book of Mazarbul'''. 

The main difference from the other known full modes is of course the value of the letters which match those of the Numenian mode and not Sindarin. Note also that the letter ''‘a'' is used for a instead of the known crescent ''a''-tengwa. An underdot is used by Tolkien to indicate unvoiced sounds in English, which maybe fulfilled the absence of ''‘a''.

In the '''King’s Letter''', a distinction is made between Ar and Aro, like Óre and Rómen in Quenya. Au is used as semiconsonatal ''w'' and Wí has the value of ''u''. Consonantal ''y'' is expressed by the long carrier. However in the '''Book of Mazarbul''', Aro takes the value of ''w'', as in the Adunaic Mode.

Dipthongs are shown again with the two amatixi and the w-tilde. It is interesting to note that except the long consonants, even long vowels make use of the under bar.

= Angerthas Erebor =
In TA 1981, the Dwarves fled from Moria. Years later Thráin I came to Erebor and founded a dwarf-kingdom. There the Cirth were modified further and some new were added, but some reverted back to their Elvish usage.

They reintroduced &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;$&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; but substituted &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; again for ''g'' and ''gh'' this time, or as variants to their original cirth. The only cirth they introduced are only &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; for ''ps'' and ''ts''.

This mode was used in Westron by Dwarves. The lower inscription of '''Balin’s Tomb''' is written in English, as well as the '''Book of Mazarbul'''. There we find some new cirth for vowel combinations and dipthongs, not known if valid in Westron or just used only by Tolkien in English.

We learn also how long vowels and consonants are treated. An over circumflex indicates a long consonant while an under bar indicates a long vowel. Must we exclude the cirth for long vowels? There is however a distinct letter for long ''ll'' by Tolkien for English words like ''fall''. 

After the 2nd Age, the Cirth were obsoleted by the Tengwar among the western races and the Cirth remained in use only by Dwarves and Men. The Rohirrim and the Men of Dale used two related simplified forms. The Dwarves developed even pen-written cursive forms, since they used them exclusively in any form of writing communication, even in paper.

=== Notes ===
&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;: This certh is said to represent ''ll'' in English words like ''fall''. However it is interesting to note that Welsh has the digraph ''ll'' which denotes a sound, similar to the Sindarin and Westron ''hl'' (as Tolkien transcribed it). It's possible that this ''ll'' was used for Westron ''hl'' however there is no such evidence published.

=== Examples ===
That is how a Dwarf or a Northerner could write these Westron words.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;@l2c9Gcu&lt;/em&gt;	''Ribadyan'' (byrding)

I think that the articulations and types of consonants are better explained in the phonology article. This page just needs to inform the reader of what the IPA is, some of it's history, why we use it, and what the alternatives are; e.g. XSAMPA (but not neccissarily in that order). - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 10:10, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Oops.... I think you are right. I didn't remember about that page! Silly me... [[User:Jotomicron|Jotomicron]] 21:05, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Display Problems Section? ==

I think it would be a good idea for us to have a section explaining how to get browsers to display IPA. This seems like the obvious place to put it, but I'm unsure as to whether it would be benificial to have it earlier on in the book (seeing as some IPA characters show up in the beginners section).

== Introduction ==
This book is intended to develop content for a new chapter on '''Coordinate Reference Systems''' and '''GNSS Surveying''' for the [http://www.gsdi.org/gsdicookbookindex.asp Spatial Data Infrastructure Cookbook] developed through the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) initiative.   The purpose of the chapter is to provide high level information for a basic understanding of global coordinate reference systems (e.g., WGS 84, ITRFxx/GRS80) and case studies from different regions and countries of the world about the challenges of tying their datums to global coordinate reference systems. As the final product will be incorporated in a Portable Document Format (PDF) document, it is important that sufficient information be extracted from open sources so that the user does not have to jump from article to article to get high level information about Global Coordinate Reference Systems and Positioning.  Content will be condensed into a chapter covering 15-20 pages.

The [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks]] approach is being used to foster international collaboration and to quickly develop content.  Anyone can contribute and change existing content, and one does not need to register.   If, however, you want attribution for your contribution, you are encouraged to register.  If you decide to contribute, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:How_to_edit_a_page Wiki markup].  The Wikibooks approach is not for people who do not want their masterpiece altered!

As of 2005-01-26, our wish list for contributions is as follows:

# Extraction of information from open sources for inclusion in this chapter
# Graphics and figures
# Case studies from various regions and countries of the world for tying into global coordinate reference systems such as WGS 84 and ITRFxx/GRS80
# Anything marked as TBSL (To Be Supplied Later)

== Context and rationale ==
''Consistent with the SDI Cookbook, this section establishes the background, context, and rationale for the subject suitable as general orientation for all readers, but targeted for managers and end-users.''

=== Geodetic datum ===

==== Ellipsoid ====
In [[geodesy]], a '''reference ellipsoid''' is a mathematically defined surface that
approximates the true figure of the Earth or [[w:geoid|geoid]]. It is used as the surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and [geographic] point co-ordinates calculated.

Mathematically, the reference ellipsoid is an oblate (flattened) ellipsoid of revolution with two different axes, an equatorial semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a polar semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The ellipsoid of revolution is obtained by rotating the ellipse about the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Elpsminr.png Reference ellipsoid])

The ''flattening'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{a-b}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

- from [[w:Reference ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid]]

[[w:GRS 80|GRS80]] was adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) at its XVII General Assembly in Canberra, Australia, December 1979. 

For GRS80, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = 6 378 137 m and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; = 0.003 352 810 681 18

=== Geoid ===
A '''geoid''' is a close representation of the shape of the Earth. According to [[w:Carl Friedrich Gauss|C.F. Gauss]], it is the &quot;mathematical figure of the Earth&quot;, in fact, of the Earth's [[w:gravity|gravity]] field. The geoid is that equipotential surface which coincides on average with mean [[w:sea level|sea level]].  - adapted from [[w:Geoid|Geoid]]

The geoid has an irregular surface and unlike the ellipsoid, cannot be expressed by a mathematical formula.
=== Height ===
In [[geodesy]], height is the distance of a point (usually on the terrain surface, such as a mountain top) vertically above or below a ''reference surface'' - adapted from [[w:Height|Height]]

An ''ellipsoidal height'' uses the reference ellipsoid as its reference surface.   A ''geodetic height'' uses the geoid as its reference surface.

=== Coordinate systems ===

==== Geographic coordinate systems ====
[[w:Latitude_and_longitude|Geographic coordinate systems]]&lt;/br&gt;
[[w:Latitude|Latitude]]&lt;/br&gt;
[[w:Longitude|Longitude]]&lt;/br&gt;

=== Global Coordinate Reference Systems ===
==== Geocentric XYZ (TBSL) ====

==== International Terrestrial Reference System(ITRS) ====
[[w:ITRS|International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)]]
===== International Terrestrial Reference Frame(ITRF) =====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Terrestrial_Reference_System The International Terrestrial Reference Frame] - The International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) is a set of points with their 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates which realize an ideal reference system, the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)

== Organizational issues ==
''Consistent with the SDI Cookbook, this section addresses the design architecture of organisations, roles, and software systems that are intended to interact.''

This section will provide case studies on how various regions and countries of the world are tying into Global Spatial Reference Systems.
=== Regional reference frames ===

[http://www.gsi.go.jp/PCGIAP/98wg/98wg1.htm Permanent Committee on GIS Infrastructure for Asia and the Pacific (PCGIAP) Working Group 1: Regional Geodesy]

==== Antartica (TBSL) ====

=== National datums ===
==== Australia ====
[http://www.ga.gov.au/nmd/geodesy/datums/gda.jsp Geocentric Datum of Australia]&lt;/br&gt; 
Reference Frame: ITRF92(International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1992), Epoch 1994.0,  Ellipsoid: GRS80

==== New Zealand ====
[http://www.linz.govt.nz/rcs/linz/pub/web/root/core/SurveySystem/GeodeticInfo/geodeticdatums/index.jsp#nzgd2000 New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 (NZGD2000)]&lt;/br&gt;
Reference Frame: ITRF96 (International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1996), Epoch 2000.0, Ellipsoid: GRS80

New Zealand lies along the boundary of the [[w:Australian_Plate|Australian Plate]] and [[w:Pacific_Plate|Pacific Plate]] and therefore, is a geophysically active area.  The effects of slow crustal deformation (plate tectonics) amount to about 5cm per year. These changes will be managed through the use of a velocity model to generate NZGD2000 coordinates from observations made at times other than the datum reference epoch. This will allow specialised users to generate coordinates for times other than the reference epoch.

==== United Kingdom ====
[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents/guide5.html#5.2 OSGB36 (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936)]&lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I feel that [[Real analysis]] now contains quite a bit of stuff on quite a few topics. However, the book needs some clean-up and some major re-organisation to make it more reader-friendly (though new material is also welcome, particularly on '''multivariable analysis''' and '''Fourier analysis''').

Since the goal here is to put calculus on a solid footing, I am going to add background, so that we develop the concept of a number first, and work to functions more slowly and methodically, to include Heine-Borel, Weierstrass, etc.

Things that seem to fit in this context:
*(Basic) functional analysis:
**Uniform Convergence, function spaces
**Arzela-Ascoli Theorem
**Stone-Weierstrass Theorem
**Riemann-Stieltjes integrals and bounded variation
*Measure theory:
**Measure theory/Lebesgue integrals
*Generalized function (distributions) theory
*Some basic harmonic analysis (Fourier series and transforms).

However, both functional analysis and measure theory could do with their own Wikibooks

Things that might better be in [[Set Theory]]:
*Infinite sets and cardinality

Things that might better be in [[Topology]]:
*Introduction to different concepts of space: topological, metric, normed, inner product
*Basic topology: accumulation points, closure, interior, boundary, convergence of sequences, in each case with discussion of the type of space the concept is appropriate to.
*Completeness
*Compactness
*Connectedness
*Continuous maps
*Metric spaces
*Contraction Mapping Principle

==Comments by Msmithma==
*I have just submitted a major rewrite of the Sequences section.  Amongst other things I changed the notation for sequences from &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  This is more standard, easier to type, easier to read in source and will not conflict with the set theory book (if that is ever written).  It also inlines better (in the form &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;) when you have the &quot;Recommended for modern browsers&quot; math view option selected.

*Incidentally, I would welcome discussion concerning the structure and approach that should be taken in this book, but in the mean time I shall continue to do things the way I think they should be done. [[User:J Bytheway|J Bytheway]] 22:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

*I too was a little overwhelmed by the work to be done in the set theory book, will start on Topology/Compactness tomorrow. Made minor edit to Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, Bolzano was spelt wrong and definition was not limited to the reals. Will check the proof tomorrow as I'm too tired for reasoned arguement now.

* I just did a major re-write/organization of &quot;The real numbers&quot; section.  Added a couple sections on ordered sets and fields, didn't put much onto the field section.  I broke the main chapter of the section up into two pages so that the wiki stoped complaining about the size of the page and to make it easier to read.  Now the axioms are on one page and the properties/consequences are on the next. I also added a cover page as per the wikibooks style guide. Also add your names to the [[Real analysis/Authors]]  Page! [[User:Msmithma|Msmithma]] 07:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

* I just merged the edits on the natural numbers section with the original text, there was some redundant text that was removed and I'm not sure I did a great job placing the two new axiomatic approaches to the natural numbers but it restores the old flow while truing to incorporate the new material.  We should probably choose if we want the natural numbers to start at 1 or 0, I vote 1.

== Differentiation ==

*Personally, I would like to see there be separate sections for Functions and Differentiation, rather than differentiation as a subsection of Functions as it is now. How does everyone else (assuming there is anyone else :-p) feel about this change? --[[User:Notanut|Notanut]] 10:43, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Topics Covered ==

*In response to the comment about structures and topics, I've started this thread. Personally, I don't like the current organization very much and I would also like to see a broader coverage of topics (ie a little basic topology - open/closed set, compactness and the like) in addition to coverage of topics currently deemed too advanced (especially integrals other than the Riemann integral... at least I think Lebesgue integrals are currently out because they're too advanced). I think a good organization would be something mor or less of the form:
Ch.0, Background
     0.0 Sets (unless it's assumed the reader is already familiar)
     0.1 The Real Numbers
     0.2 Construction (though I still don't know what is planned for this)
     0.3 Metric Spaces (maybe)
     0.4 Regions (ie Neighborhoods, Open/Closed sets, Boundaries, Compactness... all that fun stuff)
Ch.1, Real Variables and Functions
     1.1 Functions
     1.2 Limits
     1.3 Continuity
     1.4 Sequences
     1.5 Series
Ch.2, Differentiation
     2.1 Derivatives
     2.2 Stuff about derivatives
     2.3 L'hospital (maybe)
     2.4 Taylor's Theorem
Ch.3, Integration
     3.1 Riemann Integration
     3.2 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
     3.3 Lebesgue Integration
Ch.4, Advanced Topics
     4.1 Measures
     4.2 Fourier Series
     4.3 Distributions
     4.4 Hilbert Spaces
     4.5 Other Forms of Integration (like Riemann-Stieltjes and so on)
Obviously Ch.4's outline is wildly unorganized, and the rest could probably be improved upon. Suggestions are welcome, especially since I've never had formal training in Real Analysis. --[[User:Notanut|Notanut]] 12:12, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

** In principle I agree with you.  When I laid out the present structure I would have included more metric/topological stuff had it not been for the fact that there was already a [[Topology]] book.  I thought it would be better to have two seperate works, but heavily intertwined.  With luck, this would allow people who don't want to study topology the chance to learn real analysis independantly, and those who do the chance to learn the two together (which, I agree, is somewhat more elegant).  Writing it all out twice may aid learners who want a different presentation, but it nevertheless seems slightly silly when we have the opportunity to make good use of the wiki format to avoid it.
**A presentation along the lines suggested above would certainly work, although I would rather put Lebesgue integration after measures, and relegate most of the other advanced topics to a book on functional analysis (with a link in the &quot;where next?..&quot; section of this book).
**The construction section (about which you seem confused) is intended to describe ways of constructing the real numbers (out of the rational numbers, e.g. as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences).  When I learnt real analysis, this aspect was very much brushed over, and I feel it deserves more attention.  It's certainly not crucial for understanding of the other topics, however.

*I provided a proof of the Squeeze Theorem, and added the equivelant characterizations of completeness that were promised in the &quot;Real Numbers&quot; section.  If I did something terrible, let me know.   The proofs I gave could doubtlessly be improved, and I will keep editing them myself.  I did this more as a way of getting some text out there than anything else.  I'm a bit of a newcomer here, so I apologize for any faux pas I may have committed.  I think most of the changes I made are of a reversible nature, anyway.  Also, I had some problems with the math formatting that I couldn't fix.  If someone knows how to make things work right, please do.  L Culler 3:46, 11 May 2005

== Set Theory Notation ==

*I find some of the Set Theory notation odd.  For example: &lt;math&gt;\forall\epsilon&gt;0:\exists N:\forall n \geq N:|x_n-a|\leq\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,doesn't have an implication arrow.  Neither does any other theorem have an implication arrow.  I am used to seeing set theoretic statements written as such:&lt;math&gt;(\forall\epsilon&gt;0)(\exists N)(\forall n \geq N)\implies |x_n-a|\leq\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which is a little less ambiguous. But, &lt;math&gt;(\forall\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}&gt;0)(\exists N\in\mathbb{N})(\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\geq N)\implies |x_n-a|\leq\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is even less ambiguous.  What do you think?  --[[User:Fraxtal|Fraxtal]] 22:44, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

Why was the Real Analysis book moved be be a Topology sub-book?  Surely these should be separate books.

== Why Analysis? ==

As a newcomer I'm unsure if this belongs here, but one of the things which I struggled with (and which many other newcomers to analysis struggle with) is the question of why analysis needs to be done at all.

The common situation is that a first-year undergraduate mathematician will have studied calculus at A-level, concentrating on the how and trusting in the why (or seeing an intuitive, rather than rigorous, proof of the why). This is no bad thing IMO, but it does result in a feeling of confusion and disappointment as our undergraduates learn that they're going to spend their first year &quot;learning differentiation and integration&quot;.

Of course, once the course is over it's more apparent why it was necessary, but until then the whole thing is rather bewildering.

So one thing I'd like to propose writing is a sort of streetmap of real analysis, explaining - in fairly untechnical language - how all the parts of the topic slot together, where everything fits, and why it's not the same as calculus.

Would this be a good place to add it? (I've yet to sign up for a username, but will likely do so soon...)

== Exponential Function ==

I am adding a chapter solely on the exponential and logarithmic functions. The usual way to construct these functions is to define the logarithm as &lt;math&gt;\int_1^x\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; as its inverse. Although the method I'm providing is longer, I believe it has its own merits. 

I am also moving the section on rational exponentiation currently in the Continuity chapter to the new chapter.&lt;br /&gt;[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 09:48, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>Grammatical and structural changes to the handhorn technique section</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavGeneral}}
== Natural ==
The natural horn is the ancient ancestor of all modern horns, having no valves whatsoever. Since it lacks valves, only the notes in the harmonic series can be produced without the use of the right hand. In order to play notes outside of the harmonic series,hornists originally used varying hand posistions, a practice still commonly used today on modern horns to make minor pitch adjustments. Today, when playing music written before the advent valves, we see parts written for horn in many keys besides F. While multiple keys consistently challenge players of modern valved horns to accurately transpose by sight, they actually simplify the reading and playing of music for the natural horn. The hornist would just add the correct crook to change the natural horn's key, thereby enabling the player to both read the music as written and more easily play passages with the hand. Realizing that handhorn technique doesn't change between keys can help make transposition much easier. All we need to know is which key combinations are equivalent to the key of the horn part.

List of natural horn keys with their corresponding fingering on the modern horn:
* C alto - none
* B alto - none
* Bb alto - T0
* A alto - T2
* Ab alto - T1
* G - T12 or T3
* Gb - T23
* F - F0 or T13
* E - F2 or T123
* Eb - F1
* D - F12 or F3
* Db - F23
* C - F13
* B basso - F123
* Bb basso - none
* A basso - none
* Ab basso - none

=== Handhorn Technique ===

Before starting to learn handhorn get to know the harmonic series of the horn or the notes that can naturally be played without valves. &lt;!-- a figure of the natural harmonic series should be inserted here. --&gt;

For every pitch there are a few things we can do to give us a near chromatic range:
* To play one half-step lower, close off the bell a bit. This will take some experimenting to figure out how much, but it should be relatively easy.
* To play one half-step higher, fully stop the bell. (For a full explanation see [[W:en:List of Horn Techniques|Stopped horn]].)  For modern horns, we are encouraged to make this sound quite nasally. For the natural horn, it should be much smoother. Experiment to make the note sound more uniform with other notes. This may even require playing some of the open notes slightly more closed.
* Pitch bending with the lips is required for some notes. For example Beethoven especially likes throwing in low written G's (bottom line base clef in new notation). This is not a note in the harmonic series, but bending the pitch that low is quite possible. Another example that is not used often is for playing the D just below the treble clef staff. It is a whole step away from the C and E which can be played open. Bending all the way to the D from either note is quite difficult, but a half-step bend down from the E is very doable. So if we bend a half-step and then close off the bell a bit we can get a D.

Some repertoire for natural horn:
* Mozart Horn Concerti
* Beethoven Sonata for Horn
&lt;!-- add more here --&gt;

== Single ==

The single horn has three valves which lower the pitch of the instrument two, one, and three half steps respectively.  Valves eliminate the need for hand-horning, though stopped horn is still commonly used among modern players.  Single horns are usually made in the key of F, though many can be found in Bb alto.   

== Double ==

The double horn combines the F and Bb single horns into one instrument.  Double horns have four valves; the three valves of the single horn plus an additional valve, played with the thumb, to switch between the F and Bb horn.  The double horn is the most commonly used today.  It gives players extra versatility by allowing them to use the Bb horn to produce better tone in the upper register and in the low range from the F below middle C to the C a fourth below that.  The F horn is typically used in the mid-low to middle register.  

== Descant ==

The descant horn is a single horn in the key of F, but pitched an octave higher than the usual F horn.  It is often used for pieces in which the horn part is entirely in the upper and upper-middle registers.

== Triple ==

The triple horn combines the single F, single Bb, and descant horns into one instrument.  It has the four valves of a double horn plus a fifth valve to switch to the descant &quot;side&quot; of the horn. &lt;!--add more please--&gt;

== Closely related instruments ==
* Alp Horn
* Wagner Tuba

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Enzymes are macromolecules that act as organic catalysts in most of the organism's biochemical reactions that have functions indispensable to maintenance and activity of life. It is crucial to note that reaction rates of certain chemical conversions occurring in living organisms are extremely low, and catalysis is necessary to maintain reasonable time of cell development and division. Majority of functional enzymes are proteins, like trypsin, fumarase or papain. A small subset of enzymes are composed of RNA and are known as '''ribozymes''', for example hammerhead ribozyme, responsible for cleaving and joining at a specific site of RNA molecule, or 23S rRNA of prokaryotic 50S ribosome subunit activity of peptidyl transferase. The general mechanism by which enzymes work is by reducing the energy required to start the reaction, otherwise known as the activation energy. Microorganisms producing certain enzymes, or extracted and purified enzymes alone have extremely varied uses: ethanol production (''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''‎, ''Zymomonas mobilis'') forensic science (restriction enzymes), and polymerase chain reaction amongst them.
Uses of enzymes are not purely scientific. These diverse molecules form a huge part of industries such as brewing and pharmaceuticals; the use of enzymes alone in the brewing process of Guinness is worth over a billion euro to the Irish economy.

== Structure of Enzymes ==

Model enzymes are monomeric, globular proteins. Majority of studies on nature of enzymatic reactions were conducted on trypsin, chymotrypsin or amylase. As every protein, to work correctly enzymes require proper folding, and, by consequence, are susceptible to deactivation by denaturation. The key to enzyme activity is a structure called '''active site'''. Interactions between residues of polypeptide chain aminoacids cause them to create a structure of defined size, shape and sequence. The difference between active site and structural domain is that the latter is able to recognize (recognition site) and process a defined molecule. Whether the interaction between the molecule and recognition site is sterical (shape-based), hydrophobic (chymotrypsin) or ionic (trypsin) it is always specific and temporal. Inhibitors often use specific covalent binding to an active site, which deactivates enzyme permanently. 

Two theories regarding active sites were created. Theory of ''key and lock'' states that active site and substrate are of matching size and shape - substrate being a key and active site a lock. Binding of perfectly matching molecule would induce conformational changes of enzyme, causing catalysis. Second theory of induced fit states that active site and substrate have different, mismatching structures. When substrate meets active site it induces it to assume certain conformation, whether it is by removing structural water molecules, or straining interactions between aminoacid residues. 

== Mechanism of Enzymes ==

The mechanism how enzymes work is by lowering the activation energy of the reaction which the specific enzyme is to catalyse. Each enzyme is entirely specific to the reactants; it will only work for one specific reaction, this is due to the unique active site of each enzyme. The enzyme's active site is in a unique 3D shape, with a unique pattern of electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity. Here the specific substrates -- the substances upon which the enzyme works -- are temporarily combined with the enzyme, forming an enzyme substrate complex, or ESC. The reaction then occurs, and the product of the reaction separates from the enzyme, at which point the product may be used. The enzyme is then capable of repeating the reaction many thousands of times, although they may have to be replaced every so often.

'''Activity of Enzymes'''
Control of Enzyme activity in Cell
The production of enzymes can be enhanced or diminished by changing the internal environment of the cell. This is called enzyme induction and inhabitation. The enzyme inhibitor or the enzyme inductor will be bound to the enzyme and either decrease or increase the activity of the enzyme. The inhibitor stops the entre of substrate to the active site. It can be reversible or irreversible. Enzyme activities are compartmentalized; this means that the reduced activity of one enzyme can lower the productivity of another, since they are linked. Some enzymes will be activated by environmental factors inside your body, for example the lowering of body pH changes the activity of hemagglutinin in influenza. Thus, the lower the potential energy barrier to reaction, the more reactants have sufficient energy and, hence, the faster the reaction will occur. All catalysts, including enzymes, function by forming a transition state, with the reactants, of lower free energy than would be found in the uncatalysed reaction.


----
'''Enzyme Graph'''

Enzymes do not modify the equilibrium of a reaction.  Enzymes only catalyze or speeds up the rate of reaction by stabilizing the transition state and do not participate in the chemical reaction.  The transition state is the highest activation energy (Ea) on a reaction coordinate in which the molecule is only partially reacted.  The activation energy is lowered when a catalyst (enzyme) is used.  When an enzyme is not used, the activation energy of a reaction is much higher, which will take the reaction much longer to proceed.  The enzyme is complementary to the transition state and not the substrate, in order to facilitate the reaction efficiently.  A catalyst is present in the reactants and also appears in the end products.

&lt;small&gt;
[[File:CatalysisScheme.png]]&lt;/small&gt;

== Properties of Enzymes ==

1. Enzymes are sensitive to heat, and are denatured by excess heat or (inactivated by excess cold), i.e. their active site becomes permanently warped, thus the enzyme is unable to form an enzyme substrate complex. This is what happens when you fry an egg, the egg white (augmenten, a type of protein, not an enzyme), is denatured.
2. Enzymes are created in cells but are capable of functioning outside of the cell. This allows the enzymes to be immobilised, without ''killing'' them.
3. Enzymes are sensitive to pH, the rate at which they can conduct reaction is dependent upon the pH of where the reaction is taking place, e.g. pepsin in the stomach has an optimum pH of about pH2. Whereas salivary amylase has an optimum pH of about 7. 
4. Enzymes are reusable, and some enzymes are capable of catalysing many hundreds of thousands of reactions every second, e.g. catalase working on hydrogen peroxide.
5. Enzymes will only catalyse one reaction, e.g. invertase will only produce glucose and fructose, when a glucose solution is passed over beads of enzyme (see Immobilisation).
6. The reaction rate for an enzyme is limited by its saturation point.  Saturation is essentially the point at which an enzyme can no longer speed up the reaction to compensate for the increase in substrate concentration (push the equilibrium towards the products).  Graphically this is portrayed as a horizontal asymptote and is also called the maximum velocity.  Each enzyme has its own maximum velocity for a given substrate.  Measuring the rate of product formation with varying concentrations of substrate is one way of determining the maximum velocity of an enzyme. 
7. Enzymes are capable of working in reverse, this acts as a cut off point for the amount of product being produced. If there are excess reactants the reaction will keep going and be reversed, so that there is no overload or build  up of product.
Enzymes are catalysts in the breaking down of substances by bonding with them briefly. Hydrogen peroxide they break it down into water and oxygen much faster than it would naturally occur. Inside the body they are used to break down food and to start off the digestion process. They are proteins they are affected by the pH level of the substance and also the temperature of the substance. The last important note is that obviously the concentration of the enzyme will affect how well it works.They are substrate specific which is illustrated by the lock and key hypothesis.

Enzymes may be immobilised in two ways, firstly by bonding them chemically to some sort of rigid structure, and secondly by physically placing the enzymes on an insolube support structure, e.g. a gel or bead. The second method of enzyme immobilisation is much more common, is cheaper, but it does reduce the enzyme's ability to catalyse reactions. 


'''Steps in Enzyme immobilization'''

1. Make up a 5% w/v solution of sodium alginate, and leave to stand overnight, to mix properly.

2. Add the enzyme, or in this case, a cell e.g. yeast, to the alginate solution, and mix in well. At this point the mixture will be very thick, and should be left for twenty minutes to eliminate the air bubbles, from the solution; such air bubbles would increase the surface area of the beads, making them less efficient.

3. Take a syringe, and fill it with the alginate/cell matrix.

4. Make a 2% w/v solution of Calcium Chloride.

5. Hold the syringe about 20 cm perpendicularly above the calcium chloride solution, and drip in the alginate solution, trying to create the smallest possible beads, approx 3-4mm in diameter.

6. Remove and discard any alginate strings or floating beads from the chloride solution.

7. Rinse the beads in deionised water.

8. Using a retort stand set up two tap funnels above each other, placing the beads in the bottom funnel, and strong glucose in the top.

9. Allow the glucose to run through the beads, and draw off the product.

The product is a type of alcohol, which should not be ingested as it is impossible to tell whether it is ethanol or methanol, the later being toxic.

== Naming Enzymes==

Until quite recently enzymes have been given arbitrary names, for example, ptylin (amylase), this tells us nothing of what the enzyme acts upon, instead biologists have devised a means of naming enzymes, whereby enzymes end -ase; e.g. DNA Helicase, they have also included a clue as to what the enzyme acts upon; DNA Helicase working to separate nucleotides in a chain of DNA. Other common enzymes include protease, lipases, pepsin, amylase, and lysomase.

:Thanks! Two caveats: I may not contribute very consistently. I have a senior thesis to write, and this is my method of procrastination. Second, my writing may not be as smooth to read as a book should be. I'm just trying to get the material down and leave the editing and exposition to others later. Feel free to refactor anything I write. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 04:52, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Seeing the light... ==

I agree with you now that the Data Structures book should use some kind of form of generics. See the talk page for details. Basically, we can just put the &quot;unspecified types&quot; in the angle-brackets and not get too carried away with declarations (since it's pseudocode, and it's more important that the reader knows what we mean, so just treating Key and Element, e.g., as real types is good enough).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Who is Jack?=

I was a free lance filmmaker but I've returned to my geeky roots and am doing a Computer Science PhD at Imperial College London on &quot;Disaggregating Smart Meter Readings&quot;.  As a filmmaker, I've worked on over 35 films including roles as producer, director, editor and stills photographer.

My personal website is [http://jack-kelly.com Jack-Kelly.com]

[http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm1913075/ Jack Kelly on IMDB]

My real name is Daniel but everyone calls me Jack!

The website for a film I produced is here: [http://www.mirrorsthefilm.com Mirrors (short film)]

== A monocot seedling ==

[[image:Monocot_seedling.jpg|400px|right|Pritchardia remota]]
The photograph at the right shows two germinating seeds.  These are seeds of the fan palm, ''Pritchardia remota'', a species found naturally only on (endemic to) the remote island of Nihoa in the Hawaiian islands. The seed on the left is in the proper orientation in the planting medium (only a part of the fruit coat covering the seed is visible), while the one on the right (in a slightly earlier stage) has been laid on the surface in order to better reveal development of the root.  The following structures are labeled:
:'''co''' - ''coleoptile'' or shoot pole of plant axis; essentially a cap within which the plumule (first leaf) is developing, to eventually project through as in the seedling on the left.  
:'''ra''' - ''radicle''; primordial root or root pole of axis (note tiny root cap), buried in the medium in the seedling on the left.
:'''sc''' - ''scuttelum''; that part of the cotyledon that remains inside the seed to absorb food stored in an endosperm.

=== Square tapered hubs ===

These are known as cotterless hubs outside the US. The square tapered hub is the basic hub that is found on cheaper unicycles and most bikes. The ends of the spindle are the square tapers. The cranks have square holes and are fastened onto the spindle with a bolt or a nut.

The advantage of this hub is mainly that it is cheap. The disadvantages are that the axle may snap or bend more easily than the axle on a splined hub and that the square tapers may become rounded if ridden with a loose crank.

=== Splined hubs ===

The splined hubs are found on high-end trials and mountain unicycles. These hubs are more expensive, but they are also a lot more durable. The splines (small ridges almost like teeth) on the end of the axle fit into an appropriately shaped hole in the crank. This provides more points of contact between the crank and the axle, and the force can be distributed over a greater area. On a square tapered hub there are only four points of contact. A splined hub usually also comes with an axle of greater diameter. 

If you intend to do trials and muni, having a splined hub is good, since these riding styles typically produce a lot of stress on the axle.

Common brands of splined hubs are Kris Holm, Qu-Ax, Onza, Profile, Koxx, Torker, KH/Onza, Nimbus ISIS and the new KH Moment.

==== Loose crank arms ====

Loose crank arms is one of the most common problems but fortunately this is usually easy to resolve. For splined hubs, you will need anti-seize and the appropriate allen keys, usually an 8mm and a 6mm. Remove the crank arm by loosening up and removed the retaining bolt and pinch bolt (if your hub has one). Put some anti-seize on the threads of these bolts. Then remove the crank itself and cover the axle and splines with anti-seize. Do not use too much or you'll make a mess. When you put the cranks on, first tighten the retaining bolt (the big bolt) on both sides, but not super tight. Then tighten both retaining bolts. Finally, tighten the pinch bolts. It is important that both the retaining bolts and the pinch bolts are very tight.

It is a good habit to check the bolts regularly. If the unicycle is new it make require that you tighten it a few times before it settles.

==== Keyway slop ====

If you notice that both cranks slip at the same time when you ride or idle, it is likely that your hub has some keyway slop. A minor keyway slop feels like a tiny clicking sensation in both cranks, while a major slop may very well render the unicycle unridable.

The problem is that when the axle is made of steel and the hub is made of aluminum, the different metals cannot be welded. The axle is pressed into a machined keyway in the hub. The manufacturing tolerances for this process are very close. If tolerances are off by just a few thousandths of a centimeter, the hole for the keyways may become just a little too big, and the hub may develop a slop.

It is possible to repair this, at least temporarily, by pressing the axle partly out of the hub and applying Loctite. If your unicycle is new, your best bet is to contact your dealer. Make sure that they have a replacement ready for you before you send back your hub.

Kris Holm has reported that the KH/Onza hub does not suffer from these problems.

==== Splined Cranks ====

Unfortunately every brand has its own standard, though progress is being made to move towards the ISIS standard, as Kris Holm, Onza, Nimbus, Qu-ax and Koxx have adopted this industry-wide standard, though there are some incompatibility issues with the Koxx Hubs not fitting any other ISIS cranks.

Currently we have

=== Wheel sizes ===

====Freestyle====
Freestyle is generally done on a 20&quot; wheel, because it gives more fine control than any other wheel size. Almost all serious performances are done with this wheel size. Most skills can be done on a 24&quot; wheel however, and freestyle on a Coker or a very small wheel can be an interesting challenge.

==== Trials ====

The trials wheel are usually 19&quot;, but it is also possible to do trials on a 24&quot; muni. If you need to ride any distance a 24&quot; may be a good alternative.

Notice that for a standard '20&quot;' trials unicycle with a 2.5&quot; tire, the rim is 19&quot; and this means that you cannot fit a regular 20&quot; tire onto a trials rim, nor a trials tire onto a regular 20&quot; rim.

==== Muni ====

A muni is usually 24&quot; or 26&quot;, except for 20&quot; trials unicycles that may be used as munis by children. Ascents and descents may be somewhat easier on a 24&quot; muni than on a 26&quot; muni. Expect a 24&quot; muni to be somewhat easier to manoeuvre but slightly slower than a 26&quot;. 29&quot; Munis are becoming popular too. If cross country riding and climbing is your thing, 29&quot; is the way to go.

If your riding is technical then a 24&quot; muni is probably a better choice. 26ers are generally for trails with not so many technical sections, and 29ers should only be used for fast, smoother XC trails.

==== 28&quot; and 29&quot; (700c)====

These use the same rim, the difference is that the 29&quot; unicycle has a thicker tire, such as a Schwalbe Big Apple (28x2.35) or a WTB Motoraptor or Nanoraptor (both 28x2.1). On a 29&quot; you will feel the ground less - in a good way. Both are good for commuting.

==== 36&quot; (Coker) ==== 

36&quot; wheel unicycles are commonly referred to as Cokers, named after the tire manufacturer that sold the first 36&quot; unicycles.  Riding is substantially different to riding a smaller wheel because once you get such a big heavy wheel spinning nicely, it's got lots of momentum. 
While 36&quot; are most commonly used for distance riding, there have been recent experiments with more aggressive, almost bmx-style, riding. These experiments have led to the proposal of a variant of trials, called rolling trials, where the basic idea of getting over a set of obstacles is taken from trials and applied to a unicycle that can't jump well but can roll over almost anything.

A new 36 inch unicycle that is somewhat cheaper than the Coker, has recently been introduced by Qu-Ax.

There is now another 36&quot; wheel unicycle, the Radial 360 36-inch Unicycle which has noticeably better components than the basic Coker and a slick road tyre.

One of the biggest recent improvements in 36&quot; unicycles is the Nimbus 36&quot; with its twin forked chromoly frame to give rigidity and machined bearing cups and T7 handle.

=== Frames ===

==== Aluminium vs. Steel and Titanium ====

Aluminium is weaker than steel, and significantly more brittle.  To prevent cracking, aluminum frames must be made much stiffer than steel frames.  Still, aluminum has only 1/3 the density of steel, allowing stiff frames made of &quot;oversized&quot; aluminum tubing to weigh less than steel frames.  Since the walls are so thin they are however easy to dent, and dents  may introduce a local weakness, making it prone to break there.
Titanium is a new rising material, which combines mostly the qualities of steel and aluminium. It has no corrosion, high stability and light wheight. Depending to the alloy it is possible to build very stiff and light frames or more elastic frames. Because of the complex fabrication it is, at the moment, about ten times as expensiv as steel.

==== Painting your frame ====
The longest lasting and most professional way to go is powder coating. This method is done by a powdercoating shop and is very durable and good looking. Powder coating can cost anywhere from $50 to $100 for a frame. Look in the yellow pages for powdercoating shops.

If your mind is more focused on budget, spraypainting is your best option. Use high quality paint, and put as many coats as you can (recomended 3-8). Also keep in mind that if you have a chrome frame, you should sandpaper it until you get a &quot;brushed metal&quot; look before painting. ALWAYS use PLENTY of clear coat. Again, use as much as possible, because this will keep your paint from being scratched.

==== Bearing sizes ====

All bearings are 10mm(?) wide.

* 22 mm ID 42 mm OD 
These are used on the 2007 Onza ISIS, Nimbus ISIS and KH Moment ISIS hubs.

* 19 mm ID 40 mm OD (6203-12-2rs)

These bearings fit a Profile hub together with for example a Yuni or a KH Pro frame. It is possible to use a frame designed for 42 mm OD bearings with shims, shims are available from unicycle.com

* 20 mm ID 42 mm OD (6004-2rs)

This is used on trials and off-road unicycles such as Kris Holm, Onza, and Qu-ax.

* 17 mm ID 40 mm OD (6203-2rs)

This is the standard on most unicycles, with a few exceptions.

* 17 mm ID 35 mm OD (6003-2rs)

This is the size used for Miyata, Sem and Pashley unicycles.

* 20 mm ID 40 mm OD

These bearings are used on the Torker DX, but are hard to come by separately. 

----

It is possible to determine the size of a bearing by looking at the numbers.

'''The first digit is the type code&lt;br&gt;'''
6 = &quot;single row deep groove ball bearing&quot;

'''The second digit is the series number&lt;br&gt;'''
2 = &quot;light&quot; (as opposed to extra light, medium, heavy etc)

'''The third and fourth digit are the bore size code&lt;br&gt;'''
Some common ones are:
*00 = 10mm
*01 = 12mm
*02 = 15mm
*03 = 17mm
*04 = 20mm

'''The 2rs suffix indicates it is a double sealed bearing.'''

The outside diameter (OD) of a bearing depends on both the bore size (inside diameter) AND the series. A more robust bearing has a larger OD.

=== Pedals ===

Pedals can be broken into two categories, metal and plastic.  Because metal pedals can easily damage delicate surfaces, plastic pedals are a must for indoor riding on gym floors.  Special freestyle pedals are rubber coated and have no exposed metal parts for this purpose.  Most freestyle and commuter unicycles come with plastic pedals.  Extra caution must be taken when riding with wet shoes on plastic pedals, for shoes have a tendency to slip off.  For muni and trials riding, metal pedals help prevent the rider's feet from slipping, but these pedals can do serious damage to your shins.  It is always a good idea to wear shin guards when riding with metal pedals.  

Good pedals for trials or muni are BMX platform style pedals of steel or aluminum, or, less commonly, magnesium. It is important to have a big platform. If you want to do pedal grabs it is also important to have replaceable pins. While too long pins tend to make the pedal stick to surfaces, too short pins do not provide enough grip. Something in between is the best.

While sealed bearing pedals have good protection against water and mud, an unsealed pedal holds up better for pedal grabs.

Good pedals are made by OJC, Snafu, Primo, Wellgo, etc.

It is not a good idea to use clipless pedals on your unicycle, even though they may weigh less. If you lose balance with regular pedals, you can almost always place your feet on the ground, and you'll be fine.
But if your feet are clipped in, it's quite a high fall to land on your hands. The wrists are easy to break, and if you land on your head, that's far worse.

=== Saddles ===
Since you hopefully will spend a lot of time in your saddle, having a comfortable saddle is nice! If you plan to spend more than a half hour at a time sitting on the saddle, a seat with more padding than is found on a basic unicycle seat is recommended.  Some prefer airseat conversions, others enjoy maintenance free seats containing various degrees of foam or gel inserts. Saddle comfort varies widely with rider, and what is comfortable for one rider may not be for another.

==== Saddle Brands ====

* Kris Holm - A large soft seat with lift handle on the front.  Comes in various colors.  Options include a removable cover or an air saddle.  Pretty much the standard seat for medium to upper-grade unicycles.  A lot of people would recommend the Kris Holm saddle for distance riding and muni. The Kris Holm saddle is also good for trials although some prefer a Miyata saddle.  This seat's design is very similar to the Torker DX and Unicycle.com Velo seat.

* Nimbus - Nimbus makes a low-profile seat with gel inserts that many prefer for trials. Similar to the Unicycle.com gel seat.

* Miyata (Torker LX) - Less bulky than the Kris Holm saddle so prefered by some trials and freestyle riders, but not very strong.  Easily converted into an air saddle.  Non-standard seat posts are required for this seat.

* Viscount - Popular entry level seat that comes in multiple colors.  Lightly padded but prefered by some because of its thin profile.  Screws on front bumper guard rub against fingers when jumping. This seat has a steel base, as opposed to the plastic bases on many other seats, so there is less seat flex.

* Classic - Similar to the Viscount with metal base but with more robust bumpers.

* Semcycle - Schwinn style seat which comes in multiple colors.  Comfortable and is easily converted into an air seat for extra comfort.  

* Torker CX - Standard on the Torker CX unicycles.  Small and very sturdy.  Best suited for smaller riders, as larger riders generally find it uncomfortable.

* United - A solid inexpensive beginner seat.  

* Savage - Inexpensive seat that is easily ridden in both directions.  Contains metal bumpers, use with extreme caution.

Other seats such as the United and the Koxx are both suitable for trials.

==== Air seats ====

It's possible to convert your seat to an air seat. The exact procedure depends on the model of seat being operated on, but in general the process goes something like this:

# Acquire a small tube - one to fit a 12&quot; wheel is generally suitable
# Remove seat bumpers and/or handle (this usually means undoing some screws or nuts)
# Remove cover (this often means removing staples). At this point you have a naked seat.
# Remove the foam or other padding from the seat.
# Drill a hole (min 8.5mm) in the seat base for the tube's valve to stick out.
# Arrange the tube; either tape it into a suitable shape or put it in an airseat tube bag.
# Place the tube on the seat, where the foam used to be.
# Cut the bottom off the foam, so you have a thin piece of foam that will ensure the seat has an appropriate shape
# Place the foam on top of the tube.
# Reattach the seat cover, and any bumpers and handles
# Inflate the tube to the desired pressure, being careful not to overinflate it and damage the seat cover.

=== Crank length ===

Within reasonable limits shorter cranks mean more speed while longer cranks ease climbing and provide more braking power and better general maneuverability.

Crank lengths are very much a personal thing. The right crank length for you will depend not only on what kind of riding you do, but also on your strength and confidence. You should experiment to find out what works for you.

==== Trials ====

The common crank lengths for trials are
* 127 mm
* 137 mm
* 140 mm
* 145 mm

In general precision increases with the crank length. 127 mm cranks may increase hopping height for rolling hops since you can gain more speed. 140 mm or 145 mm may be a good choice for regular trials, but they are rather slow. Also the pedal hitting the ground in leaning turns may become a problem with 140 mm, and even more so with 145 mm.

As for different types of trials, Short cranks are recommended for street/urban trials, medium lengths for all-around, and longer lengths for pure/natural trials.

==== Muni ====

The common crank lengths for muni are between 150 mm and 170 mm. Longer cranks may be harder on the knees.

==== Freestyle ====

For 20&quot; freestyle riding, cranks range from 89mm to 127mm.  The larger the cranks, the more your legs move and cause your ride to oscillate side to side.  Smaller cranks have less torque but allow the rider to travel faster and ride with their seat higher.  For the beginner, 127mm cranks are standard. most freestylers ride 114mm cranks

==== Commuter/36&quot; ====

Generally, shorter cranks will give the rider more speed, but less control. Since short cranks provide less torque, though, many of these cycles include brakes for gradual-slowing down or descending.

=== Tires ===

This section answers questions about tires for different types of riding, such as:
* What tire width is appropriate?
* What thread count is good?
* How do you make snow chains?

==== Trials tires ====
The most popular trials tires are the Monty, Luna, Maxxis Creepy-Crawler, and Try-all. Most trials tires are around 2.5&quot; wide, and have a square block pattern tread (except for the Try-all, which has a tread designed for natural trials). The things to look for in a trials tire are low weight, low duro rubber, thick sidewalls, and tall sidewalls. [http://www.unicyclist.com/forums/showthread.php?t=65995 The Official 19&quot; Trials Tyre Thread] at Unicyclist.com is a great help when looking for advice on choosing trials tires.

==== Muni tires ====
Tires for Muni are generally very high-volume, low pressure, to provide the most cushioning and bounce. Typical tires for muni are 3&quot; wide and include the Duro Wildlife and Nokkian Gazzaloddi, as well as Surly 4&quot; Endomorph and Larry.

==== 28&quot; and 29&quot; tires ====
The size of these tire sometimes confuses people as they are both 700c tires and will fit on the same rim. 
A 28&quot; tire is a 700x40c.
A 29&quot; tire is anything bigger up to 700x60c.
The Schwalbe Big Apple 29x2.35&quot; is probably the most popular tire for unicycling on the road.
Off-road there are several tires available; Kenda Klaw XT, IRC Notos XC, IRC Mythos XC.

==== 36&quot; Tires ====
There are four styles of tire currently available for 36&quot; wheeled unicycles; the original Coker &quot;button tread&quot; hybrid tire,the Qu-ax 36&quot; road tire (also known as Wheel TA 36-inch Street Tire, same as the new Coker XLR road tire), the new lightweight Nimbus Nightrider 36&quot; road and trails tire and the Coker Off-Road tire with block tread in the shape of the &quot;coker&quot; lettering. These tires are nearly identical except for the tread pattern except for the Nightrider which has 2-ply construction rather than 4-ply to save weight and is rated up to 65 PSI rather than 32 PSI.

==== What else ====
==== How to make your own studded tire ====

Affordable studded tires in some sizes are very hard to find. 
The best I have found are a few pretty cheap (350SEK/40€/$55+shipping) 20&quot; studded tires from a BMX dealer, manufactured by Innova.

So why not make one for yourself? The only costs are a tire, some studs and some work.

This is how I made my studded tire, not necessarily the best way to make it.

You need:

1 tire that fits your rim - it must have a fairly deep tread to make sure the screws have something to grip. (i used a Nokian X-trak)

2.5mm drill

Half-inch self drilling screws for wood

Glue

An old tube, or a few meters of duct tape (or both).

A screwdriver

Something to cut the screws with!

(Thimble)

1. Take a good look at the pattern on the tire and decide where the studs should be for best performance? Keep in mind that if they are in the middle, you'll have great grip in acceleration and braking, whilst if they are on the sides, they'll grip when your off balance and therefore have more need for that grip.

Considering this, I placed 2 parallel lines of studs. The lines were 1.5 cm apart, and within each line the studs are separated by about 3cm. That required 92 studs for a 20&quot; tire; if I made one today I might have put more studs in, but it works well as it is.

2. Now you have to drill all the holes.  Drill 2.5 mm holes where you want the studs, drilling into the outside of the tire.

3. Start with pressing a few screws in place from inside the tire, using a thimble if required

4. Screw those screws in place

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until all holes are used.

6. Since the heads of the screws will tear on the tube, you have to do something about it.

Either: Cut an old tube to create a strip of rubber that reaches all the way around the tyre. Make it wide enough that there is at least 1cm between the edge of the strip and a stud, and glue it in place.

Or: 3 layers of duct tape will suffice.
I used: Both, use only the tube for 2 weeks, then i had my first pinch flat, now i have both.

7. Place the tire on the wheel, inflate to high pressure, wait for the glue to set.

8. Cut all the studs to a few millimeters of length using your weapon of choice, being careful not to harm the tire.

This took me about 4 hours of a rather inefficient work, would be able to do it in under 1 hour.

Don't use your new tire indoor, and use high pressure (at least 3 BAR or 45 PSI) to make sure the studs don't pop into the tire.
You're all set!

=== Rim ===

Choosing a rim involves tradeoffs. If you do high drops, you may want a tough downhill rim. But sturdy rims are also heavy, and therefore not so good for hopping.

The most common rim for MUni is the Alex DX32 rim which is 35.1 mm wide.

Qu-Ax uses a DB-45 rim which is 45 mm wide.

Kris Holm designed and sells multiple types of rims. Two rims are 24 inch with 36 holes, one is a 42.2mm wide rim for better grip, and the other is a lighter 38mm rim for distance riding. Another rim is a 700c rim with eyelets. On the new 2007 KH unicycles, the rims are 45 mm wide but with holes drilled intermittently to reduce weight. In this way, the advantages of both types of rims are combined

For 28&quot; and 29&quot; unicycles, a standard 700c rim is used.

On a coker, there are three rims available. The Coker company makes a steel rim, which is serviceable but is known to bend after some abuse. The traditional choice for a stronger rim is the Airfoil rim sold by unicycle.com. Darren Bedford has recently started selling a coker with an aluminum rim, but these turned out to be brushed steel as used on the Qu-ax 36&quot; unicycle 

If you like extreme MUni, Surly Bikes makes the Large Marge 65mm wide rim in both 26 and 24 inch sizes. This rim claims to be good for  riding on sand, snow, mud, or other terrain where you need more grip than usual. http://www.surlybikes.com/parts/largemarge_pop.html

=== Tire pressure ===

Tire pressure is a huge topic among unicyclists.

In short, low pressure offers better grip, while high pressure is better for heavy landings or pre-hops with a lot of force. In detail, high pressure on the other hand lowers rolling resistance and eases turning.

Low pressure may provide a better grip and allow you to roll over small obstacles rather than bounce off them.

Your tire pressure is considered too low if your rim's sidewalls hit the ground when you land a drop. Rim sidewalls pressing the tire on the ground may cause pinch flats.

For freestyle it may be of advantage to use a high pressures, up to 85 psi has been spotted on the forums, (though I don't know the standard, someone with a trials or freestyle uni please add info here). 
Certain bmx freestyle tires can now be put up to 120psi and one even has Kevlar beading.

Trials and mountain unicycling uses rather low pressure, as low as 18 psi has been spotted on the forums, though psi in mid twenties seems to be more common.  A rule of thumb to start with is to use 1PSI for every 10lbs of rider.  A rider who weighs 180lbs would thus use 18PSI, a rider of 200lbs would use 20PSI.  This is a good starting point, and can then be adjusted to fit the rider's skill and/or terrain.

=== Brakes ===

Most unicycles do not use brakes, simply because the use of direct drive. (Because the pedals are directly attached to the wheel, if you stop pedaling you will stop moving.) However, there are those who are developing unicycle brakes. The only unicycles that do use brakes commonly are MUnis and some commuter unis.

Brakes 
* Make it possible to do steeper hills in control.
* May provide more traction on loose downhill ground, where backwards torque would cause slippage.
* Give the knees/legs an easier job on long descents.

The most common brake used is the Magura HS-33, a hydraulic rim brake used commonly on trials bicycles. Commuter unis commonly use V-Brakes, but most MUnis must use hydraulic brakes because V-Brakes don't provide enough clearance for a 3&quot; tire.

=== Geared Unicycles ===
The first practical geared unicycles were designed and developed by [http://staff.washington.edu/gharper/ Greg Harper] and [http://freenet-homepage.de/unifrank/index_engl.htm Frank Bonsch]. The [http://schlumpfdrive.com/?sl=en&amp;sid=&amp;u_s=0&amp;u_a=22 Schlumpf geared unicycle] is now in production and available for sale.  There is also the new Kris Holm/Schlumpf geared hub with a reinforced ISIS axle and without the torque lever, released in January 2008.

While the previous methods of gearing involved a shifting mechanism inside the hub, some have experimented with using gears outside the hub, usually with a &quot;jackshaft&quot; dual sprocket, and this was developed for the larger-wheeled road unicycle by Pete Perron of Seattle. The jackshaft concept for cycling was originated by Ernesto Colnago of Italy, in a one-off bicycle prototype.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mandarin, like any language, has its own slang words and informal meanings for some common words. For example, 同志 (''tóngzhì'' - comrade, a commonly used honorific under Communism) now has a second meaning of &quot;gay person&quot; (because it literally means &quot;same aspirations&quot;—in this case sexual proclivities rather than political interests), and the female equivalent 小姐 (''xiǎojiě'', often used with service personnel such as waitresses) can also refer to a prostitute. Below is a partial list of common slang terms. The letters &quot;xx&quot; stand for someone or something, lit. gives a literal translation, and equiv. refers to an equivalent English expression.

=== Learning progress ===

The time it will take before you can ride a unicycle varies greatly. Some (although few) learn it instantly as they step on the unicycle, while for others it may take months. The most important thing to keep in mind is that anyone can learn, just don't give up.

If you are interested in the correlation between time it takes to learn how to ride a unicycle and age, have a look at http://www.xs4all.nl/~klaasbil/agelearn_short.htm

It helps your inspiration to watch other unicyclists ride. If you do not have a friend who can show you, look at the links to the galleries below!

=== 10 steps to Unicycling ===
Contrary to popular belief there is nothing that I can tell you that will make you instantly be able to ride a unicycle. People always say &quot;How do you do it?&quot; like there's some magical thing I can tell you that'll make you be able to ride instantly. There isn't. However, there are things that can help you learn to ride. Before you try some of these tips, it may help to have a friend on either side of you for your first couple attempts. This will give you a chance to &quot;understand&quot; the unicycle.

# Find a handrail that's a comfortable height.
# The easiest place to learn to ride is on smooth concrete or asphalt. Grass is too bumpy.
# Get used to simply sitting on the unicycle whilst holding onto the rail.
# Start riding forwards whilst holding onto the rail. (2 hands on the rail to start with and then progress to one)
# Eventually, when you are comfortable holding onto the rail and riding, let go.
# Get as far as you can and repeat.
# Keep your weight mainly on the seat. This stops you from wobbling side to side as much.
# Pedal evenly.
# Look forward.
# Wave your arms if you need to. You can't look like more of an idiot than you already do.

'''*Note on safety:''' Wear as many pads as you can, and try make sure you land on your feet, don't worry about catching the unicycle.  Dirty or broken parts are easy to fix, broken bones aren't.

=== Key points and tips ===
Biking is much easier than unicycling to learn because on a bicycle, you only have to control your balance to the left and right. Also, on a bicycle, your wheels automatically stay under your center of gravity when you are moving forward. However, on a unicycle, you don't have that luxury. You have to balance in the forward and backward directions, as well as to the sides.  Since side balancing is mostly taken care of by precession, forward-backward balance will be your key concern, at least at first.

To accomplish this, your weight must be farther forward than will feel normal for most people. You have to keep the unicycle under you, rather than you on top of it. So, if you lean forward and then pedal forward, the unicycle should be under you. This takes a while to get used to for most people, as the four-directional (forward, backward, left, right) balance is tricky. Don't fear! It will come with practice. Practice is the most important thing in your learning process.

If you have a specific problem that is not covered here, search the forums at [http://www.unicyclist.com Unicyclist.com] and if you cannot find an answer, ask a question.

=== Why did I fall off? ===
Basically, when you fall off you can always find the reason. This can help you correct the problem and improve. If you fall off the front you are either not pedaling enough (likely) or leaning too far forward (not as likely). If you fall off the back, you are either leaning too far back (likely) or pedaling too fast (less likely). If you fall off the side, you are probably not going anywhere. When you are learning, you always want to keep a forward momentum!

=== Saddle soreness ===
It is normal to experience some discomfort when you start unicycling. This normally goes away as you learn to move some of the weight from the saddle to the pedals. Try to keep 1/3 of the weight on the pedals. Contrary to common belief, this is not only a problem for men!

Not all saddles are equal, especially when it comes to comfort. Many saddles, including Miyata and Viscount, have very little padding. If you have a saddle like this, you should consider either performing an [[The_Unicyclopedia/Hardware#Air_seats|airseat conversion]] on your saddle or replacing it with something with more padding such as Kris Holm or Koxx. The KH Fusion Freeride saddle seems to be generally accepted as the most comfortable unmodified saddle currently available.

Some things to try in order of importance

# Wear bike shorts with padding
# Change the angle of the saddle so that it's higher in the front
# Try a cycling lubricant like Chamois Butt'r
# Practice riding standing up with all of your weight on the pedals, and stand up a little while for every minute or so as you ride
# Lower the seat post by a few cm

=== I drift! ===

It is common that you drift slightly to the left or to right in the beginning. It usually goes away as you get better at unicycling. Things you may try include but are not limited to

* Check that the saddle is straight
* Check your posture, you should sit straight
* The road may be slanted. Most roads have a crown in the center and a slight slope to the shoulder.

If you want to actively attempt to correct your drift, there are several ways to practice.
These methods below may quickly show you whether it's harder for you to turn or balance at a particular angle.

* Ride in figure eights, try to keep all of the turning smooth and incremental
* Keep your back straight, and try to ride with your hands at your sides or behind your back
* Ride in lots of circles with decreasing diameter in the opposite direction of your drift
* Try riding with one shoulder or the other forward, you can encourage this by having one hand reaching across your body in front, and the other hand reaching across your body in back

=== Seat height ===

When you begin unicycling it helps to have the seat high in order to transfer most of your weight to the saddle. The seat should be in a position where you can just barely reach down to the pedals with your heel when the pedal is down.

Free mounting is easier with a lower seat.
For muni and trials you may want your seat a little or even a lot lower. When you start learning hopping, lower the seat by an inch or so. Then if that feels good, you could stay with that or try it even lower. The ideal height depends on the person and their style of riding.

When you learn seat out hopping having the seat too low may be uncomfortable and even put unnecessary stress on your shoulders, back, and arm.

Lowering the saddle may also help with saddle soreness.

=== Good Luck! ===
Good luck with learning, don't give up! It will come with time and lots of practice!</text>

=== Basic skills ===

==== One foot riding ====
When riding one footed, the vast majority of people prefer to place the non-pedaling foot on the crown. However, on larger frames (over 26&quot; or so, especially if the crown is rounded rather than square) it may be easier to bend the knee of the free leg at a 90 degree angle, and ride with the foot pointing backward, pressing the side of your calf against the frame. It is also possible to ride with the leg out in front (as seen in George Peck's Rough Terrain Unicycling film), however this is generally considered the most difficult.

A 20&quot; wheel is usually preferred for learning, as with most freestyle skills, easier with longer cranks, like 150 mm. However, the momentum of a larger wheel will make one-foot riding up hills much easier.
The more grip your pedals have, the better for one foot riding, as this will enable you to extend the usable range of motion. With pinned pedals, you can not only push the wheel pedal down, but also pull it backwards at the bottom of the cycle and forwards at the top. The pedals will frequently scrape your legs while learning so, if you use pinned pedals, appropriate protective clothing should be worn.

A smooth hard floor, such as a gym or hallway, will help, but a sidewalk (pavement) will work perfectly fine.
At first it will be easier to push down harder than normal on the front pedal to get more momentum to keep the wheel moving, but you will find it easier in the long run if you maintain a smooth, even tempo, just as if pedaling with both feet. Use your body to control your balance. When you first take one foot off, your wheel will be in front of you and you will be bent over at the waist to keep your balance centered over the uni. Whether this is just what naturally happens, or that purposefully doing this will actually help your learning, I do not know. 

At first just ride with taking the weight off one pedal for longer periods of time until you can do it for at least one revolution. When you get the hang of it, it is normal to run out of momentum after 3 or 4 revolutions. Just keep practicing and you will slowly start to go further, but a slight downhill may be helpful.

You may notice a significant wobble from side to side at first, but with a little practice, you should be able to travel in a line as straight as when you are using both feet, especially if one foot is on the crown.

There are three ways of learning to ride one-footed. Most people recommend method 2, or a combination of 1 and 2.

# As you ride along, put one foot on the crown of your unicycle and try to keep riding. Keep practising until you are able to do it. Some say that the transistion is the hardest part, and by the time you get that down smoothly, one foot riding will be pretty easy.
# Put less and less pressure on the pedal with that foot you plan to remove, until you are eventually not pushing the pedal at all. At this point you should be able to move that foot to the crown. The disadvantage of this method is that you will not have your leg on the frame to help you control your movement.
# Hold onto a wall, fence, or similar object. Place one foot on its pedal, and the other foot on the crown. Do a few exaggerated idles while in this position, slowly getting the pedal with the foot on it about to the 10 O'Clock position. At this point push the pedal down and around. When it gets to the bottom, stop pushing so it can come back up. You are now in a position where you can push the pedal around as many times as you like. Remember to keep your weight forward at all times, or your unicycle can shoot out from underneath you and leave you falling to the ground backside-first.

==== Idling ====
Some people find it easier to learn to ride backwards before learning to idle, some prefer to learn idling first, but either way they are complementary skills; learning one will improve your skill at the other.

Start going forward on flat ground, then slow down by resisting the pedals so that you almost come to a stop when your pedals are horizontal and your stronger foot is behind. The unicycle should be slightly in front of you (if it is not, lean back a little). Push moderately hard down on this pedal. 

Now, with your stronger foot in front, push down again. Work on making it all one fluid motion, rather than hesitating when the pedals are horizontal. Also, work on minimizing the travel needed to idle: 45 degrees is a good starting goal, rather than 180 (horizontal-to-horizontal).

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] showing [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240idleR idling]

==== One foot idling ====
As you idle, when your pedals are horizontal, put your back foot on the crown, and continue to idle. It helps if you have practiced to keep all the pressure on one foot, first. If you know how to idle, the one foot idle is not far away. 

To go directly from one foot idling to one foot riding, you will need to build up some momentum by idling in increasing arcs, often over 180 degrees (pedals going above horizontal).
To learn to freemount to one-foot idling, place the uni in front of you, and place one foot on the pedal. Push down and, at the same time, quickly take the other foot from the ground amd put it on the crown.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] showing [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240idle1ftL 1 footed idling]

==== Backward riding ====

Backward riding is similar to forward riding, except in the opposite direction.

There are two ways most people learn backward riding.

* Learn to idle first

If you can idle, you can learn to go backward in steps. Do an idle and then let the wheel go one whole rotation backward into another idle. Once you have got that, practice doing two rotations back, then three, and so on. After a while you will be going backward.

* Just go for it

Grab something to start from, let go, ride backwards, repeat. It might help to do this beside a rail, a wall, or a helper.

In both methods, there are a few important things to know.

* It is easier to ride backward without looking behind you. When you are learning, look behind and check that it is clear before you ride. Once you have learnt to ride backward, you can practice looking behind while riding backward.


* If you are scared of riding backward into the unknown, stand off the unicycle and practice running backward through your practice area to help give you confidence. Also, if the area is limited in size, have visual clues on the ground so you can see the end of the wall before you get there.

* Playing hockey is a great way to learn riding backwards- I pretty much learned it by mistake by playing hockey regularly.

* Try starting against a wall, car, post, etc. I find that easier.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] showing [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bw backward riding]

==== Rolling Hops ====
Rolling hops- as in riding along, and then hopping. Ride at moderate speed, wait for feet to be in right position (pedals horizontal), hold the seat, and hop! Pull the seat upwards as you do.
It takes time to develop timing, but with some practice you can get nearly as high as a SIF hop. Many people find that it helps to bend forward before pulling up, then again in the air to add even more height.

=== Seat out skills ===

==== Riding stomach on seat ====
This is pretty self-explanatory. It is riding with your stomach or chest on the seat. This is very similar to riding seat in front. It has four parts; it helps to practice number 2 and 3 first.

1) Quickly take the seat out from under you, it may be easier to ride on the very back of the seat for a second or two before you do this....(see Riding Seat in Front).

2) .....and place it on your stomach:

Lean over the seat and place it securely under your stomach or chest. I find it much easier to place it just lower than my stomach.(By stomach or chest I mean around the lower, to middle region of your torso). It helps to have a bit of body fat for this as it keeps the seat stuck to you rather than wiggle around. You probably will need to hold the seat still with one of your hands. Keep as much weight as possible on the seat.

3) Riding with stomach on seat.

Once the seat is under you and secure, ride forward like you normally would with your arms or arm out for balance. Be careful so you do not fall forward, onto your face.

4) Returning to normal riding

Simply hold the seat, push yourself off it, and place it back between your legs, quickly moving the seat past the point where it is hard to balance if you can't yet ride with the seat out in front.

While this trick may seem a little daunting at first, it is really easy. I got it on my second try. 

Safety: wear a helmet and wristguards while practicing because it can be likely that you will fall forward on your hands or face...

==== Riding seat in front ====

This is riding with your feet on the pedals as normal, but with the seat held out in front of you.

There are three parts to this skill. It's probably best to practice 2 first and then learn 1 and 3.

1) Taking the seat out from under you.

Stop briefly, stand up tall on the pedals and pull the seat out. It's a bit easier if you stand with your toes on the pedals, rather than the arch of your foot. Some people find it easiest to pull the seat out with one hand, then grab the side of the seat to hold on to with the other hand. Obviously, this is easier with the seat a bit lower. Very curved seats, such as Kris Holm and Velo seats are designed more so they don't come out from under you when riding technical muni and trials, and therefore tend to be a bit more difficult to pull out than less curved seats, but it is certainly possible with any seat.

2) Riding along with seat in front.

Hold the side of the seat with your hand and ride along. To start with hold the seat so it is in front of you, but still touching your body. When you get better, you can hold it further away. You need to make sure you're not putting more pressure on one pedal and try to pedal very smoothly. I suggest holding the seat firmly with both hands at the start and gradually working on letting go more and more, so that you can then hold on with one hand...3 fingers and a thumb....and finally 1 finger and your thumb. Next, see seat drags!

3) Putting the seat back under you:

Stand up tall on the pedals, quickly push the seat back under you and ride off before you fall over.

==== Riding seat out back ====

See above and replace in front with in back as appropriate.
I also find it easier to hold the seat handle with your arm going between your legs. This makes it slightly more stable while you're learning. When you are comfortable you can do it the same as seat in front.

==== Seat on side ====
This skill is easier on a 20&quot; wheel. It is still possible to learn it on a 24&quot; wheel.

To start with, practice riding in circles with seat out in back. When you are comfortable with this, lean a little while turning, and slip the seat to your side. The hard part is avoiding scraping you leg with the tire, while still getting you leg properly between the seat and the wheel. It helps to go slow, squat down a fair amount, and lean back. This may not be necessary on a 20&quot; unicycle. But in any case it will help when bend (your knees, not your back). You can also do spins in this position, or go backward, if you practice enough.

==== Chin on seat ====
Chin on seat is exactly what it sounds like; you crouch down really low while riding seat in front, plant you chin on the seat, and let go of it with your hands. Obviously, the first step is to practice crouching down while riding seat in front. This is rather awkward, and puts a lot of strain on your knees. Pretty soon, you will be able to touch the seat with your chin, for short periods of time. Now try to press harder and harder with your chin, until you feel fairly stable. Then let go of the seat with your hand. This skill is similar to seat drag in several ways; you must ride fast, and shift your weight from side to side to keep the wheel from wobbling. It's easier than seat drag, but not as much fun. It might be a good preparatory exercise for seat drag. Once you can do both, try transitioning from chin on seat to seat drag, simply by standing up from chin on seat and letting the seat drop. This skill is undeniably ridiculous, but it's still a good one to learn, if only for the sake of thoroughness.

==== Seat in front one-footed ====
This is the skill where the seat is in front. You put your hand on the seat and when the pedal is turning upwards lift your body with your hands and let it come up. Once it is up push down.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] that shows [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f3202401ftsf 1 footed riding with the seat in front]

==== Seat drags front and back ====
For seat drag, you first have to learn to ride with the seat in front or in back well extended. When you are comfortable with this, ride along quickly, and as smoothly as possible, so that the seat is not wobbling in your hand. I don't think it really matters what position the pedals are in when you drop the seat. Once you have dropped the seat, try to continue riding for as long as possible, although at first you will probably fall off immediately. When working on seat drag, as with the ultimate wheel, don't wear shorts unless you have some leg armour, because otherwise your shins will quickly get scratched up. While riding dragseat, try to go fast, as this will give you more stability. You have to shift your weight from side to side as you turn the pedals somewhat, to avoid inducing excessive wobbling. I do not find that there is much difference between seat drag in front and back, except that seat drag in front is easier, since you can see how the saddle is wobbling, and make the appropriate adjustments. When you fall off in front, try to jump forward a ways, (your momentum will generally carry you forward in any case) so that you don't step on the seat and damage it. When you fall off in back, be ready to make a quick adjustment in balance, for you may have to bend extremely far backwards to avoid being injured. This applies to coasting and gliding also.

Once you are comfortable with seat drag in front, you can learn to pick the seat up again. I find the pick up to be easier if I am riding more slowly than normal. This makes it easier to lean over. At first just try to lean over and touch the seat post briefly. When you can do this comfortably, simply reach down quickly and confidently and pick it up again.

Getting out of seat drag in back is somewhat more complicated. A lot of riders simply lean very far down and grab the seatpost, but it is also possible to kick it up with you foot or lift it up with your heel. I am most familiar with the latter. Before you switch to seat in back, make sure that you have the toe (not the ball or arch) of the foot you plan to use on the pedal. Turn the heel of this foot as far in as you can, without hitting the crank. Now drop the seat in back and let it drag for a while. Try to ride with as little wobble as possible. To lift the seat again, induce some wobble in the wheel as your foot is coming around in back. This causes the frame to swing around over your heel, so that you get leverage on it. When done properly, this should cause the frame to rise. Catch it with your hand as soon as possible, because otherwise you can end up in seat on side, which can be awkward.

==== Side ride ====

Side ride is riding one-footed with the foot on the non-corresponding pedal, and the entire body from the waist down on the same side of the unicycle as the pedal being used. For sake of convenience, I'll assume you're learning it on the left side with the right foot. If you're learning it on the right, simply reverse the directions.

To start out, stand on the left side of the unicycle, and turn the left pedal so that it's up, in front, nearer vertical than horizontal. Now grasp the seat with both hands, your right hand near the middle of the seat and the left at the front. Rest the saddle tightly against your body. Now set your right foot on the left pedal, and step down on it. It may take a lot of practice to get the first cycle of the wheel. You should rest almost all your weight on the saddle and press your thigh right against it. Press down fairly hard on the first stroke, then as soon as the pedal is down, release all the pressure so that the pedal can come up again. With a lot of practice, you should be able to get the pedal to come up and over again. 

Once you can do this consistently focus on actually riding. Side ride goes naturally in a circle to the right. (Assuming you're doing it on the left.) Once you get good at circling to the right you can go straight, or even in a figure eight, but at first you should do a circle to the right. Lean very hard to the right, and do everything you can to get your weight over the wheel, rather than to one side of it. The placement of your free leg is also important; raise it forward, and as much to the right as possible. It might even help to try placing it directly above the wheel. Keep your foot pressure on the pedal light and put all your weight on the seat.

=== Wheel walking skills ===

==== Wheel walking ====

Some people say the best way to start wheel walking is to begin near a wall, carry out the movements while holding onto the wall and then eventually try it away from the wall. A good way to use this technique is to learn the general foot motions by the wall, then carry on in the open. Possibly, the best way is to start away from the wall, as people usually learn quicker this way. You can either start from idling or start as a mount. Neither way is easier than the other, unless you can't idle. With your first foot roll forward with your toes and then stop with you heel. It is important to get as much distance as possible in one push, then as your other foot holds the wheel still, do the same thing with the remaining foot toe heel, toe heel, toe heel etc. Most people tell you to lean back, which isn't quite true. The best advice i can give is to sit up straight AND NOT LEAN FORWARD(some people think it helps to stick out your rear). Look forward, not down.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240ww the basic wheel-walk]

==== One foot wheel walking ====
People generally find one foot wheel walking more difficult than wheel walking with both feet. One method of learning to one foot wheel walk is to start using a wall (or some other support) with one foot planted firmly on the crown of the frame and the other resting on the top of the tyre. You should always have an upright posture when one foot wheel walking, as it is generally done pretty slow and you'll have more control this way. This skill requires reasonably fast foot-work which will only come with practise.

While holding your support, push the tyre forwards, then lightly and quickly drag your foot along the tyre back to it's original position. Eventually you'll want to be able to drag your foot back lightly enough that the wheel still rolls forward the whole time. This will result in a much more controlled and impressive technique and can also lead to gliding. One foot wheel walking requires not only fast 'paces', but also for these paces to come in reasonably quick succession. Keep your arms under control, place them along your body wide, or do your hands on your hips.

Once you feel comfortable one foot wheel walking beside a support, try leaving the support after a few metres, then riding into a one foot wheel walk unassisted. To do this, you should reasonably slowly, then lean back a little and pause on the spot while stepping up. Generally it's easiest to pause with one foot down and back and the pedals somewhere between horizontal and about 45 degrees. Then you must quickly step up directly to the tyre with your other foot, and follow with your dominant foot (which goes to the crown). Then you're ready to kick the tyre forwards again and start one foot wheel walking. Once you've got the hang of this you can also try going into the one foot wheel walk without the pause by doing a little glide.

==== Standup wheel walking ====

Stand-up wheel walk is riding, standing on the frame with one foot, and propelling the wheel with the other. Before learning it, you should be fairly steady with one-footed wheel walk, and preferably also be able to glide a little. You need a unicycle with a good sized square fork that you can stand on comfortably, and also a good-sized seat you can grab well with your knees/calves.

The first step in learning this skill is to figure out how to get into it. While holding onto the seat with one hand, and some sort of support with the other, transfer your favorite one-foot wheel walking foot so that it is on the fork and the wheel. Put the other foot on the fork. Position this foot carefully, as it will support most of your weight. Some find it works best to put the instep on the fork, not the heel or the ball of the foot. Now lean back a little, and stand up carefully. When you feel steady, move your driving foot down so that it touches only the tire. Turn it in a good ways, so that you are somewhat pigeon-toed. You should be able to move your foot freely. Practice moving along a wall, or while being guided by a spotter until you have some idea how to make the wheel move. Now try to move away from the wall. Make sure you stand up straight; don't hold the seat, don't look at your feet. The motion for stand-up wheel walk is a bit different from one-footed wheel walk. You don't just use your leg to move the wheel; you should try to move the wheel with a kicking motion using your whole body. Different riders do this skill different ways; some push more with the foot, while others use mostly a full body motion and changing of pressure. The first is more stable, while the latter is faster and easier to balance sideways. In either case, you do short stand-up glides between steps. This can be scary, but it's necessary for learning. This is a very satisfying skill to learn, if only because of the extra height it gives you.

As for the transitions, there are several ways to do it. You can ride, idle or hop, then jump onto the frame, with or without holding the seat, and possibly doing a 180 or 360 unispin on the way up, or you can plant your feet on the fork and stand up from riding, idling, one-footed wheel walk, or gliding. To get into it from riding, ride along slowly while holding the seat, then when your driving foot is near the top of a cycle, plant it on the wheel and fork and brake, leaning back a fair amount. Now in one swift motion, transfer the other foot to the frame, stand up, move your driving foot down, and start taking quick steps. You need to go really fast for the first couple steps. The main thing to remember is to lean back and do it fast. Getting into it from gliding works basically the same way, except you take a long time to brake the wheel before standing up.

==== Backward wheel walk ====
Backward wheel walk is even slower than forward wheel walk. Try to move your feet in small circles, closely following each other, and push the wheel mostly with your heels. Use your whole foot if you can, but you might find that if you try to use more than the heel, your feet will get tangled up.

If you are having trouble getting into backward wheel walk from idling, concentrate on making the idling smooth and as straight as possible. On the last stroke before moving your feet to the wheel, idle out faster and farther than normal. When the wheel rolls back, it will have some backward momentum which is very useful when getting started. You can also get into this skill from forward wheel walk by coming to a stop, leaning back slightly and holding still for a minute, then reversing direction. Getting out of this skill is pretty straightforward.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bwww the basic wheel-walk backward]

==== Backward wheel walk one-footed ====
You can also learn to do the backward wheel-walk one-footed. The posture for this skill is pretty much the same as for regular backward wheel walk, except you should lean the seatpost back even farther, and and your upper body forward even farther, to get the necessary room for the strokes. You also use mostly your heel. Unlike in one-foot wheel walk forward, it is very difficult to let the wheel glide along your foot between strokes. Instead, you have to coast briefly between each step. Since it is only for a split second it shouldn't be too hard. One thing to concentrate on is letting the wheel roll between strokes so that you can build up speed and momentum, rather than stopping it at the end of each stroke. The latter way feels awkward and won't look very good.

==== Backward spoke walk ====
Despite the name of the skill, it does not necessarily involve sticking your feet in the spokes. The essence of this skill is wheel walking backwards with the feet behind the frame, contacting the sides of the tire, the rim and possibly the spokes.

This is a fairly simple skill to learn. First experiment, while holding some support, with putting your feet behind the frame on the sides of the wheel and propelling it. You have to press very hard against the sides of the wheel in order to get enough grip. Also, the tire and shoes you are using can make a big difference. After a little practice, you should be able to get into this skill from idling, and go several meters. It is fairly normal for the wheel to wobble from side to side, because of how hard you must press against the tire/rim. What makes this trick easier than regular backward wheel walk is that you are pushing the wheel, not pulling it, so it's quite a bit like standard wheel walk. To get out of this skill, simply put your feet on the pedals and ride out backward. When you are comfortable with this and regular backward wheel walk, it can be fun to switch repeatedly between the two.

A video in which Jonathan S. Miersma demonstrates [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bwspokeww a backward spoke walk]

==== Forward spoke walk ====
Spoke walk is one of very few tricks that is easier to do backward than forward. It can be done forward, however. While holding onto something, take your feet off the pedals and put them on the sides of the tire, behind the frame. Now lean forward a little, and try to pull the wheel forward. In order to get any kind of traction, you must press very hard against the sides of the wheel. Also, try to arrange your feet so as to maximize the area of the foot contacting the tire. It may help to turn your heels in so that they are on top of the tire while keeping your toes near the rim. At first, you can only take very small steps, but try to make your steps as big as possible. Lean forward just a little bit and concentrate on exactly how you are moving your feet. The motion is nearly straight upward. Try getting into this skill from idling, riding, and other ways of wheel walking. To get out, just return your feet to the pedals.

==== Koosh-koosh ====
The unusual name of this skill is said to come from the sound you hear when you do it. It is also supposed to be one of the easiest ways to wheel walk backward.

For koosh-koosh, you put one foot on the unicycle so that the heel is on the fork and the toe is on touching the tire. The other foot can be placed two ways; either somewhat upright with the toe on the wheel or upside down with the shoelaces on the wheel. You use the foot behind the frame to push the wheel backward and the foot in front of the frame to hold the wheel in position while moving the other foot back forward.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240kooshkoosh the koosh-koosh]

==== One-footed backward lace walk ====
This skill is quite similar to koosh-koosh, except the foot on the frame does not contact the wheel at all, and the driving foot behind the frame has to be placed upside down with the shoelaces on the wheel (thus the name.) One-footed backward lace walk is faster and smoother and so is probably more visually attractive than koosh-koosh, so you should consider learning it. Another good reason to learn it is that it can lead up to backward gliding. Before learning this skill, you should probably learn either spoke walk or koosh-koosh, although neither is really necessary.

It feels a lot like normal one-footed wheel walk in that you push, relax pressure, glide while moving your foot back into position, and push again. If you go fairly quickly balance may be slightly easier.

The transitions for this skill can be hard. Try it from idling or from koosh-koosh if you have already learned that. An alternative method is to take one step of regular backward wheel walk with your non-driving foot, then position your driving foot, set the other foot on the frame and push off. You can also get into it from spoke walk and other backward wheel walk variations. The simplest way to get out is to come to a stop and wheel walk out of it forward, beginning with the foot on the frame.

A video demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bwww1ftinback lace-walk] by Jonathan S. Miersma

==== One-footed forward lace walk ====
One-footed lace walk can be done forward as well as backward, although the forward variation is a bit harder. Before learning this skill you should be comfortable with a forward spoke walk and a one-footed backward lace walk, and a little work with coasting wouldn't hurt.

Lean forward and position your foot as low on the wheel as possible, with as much of the top of your foot touching the wheel as possible, so that you can get enough grip to move the wheel. You have to pull very hard and take very big steps at first, removing your foot from the wheel and repositioning it between each step. While repositioning your foot you will have to coast briefly. If you have a square frame you should be careful to avoid scraping your shin on its corner.

You can transition to this skill directly from riding or idling, but I think the easiest method is to take one wheel walk step forward with your non-driving foot and hold the wheel in place while you position your driving foot. To get out of it, switch to regular wheel walking.

==== Sideways wheel walk ====
This skill consists of riding the unicycle sideways in the &quot;hopping standing on the wheel&quot; position, that is, holding the seat tight with both hands, and one foot on each side of the frame. 

The first step for learning this skill is to learn to step up one foot at a time into hopping on the wheel, rather than jumping into that position. Once you are comfortable with this, step up, and try to move the wheel sideways. One foot will be pushing the wheel and the other will be pulling it. Concentrate on the pushing foot (the left foot if you go to the left, and the right foot if you go to the right), as it provides most of the power and makes all the balance corrections. After a few months working on this skill, I found that only the pushing foot was necessary, so now I generally do sideways wheel walk one-footed. The advantage of doing it one-footed is that your feet don't have to work together nearly so much, and you can use the free leg for balance adjustments, the same way you use your arms for most tricks. The basic method of practicing this skill is to climb into the position and start moving. Because you need both arms to hold the seat, you can't work from the wall or ceiling, although it might help to have someone as a spotter.
Some things to think about when learning are:

1. Very important! Put all your weight on the seat through your arms. Try to be fairly high up and over the seat so that you will be steady in this position. Don't try to squat, and don't put any weight on your feet. You just use them to kick the wheel lightly along. If you get sore wrists or break the seat because of this, you are doing something right.

2. Almost all balance adjustments are made with the pusher foot. Forward and back adjustments, (from the unicycles point of view) are made by speeding up or slowing down as necessary. Side to side adjustments are made by steering the unicycle a tiny amount to the right or left.

3.Your speed should probably be slightly faster than regular wheel walking, probably about riding speed. This will increase the wheel's momentum and give you more stability.

The transitions are fairly simple. To get into sideways wheel walk, do a normal transition to hopping on the wheel. Then lean slightly in the direction you wish to move and go for it. To get out of this skill, do a short sideways glide while leaning back a little in order to come to a stop. Then hop on the wheel and transition back to pedals by your preferred method.

==== Hand wheel walk ====
There are several ways to wheel walk with your hands
* being sitting on the seat with the feet on the frame
* stomach on the seat with legs extended
Some other variations are sitting on the seat with the feet out, sideways hand wheel walk with the stomach on the seat, one-handed hand wheel walk, backward hand wheel walk, and even wheel walking using only the thumbs.

Hand wheel walk with the stomach on the seat is probably the easiest variation. If you can wheel walk regularly and ride stomach on the seat, you can start learning this skill. First, set the unicycle upright and facing forward and rest your stomach on the seat. Experiment with different positions until you find one that is relatively comfortable. Then hold the wheel with one hand and rest the other near the frame, gradually transferring your weight from your feet and to the seat. When you are resting mostly on the seat and feel stable, take your feet off the ground and splay them out to the side a little bit. Your legs can move around quite a bit to help you balance. Now start pushing the wheel with your hands. Avoid catching your fingers in the spokes.

To get into it, ride stomach on seat at the hand wheel walking pace, then put your hands on the wheel and start pushing it. To get out of it, you can put your feet back on the pedals at almost any position, than stand up into seat in front riding. You can also do a cool mount by running at a nice rate, sticking the seat under your stomach, and slamming the wheel into the ground. You can make your whole body from the waist down fly well up into the air as you brake the wheel to a normal pace. 

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240handwwstomach hand wheel-walk stomach on seat]

You also can learn it sitting on the seat. You see this variation a lot more often in freestyle performances and competitions. Learning this skill can be rather problematic, since you can't mount into it, getting into it from idling is somewhat tricky at first, and you can't use a wall, since you have no way to hold onto it. The best methods are to have a spotter steer you along until you can practice it from idling, or to do it from a pole or the end of a wall. I used a book cabinet in my basement. You also have to have the right kind of saddle. Something like the Torker CX or the Savage saddle is too small and will be very painful. How you sit on the seat can make a big difference. Try to sit back on the end of the seat, so that when you lean over your weight will rest mostly on your abdomen, not certain sensitive areas. This is even more the case if you want to learn hand wheel walk with the legs extended. When you try it the first time, get into a steady position and hold onto something with your one hand. Then transfer your feet and other hand to wheel one at time, and lean down and forward. The farther forward you lean, the easier it will be to balance. Put as much weight on the fork through your legs as possible to decrease the discomfort. Now push the wheel a couple times with the hand on the wheel until you are clear of your support, then bring the other hand down and get started. You should make the pushes a ways down the wheel, not right near the fork. You make the balance corrections by changing the speed and direction of your pushes, and by leaning your upper body from one side to another. Side to side balance is the tricky part. If you are falling off to one side slowly, and turning slightly, try to swing your whole upper body to the other side. If you realize that you are falling off soon enough, you can right yourself this way. 

As soon as you can get ten or fifteen steps fairly often, you should try learning to go into hand wheel walk from idling or riding. Mount sitting a lot farther back than normal and idle smoothly, then come to a stop at the end of a large forward stroke and begin transferring your limbs. First move the high idling foot, then put one hand on the wheel. Then transfer the other foot, give the wheel a push with your first hand and get the other hand in place behind it. If you don't get both feet placed securely on the fork, (you need a solid square fork for this skill) get off immediately. The best term to describe what happens when one or both of your feet slip off the wrong way is &quot;wedgie.&quot; 

Getting out of this skill can be a little tricky. I have done it two ways. One way is to quickly raise your body and put your feet on the wheel, do a short wheel walk, then drop to the pedals. The other is to wait until a pedal is coming down, then quickly move your foot from the fork to the pedal. Raise your body quickly and go into one-footed idling, then get your other foot down.

=== Miscellaneous skills ===

==== Backward one-footed riding ====
The most common method seems to be to transition from one-footed idling, but experiment with getting into it from backward riding and riding forward one-footed as well, so that you find what works best for you. Concentrate on pulling the pedal through the upstroke as this is usually the hardest part. Lean back a ways too, but always be careful to avoid a high speed backward dismount which could be dangerous.

==== Gliding ====
Gliding is when you have one foot on the crown of the frame and one foot placed on the tire to control speed and aid balance. It is easiest to see gliding as a progression from one foot wheel walking. Try to wheel walk one footed down a hill and you'll end up gliding. Also practice going from one foot riding directly into gliding, especially on flat ground, and eventually from riding directly into gliding. It may take several weeks to learn this skill well. Try to apply as little pressure as possible on the tire, and lean back.

Gliding as a flatland skill is fun when done in a circle. Ride fast in a big circle, leaning heavily to one side. Now switch to gliding with as little pressure as possible, still leaning heavily to one side. You tend to go in a spiral rather than a proper circle, and end by straightening up and doing a very small piroutte.

==== Coasting ====
Coasting is one of the most enjoyable things you can do on a unicycle in my opinion. For those who don't know the distinction, gliding is riding the unicycle with one foot on the wheel as a brake and the other on the fork (or extended) while coasting is riding the unicycle without contacting the wheel, pedals, or anything except the frame and saddle. Coasting is much harder.

To learn to coast, first get really good at one-footed riding, so that you can ride along smoothly, at a steady speed, and without accelerating or braking the wheel in any way. Actually you don't need to be quite that good at one-footed riding to start learning to coast, but after a little while working on this skill, you will have one-footed riding down this well. Although it would probably be advisable to learn to glide before working seriously on coasting, this isn't necessary, since the balancing mechanisms are quite different for the two skills.
 
Now you can move on to the actual coasting. From smooth one-footed riding at a not too fast or too slow rate, take the pedalling foot off and let it hang next to the spinning pedal. In all likelihood, you will fall off immediately. It is of utmost importance that at this point you do not kick the pedal or affect it in anyway. You need to coast off at the same speed, balanced in the same way which you were before starting the coast. Practice this step for a while until you are comfortable with taking your foot off the pedal and falling off. You will find that you sometimes coast short distances without trying very hard. It is a great feeling when it does happen.

When you are comfortable with this, you can start working on balancing in this position and experimenting with various postures. There are two basic ways to coast; either with one leg extended and the other on the fork, or with both feet resting solidly on the fork. I recommend that you experiment with both to find which way works for you, keeping in mind however that most unicyclists seem to find coasting with both feet on the fork easier. Although it is harder to get into and easier to fall from improperly, it offers more stability. The basic balancing mechanism for coasting is a rocking motion that is rather difficult to explain. I suggest watching some videos or actually watching other unicyclists coast if possible so that you will know when you are balancing properly. If you are falling off forwards, you need to lean forward by bending at the waist. This will cause your waist region to move back and the wheel to move forward also, thus correcting your balance. If you are too far back, lean back. I find the forward adjustments a lot easier. One important tip to balance yourself properly is to keep your arms straight and raise them nearly vertical. Some riders keep their arms farther down when they coast, but almost all extend them in some way. Experiment with various arm positions and find what works for you. I suggest trying to switch to coasting with both feet on fork after you have worked on the leg extended variation for perhaps a a while. Try to plant both feet solidly on the fork. I find it even helps to squeeze the seat post tightly between my feet. This will probably work best if your frame has a nice solid square fork which offers a lot of support.

Coasting is an extremely difficult skill, and one which requires a lot of commitment to learn. It took me six months of hard practice. But if you keep with it, you will have a highly enjoyably skill that is very satisfying and also impressive. It is worth it.

Once you can coast smoothly for a ways, try getting out of it. The easiest method is to switch to gliding, then to wheel walking, then to the pedals. Getting out of coasting is a relatively easy skill, which probably does not require much advice.

As an interesting historical note, coasting was, as far as is known, first done by a Swede, Joakim Malm, around 1980. Before that, it was generally considered impossible. Joakim was one of a group of three Swedes who revolutionized freestyle riding, inventing skills such as seat drag, the 540 unispin, and several others. They were also influential in the movement toward using only 20&quot; unicycles for freestyle.

==== Handride ====
Learning to position yourself properly is one of the main difficulties for this skill. First, turn the unicycle around. Actually, you don't exactly sit on the unicycle; rather you hang upside-down, with most of your weight on your abdomen. Position the seat so that the back bumper is resting near your navel, and reach down and grasp the pedals with both hands. While holding the pedals, with the seat positioned as described above, set the wheel on the ground. Now jump up and forward while pulling up very hard on the &quot;down&quot; pedal and pushing down on the &quot;up&quot; pedal. Then start pedalling backward. This can take a lot of strength. The direction of motion should be backward, that is such that if you were to switch to sitting on the seat and pedalling with your feet without turning your body, you would be riding backward. It is also possible to handride forward, but this is more difficult and dangerous as will be explained later. When you mount, make sure to jump up a good ways; otherwise, you will fall off immediately. Eventually, you will get a feel for how to turn the wheel and will get a few cycles of the wheel.

When you are handriding, you can fall off in the direction of motion, or in the opposite direction from that in which you are moving. It is falling off in the direction opposite motion that is a problem, it could be dangerous so try hard ot avoid falling off in that direction. This is the reason forward handride is more dangerous; you are more likely to fall off in such a way that you can't land on your feet. Although it can be a little unnerving, you have to lean farther in the direction opposite motion than feels comfortable. Otherwise you just fall off the other way immediately. So when handriding, try to adjust your speed so that you stay well over the wheel, but not so far forward that you fall off in the direction opposite motion. You can also use your legs to adjust the balance, but only a little bit. For the most part, they swing around in a somewhat ridiculous manner. 

It is possible to transition from riding with your feet into and out of handride. Getting out is not very hard. Simply take one hand off the pedal and quickly insert a foot in its place. The other foot falls into place pretty much automatically, as you quickly sit up straight. If you want to go to sitting on the seat properly, you have to do a unispin. To get from riding into handride, you also have to do a unispin to get the seat turned around. Now try to put your abdomen on the seat as you do for handride. Lean down as far as you can while idling. At the end of one idle, pull a foot off the pedal and grab it with your hand. Now start pulling the pedal around and took the other foot off the other pedal. As this pedal comes forward, grab it with your hand and try to get going. Grabbing the pedals properly can be very tricky. Try to idle straight before attempting the transition. Also, make sure you are leaning forward sufficiently. This transition to handride has also been done from hand wheel walk with the legs extended, but I don't have anymore information on this trick. If you learn forward handride, you can also transition into it from regular riding without any idling or hand wheel walking. No more information on this skill either.

=== Stationary skills ===
==== Hop ====
Hopping can be done with 2, 1 and no hands on the seat. The last option allows for skipping ropes to be used.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f288216fire-skipping a burning skipping rope] while hopping on a unicycle.

==== Spins ====
A spin is a where you go round in circles really fast. You do this by having your upper body on one side of the point you are turning about while your lower body is on the opposite side.

To do a spin - 

# Do a leaning turn, about a metre in radius or so. 
# Do a really hard action-reaction turn in the same direction as your leaning turn. 
# Pedal like mad. 

If it just feels like you're turning in a tight circle, then you're not doing a spin. When you hit the spin, you'll feel like you're going round ten times as fast as normal and like you're not really steering, just being magically spun round and round. You'll totally know it. 

If your pedals hit the ground, you're leaning too far, you don't have to lean incredibly hard to spin.

I learnt to do spins using a hockey stick. If you've got one, try using this. First learn to turn 360 degrees using the stick to turn you, then try and get into a spin using the stick to do the action reaction turn. 

Once you get good at spins, you can do them straight away, out of stillstands or whatever without the leaning turn into them. I like to stillstand, then lean a little bit and go into a spin. 

Nb: Action-reaction turn is a turn where you turn your upper body one way(the action) and the unicycle turns the other way(the reaction).

* Exiting the spin
The trick is just to keep practicing until you can do the spin really smoothly and then you can slow down and pedal out of it. Alternatively, do a pirouette out of it and then pedal off once you've slowed down a little, before you fall over. 

In both cases, as you straighten up and ride out, your tyre will catch and you'll be able to ride straight off, you don't have to wait until the spin has fully stopped to ride off.

==== Pirouettes ====
Pirouettes are similar to spins, except that you do not pedal while you spin around. Instead, you stand with the pedals horizontal, and let inertia spin you around. It helps to stand up on the pedals and hold your arms out and bring them in close to your body as you start to spin, like a ballerina does.
A pirouette is considered valid only when doing 3 or more revolutions.

==== Hopping standing on the wheel ====
For this skill, you set the unicycle sideways, stand with one foot on each side of the wheel, hold one end of the seat with each hand, and hop.

You should mount directly into it at first. There are two basic ways to do this; either jump up and plant both feet solidly against the frame, or climb up by leaning the unicycle a little to one side, putting one foot directly on top of the wheel, stepping up, and setting your other foot on the other side of the frame. (The latter is better if you plan to learn sideways wheel walk eventually, since the same technique is used to mount into that skill.) Now hop! It's really very simple, and should only take a little practice. You can do it with your feet solidly against the frame, or spread out a ways. The latter may be slightly harder, but again, it is better for learning sideways wheel walk. 

The transitions can be fairly frustrating. To get into it, switch to seat in front hopping, then jump off the pedals. You can either spin the unicycle 90 degrees and land on the wheel, or jump around yourself and land, with the unicycle moving very little. This is actually fairly easy, but seems intimidating at first. Getting out tougher. There are several methods, including twisting around and switching to wheel walk, twisting and getting your feet directly on the pedals, jumping right down to seat in riding, and jumping down to seat in front hopping. The last is a good way to prepare for unispins. I usually use the twisting methods. The main thing to remember is to pause after each hop, but only attempt to twist around when you feel very well balanced. Twisting to the pedals is usually easiest when the pedal corresponding to the rear hopping foot is horizontal in front.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240hoponwheel hopping on wheel] and both transitions.

==== Side hopping ====
Side hopping is a somewhat silly trick, but you might want to learn it any way. Stand to the side of the unicycle and put your right foot on the left pedal, or your left foot on the right pedal. Now lean (to the left if you are on the right and to the right if you are on the left) stand up on the pedal and hop. It may be slightly easier to do this if you put the free foot around in back on the other side of the tire, in order to hold the wheel still a little more. The main thing to remember is to lean a lot to one side, because otherwise you move sideways pretty quickly. I don't know how to get into it from riding, but to get out of it, you jump up, switch feet on the pedal, get the foot previously used for hopping to the other side, and idle seat-in-front.

Warning: side hopping may damage your unicycle's hub.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240sidehopping side-hopping]

==== Unispins ====
A unispin is when you hold the unicycle in front of you, jump off the pedals, twist the unicycle and land on it again. A standard unispin is 180, but 360 is also common and 540 and 720 are heard of. You can also do 90, 270, 450, and 630 degree unispins into and out of hopping standing on the wheel, or 180 and 360 unispins while hopping standing on the wheel.

To do a 180 unispin usually you stand in the seat out position; you can either do it with one hand or two hands. Two hands is much easier for beginners. When you're standing in the seat out position and your hands are in the unispin position, either both hands are on the same side of the saddle, or one is on each side in a crossways position. It's best to have the pedals flat. Jump up and spin it; you never need to let go of the uni. Then aim for the pedals or cranks, and land safely. 

To do a 360 unispin you should stand in the same position as for the 180 unispin. You can either have your hands in a crossways position or both of your hands on the same side. It depends on whether you want to air the uni or just spin it on the ground. If you're doing the crossways position you don't have to let go of the uni and it will probably spin on the ground, which some people think is easier. Another method is to put both hands on the same side, then jump up, spin it, let go of the uni, then catch it again. What you prefer is a matter of taste. You may consider wearing leg protection!

==== Seat drop ====
This skill consists of hopping seat in front, dropping the seat and frame onto your toe, and then kicking it back up.

First, while idling, gradually move your front hopping foot, which should be the upper foot while you are idling, over, until it rubs against the frame. Now transition smoothly to seat in front hopping. Between hops, edge this foot over even more, until it is touching the tire or rim. Now drop the seat, and catch the frame with your foot. Once you can catch the frame properly, practice getting the seat back up, so that you can catch it again. You should throw the seat done firmly, and at the same time lean slightly forward. After the frame touches your foot, lean back a little so that the seat bounces up again. Now catch the seat and go back to hopping or riding. 

It looks cool to do a series of seat drops without hopping in between. I haven't tried this yet, but presumably it's a lot harder than just a single. Also, you can try to pause for a while before kicking the seat back up. Another good looking move is to combine this trick with trials, so that you jump onto an obstacle, drop the seat, catch it, and jump off again.

==== Crank idle ====
Crank idle is idling with your entire body off one side of the unicycle, one foot on the pedal and one foot where the crank goes into the unicycle hub. Presumably you can achieve this transition by first going to seat on side idle and then swinging your foot over the tire.

==== Jump ====
For a jump mount, hold the unicycle in front of you, (preferably with one hand, although you can also use both, if you are nervous about it) with the pedals level, then jump up, land your feet on the pedals, pause, then sit down on the seat. Sometime after you take off, but before you land, you can move the seat into exactly the right position. Make sure you land with all your weight on the pedals. This is probably the easiest mount, after the standard one, although it is intimidating at first. 
In order to overcome your fear, try mounting to seat-out riding. Simply hold the seat in front of you, and jump on the pedals, still holding the seat in front of you. 
You can also try doing a seat-in jump mount. That is, put the seat between your legs, then jump up and try to land your feet on the pedals. Hopefully after trying this a couple times you'll be ready for the regular jump mount, which is actually easier.

==== Suicide ====
The suicide mount is simply a slightly harder and much more impressive extension of the jump mount. Position the unicycle in front of you, balance it, let go, pause, jump, land your feet on the pedals, and sit down on the seat. The longer you pause between letting go and jumping, the more impressive it is. To nerve yourself up for this undeniably scary trick, practice doing regular jump mounts while holding the seat very lightly. Try holding the seat with only a few fingers, and eventually only with your little finger. Now you should be ready to try it. Balance the unicycle very carefully, (with the pedals level) so that when you let go, the saddle falls toward you. If it falls to the side, you won't land it, and if it falls away from you land it seat in front by catching the saddle, but that's not a suicide mount, since the suicide mount must be done freehanded. Watch the saddle after you let go of it, and jump at the right moment, so that the saddle is in exactly the right place when you land. To a certain extent, you have to catch it with your legs as you come down.
Obviously it will be easier with the seat lowered. Also don't wear baggy pants, or you'll have to jump stupidly high so you don't knock the seat out of the way.

==== Reverse ====
The reverse mount is simply a standard mount in reverse. Begin standing in front of the unicycle, sit on the seat and step onto the pedal that is slightly forward, bringing the unicycle up under you from behind. This feels somewhat like idling
The reverse mount is also known as back-mount.

A video of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] demonstrating [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240backmnt the back-mount]

==== Side Mount ====

The side mount is a fun and fairly easy mount. Stand behind the unicycle, place your strong foot on the pedal at the bottom of the stroke and hold the seat out to the side with the opposite hand. I find it easiest to hold the back of the seat and lock my elbow. Then simply step onto your strong foot while you swing the other leg forward (between your strong leg and the unicycle) and around the front of the seat to the other side. Relax your grip on the seat to bring it up under you as you place your free foot on the pedal and begin to idle. 

Variations on this mount include swinging the leg around the seat an extra revolution and also swinging the leg around the back of the seat, mounting like a bike ( http://likeabikes.com ), which is harder than you would think.

==== Side Jump to Wheel Walk ====
Once you are comfortable with some of the simpler wheel walk mounts, like putting the seat between you legs and jumping up forward, try the side jump mount to wheel walk. Hold the back of the seat with one hand, and stand next to the unicycle. Now jump up and sideways. Swing one leg around the saddle and swing the saddle back with your hand, then try to set your foot on the wheel, thus absorbing most of the impact. Now quickly bring the saddle back forward between your legs and land sitting on it. Since you don't have to jump up very far above the seat for this mount, (it's more about swinging the seat under you) you only fall down a very short distance, less than for the regular jump mount, so it's not very hard on your crotch. Now wheel walk out of it!

==== Pickup ====
With the unicycle lying on the ground with tire pointing up, hop onto the pedals and reach down to pick up the seat with your hand.

A video of [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240pickupmnt the pick-up] done by Jonathan S. Miersma.

==== Kickup ====
Place the unicycle on the ground, lying on its side, facing forward, with the pedals level. The pedal on top should be behind (closest to you) and the pedal on the ground in front. Stand with the uni just in front of you, with the seat pointing diagonally to your right. Stand on the pedal. Your foot will actually be at a 45 degree angle to the pedal, so the left edge of your left foot will touch the pedal, and the right edge will touch the crankarm. Put the toe of your right foot under the saddle (from the outside, with your toe facing the wheel). This is the setup for the kickup mount. If you now shift your weight onto the pedal and pull the seat underneath you with your foot, the unicycle will come upright so you can put your other foot onto its pedal and ride away. 
Seat height is important here: it is easier with a lower seat, but if it is too low, the seat will fly out from between your legs. If it is too high, you'll experience extreme discomfort as you kick the saddle into your own crotch.
And the most important is to jump in to a motion from seat to pedal(!), and NOT from seat to the center of the hub.

==== Introduction ====
Muni is an abbreviation for mountain unicycling, and is a description for the practice of unicycling on any sort of rough terrain. You don't necessarily need a mountain for Muni - it's the terrain that makes it Muni, not where the terrain is.

==== Basic techniques ====

It is important to lower the seat and to lower the tire pressure. These two simple adjustments make a tremendous difference. Try to keep one hand on the saddle and stand up over the saddle when you go through difficult sections, as this will make it easier to exert more force through the pedals. It is important to have sufficient balance in order to stay on top of the wheel without changing your riding direction too much. The tire will go its own way; you will have to learn to follow it. An excellent exercise is to practice riding a rail. This will force you to stay on top of the wheel without any adjustments in the riding direction.

==== Rolling out of drops ====

Big drops may put tremendous stress on the axle if you do them wrong. To reduce the stress, you may roll out of the drop. The point of this is to transform the downward force into a forward and downward force on the muni. To do this you will need some forward momentum as you go off into the drop, and then fold slightly at the waist, and the muni will try to shoot out in front of you instead of getting compressed under your weight. It is easiest to drop from a stillstand, but as you get more confident it is better to just roll the edge into the drop. Try to land with the cranks horizontal and absorb the shock by first flexing your legs, then at your waist and followed by your upper body and arms. If you have practiced hopping in both pedal orientations it may not matter in what orientation you are when you hit the ground, otherwise you can try pedaling the wheel half a revolution or so into the right position before you land. It is important to stand up on the pedals, and it may help to lower your saddle.

It is easiest to roll out a drop on a downhill slope. If there isn't any slope below, you may still use an angled rock or a bump, by aiming for the far side. Try to scan the area below for a good place to roll out a landing.

==== Hopping in any pedal orientation ====

If you ride in rough terrain with roots and rocks, the tire oftentimes gets stuck behind some obstacle. A solution is to put in a small hop, just enough to clear the obstacle, to regain balance and get going again. Things get more complicated if you are in the middle of a climb. Depending on the riding surface it may not be possible to get going again once you stop. If you are riding in mud or loose dirt, the tire may lose its grip as you put pressure on the pedals. With practice it becomes natural to put in a forward hop to regain momentum every time you start from stillstand. Mounting to stillstand and then doing a forward hop is actually the easiest way to start on a steep hill.

Since it is difficult to anticipate when the tire will become stuck behind something, it is important to practice hopping out of difficult situations in both pedal orientations, that is with either foot back. Also try to practice holding the seat with either hand.

==== Riding in snow ====
Living in Norway, I have some experience with snow. It is difficult if the snow is deep and if there is ice underneath it, but it can also offer great amounts of fun!

If we assume that there is no ice and that the snow is not very deep, your only challenge is that you do not know anything about the surface you are riding on- where the bumps are and how big they are. This factor makes riding in snow quite exciting.

Riding on tracks made for skiing on is even more fun, because you can ride on top of the snow quite the same as if you were riding on a normal road. It is, however, often a problem to idle or do quick turns as you easily may fall.

Riding on ice, especially ice for ice-skating, is also a huge challenge. You need to sit right on top of your unicycle and do as few moves as possible . If you need to move it should be slow and controlled. Riding on ice is a potential risk to your wrist as you easily may fall backwards.

A studded tire will help you keep in control over the unicycle on ice, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Unicyclopedia:Hardware#How_to_make_your_own_studded_tyre the instructions] for instructions on making a studded tire.

==== Northshore riding ====
When it comes to riding the &quot;Ewok Village,&quot; keep these things in mind:
*Wood can be slick- gently slow down.
*Pay attention to the feature, not the 15 foot chasm below it.
*Most drops from bridges should be done as a rolling hop because the trannys bikers build are usually too far to static hop.
*Look before you ride and use a spotter- bikers come flying down trails and over structures very fast and aren't going to be looking for a unicyclist going a third the speed he is.
*Avoid sketchy features, even if they look really cool. I have had a teeter-totter collapse on me 10 feet up!

==== Nightrides ====

It is possible to ride your unicycle offroad even if it's dark outside with a headlight. This can be a very memorable or even eerie experience if you're all by yourself! With a good light source, the riding itself is not that much more challenging, although it may be slightly more difficult to correctly estimate the size of rocks and other obstacles in the riding surface.

To ride on gravel a cheap LED headlight may be sufficient, but if you want to ride technically challenging singletrack you will need a better light source. Unfortunately a good halogen headlight is rather expensive. Fortunately these can be built at home at a far lesser expense.

A powerful configuration for unicycling features a 20 W halogen light with a 38 degree spread together with NiMH batteries.

==== Effective braking ====
Pedal slower and try to carve sideways if possible. Much like skiing.</text>

Basically, street is doing various tricks, preferably while tackling various obstacles. If you only occasional use obstacles, what you do may be considered flatland, but if you lack tricks in your riding, instead of obstacles, it may be considered trials.
The crankflip, unispin and their variations are the most used tricks for street, but as only you set the rules, you may even do the most difficult freestyle tricks if you feel the urge to.

&lt;code&gt;''&quot;The best definition I have heard thus far is that street is skateboarding on a unicycle.&quot;''&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;~ '''Muniracer'''&lt;/code&gt;

 
==Street styles==
Even though street itself is a riding style, there is different kinds of street, which I will try to explain here:

====Big street====
Big street is generally when you do scary things. Like jumping down a huge flight of stairs. One can argue that tricks on flat can be scary as well, but I don't think they are, at least compared to big street. But you are dearly welcome to edit this good page. Anyway, big street often doesn't contain the more technical tricks, like sejflip and such, but it doesn't have to be like that. The opposite of big street would be small street. Watch this video if wondering what that would look like. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwb6WD8Tmk

====Technical street==== 
This is going big, not obstacle-wise, but trickwise. Landing as difficult tricks as possible. The opposite of this would be simple street, but just like small street, this term isn't used.

====Oldschool street==== 
The difference between old-school and new-school is, roughly, the crankflip. Oldschool is when you ride like people rode before Mike Clark invented the crankflip. This includes tiregrabs, no- and one-footers and shifties. Newschool is the style most people ride today, with lots of flips.



Feel free to add more street styles

Coronation Street?

==Street Skills==
===Stair sets===
This is my way of jumping stairs, it may not be the best way, but I can do 5 sets with it so, here we go. Basically I place my pedals in my preferred hopping position at the edge of the top stair. Ride backwards or roll the uni back around 2-6 revolutions, depending on what you like best and the length of the sets, so that if you were to ride forward, toward the stairs, when you reach them you would be in your preferred hopping position. From there get on the uni and ride forward at a comfortable pace and rolling hop the stairs. You may want to speed up if the stairs are particularly long. Hopefully you will clear them. Remember that you can still land on the stairs and ride them out, if you're lucky. Remember to BE CAREFUL because you will not only fall, you will fall down the stairs.

===Zeroplant Crankflip===
This is the first step to learning a crankflip. You basically ride forward, jump, kick the cranks, plant one foot on the ground and jump back onto the uni once the cranks have done one or more rotations. You may want to learn the rolling jump mount before trying this as it teaches you how to land on moving cranks/pedals. Firstly you ride forwards at a reasonably slow pace (go faster as you get more confident). Then lean forward slightly over the uni, jump and kick the front pedal downward and quickly suck your foot back up. Whilst doing this plant your other foot on the ground. Don't &quot;camp&quot; ont the foot. If you do, kick the cranks faster instead. Then jump back on the uni, land on the pedals and ride away.(By the time you land on the uni the cranks should be back where they started)How long you have your foot on the ground depends on how fast the cranks are spinning. This trick teaches you how to flip the cranks for the crankflip.
Also, check out Shaun Johanneson's crankflip tutorial on youtube. it covers zeroplant and footplant crankflips as well as normal ones.
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaDyxB0gwMw Crankflip Tutorial Here (Video no longer available)]

===Footplant Crankflip===
Same as above except do a footplant on an object. See above for video tutorial.

===Crankflip===
The crankflips is, as you may have guessed, is letting the wheel do a revolution, without your feet on the pedals, while in a jump.
#Ride slowly fowards.
#Lean over the uni, right before you plan to jump.
#Kick your front foot down while moving your backfoot away from it's pedal, and jump up in the air as high as possible. The kick is more important than the jump.
#For safety's sake, pull the uni slightly out in front of you while you are in the air.
#Spot the cranks (they should be attatched to the pedals and hub).
#Plant your feet back on the cranks or pedals and ride away.
See above for tutorial.

When I tried crankflips, my uni always landed in front of me. It was reaaally irritating, but I then I began experimenting with different ways to kick, different places to put my legs while in the air and such. It suddenly clicked when I put my feet way too high in the air. So the morale is, experiment, for God's sake! try to find what works best for you, not what works for everybody else!

===180 Unispin===
Firstly, you want to be comfortable hopping with the seat in front. Once you can do that learn  [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240180spinmount the 180 jump mount]. Simply jump, spin the unit 180 degrees, and land with your feet on the pedals. Once you can do both of these reasonably well you should be ready to try a 180 unispin. Get on with the seat out in front, holding the seat with one hand on the front and one on the back, and steady yourself. Some people like to do small bunnyhops in order to find their center of balance. Then, when you are ready, jump up while keeping the uni more or less on the ground. You do not want the uni to come up with you. Then spin the uni 180 in whichever direction you feel most comfortable, and then land with your feet on the pedals or cranks. If you are not sure that you are going to land correctly, try to land on the ground next to the pedals. One thing that really helped me was keeping the wheel on the ground and using the saddle to keep yourself in the air. This trick should take around 45 minutes, more or less, of solid practicing to learn. Even then, you may not be able to do it every time. Remember to wear shin guards in case you miss the pedals. Remember that your feet do not have to go out too much. I jarred my wrist really badly doing this, so wristguards or tape may be a good idea.
The unispin is also in the freestyle section, but this is also a street skill, and this has more detail.

And in this video [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] shows how to do [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f3202401802seat a 180 unispin] without any needless hopping

===360 Unispin===
The 360 unispin is somewhat different to the 180 unispin. To do the 360 unispin you want to be able to do the 180 unispin well first. Unlike the 180 unispin the 360 jump mount is not necessary;  I actually find the mount harder than the spin. Okay, there are a few things to learn. First, you want to figure out how you are going to spin the uni. Some people let go of the saddle when they spin the uni, some do not. I do not, I am not that coordinated. Once you figure this out practice practice practice. get comfortable doing this. then figure out whether to spin seat in or out. I spin seat in so that it stays under me. Then practice some more. One day it'll just come to you.  Remember once your feet leave the uni it is key to snap them back in as quick as possible.

In this video [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] shows [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f3202403602ww a 360 unispin to wheel-walk]

===Rolling Hop===

==Skill descriptions==

=== Stances ===
*'''Natural''': The stance in which you feel most comfortable jumping and tricking. The natural stance comes in two varieties: left or right foot forward. Both are self-explanatory. On average, a larger percentage of riders hop left foot forward.
*'''Switch''': Switch stance is the opposite to your natural stance; a regular footed unicyclist tricking with their right foot forward is riding in switch. This is difficult because your feet need to switch roles.
*'''Fakie''': In fakie, you're in your natural stance, but travelling backwards. From a difficulty perspective, it's slightly uncomfortable, but because your feet still perform the same roles as they naturally would, fakie is only slightly more difficult than riding normally.
*'''Switch Fakie''': In this stance, one must ride backwards whilst performing all tricks with the opposite foot forward. It is commonly accepted as the most difficult stance to hop and pull tricks from, because it combines the difficulties of the other stances.

=== Trick Descriptions &amp; Tips ===
*'''Body Varial''': Jump up, rotate your body 180 degrees in reference to the unicycle, and land.
*'''Hoptwists''': A basic trick consisting of a hop and rotating with the unicycle before landing. They include: 180's, 360's and 540's. 
*'''Shifty''': In a jump, the rider tweaks the uni 90 degrees to one side and returns it to normal.
*'''One-footer''': A self-explanitory trick consisting of a high hop and extending the front foot off the pedal and placing it back on before landing. 
*'''No Footer''': During a jump, the rider takes both feet off the pedals before landing back on and absorbing the impact.

=== Unispins ===
*'''180 Unispin''': A basic trick for street unicyclists. To perform this trick, one must jump up and spin the unicycle 180 degrees on a vertical axis and land back on. 
*'''360 unispin''': Similar to the regular unispin, the rider must jump high and spin the unicycle 360 degrees on its axis. It is much more difficult, though. In order to have it spin all the way around, most people find that they must let go of the seat before landing back on; this makes it harder to control while learning.
*'''540 unispin''': Exactly like other unispins, except the unicycle spins 540 degrees before the landing. Most would agree this is the most degrees it can rotate and still look well in a line or combo. 
*'''720 Unispin''': As you can guess, a 720 unispin is the same as other unispins, but the unicycle spins 720 degrees before landing. First done by Andy Schwarz in the late 90's.
*'''900 Unispin''': More and more people are landing 900 unispins
*'''1080 Unispin''' Adrien Delacroix landed a 1080 unispin first and  it was on a spring board, but later landed one flat, Forrest Rackard did one off of a picnic table,
Eli Brill recently landed a rolling 1080 to be the third person to land a 1080 unispin
*'''1260 Unispin'''Eli Brill landed the worlds first and only 1260 unispin at unicon 16.
*'''270/450 unispin''': Unispins which are landed into/out-of hop on wheel. Many variations exist. 
*'''Inward unispin''': An awkward trick in which the rider combines a body varial with a unispin; the body rotates in the opposite direction of the unicycle, making it a difficult trick to pull off.

=== Varial Tricks ===

*'''Varial''': A trick combining the 180 and a unispin starting with seat-in, in the same direction. This is easier than a 360 unispin to most, and helps in the learning process.
*'''Smallspin''': A smallspin is performed by starting the trick with the seat-out (holding the seat out in front) and then simultaneously doing a 180 unispin and a 180 degree jump twist.
*'''Bigspin''': A bigspin is performed by starting the trick with the seat-out (holding the seat out in front) and then simultaneously doing a 360 unispin and a 180 degree jump twist.
*'''Full varial''': The ''full varial'', or ''whippersnapper'' as Dan Heaton jokingly calls it, is a combination of a 180 and 360 unispin with seat-in, in the same direction. It is a smooth-looking street skill named after the whip-snap motion of the tire.

=== Flip tricks ===
*'''rev'''*: The rider jumps into the air and pedals one rotation fowards.
*'''Crankflip''': The crankflip is a challenging trick to learn and is a great skill to have. To do this trick, one must lean over the unicycle and jump up with pressure on the front foot. As the feet are pulled up high, the cranks spin 360 degrees around the hub before the person catches the spinning pedals and lands. 
*'''Doubleflip''': A trick similar to the crankflip; except in the doubleflip, the cranks spin two full revolutions before landing instead of one.
*'''Tripleflip''': An extremely rare trick where the cranks spin three revolutions before landing back on. 
*'''Crankbackflip''': The crankbackflip is a rolling hop combined with a kick from the back foot that causes the cranks to spin a full revolution backwards. This skill is easier to learn if you have one-footers down.
*'''Doublebackflip''': An advanced flip trick consisting of flipping the cranks two revolutions backwards.
*'''Triplebackflip''': An pro flip trick consisting of flipping the cranks three revolutions backwards.
*'''180 flip''': This trick is combination of a 180 hoptwist and a crankflip. To excecute this trick, the legs need to be out higher but is relatively quick to learn nonetheless. '&quot;180 doubleflips'&quot; are becoming more common and '''180 tripleflips''' are rare, but heard of.
*'''180 backflip''': This is a combination of a 180 hoptwist and backcrankflip.
*A '''hickflip''' consists of a unispin and crankflip. Named for Kelly Hickman. This is one of the first flip tricks people learn. Shaun J. has been known to land '''hickdoubleflips''', which have an added revolution of the cranks.
*'''donkey hick'''*
a donkey kick and a hickflip combined. accredited to one of Shaun J's friends.
*'''Hickbackflips''' are a hop, unispin and backcrankflip before landing. Few, including Kelly Hickman can do this difficult trick.
*'''360-unispin flips''', also known as '''trey flips''' consist of a 360 unispin and a crankflip. It is difficult to land and is a very smooth trick.
*An '''inward flip''' is a variation on the inward unispin when there is a crankflip added in. (180 unispin + reverse body varial + crankflip)
*'''Varial flips''' are composed of a crankflip and a varial. (180 hoptwist + unispin + crankflip)
*'''Varial backflips''' are another rare trick that are difficult to pull off. It has a backcrankflip and a varial. (180 hoptwist + unispin + backcrankflip)
*'''Sex-change flips''' are a smooth trick that consists of a body varial and a crankflip. To make this trick easier, I find that if you tilt the front foot inwards whilst flipping it makes the body varial easier.
*The '''Donkey Kick''', a term coined by Dan Heaton, consists of jumping up with one foot on the frame and the other on the back of the tire. After gaining your balance, one must jump and push the back foot away, causing the cranks to spin a full rev backwards. It is a fun trick, to see and to do.
*'''Footplants''' are a fairly simply trick. The unicyclist rides up to an obstacle, jumps off the unicycle, plants the front foot on it, lands back on and continues rolling. The footplant has countless varitions such as the 'zero plant' where it is done on flat ground.

=== Flatland Tricks ===
Flatland tricks are peculiar because there are so many of them and so many different variations that many of the tricks do not have names. Style and creativity can be added to these tricks to make them original and look better. Here are a few:

*The '''Superman''' differs from the generic use of the trick. In unicycling, the rider bends down, placing their chest on the seat and extends the legs parallel to the ground. Before the balance is lost, the feet are placed back on the pedals.
*The '''Seatdrop''' is one of the most basic flatland skills. The rider hops on the cranks, making sure to point the front foot inward. They drop the seat down until the toe catches it. To get it back up, one can either grab it with their hand, or kick it up with the foot.
*The '''Wrap''' is a stationary trick when the rider wraps the seat in a circle around each leg before they continue riding. Excellent street rider such as Dan H. and Xavier Collos have been known to do '''Double or Triple Wraps''' and even '''Superwraps''' in which they wrap each leg around twice before they continue.

Note about tricks - all tricks that rotate on a vertical axis (hoptwists, unispins, etc.) can be spun in the opposite direction to which you are comfortable. In street unicycling terms, the trick is known as ''''blind''''.

== Street skill levels ==
These skill levels are in no way official. They are intended to help the street rider develop a basic set of skills, and to rate those skills after difficulty. When you feel confident with the skills in this list, only your imagination is the limit of what can be done!

Trials is about controlling where you are and where you want to be.
:-- Kris Holm

==Practicing trials==
When you practice trials, it is important that you have a good unicycle. It should be able to stand your riding. It is also important that you do not hurt yourself. Dropping huge heights will only hurt you and your unicycle. I personally feel that your trick should not be somewhere where the risk of getting hurt is very high: The challenge should be the obstacles and not your fear!

When practicing trials, also try to have somebody to watch you and see if you are doing it right. It helps a lot to watch movies or learn from a friend. Rest is also as equally valuable as practice when it comes to learning new moves. Give yourself plenty of time for both, and take breaks if you need to.

Essentially, to ride trials requires an intensively focused state of mind. An individual's ability to perform various trials moves stems not from the limits of what has or hasn't been done, but from what their imagination, and body will permit.

==Crank grabs==
A crank grab typically consists of two steps

# Hop to crank grab position, where you jump and land on the edge of something (table, bench, etc.) but instead of landing on your wheel land on your crank
# Hop from crank grab position to rubber, jumping from the first position and landing on your wheel

It is important to lean far into the object you are grabbing onto. The second foot may or may not leave the pedal. Practice doing small hops from the crank before trying to go fully to rubber, and it will follow naturally. It may take a while before you learn to land on the crank in balance.

A good way to learn crank grabbing is to practice just from the part after the crank has been caught on the ledge. First, just try to get the wheel over without focusing on landing on the pedals with balance. Next, focus more on landing with control over the unicycle. Continue this method until you can  land the crank grab easily. Now is the time to learn the actually grab section of the crank grab. Finally, you can put it all together!

== Pedal grab ==
A pedal grab is typically made seat out and consists of two steps

# Hop to pedal grab position
# Hop from pedal grab position to rubber.

It is important to lean far into the object you are grabbing onto. This is more difficult for the pedal grab than the crank grab since the seat isn't as stable. The second foot may or may not leave the pedal. Practice doing small hops from the pedal before trying to go fully to rubber, and it will follow naturally. It is in fact easier to go from pedal grab to rubber than from crank grab to rubber once you know it.

Try to think of it as a skateboard ollie. This was the tip that made me go to rubber for the first time. Lift your free pedal (the one not on the object) a little bit up in the air and then in one single motion swing the other pedal up. The key to succes is to practice. If you follow these steps you will learn to pedalgrab in hardly any time.

== High hop seat in ==

It is difficult to hop high seat in (other than using seat in rolling hop). Accept it to be difficult to get higher than 30 cm unless you use pre-hops. Practice bending at the waist and pulling the unicycle up as you hop. For higher seat in hops, a pre-hop is necessary. You would typically also run a higher tire pressure and lower seat height than normal. It is possible to get up and over 60cm seat in side hops, however the majority of unicyclists will either switch to seat out or to rolling hops. 

Seat-In hops are essential to learn before seat-out hops, since the seat provides an extra point of contact, and therefore more control for beginners. After the seat begins to limit hopping height it is recommended that one develops his/her seat out control.

When hopping seat out, it helps to have the seat at a comfortable height. It should be just high enough to let you stand almost straight while holding the saddle in front of you. Holding the saddle in the back makes it easier to pull it up. Practice hopping on angled surfaces, or doing natural trials to learn controlling rotational force on the wheel. The key to comfortable hopping seat out is even pedal pressure distribution. If one is unable to apply even pressure, then the wheel will roll uncontrollably.

Hopping seat-out requires several different aspects in order to attain maximal height. This technique can be broken down into the following:
1.Prehop
2.Jump
3.Landing (tuck)
4.Recovery

1. Practice pre-hops by bunny hopping seat out and focus on the timing, you will develop a sense for when force should be applied. Prehops can be transferred from hopping seat-in, since  it is the exact same action, and will transfer directly. To execute the prehop, back off a bit from the object, stand still, make a hop towards it, and as you hit the ground, apply pressure at the right instant, and the force will bring you up while you pull up the unicycle beneath you.

2. The jump is where you're actually jumping. One's ability to perform high hops depends on one's vertical jump, but only to a certain degree. Vertical jump is the height an individual can jump off the ground(measured from where you can touch a wall, arm fully extended to where you can touch the same wall when you jump up) It makes sense that vertical jump affects hopping height, however this isn't the only factor, and one's Vertical Jump can be improved through fitness and just practice.

3. The Landing is the most important part of the high hop. This requires a tucking off the wheel up underneath you as much as possible. Make sure you pull the tire up as far as possible to get maximum height. When you reach the top of the object you're aiming for, you should almost be able to feel the tire hitting your butt. Using this technique with a static hop it is possible to get over 85 cm (2.77 feet). With a prehop done properly, you should be able to add 15cm (6 in.) to your static hop. Using this technique hops of over 100cm (3.25 feet) have been accomplished.

4. Recovery is basically standing up from that super-tucked position that you used to get onto the object which you just made it up. This seems like an unimportant step, but if you can't stand up, that massive wall you just cleared doesn't mean anything, except that you can &quot;Almost make that hop&quot;
Finally put it all together. 

Also check Ryan Atkins [http://gallery.unicyclist.com/albums/albus24/How_to.wmv video tutorial] on how to hop somewhat high.

== Gapping seat out ==

Stand perpendicular to where you want to go. Lean to the side you with to go, and make the hop. Gapping seat out will allow you to pull the tire up as you jump, and this can be used to achieve a greater distance in your gaps much the same way as in regular seat out hops. It is a lot easier to gap to the sides than it is to gap forwards. You will develop a sense for how much you need to lean before jumping; it is usually not that much. It may help to twist in the air, meaning to take off to the side and twist in the air so that you land facing the direction in which you jumped. If you are gapping onto a narrow object, try to gap somewhat less than you think you have to and use the momentum from the jump and shift your hips to find balance. It is somewhat easier to do the adjustments when you jump too short than when you overshoot.

== Gapping seat in ==
Similar to gapping seat out but with some more control.

== High rolling hops ==
Initiation:
When working out how far you need to be before starting a rolling hop, take the height of the object onto which you wish to hop, and turn this into the distance from which you will initiate the hop. Add a little bit more to the distance at which you initiate the hop. Start riding backwards about 3-8 revolutions (depending on personal preference and situation) from where you wish to initiate the hop. 

E.g. Bob wants to rolling hop onto an 80cm high table. He works out where he would initiate the hop, about 90-100cm from the table to (horizontally). He then puts the center of his wheel onto the spot, rides backwards 6 revolutions and stops. He puts a rock at where he has stopped so that he can adjust how far he needs to be if further attempts are made. Bob then rides as quickly as he can to the initiation point, holding his seat and preparing himself as he approaches. He then pulls up on the seat, using his other hand for balance and stability, and launches himself up as hard as he can. As he approaches the table top he bends at the stomach, bringing the wheel up in line (vertically) with his head. The continuing horizontal momentum will carry his body onto the table with the unicycle. 

The key to Bob's success however, was in the fact that he had progressively practiced the rolling hop everyday. It doesn't just happen!!! Also, when doing a rolling hop, the majority of people bail (pull-out) because they feel that they cannot make the hop. The key is, just do it. If you stack it, make sure you have safety equipment on, but in the scheme of things, you must make yourself do it. 

&quot;I recently made a couple of 80cm rolling hops, and I found that the first attempt that I made it was a complete surprise, because I just forced myself to do it! Also, if you feel like after about 15-30 minutes that you are still not making it because you are too afraid/scared/unwilling etc... leave it for a day, or a couple of hours, go and do some wheel walk/gliding/backwards riding/backflips for a while and come back to it later. Also, if you keep trying rolling hops at the same place and still get scared, try doing it somewhere else. And remember, once you have made it, convince yourself that you can make it every time from now on. Also, it is a good idea to measure the height, and compare it to other situations of the same height when in doubt of whether you can make it or not.&quot; - UR

== Dropping seat in ==
Dropping seat in is the easiest way of dropping. The most common way to drop seat in is to just approach the edge and then &quot;kaboom&quot; down to the ground. This produces tremendous stress on the axle. Instead you should try to hop forward, bending your body slightly at the waist to help the wheel roll forward with you as you hit the ground. It is important to have some forward motion, so as not to end up on your butt as the wheel shoots forward.

Having the seat lower than you may help when attempting seat-in drops by avoiding the squishing of gentleman's bits. Soaking up some of your downward momentum upon landing with flexing of the upper body downward is a good technique to take load off of the axle and the knees and ankles.

As you get better you may roll off the obstacles instead. It is good to practice dropping in both stances.

== Dropping seat out ==

If it is not possible to roll out a drop, dropping seat out is an effective technique. Seat out drops can also be combined with a roll out if the surface allows. Seat out dropping provides a way to drop onto objects like fire hydrants or gapping bars since you may bend down to absorb the downward forces. One crucial thing is to keep the wheel stable through the drop.

== Riding down stairs ==

When you ride down stairs, you want the unicycle to be slightly in front of you while at the same time you want to lean forward. It is easiest to bend a bit at the waist. If you lean backwards chances are that you will fall on your back, and if you lean forward, you are likely to leave the unicycle behind. Also, stairs are easier to ride and much less intimidating if you think of them only as a bumpy hill. 

The next thing is that you should keep some distance to the seat so you do not hurt yourself. Suspend in your knees if needed, but the need to suspend is not as big in steep stairs.

Riding down stairs is a little dangerous if you do not use a helmet and other protective gear. Protect your back as well as you can, the chances of falling backwards are quite high. Also be aware that you might end up running down the stairs instead of cycling.

The biggest thing that helped me was pulling up on the seat! This keeps the pedals stuck securely to your feet preventing you from simply coming off your uni.

== Mounting on skinnies ==
If the rail is low enough, put the wheel of your uni up first, then one leg (the one that will be on the rail as you mount). Hold the seat with one hand and keep the other out wide for balance. Step up and regain your balance. Then get your pedals where you want them (I've found the static mount is easiest so have the pedals horizontal) and put one foot on the back pedal.

It's easiest to balance if the back foot that's still  on the rail is at about 30 degrees or less to the direction of the rail. If your foot is at more of an angle there won't be as much shoe in contact with it and you won't be able to correct your balance as easily, plus depending on your shoe type, you might get stuck in the arch of the shoe and that will make it even more difficult to balance.

When you're in that position have the seat between your legs as you'll be much more balanced that way, and stand there for a few seconds making sure your weight is directly over the uni and the uni is directly over the rail. This is a very important step. Have one hand on the seat when you mount so you're absolutely sure it goes where you want it and you don't have to fix it later while you're trying to ride the rail. 

You MUST completely ignore the terrain below the rail. That is what's most likely to make you mount and lose balance to one side even if it doesn't intimidate you. 

Then mount and bring the other hand out wide for balance, and ride the rail.

== Riding on skinnies ==
Once you are steadily mounted, pedal forward slowly. It is important to look at the end of the skinny, not directly down at the tire. Try thinking about pushing on the pedals as lightly as possible, so your wheel does not wobble. Like almost any other skill, it helps to keep your weight on the saddle.</text>

=== General ===

Nuts and bolts do not like being assembled dry, especially if they are tightened firmly.  Depending on the parts involved, use either grease (e.g. white lithium or Phil Wood), anti-sieze, or threadlocker (Loctite or equivalent) on the threads.  It may also be a good idea to take everything apart once in a while to make sure everything is OK and get a chance to put on some more anti-seize. When you put on the pedals don't forget that the left pedal goes on in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise). Keep your wheel true and your bolts tight!

=== Cutting the seatpost ===

If you buy a muni, chances are that the seat post will be too tall for you. The procedure of cutting a seat post is trivial and can be done by anyone with access to a metal saw. Do NOT put any part of the unicycle in a vice! Hold the seat post in your hand and cut. File away the sharp edges. Finally put on some grease (anti-seize may not be a good idea here).

=== Noises ===

There may be many different sources of noise on a unicycle. The most common are the cranks, the pedals and the spokes.

It is very common that there is a creaking noise from the spokes. If you tighten your spokes evenly with a spokes wrench however, the noise level will most likely subside.

=== Loose pedals ===

Hold the pedal and wiggle it around. If it moves it may be loose. Look for movement where the pedal attaches to the crank. If it is loose, remove it and apply anti-seize or Loctite and tighten it - hard. Notice that the left pedal goes on in the other direction!

A pedal may also be loose on its spindle. Resolving this is somewhat more difficult. See the pedal section below.

If you hop often, the pedal may start to feel loose. This isnt because it is loose, it is the bearing breaking down.

=== Loose cranks ===

Hold the crank arm and wiggle it. If you feel a click then the crank arm may be loose. It is easy to detect this if you idle with the pressure on one foot.

=== Splined hub/crank maintenance ===

It is very hard to actually break a set of splined cranks but unless they are regularly maintained they will wear and show movement on the spline.  This goes for all types and makes of splined crank sets.  This is because the splines are not tapered but are straight and rely on the precision of the fit to keep them from moving.

[http://www.unicycle.uk.com/FAQ.asp?iCategory=57#Refurbishing%20Hubs Refurbishing Hubs]

Other cranksets can be maintained in a very similar fashion depending on design.

=== Loose spokes ===

The spokes make a characteristic sound when they are loose.

To tighten the spokes you will need a spoke wrench. It is of utmost importance to have a high quality spoke wrench that fits snugly onto the nipples! High quality spoke wrenches are made by Park Tools. If you have a low quality spoke wrench it will round your nipples and make it impossible to further adjust the nipples without removing the tire. If you notice that the wrench slips, stop immediately!

To tighten a spoke you have to turn the wrench in the opposite to the direction that would be intuitive, i.e. counterclockwise. Think of the nipple as a screw going onto the spoke and you will understand why. If the wheel is true it may be sufficient to go around the wheel and tighten the spokes one by 1/2 a revolution, or in case they are very loose by a whole revolution or more.

===Popped spoke===

If you have a weak rim, a spoke can sometimes gradually enlarge its hole until it pops out of the rim. The spoke will not stay in place if you try to put it back into the rim. A good temporary fix until you can purchase a better rim is to take the nipple off, insert a washer over the hole, replace the nipple, and tighten the spoke again. 

=== The wheel is not centered in the frame ===

Several things could be wrong.

1. One side of your fork could be longer than the other, this is unusual, more often the fork legs are not correctly aligned but these can be straightened quite easily. If the fork legs are different lengths this can be easily fixed by putting shims between the top of the bearing and the bottom of the fork. One could use strips of aluminum soda can as shims. The basic idea is to use shims to add length to the shorter side of the frame. Here are the step by step instructions:

* Diagnosis
Remove the main caps, but leave the wheel in the frame. Spin the wheel. If the wheel is closer to one side of the frame consistently, than try removing the wheel and putting it back in the other direction. If it's off center to the other side, than your wheel is dished, and that's a different problem. If it wobbles back and forth while it spins, than it's out of true. If it looks just like it did before you turned the frame around, than you need to shim it.

* Fix
Remember the shorter side where the frame is closer to the wheel. Remove the wheel from the frame. Cut out pieces off soda can to fit in the top of the bearing holder. Depending on how bad it is, you could need 7 or 8 pieces. Put the shims in the bearing holder attached to the shorter side of the frame. Put the wheel in the bearing holders on top of the shims.

You may have to bolt the main caps back on to the frame before you know if you've put the correct number if shims in, because they compress a little when you tighten the main caps. Add or remove shims to get the wheel as close to centered as possible.

This been used on several unicycles and it has not caused problems.

2. Your bearings aren't centered on the axle. If your bearings have a press fit like on a Suzue hub, they may have slipped. If you have a Profile hub or something with a similar design, having a different number of spacers on each side of the axle will cause this also. This will probably be addressed by John Childs if you ask him.

3. Your frame could be bent. This is not very common. You may be able to bend you frame back, or possibly use the shim fix. If not, buy a new frame.

=== Wheel truing ===

=== Bearing holder tightness ===

It is important not to overtighten the bearing holders since this may damage the bearings. It is easiest to do this by trial and error. Tighten the bolts on both sides equally using the fingers only and then turn the wheel by hand and observe how freely it spins. Now continue to tighten the bolts evenly until the wheel comes to a stop more quickly. Now loosen the bolts slightly on both sides just to make the wheel spin freely again.

If you have a heavy wheel, the wheel may spin even though the bearings are too tight. If you can flex the frame, then you need to tighten the bolts more.

[http://londonunicyclingclub.ca/bearings.htm Instructions on maintenance of bearings]

=== Pedals ===

It is surprisingly easy to damage the threads on the pedals. To avoid this you should always use only your hands for the first few turns as you put on the pedal. Make sure that there is some grease or even better some anti-seize or Loctite on the threads. If the pedal does not go in easily, you may be on your way to crossthreading it! If you have crossthreaded the cranks or the pedal you will most likely need to replace these parts. The pedals should stay tight once they are on.

In case the pins fall out of the pedal you may use regular screws that you get from a hardware store, or real replacement pins from a bike shop. Use Loctite if they get loose. Sometimes the threads take damage when a pin falls out, and there is not much one can do about that, except avoiding pedal grabs.

If you suspect that the pedal is getting loose on its axle, i.e. clicking and feeling loose, it may  fall apart any second, and you may not be able to find the balls if they happen to fall out.

Unsealed pedals may become filled with water and mud. In case this happens you have to take off the plastic cap and remove the nuts. As you bring the axle out of the pedal, keep an eye an the balls as they tend to fall out. Fill the pedal with grease and put it back together. It is very easy to overtighten the nuts, check that the pedal spins freely as you tighten the nuts. Most pedals come with little grease since they spin better that way.

[http://londonunicyclingclub.ca/pedalbearings.htm Instructions on maintenance of pedals]

=== Saddle ===

A saddle usually either breaks at the seat base or the seat cover develops rips that cause the padding to fall out.

If you know that you are likely to hit the side of the saddle onto concrete, it would be wise to be able to protect it. Either you can buy a KH Fusion seat cover or simply cut off a section a tube and stretch over the saddle. Segments from used 2.125&quot; tubes are known to work. Cut off a segment, and heat it, stretch it, repeat a few times and then try it on. The front sides of the saddle take the most damage, so putting just in front of the seat post is a good idea. It is good if the tube goes all the way to the handle, that way it won't slide back as easily. The tubes will break eventually, but they are easy to replace. Trying to fix a rip in the may not be worth the effort. Maybe glue would work.

If the seat base fails, you either live with it, buy a new seat base or save up for a Carbon Fibre seat base. The Carbon Fibre seat base will in addition make the seat a lot stiffer, so you can exert force directly to the frame.

=== Helmets ===
Although most people hardly ever hit their head, a helmet is recommended especially if you're doing something crazy! Remember that you cannot afford to bash up your head a few times before deciding to buy a helmet.  

If you want to ride over gaps and other odd-shaped obstacles, a skate helmet offers better protection than a bike helmet. For general riding the lighter and better-vented bike helmets are probably more adequate. A good helmet can be pretty cheap.

=== Shin protection ===
If you don't mind the occasional bloody leg, then shin guards with plastic pedals aren't necessary, but if you are using pinned pedals, then shin protection is a requirement. The gash from a pinned pedal is rather painful, and it may take a month for it to heal completely. Particularly bad gashes may need stitching.

After a while you get used to them and forget they are there. They have saved my legs a couple of times from nasty roots and stones.

Kris Holm designed and sells shin guards specifically for unicycling. 

Other companies that produce shin guards are TSG, Roach, KHE, and sixsixone. Sixsixone knee/shin armor is very popular among unicyclists, and gives good protection.

=== Knee Guards ===
If you fall forward enough that your hands touch the ground, odds are that your knees aren't far behind.  Part of learning how to ride a unicycle is knowing how to fall.  Many beginners take serious falls on their knees during this process.  If you are new to the sport, are an adult, or attempt difficult stunts, knee protection is a good idea.

Many knee guards are available and some come with shin protection attached for complete &quot;Leg Protection&quot;.  Popular leg armor is available from Kris Holm and Sixsixone.

=== Shoes ===

Most unicyclists prefer low shoes with a flat sole. Boots tend to infringe on the ankle movements  and heels may make adjustments of foot placement difficult.

Sneakers, or skate shoes are good. If it is wet and cold and you can afford it, low Gore-Tex boots are also nice. If you use pinned pedals or practice gliding, expect your shoes to wear out in no-time. Soles that are made from one piece of rubber may hold up better. Take notice of how well the sole is attached to the shoe. If you have the money to buy a cycling specific shoe, the [http://www.fiveten.com/ Five Ten Impact] is highly recommended. (Go to -&gt;Footwear -&gt; Freeride) It comes in high and low top, and has a very grippy sole. Vans skate shoes have a great sole for gripping on pinned pedals, because of how the indentations in the sole fit around pins. Another shoe that is great is The North Face's A5s. They have a one-piece Vibram sole that is nearly indestructible, and the tread in the sole is perfect for gripping pinned pedals.

Many riders wear Converse All-Stars, both high and low top, but mostly for freestyle riding because they are soft and the rider gets a good feel for the pedals. Keep in mind All-Stars purchased in the U.S.A. have a felt lining glued to the bottom of the rubber sole which makes them slippery on the pedals (why, I don't know). Look on the web for a store in Canada then purchase from there to avoid this &quot;feature&quot;. The high-tops also provide a small degree of protection for those exposed ankle bones so close to the cranks!

=== Wrist guards ===
Breaking your wrist is bad and it happens more than you may think.

Wrist guards are especially important in unicycling, because riders tend fall forward onto their hands.

Kris Holm designed and sells wrist support gloves specifically for unicycling.  These wrist guards cover the fingers, have palm padding and a wrist splint on the back of the wrist to allow easier seat grabs.  Full finger covering is also important when constantly grabbing your seat in trials and muni.  http://www.krisholm.com/products/productpics/index-Pages/Image16.html

Many other companies sell wrist guards designed for inline skating or skateboarding. Harbinger wrist wraps are excellent, because they allow for flexibility while keeping your wrist stable.

=== Ankle Guards ===
Bloody ankles are not uncommon for trials and muni riders.  Depending on the Q of the cranks, your ankles can become dangerously close to the hub.  This often happens when a rider loses control of their unicycle during a big drop because the ankle of the forward foot is located next to the hub.  If you don't have high-top shoes with ankle padding, ankle guards that insert into shoes are available.  

Many people had this problem with the Summit and Kris Holm 2003-2004 trials uni.  The 2005 Kris holm cranks have a larger Q and don't suffer from that problem as much

In addition, some riders wear ankle braces designed to prevent sprained ankles and torn tendons, and to protect them while recovering from an injury. These range from neoprene rubber tubes that fit over the ankle, to plastic sided braces which work in a similar fashion to wrist guards.

A cheap and easy solution to protect ankles is by cutting a (soft) computer-mouse mat in 4 pieces, round the corners, and put those in your socks.</text>

== Using Java for Serial Communication ==

=== Introduction ===
Because of Java's platform-independence, serial interfacing is difficult. Serial interfacing requires a standardized API with platform-specific implementations, which is difficult for Java.

Unfortunately, Sun didn't pay much attention to serial communication in Java. Sun has defined a serial communication API, called [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-141752.html ''JavaComm''], but an implementation of the API was not part of the Java standard edition. Sun provided a reference implementation for a few, but not all Java platforms. Particularly, at the end of 2005 Sun silently withdrew ''JavaComm'' support for Windows. Third party implementations for some of the omitted platforms are available. ''JavaComm'' hasn't seen much in the way of maintenance activities, only the bare minimum maintenance is performed by Sun, except that Sun apparently responded to pressure from buyers of their own Sun Ray thin clients and adapted JavaComm to this platform while dropping Windows support.

This situation, and the fact that Sun originally did not provide a ''JavaComm'' implementation for Linux (starting in 2006, they now do) led to the development of the free-software [http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page ''RxTx''] library. ''RxTx'' is available for a number of platforms, not only Linux. It can be used in conjunction with ''JavaComm'' (''RxTx'' providing the hardware-specific drivers), or it can be used stand-alone. When used as a ''JavaComm'' driver the bridging between the ''JavaComm'' API and ''RxTx'' is done by ''JCL'' (''JavaComm for Linux''). ''JCL'' is part of the ''RxTx'' distribution.

Sun's negligence of ''JavaComm'' and ''JavaComm'''s particular programming model gained ''JavaComm'' the reputation of being unusable. 
''RxTx'' - if not used as a ''JavaComm'' driver - provides a richer interface, but one which is not standardized. ''RxTx'' supports more platforms than the existing ''JavaComm'' implementations. Recently, ''RxTx'' has been adopted to provide the same interface as ''JavaComm'', only that the package names don't match Sun's package names.

So, which of the libraries should one use in an application? If maximum portability (for some value of &quot;maximum&quot;) is desired, then ''JavaComm'' is a good choice. If there is no ''JavaComm'' implementation for a particular platform available, but an ''RxTx'' implementation is, then ''RxTx'' could be used as a driver on that platform for ''JavaComm''. So, by using JavaComm one can support all platforms which are either directly supported by Sun's reference implementation or by RxTx with JCL. This way the application doesn't need to be changed, and can work against just one interface, the standardized ''JavaComm'' interface.

This module discusses both ''JavaComm'' and ''RxTx''. It mainly focuses on demonstrating concepts, not ready-to-run code. Those who want to blindly copy code are referred to the sample code that comes with the packages. Those who want to know what they are doing might find some useful information in this module.

jSSC (Java Simple Serial Connector) should also be considered

=== Getting started ===

* Learn the basics of [[Serial Programming|serial communication and programming]].
* Have the documentation of the device you want to communicate with (e.g. the modem) ready.
* Set up all hardware and a test environment
* Use, for example, a terminal program to manually communicate with the device. This is to be sure the test environment is set up correctly and you have understood the commands and responses from the device.
* Download the API implementation you want to use for your particular operating system

* Read
** the JavaComm and/or RxTx installation instruction (and follow it)
** the API documentation
** the example source code shipped

=== Installation ===

==== General Issues ====
Both ''JavaComm'' and ''RxTX'' show some installation quirks. It is highly recommended to follow the installation instructions word-for-word. If they say that a jar file or a shared library has to go into a particular directory, then this is meant seriously! If the instructions say that a particular file or device needs to have a specific ownership or access rights, this is also meant seriously. Many installation troubles simply come from not following the instructions precisely.

It should especially be noted that some versions of ''JavaComm'' come with two installation instructions. One for Java 1.2 and newer, one for Java 1.1. Using the wrong one will result in a non-working installation. On the other hand, some versions/builds/packages of ''RxTx'' come with incomplete instructions. In such a case the corresponding source code distribution of ''RxTx'' needs to be obtained, which should contain complete instructions.

It should be further noticed that it is also typical for Windows JDK installations to come with up to three VMs, and thus three extension directories. 
* One as part of the JDK, 
* one as part of the private JRE which comes with the JDK to run JDK tools, and 
* one as part of the public JRE which comes with the JDK to run applications
Some even claim to have a fourth JRE somewhere in the \Windows directory hierarchy.

''JavaComm'' should at least be installed as extension in the JDK and in all public JREs.

==== Webstart ====
===== JavaComm =====
A general problem, both for ''JavaComm'' and ''RxTx'' is, that they resist installation via [http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/ Java WebStart]:

''JavaComm'' is notorious, because it requires a file called ''javax.comm.properties'' to be placed in the JDK lib directory, something which can't be done with Java WebStart. This is particularly sad, because the need for that file is the result of some unnecessary design/decision in ''JavaComm'' and could have easily been avoided by the ''JavaComm'' designers. Sun constantly refuses to correct this error, citing the mechanism is essential. Which is, they are lying through their teeth when it comes to ''JavaComm'', particular, because Java for a long time has a service provider architecture exactly intended for such purposes.

The contents of the properties file is typically just one line, the name of the java class with the native driver, e.g.:

 driver=com.sun.comm.Win32Driver

The following is a hack which allows to deploy JavaComm via Web Start ignoring that brain-dead properties file. It has serious drawbacks, and might fail with newer JavaComm releases - should Sun ever come around and make a new version.

First, turn off the security manager. Some doofus programmer at Sun decided that it would be cool to again and again check for the existence of the dreaded ''javax.comm.properties'' file, even after it has been loaded initially, for no other apparent reason than checking for the file.

 System.setSecurityManager(null);

Then, when initializing the JavaComm API, initialize the driver manually:

 String driverName = &quot;com.sun.comm.Win32Driver&quot;; // or get as a JNLP property
 CommDriver commDriver = (CommDriver)Class.forName(driverName).newInstance();
 commDriver.initialize();

===== RxTx =====

''RxTx'' on some platforms requires changing ownership and access rights of serial devices. This is also something which can't be done via WebStart.

At startup of your program you could ask the user to perform the necessary setup as super user.

Further, RxTx has a pattern matching algorithm for identifying &quot;valid&quot; serial device names. This often breaks things when one wants to use non-standard devices, like USB-to-serial converters. This mechanism can be overridden by system properties. See the RxTx installation instruction for details.

== JavaComm API ==

=== Introduction ===

The official API for serial communication in Java is the JavaComm API. This API is not part of the standard Java 2 version. Instead, an implementation of the API has to be downloaded separately. Unfortunately, JavaComm has not received much attention from Sun, and hasn't been really maintained for a long time. From time to time Sun does trivial bug-fixes, but doesn't do the long overdue main overhaul.

This section explains the basic operation of the JavaComm API. The provided source code is kept simple to demonstrate important point. It needs to be enhanced when used in a real application.

The source code in this chapter is not the only available example code. The JavaComm download comes with several examples. These examples almost contain more information about using the API than the API documentation. Unfortunately, Sun does not provide any real tutorial or some introductory text. Therefore, it is worth studying the example code to understand the mechanisms of the API. Still, the API documentation should be studied, too. But the best way is to study the examples and play with them. Due to the lack of easy-to-use application and people's difficulty in understanding the APIs programming model, the API is often bad-mouthed. The API is better than its reputation, and functional. But no more.

The API uses a callback mechanism to inform the programmer about newly arriving data. It is also a good idea to study this mechanism instead of relying on polling the port. Unlike other callback interfaces in Java (e.g. in the GUI), this one only allows one listener listening to events. If multiple listeners require to listen to serial events, the one primary listener has to be implemented in a way that it dispatches the information to other secondary listeners.

=== Download &amp; Installation ===

==== Download ====
Sun's [http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/ JavaComm] web page points to a [http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=43208d3d download location]. Under this location Sun currently (2007) provides JavaComm 3.0 implementations for Solaris/SPARC, Solaris/x86, and Linux x86. Downloading requires to have registered for a Sun Online Account. The download page provides a link to the registration page. The purpose of this registration is unclear. One can download JDKs and JREs without registration, but for the almost trivial JavaComm Sun cites legal and governmental restrictions on the distribution and exportation of software.

The Windows version of JavaComm is no longer officially available, and Sun has - against their own product end-of-live policy - not made it available in the [http://java.sun.com/products/archive/ Java products archive]. However, the 2.0 Windows version (javacom 2.0) is still downloadable from [http://wind.lcs.mit.edu/download/ here].

==== Installation ====

Follow the installation instructions that come with the download. Some versions of JavaComm 2.0 come with two installation instructions. The most obvious of the two instructions is unfortunately the wrong one, intended for ancient Java 1.1 environments. The information referring to the also ancient Java 1.2 (jdk1.2.html) is the right one.

Particularly Windows users are typically not aware that they have copies of the same VM installed in several locations (typically three to four). Some IDEs also like to come with own, private JRE/JDK installations, as do some Java applications. The installation needs to be repeated for every VM installation (JDKs and JREs) which should be used in conjunction with the development and execution of a serial application.

IDEs typically have IDE-specific ways of how a new library (classes and documentation) is made known to the IDE. Often a library like JavaComm not only needs to be made known to the IDE as such, but also to each project that is supposed to use the library. Read the IDE's documentation. It should be noted that the old JavaComm 2.0 version comes with JavaDoc API documentation that is structured in the historic Java 1.0 JavaDoc layout. Some modern IDEs are no longer aware of this structure and can't integrate the JavaComm 2.0 documentation into their help system. In such a case an external browser is needed to read the documentation (a recommended activity ...).

Once the software is installed it is recommended to examine the samples and JavaDoc directories. It makes sense to build and run one of the sample applications to verify that the installation is correct. The sample applications typically need some minor adaptations in order to run on a particular platform (e.g. changes to the hard-coded com port identifiers). It is a good idea to have some serial hardware, like cabling, a null modem, a breakout box, a real modem, PABX and others available when trying out a sample application. [[Serial_Programming:RS-232 Connections]] and [[Serial_Programming:Modems and AT Commands]] provide some information on how to set up the hardware part of a serial application development environment.

==== Finding the desired serial Port ====

The first three things to do when programming serial lines with JavaComm are typically 

#to enumerate all serial ports (port identifiers) available to JavaComm, 
#to select the desired port identifier from the available ones, and
#to acquire the port via the port identifier.

Enumerating and selecting the desired port identifier is typically done in one loop:

 import javax.comm.*;
 import java.util.*;
 ...&lt;br&gt;
 //
 // Platform specific port name, here= a Unix name
 //
 // NOTE: On at least one Unix JavaComm implementation JavaComm 
 //       enumerates the ports as &quot;COM1&quot; ... &quot;COMx&quot;, too, and not
 //       by their Unix device names &quot;/dev/tty...&quot;. 
 //       Yet another good reason to not hard-code the wanted
 //       port, but instead make it user configurable.
 //
 String wantedPortName = &quot;/dev/ttya&quot;;&lt;br&gt; 
 //
 // Get an enumeration of all ports known to JavaComm
 //
 Enumeration portIdentifiers = CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers();&lt;br&gt;
 //
 // Check each port identifier if 
 //   (a) it indicates a serial (not a parallel) port, and
 //   (b) matches the desired name.
 //
 CommPortIdentifier portId = null;  // will be set if port found
 while (portIdentifiers.hasMoreElements())
 {
     CommPortIdentifier pid = (CommPortIdentifier) portIdentifiers.nextElement();
     if(pid.getPortType() == CommPortIdentifier.PORT_SERIAL &amp;&amp;
        pid.getName().equals(wantedPortName)) 
     {
         portId = pid;
         break;
     }
 }
 if(portId == null)
 {
     System.err.println(&quot;Could not find serial port &quot; + wantedPortName);
     System.exit(1);
 }&lt;br&gt;
 //
 // Use port identifier for acquiring the port
 //
 ...

{{NOTE|note=JavaComm itself obtains the default list of available serial port identifiers from its platform-specific driver. The list is not really configurable via JavaComm. The method  &lt;code&gt;CommPortIdentifier.addPortName()&lt;/code&gt; is misleading, since driver classes are platform specific and their implementations are not part of the public API. Depending on the driver, the list of ports might be configurable / expendable in the driver. So if a particular port is not found in JavaComm, sometimes some fiddling with the driver can help.}}

Once a port identifier has been found, it can be used to acquire the desired port:

 //
 // Use port identifier for acquiring the port
 //
 SerialPort port = null;
 try {
     port = (SerialPort) portId.open(
         &quot;name&quot;, // Name of the application asking for the port 
         10000   // Wait max. 10 sec. to acquire port
     );
 } catch(PortInUseException e) {
     System.err.println(&quot;Port already in use: &quot; + e);
     System.exit(1);
 }
 //
 // Now we are granted exclusive access to the particular serial
 // port. We can configure it and obtain input and output streams.
 //
 ...

=== Initialize a Serial Port ===

The initialization of a serial port is straight forward. Either individually set the communication preferences (baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity) or set them all at once using the setSerialPortParams(...) convenience method. 

As part of the initialization process the Input and Output streams for communication will be configured in the example.

 import java.io.*;
 ...
 &lt;br&gt;
 //
 // Set all the params.  
 // This may need to go in a try/catch block which throws UnsupportedCommOperationException
 //
 port.setSerialPortParams(
     115200,
     SerialPort.DATABITS_8,
     SerialPort.STOPBITS_1,
     SerialPort.PARITY_NONE);
 &lt;br&gt;
 //
 // Open the input Reader and output stream. The choice of a
 // Reader and Stream are arbitrary and need to be adapted to
 // the actual application. Typically one would use Streams in
 // both directions, since they allow for binary data transfer,
 // not only character data transfer.
 //
 BufferedReader is = null;  // for demo purposes only. A stream would be more typical.
 PrintStream    os = null;
 &lt;br&gt;
 try {
   is = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(port.getInputStream()));
 } catch (IOException e) {
   System.err.println(&quot;Can't open input stream: write-only&quot;);
   is = null;
 }
 &lt;br&gt;
 //
 // New Linux systems rely on Unicode, so it might be necessary to
 // specify the encoding scheme to be used. Typically this should
 // be US-ASCII (7 bit communication), or ISO Latin 1 (8 bit
 // communication), as there is likely no modem out there accepting
 // Unicode for its commands. An example to specify the encoding
 // would look like:
 //
 //     os = new PrintStream(port.getOutputStream(), true, &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;);
 //
 os = new PrintStream(port.getOutputStream(), true);
 &lt;br&gt;  
 //
 // Actual data communication would happen here
 // performReadWriteCode();
 //
 &lt;br&gt;
 //
 // It is very important to close input and output streams as well
 // as the port. Otherwise Java, driver and OS resources are not released.
 //
 if (is != null) is.close();
 if (os != null) os.close();
 if (port != null) port.close();

=== Simple Data Transfer ===
==== Simple Writing of Data ====

Writing to a serial port is as simple as basic Java IO. However there are a couple of caveats to look out for if you are using the AT Hayes protocol:

# Don't use println (or other methods that automatically append &quot;\n&quot;) on the OutputStream. The AT Hayes protocol for modems expects a &quot;\r\n&quot; as the delimiter (regardless of underlying operating system). 
# After writing to the OutputStream, the InputStream buffer will contain a repeat of the command that was sent to it (with line feed), if the modem is set to echoing the command line, and another line feed (the answer to the &quot;AT&quot; command). So as part of the write operation make sure to clean the InputStream of this information (which can actually be used for error detection).
# When using a Reader/Writer (not a really good idea), at least set the character encoding to US-ASCII instead of using the platform's default encoding, which might or might not work.
# Since the main operation when using a modem is to transfer data unaltered, the communication with the modem should be handled via InputStream/OutputStream, and not a Reader/Writer.

{{TODO|
* Explain how to mix binary and character I/O over the same stream
* Fix the example to use streams}}

 // Write to the output 
 os.print(&quot;AT&quot;);
 os.print(&quot;\r\n&quot;); // Append a carriage return with a line feed
 
 is.readLine(); // First read will contain the echoed command you sent to it. In this case: &quot;AT&quot;
 is.readLine(); // Second read will remove the extra line feed that AT generates as output

==== Simple Reading of Data (Polling) ====

If you correctly carried out the write operation (see above) then the read operation is as simple as one command:

 // Read the response
 String response = is.readLine(); // if you sent &quot;AT&quot; then response == &quot;OK&quot;

==== Problems with the simple Reading / Writing ====

The simple way of reading and/or writing from/to a serial port as demonstrated in the previous sections has serious drawbacks. Both activities are done with ''blocking I/O''. That means, when there is
* no data available for reading, or
* the output buffer for writing is full (the device does not accept (any more) data),
the read or write method (&lt;code&gt;os.print()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;is.readLine()&lt;/code&gt; in the previous example) do not return, and the application comes to a halt. More precisely, the thread from which the read or write is done gets blocked. If that thread is the main application thread, the application freezes until the blocking condition is resolved (data becomes available for reading or device accepts data again).

Unless the application is a very primitive one, freezing of the application is not acceptable. For example, as a minimum some user interaction to cancel the communication should still be possible. What is needed is ''non-blocking I/O'' or ''asynchronous I/O''. However, JavaComm is based on Java's standard blocking I/O system (&lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt;), but with a twist, as shown later.

The mentioned &quot;twist&quot; is that JavaComm provides some limited support for ''asynchronous I/O'' via an event notification mechanism. But the general solution in Java to achieve ''non-blocking I/O'' on top of the blocking I/O system is to use threads. Indeed, this is a viable solution for serial writing, and it is strongly recommended to use a separate thread to write to the serial port - even if the event notification mechanism is used, as explained later.

Reading could also be handled in a separate thread. However, this is not strictly necessary if the JavaComm event notification mechanism is used. So summarize:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
!Activity
!Architecture
|-
|reading
|use event notification and/or separate thread
|-
|writing
|always use separate thread, optionally use event notification
|}

The following sections provide some details.

=== Event Driven Serial Communication ===
==== Introduction ====
The JavaComm API provides an event notification mechanism to overcome the problems with ''blocking I/O''. However, in the typical Sun manner this mechanism is not without problems.

In principle an application can register event listeners with a particular &lt;code&gt;SerialPort&lt;/code&gt; to be kept informed about important events happening on that port. The two most interesting event types for reading and writing data are
*&lt;code&gt;javax.comm.SerialPortEvent.DATA_AVAILABLE&lt;/code&gt; and 
*&lt;code&gt;javax.comm.SerialPortEvent.OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY&lt;/code&gt;.

But there are also two problems:

#Only one single event listener per &lt;code&gt;SerialPort&lt;/code&gt; can be registered. This forces the programmer to write &quot;monster&quot; listeners, discriminating according to the event type.
#&lt;code&gt;OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; is an optional event type. Well hidden in the documentation Sun states that not all JavaComm implementations support generating events of this type.

Before going into details, the next section will present the principal way of implementing and registering a serial event handler. Remember, there can only be one handler at all, and it will have to handle all possible events.

==== Setting up a serial Event Handler ====

 import javax.comm.*;
 &lt;/br&gt;
 /**
  * Listener to handle all serial port events.
  *
  * NOTE: It is typical that the SerialPortEventListener is implemented
  *       in the main class that is supposed to communicate with the
  *       device. That way the listener has easy access to state information
  *       about the communication, e.g. when a particular communication
  *       protocol needs to be followed.
  *
  *       However, for demonstration purposes this example implements a
  *       separate class.
  */ 
 class SerialListener implements SerialPortEventListener {
 &lt;/br&gt;
     /**
      * Handle serial events. Dispatches the event to event-specific
      * methods.
      * @param event The serial event
      */
     @Override
     public void serialEvent(SerialPortEvent event){
 &lt;/br&gt;
         //
         // Dispatch event to individual methods. This keeps this ugly
         // switch/case statement as short as possible.
         //
         switch(event.getEventType()) {
             case SerialPortEvent.OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY:
                 outputBufferEmpty(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.DATA_AVAILABLE:
                 dataAvailable(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
 /* Other events, not implemented here -&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.BI:
                 breakInterrupt(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.CD:
                 carrierDetect(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.CTS:
                 clearToSend(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.DSR:
                 dataSetReady(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.FE:
                 framingError(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.OE:
                 overrunError(event);
                 break;
 &lt;/br&gt;
             case SerialPortEvent.PE:
                 parityError(event);
                 break;
             case SerialPortEvent.RI:
                 ringIndicator(event);
                 break;
 &lt;- other events, not implemented here */
 &lt;/br&gt;
         }
     }
 &lt;/br&gt;
     /**
      * Handle output buffer empty events.
      * NOTE: The reception of this event is optional and not
      *       guaranteed by the API specification.
      * @param event The output buffer empty event
      */
     protected void outputBufferEmpty(SerialPortEvent event) {
         // Implement writing more data here
     }
 &lt;/br&gt;
     /**
      * Handle data available events.
      *
      * @param event The data available event
      */
     protected void dataAvailable(SerialPortEvent event) {
         // implement reading from the serial port here
     }
 }

Once the listener is implemented, it can be used to listen to particular serial port events. To do so, an instance of the listener needs to be added to the serial port. Further, the reception of each event type needs to be requested individually.

 SerialPort port = ...;
 ...
 //
 // Configure port parameters here. Only after the port is configured it
 // makes sense to enable events. The event handler might be called immediately
 // after an event is enabled.
 ...
 &lt;/br&gt;
 //
 // Typically, if the current class implements the SerialEventListener interface
 // one would call
 //
 //        port.addEventListener(this);
 //
 // but for our example a new instance of SerialListener is created:
 //
 port.addEventListener(new SerialListener());
 &lt;/br&gt;
 //
 // Enable the events we are interested in
 //
 port.notifyOnDataAvailable(true);
 port.notifyOnOutputEmpty(true);
 &lt;/br&gt;
 /* other events not used in this example -&gt;
 port.notifyOnBreakInterrupt(true);
 port.notifyOnCarrierDetect(true);
 port.notifyOnCTS(true);
 port.notifyOnDSR(true);
 port.notifyOnFramingError(true);
 port.notifyOnOverrunError(true);
 port.notifyOnParityError(true);
 port.notifyOnRingIndicator(true);
 &lt;- other events not used in this example */
 &lt;/br&gt;

==== Writing of Data ====
{{sectstub}}
{{TODO|todonote=
* Demonstrate usage of a separate thread to fill port's write buffer, but avoid blocking.
* Demonstrate usage of OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY (and since this is event is optional, only as an alternative.
}}

===== Setting up a separate Thread for Writing =====
{{sectstub}}
Using a separate thread for writing has one purpose: Avoiding that the whole application blocks in case the serial port is not
ready for writing.
====== A simple, thread-safe Ring Buffer Implementation ======
Using a separate thread for writing, separate from some main application thread, implies that there is some way to hand off the data which needs to be written from the application thread to the writing thread. A shared, synchronized data buffer, for example a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; should do. Further, there needs to be a way for the main application to determine if it can write to the data buffer, or if the data buffer is currently full. In case the data buffer is full it could indicate that the serial port is not ready, and output data has queued up. The main application will have to poll the availability of new space in the shared data buffer. However, between the polling the main application can do other things, for example updating a GUI, providing a command prompt with the ability to abort the sending, etc.

At first glance a &lt;code&gt;PipedInputStream/PipedOutputStream&lt;/code&gt; pair seems like a good idea for this kind of communication. But Sun wouldn't be Sun if the a piped stream would actually be useful. &lt;code&gt;PipedInputStream&lt;/code&gt; blocks if the corresponding &lt;code&gt;PipedOutputStream&lt;/code&gt; is not cleared fast enough. So the application thread would block. Exactly what one wants to avoid by using the separate thread. A &lt;code&gt;java.nio.Pipe&lt;/code&gt; suffers from the same problem. Its blocking behavior is platform dependent. And adapting the classic I/O used by JavaComm to NIO is anyhow not a nice task.

In this article a very simple synchronized ring buffer is used to hand over the data from one thread to another. In a real world application it is likely that the implementation should be more sophisticated. E.g. in a real world implementation it would make sense to implement OutputStream and InputStream views on the buffer.

A ring buffer as such is nothing special, and has no special properties regarding threading. It is just that this simple data structure is used here to provide data buffering. The implementation is done so that access to this data structure has been made thread safe.

 }

With this ring buffer one can now hand over data from one thread to another in a controlled way.  Any other thread-safe, non-blocking mechanism would also do. The key point here is that the write does not block when the buffer is full and also does not block when there is nothing to read.

====== Using the Buffer together with Serial Events ======

===== Usage of OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY Event in Writing =====

Referring to the skeleton event handler presented in the section [[#Setting up a serial Event Handler|Setting up a serial Event Handler]], one can now use a shared ring buffer from section [[#A simple, thread-safe Ring Buffer Implementation|A simple, thread-safe Ring Buffer Implementation]] to support the  &lt;code&gt;OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; event. The event is not supported by all JavaComm implementations, therefore the code might never be called. However, in case the event is available it is one building block for ensuring best data throughput, because the serial interface is not left idle for too long.

The skeleton event listener proposed a method &lt;code&gt;outputBufferEmpty()&lt;/code&gt;, which could be implemented as it follows.

     RingBuffer dataBuffer = ... ;
 &lt;br /&gt;
    /**
     * Handle output buffer empty events.
     * NOTE: The reception is of this event is optional and not
     *       guaranteed by the API specification.
     * @param event The output buffer empty event
     */
    protected void outputBufferEmpty(SerialPortEvent event) {

{{TODO}}
        
    }

==== Reading of Data ====
{{sectstub}}

The following example assumes that the data's destination is some file. Whenever data becomes available it is fetched from the serial port and written to the file. This is an extremely simplified view, because in reality one would need to check the data for an end-of-file indication to, for example, return to the modem command mode. 

 import javax.comm.*;
 &lt;br&gt;
 ...
 InputStream is = port.getInputStream();
 BufferedOutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(&quot;out.dat&quot;));
 &lt;br&gt;
 /**
  * Listen to port events
  */ 
 class FileListener implements SerialPortEventListener {
 &lt;/br&gt;
     /**
      * Handle serial event.
      */
     void serialEvent(SerialPortEvent e) {
         SerialPort port = (SerialPort) e.getSource();
 &lt;/br&gt;
         //
         // Discriminate handling according to event type
         //
         switch(e.getEventType()) {
         case SerialPortEvent.DATA_AVAILABLE:
 &lt;/br&gt;
             //
             // Move all currently available data to the file
             //
             try {
                  int c;
                  while((c = is.read()) != -1) {
                        out.write(c);
                  }
             } catch(IOException ex) {
                  ...
             }
             break;
         case ...:
             ...
             break;
         ...
         }
        if (is != null) is.close();
        if (port != null) port.close();
     }

=== Handling multiple Ports in one Application  ===
{{sectstub}}
=== Modem Control ===

JavaComm is strictly concerned with the handling of a serial interface and the transmission of data over that interface. It does not know, or provide, any support for higher-layer protocols, e.g. for Hayes modem commands typically used to control consumer-grade modems. This is simply not the job of JavaComm, and not a bug.

Like with any other particular serial device, if the control of a modem is desired via JavaComm the necessary code has to be written on top of JavaComm. The page [[../Modems and AT Commands|&quot;Hayes-compatible Modems and AT Commands&quot;]] provides the necessary basic generic information to deal with Hayes modems.

Some operating systems, e.g. Windows or certain Linux distributions provide a more or less standardized way how modem control commands for a particular modem type or brand are configured for the operating system. Windows modem &quot;drivers&quot;, for example, are typically just registry entries, describing a particular modem (the actual driver is a generic serial modem driver). JavaComm as such has no provisions to access such operating-system specific data. Therefor, one either has to provide a separate Java-only facility to allow a user to configure an application for the usage of a particular modem, or some platform-specific (native) code needs to be added.

== RxTx ==
{{sectstub}}
=== Overview and Versions ===

Due to the fact that Sun didn't provide a reference implementation of the JavaComm API for Linux, people developed RxTx for Java and Linux [http://rxtx.qbang.org/]. RxTx was then further ported to other platforms. The latest version of RxTx is known to work on 100+ platform, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Solaris and other operating systems.

RxTx can be used independent of the JavaComm API, or can be used as a so called provider for the JavaComm API. In order to do the latter, a wrapper called JCL is also needed [http://www.geeksville.com/~kevinh/linuxcomm.html]. JCL and RxTx are usually packaged together with Linux/Java distributions, or JCL is completely integrated into the code. So, before trying to get them separately, it is worth having a look at the Linux distribution CD.

There seems to be a trend to abandon the JavaComm API, and using RxTx directly instead of via the JCL wrapper, due to Sun's limited support and improper documentation for the JavaComm API. However, RxTx's documentation is extremely sparse. Particularly, the RxTX people like to make a mess of their versions and package contents (e.g. with or without integrated JCL). Starting with RxTx version 1.5 RxTx contains replacement classes for the public JavaComm classes. For legal reasons they are not in the &lt;code&gt;java.comm&lt;/code&gt; package, but in the &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt; package. However, the two currently available RxTx versions are packaged differently:

;RxTx 2.0:RxTx version supposed to be used as a JavaComm provider. This one is supposed to have its roots in RxRx 1.4, which is the RxTx version before the &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt; package was added.
;RxTx 2.1:RxTx version with a full &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt; package replacement for &lt;code&gt;java.comm&lt;/code&gt;. This version is supposed to have its roots in RxTx 1.5, where &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt; support started.

So, if one wants to program against the original JavaComm API one needs

#Sun's generic JavaComm version. As of this writing this is in fact the Unix package (which contains support for various Unix versions like Linux or Solaris). Even when used on Windows, the Unix package is needed to provide the generic &lt;code&gt;java.comm&lt;/code&gt; implementations. Only the part implemented in Java is used, while the Unix native libraries are just ignored.
#RxTx 2.0 in order to have a different provider below the generic generic JavaComm version than the ones comming with the JavaComm package

However, if one just wants to program against the &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt; replacement package, then 
*only RxTx 2.1 is needed.

=== Converting a JavaComm Application to RxTx ===

So, if you belong to the large group of people who have been let down by Sun when they dropped Windows support for JavaComm, you are in need to convert a JavaComm application to RxTx. As you can see from the above, there are two ways to do it. Both assume that you manage to install a version of RxTx first. Then the options are either

#Using RxTx 2.0 as a JavaComm provider
#Porting the application to RxTx 2.1

The first option has already been explained. The second option is surprisingly simple. All one has to do to port some application from using JavaComm to using RxTx 2.1 is to replace all references to &lt;code&gt;java.comm&lt;/code&gt; in the application source code with references to &lt;code&gt;gnu.io&lt;/code&gt;. If the original JavaComm application was properly written there is nothing more to do.

RxTx 2.1 even provides the tool &lt;code&gt;contrib/ChangePackage.sh&lt;/code&gt; to perform the global replacement on a source tree under Unix. On other platforms such a global replacement is easy to do with IDEs supporting a decent set of refactoring features.

{{Warning|Possession of cannabis is a crime in many countries, be sure you understand the legal position}}
==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] finely ground pure [[Cookbook:Marijuana|cannabis]] 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]] powder
*5 tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|sugar]]


==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to 200º Celsius.
#Grease a non-stick baking tray or use non-stick wax paper to cover base.
#Place butter and sugar in a bowl and combine till you have a thick batter.
#Add flour, baking powder, cannabis and cocoa powder and combine with small amounts of water at a time till smooth. If adding any of the additional ingredients, add now.
#Using a table spoon place a scoop of batter on tray, 0.5&quot; apart from each other and sides of the tray.
#Place tray in oven and allow to bake for 10 to 20 minutes, until center is cooked. (Pricking a toothpick in the center will let you know, if the batter sticks to the pick, it's not ready yet).
#Remove from oven, and allow to cool down.

==Optional Suggestions==
Add one or more of the following to the dry ingredients, before adding the water:
*1 capful [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] essence.
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]] (goes well with the mint).
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] flakes. (an additional 2 tbsp of butter and 1/4 cup water may be needed)
*1 tot of Kaluha, [[Cookbook:Rum|rum]] or sweet [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]].
You may also wish to replace the standard butter or margarine with [[Cookbook:Puna butter|THC butter]].
The cocoa powder may be omitted from the recipe if you prefer a chocolate-free version.

Navigation  comprises everything a robot needs to get from point A to point B as efficient as possible without bumping into furniture, walls or people.

This problem breaks down in several sub-problems:
*It needs to know [[/Localization|where (Localization)]] it is.
*It needs to [[/Collision Avoidance|detect and avoid obstacles (Collision Avoidance)]].
*It needs memory of [[/Mapping|its surroundings (Mapping)]].
*It has to be able to [[/Trajectory Planning|plan a route (Trajectory Planning)]] to point B.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Localization involves one question: Where is the robot now? Or, robo-centrically, where am I, keeping in mind that &quot;here&quot; is relative to some landmark (usually the point of origin or the destination) and that you are never lost if you don't care where you are.

Although a simple question, answering it isn't easy, as the answer is different depending on the characteristics of your robot. Localization techniques that work fine for one robot in one environment may not work well or at all in another environment. For example, localizations which work well in an outdoors environment may be useless indoors.

All localization techniques generally provide two basic pieces of information: 
*what is the current location of the robot in some environment?
*what is the robot's current orientation in that same environment?

The first could be in the form of Cartesian or Polar coordinates or geographic latitude and longitude. The latter could be a combination of roll, pitch and yaw or a compass heading.

==Current Location==
The current location of a robot can be determined in several very different ways:

==Dead Reckoning==
Dead reckoning uses odometry to measure how far the robot moves. Trigonometry and the equations of kinematics are all that is needed to calculate its new position.

This method has 2 requirements:
*It needs a way to determine its initial location.
*Its accuracy usually decreases over time as every measurement has an error and errors accumulate.

Dead reckoning is often used with other methods to improve the overall accuracy.

==Least Mean Squares==

There are numerous solutions to the localization robotics problem.  These range from simple Dead Reckoning methods to advanced algorithms with expensive radar or vision system.  The most important factor is picking an algorithm to find the robotic location is the availability of accurate relative and global position data.  For simple systems with basic relative position sensors and some form of a global position sensor, the most practical and easiest to implement localization method is that of Least Mean Squares.

See Least Squares: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares for more information on using the method of Least Squares to find solutions for over determined systems.

To look at the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm in a general sense first, it is important to look at the general principles that govern it.  The goal of all localization methods is to minimize the error between where the robot is and where the robot should be.  The algorithm must be able to follow a preset track or find the least error in the robot location (Adaptive Algorithms and Structures, p. 97).  These goals for robot localization are applied to the LMS algorithm by adaptively adjusting weights to minimize the error between the actual function and the function generated by the LMS algorithm.  As a subset of the Steepest Descent Algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), this method was created to minimize the error by estimating the gradient (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) and is known as the simplest localization method with global position output.

===Derivation of LMS Algorithm===
  	
The LMS algorithm can be applied to two cases:

•	Parallel multiple inputs

•	Series single input

[[File:LinearCombinerConfiguration.jpg]]

Figure 1: Linear Combiner Configuration  [1]		

[[File:CurveFit.jpg]]

Figure 2: Curve Fit to Data to Minimize Error  [3]	

[[File:TransversalCombinerConfiguration.jpg]]
 
Figure 3: Transversal Combiner Configuration  [1]

In both cases, the gradient is calculated as 

ε&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; - X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

where  ‘Y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;’ is the desired output, ‘X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;’ is the actual input, and ‘W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;’ for the kth input element.  Next, the gradient estimate is calculated as
 
Now that we have the gradient estimate, the weights can be updated by

W&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; - μdel&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; + 2με&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

to minimize the error through iterative change.  ‘μ ’ is the gain constant for training the algorithm.  The use of training is to adjust how fast the error is corrected for by the weight update function [1].  If the training constant is too high, the system will oscillate and never converge to the minimal error value.	

To illustrate the process other than in mathematical format, the LMS algorithm can be demonstrated through the use of pseudo code.  The purpose of the code below is for illustration purposes only.  This example is intended to provide a step-by-step visualization tool for beginning the coding process.

===Procedure LMS===
Initialize the Weights
repeat
choose training pair (x,d)
for all k do
    y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;	 
end
for all k do
    ε&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = Y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; - d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; 
end
for all k do
    W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(j+1) = W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(j) + με&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;
end
until termination condition reached

===Various Variations===


'''Modified LMS Method'''

For problems with sequentially arriving data, the Modified LS method can be used to add or delete rows of data.  In various time-series problems, a moving ‘window’ can be employed to evaluate data over a predefined timeframe.  This method is useful in LMS problems that arise in statistics, optimization, and signal processing [2].

'''Constrained LMS Method'''

For curve and surface fitting application problems, the Constrained LMS method is very useful.  Such problems require satisfying linear equations systems with various unknowns.  This method only provides a useful solution if and only if each input can be scaled by some magnitude and still remains a constant [2].

'''Direct Methods for Sparse problems'''

A sparse LMS problem involves solving the LMS problem when the matrix has ‘relatively few’ nonzero elements.  “J. H. Wilkinson defined a sparse matrix to be ‘any matrix with enough zeros that it pays to take advantage of them’” [2].  A more precise definition is more difficult to provide.  Such problem usually involve large to enormous size and involve numerous unknowns.  The following are examples of problem that can be classified as sparse problems: pattern matching, cluster analysis, and surface fitting [2].

'''Iterative Methods for LMS problems'''

A second method for solving sparse problems (in addition to the Direct Method mentioned above) is the Iterative Method.  In general, the Iterative Method is used for analysis of under-determined, sparse problems to compute a minimum solution based on the norm of the input data [2].

'''Nonlinear LMS Method'''

For problems with nonlinear systems, the Nonlinear LMS method is useful for iteratively calculating the relative LMS solution to the problem.  This method can be used for unconstrained optimization and various survey methods [2].

==GPS Global Positioning System==
On large terrains GPS can provide more or less accurate coordinates, dead reckoning and the data from its other sensors can fill in the gaps. However on small terrains or indoors the GPS's inaccuracy becomes a problem and the dead reckoning and sensor data becomes the dominant factor in determining the location.

==GPS-like Systems==
Although GPS isn't very useful indoors, similar techniques as those used in GPS can be used indoors. All a robot needs is to measure it's distance to 3 fixed beacons. Each of these distances describe a circle with the beacon in its center. 3 circles will only intersect in one point.

==Line following==
Probably the easiest way: Draw a line on the ground and use IR reflection sensors to follow it. Useful as a track or to mark the edges of the robot's work area.

This can also be done by putting an electric cable in the ground and sending a modulated signal through it. The robot can detect this cable with magnetic sensors (Hall-sensors or coils).

The complex versions of line-following involves using sensors like vision (camera) which helps reducing overall cost of sensors and implementation and also provides versatility to detect lines of various colours. It allows a great scope for autonomy in the system too.

==Landmarks==
Placing landmarks is another way to help your robot to navigate through its environment. Landmarks can be active beacons (IR or sound) or passive (reflectors). Using bar code scanners is another possibility.

A special trick, if the environment is known beforehand, is to use collision detection (i.e. sensor bumpers or similar) with known objects. Together with dead reckoning the precision can be extraordinary even when using cheap equipment.

In new environments landmarks often need to be determined by the robot itself. Through the use of sensor data collected by laser, sonar or camera, specific landmark types (e.g. walls, doors, corridors) can be recognised and used for localization.

==Current Heading==
Determining a robot's heading can be done with a compass sensor. These sensors usually consist of 2 magnetic field sensors placed at a 90° angle. 

These sensors measure the earth's magnetic field and can be influenced by other magnetic fields. Speakers, transformers, electric cables and refrigerator magnets can reduce the accuracy of the compass. Compass sensor modules can have built-in filtering for the magnetic fields of AC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Collision avoidance, in comparison to collision detection, is what is done after a possible collision is detected. Possible collisions will depend on the shape and size of both the object and robot as well as the position and motion projection of the object and the robot. When making an attempt to avoid an obstacle, there are many decisions to face. The decisions available depend on the available paths the robot can take to avoid the obstruction. These paths can either be determined upon the robot’s realization of the obstruction or, in case all of the obstructions’ positions are known, once the map is loaded. Finding the “correct” path to use can be troublesome depending on which algorithm is used and the granularity associated with it. 

==Basic Idea==

''If there is an object in the robot’s way, avoid it.''

Essentially, this is the basic idea in collision avoidance. However, this simple matter to humans is incredibly complex in the computer world. Which algorithm is best in avoiding obstacles? Which is least complex, most efficient? Which algorithm can utilize the robot’s full capabilities effectively? All of these are questions one should ask when searching for a valuable collision avoidance algorithm.

==Example Algorithm==

[[Image:Figure1.GIF|thumb|250 px|Example algorithm being put to use using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player/Stage_Project Player/Stage]]]

In the figure to the right, a simple “tank-drive” robot is presented making it’s way to three pre-determined waypoints. The robot’s algorithm is a dignified version of the simple one-liner given at the beginning of this section:

#Turn to the nearest waypoint if there is one left.
##If there is no waypoint left, stop.
##Move toward the nearest waypoint.
#If there is something in the way:
##Go around it.
##After every 1.5 body lengths, go to step 1.
#If the robot has reached the waypoint:
##Remove the reached waypoint from the list.
##Go to step 1.

Albeit this algorithm works well for an over-simplified map where all obstacles are simple geometric shapes, in more complex scenarios it may not fare as well. For instance, nestling a waypoint in the middle of a U-shaped obstacle would cause this algorithm to never end.

==Major Problem==
With robots having greater and greater importance in our everyday lives, it is no wonder that collision avoidance (particularly dealing with human safety) is becoming an increasingly greater concern. Such concerns are not to be taken lightly. There is already one death associated with roboticide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4337-smart-software-helps-robots-dodge-collisions.html| title=Smart software helps robots dodge collisions| author=Duncan Graham-Rowe |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition to safety, other concerns can be generated:
*Collision Avoidance Algorithmic Complexity
*Computer Power
*Sensor Accuracy / Throughput
*Sensor Data Interpretation

Of course, as the algorithmic complexity of the collision avoidance algorithm increases, so does the required computer power. Some researchers are even finding it beneficial to use multiple processors in parallel (parallel processing) to “divide and conquer” such problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jminguez/810.pdf| title=A “Divide and Conquer” Strategy based on Situations to achieve Reactive Collision Avoidance in Troublesome Scenarios| author=Javier Minguez, Javier Osuna, Luis Montano |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sensor accuracy and throughput is becoming less a threat to successful collision avoidance. However, this doesn’t mean it is non-existent. During the process of engineering a collision-avoiding robot, trade-offs can be made that could potentially compromise the effectiveness of the sensors in how the robot behaves.

==Detection vs. Avoidance==
Collision detection is simply the act of surveying the known vicinity of the robot and detecting the presence (or absence) of a possible collision. In order for a robot to avoid a collision, a collision must first be detected. Without collision detection, it doesn’t seem reasonable to have collision avoidance because there wouldn’t be anything to avoid (in the robot’s scope).

Collision avoidance is the plan for action the robot takes to evade the oncoming collision. As previously stated, there is no need for collision avoidance if there are no collisions to avoid.

==Collision Avoidance Algorithms==

===Quad Trees===
The use of quad trees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=00506853| title=A Comprehensive Robot Collision Avoidance Scheme by Two-Dimensional Geometric Modeling| author=Sabyasachi Ghoshray, K.K. Yen |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for a simple collision avoidance algorithm. An approximation technique used here uses a type of data structure called a quad tree. A quad tree is similar to that of a binary tree except that a quad tree has four child nodes for each parent instead of just two.

Each child node is represented by a square of pixels in a “top-down” image of the robot’s surrounding landscape. Each square simply acts as a binary answer to the question, “Is there any possibility for a collision inside of this square?” If the answer is yes, then the square is avoided, otherwise, the square is noted for safe travel. An example of this is given in the figure below.

[[Image:Figure3.PNG|thumb|250 px|Approximation of a triangle using squares.]]

====Advantages====
An advantage to using this algorithm is that retreating can be done fairly easily – by climbing back up the tree and trying a different approach. Of course, in a case where all of the obstacles have been found, a minimal path can easily be created using simple distance algorithms.

====Disadvantages====
A disadvantage to using this algorithm is that, due to the granularity of each square of pixels, it is possible for the obstacles to be close enough such that a robot wouldn’t notice that it could actually fit through a gap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To find routes efficiently a robot has to know it's surroundings. Maps can be very handy for this. Either the robot has the memory and tools for it and draws its own map, gets its map in advance or get a partial map (e.g. only walls) and adds the other obstacles to it itself.

*Getting the map in advance works fine in a static environment.
*The partial map is a more efficient approach as it already contains all the static parts of the ''world''.
*Working from scratch is the best approach when the robot is often placed in new environments.

Drawing a map has 2 major issues:
*Not all elements in the surroundings are stationary. Most sensors are too limited to measure directly if the obstacle is a wall, a chair or a person. A method for solving this issue is to use a &quot;score&quot; for each obstacle measured. Add to the score if the object is detected again when the robot passes the same location.
*Localization isn't perfect. Small accumulating errors can make it hard to determine the exact location of the robot and therefor can make it hard to find where a detected obstacle has to be noted on the map. One solution to this problem is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which corrects the location of detected objects based on the estimated error of the robots location.

A third minor issue is memory. On a robot build without a computer memory is limited and storing an entire map can be next to impossible.
If you have the memory the map can be stored in different ways:
*2D array: Easy and fast to access, very wasteful with memory.
*linked list: slower to use, more efficient with memory.
*Quadtree: faster than linked list, much harder to implement, very efficient with memory.

Implementing these structures on a PC is reasonably easy, however constructing them in a limited environment as a microcontroller is a serious challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Trajectory Planning==
Trajectory planning is moving from point A to point B while avoiding collisions over time.  This can be
computed in both discrete and continuous methods.  Trajectory planning is a major area in robotics as it 
gives way to autonomous vehicles.

Trajectory planning is sometimes referred to as motion planning and erroneously as path planning.  
Trajectory planning is distinct from path planning in that it is parametrized by time.  Essentially 
trajectory planning encompasses path planning in addition to planning how to move based on velocity, 
time, and kinematics.

===Problem Constraints===

====Holonomicity====
Holonomicity is the relationship between the controllable degrees of freedom of the robot and the total 
degrees of freedom of the robot.  If the number of controllable degrees of freedom are greater than or 
equal to the total degrees of freedom a robot is said to be holonomic.  By using a holonomic robot many 
movements are much easier to make and returning to a past pose is much easier.

A car would be non-holonomic, as it has no way to move laterally.  This makes certain movements, such 
as parallel parking, difficult.  An example of a holonomic vehicle would be one using mecanum wheels, 
such as the new Segway RMP.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dynamic Environments====
In dynamic environments, such as the real world, many possible collision objects are not stationary.  
This makes trajectory planning more difficult as time is constantly changing and objects are moving.  A 
robot cannot simply move backwards in time as it might simply back away from a stationary collision.  
In addition to this many choices are completely irreversible due to terrain, such as moving off of a cliff.

===Concepts===
[[Image:Concepts.png|thumb|Concepts of Trajectory Planning]] 
Trajectory planning gives a path from a starting configuration S to a goal configuration G avoiding 
collisions in a 2D or 3D space.

A configuration is the pose of a robot describing its position.  Configuration Space C, is the set of all 
configurations.  For instance in two dimensions a robot's configuration would be described by 
coordinates (x, y) and angle θ.  Whereas in three dimensions a robot's configuration would be described 
by coordinates (x, y, z) and angles (α, β, γ).

Free space C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all configurations that are collision free.  Computing the 
shape of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; is not effecient, however computing if a given configuration is collision 
free is by simply using kinematics and collision detection from sensors.

===Planning Algorithms===

====Potential Field Planning====
[[Image:Potential-field.png|thumb|Example of a Potential Field]] 
Potential Field Planning places values over the map with the goal having the lowest value raising the 
value depending on the distance from the goal.  Obstacles are defined to have an incredibly high value.  
The robot then simply moves to the lowest potential value adjacent to it, which should lead it to the 
goal.  However this technique often gets trapped in local minima.  Certain techniques can be used to 
avoid this, such as wavefront potential field planning.

====Sampling Based Planning====
Roadmap method is one sampling based planning method.  First a sample of N configurations in C as milestones.  Then a line PQ is formed between all milestones as long as the line PQ is completely in 
C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then graph search algorithms can be used to find a path from start to the goal.  
As N grows better solutions are found, however this increases computation time.

====Grid Based Planning====
[[Image:Grid_based.png|thumb|Example of Grid Based Planning]] 
Grid Based planning overlays a grid on the map.  Every configuration then corresponds with a grid pixel.  
The robot can move from one grid pixel to any adjacent grid pixels as long as that grid pixel is in 
C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then a search algorithm such as A* can be used to find a path to get from start to 
the goal.  One potential tradeoff with this method is with a lower resolution grid(bigger pixels) the 
search will be faster, however it may miss paths through narrow spaces of C&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;.  In 
addition as the resolution of the grid increases memory usage increases exponentially, therefore in 
large areas using another path planning algorithm may be necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Pazzah, good idea of starting an EM textbook! I'm mainly into internal medicine, but if there are any topics you'd like me to cover, please drop me a line on the English Wikipedia. I'd love to do some acute metabolic disturbances and liver disease-related pages. I also like haematology. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 15:00, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Hi Pazzah, I'm the guy who got the Wikibooks site going. I was working in an emergency room in Ohio for a while, and volunteering at a Red Cross facility in Mexico City, before the docs convinced me not to study medicine like I was thinking. Anyway I am very excited that you are doing this work here, this is the very type of work that I had in mind when I got the page started. Thank you and let me know if you need help at any time (although the technical guys have taken over and sometimes I don't know what is going on). --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 17:29, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Dr. Lovett, I made some additions to the [[EM]] book, a table of contents and some boilerplate information. Also I noticed a new website dedicated to everything medical:

http://www.wikimd.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

Maybe a place for a medical encyclopedia, while the medical textbooks go here.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to be of service.--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 18:49, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Paris:

I haven't quite figured out where 'Talk' goes, but this seems active.

I hope the talk went well at SAEM.  I understand it was today.  I am in Tucson and pretty much disconnectewd for a few days - I'll be back in Houston and connected Wed evening.

I started a little experiment with 'Templates' thinking of the variations in structure which may be useful.

First I discovered the 'Template' means something different in Wiki stuff - a fixed text that can be replicated on many pages, such as the disclaimer and is invoked with double brackets.  I thought PageStencil might be a good alternate terminology for us to use as a page/article structure such as you laid out for general articles.

It semed to me those headings generally work for disease oriented chapters.

I started thinking of a low level kind of page that relates one-to-one with a good EM refernce paper. Abstracts are available in PubMed and are linkable now by using simply PMID 15635313 amd Wiki creates a link to PubMed  - pretty nice.

However, most papers of interest will also need a summary of significance and a little better idea of content to be useful.  Full text is spotty and the WIkibook will allow a digestion of the significance of a paper and links to all sorts of related information.

I thought I would start with the 20 papers in ABEM's LLSA  - for 2004 and 2005 as useful paoers of inbterest to many.

I started playing with naming the paper with the PMID - a canonic form for summaries of one paper so is would be easy to prevent duplication, but that may not be necessary and may be confusing.

Then I encountered some kind if WIki Form-Nazi's who put my pages on a list for Speedy Deletion - not a very friendly approach to cooperative development.  They apparently proceeeded to delete my pages, experimantal as they were.  I learned to keep a copy of the source offline as the pages were deleted and I do not see a means to roll back the deletions.

So, welcome to Wiki world, Kirt.

Another structure may be a drug page for each drug-  a focus or rapid lookup by drug name which should link to all the relevant other places - contexts where the drug or class of drugs may appear.

Another subject of interest will be how to optimally use categories to lump and split things in a useful and user-intuitive manner.

As soon as I feel comfortable with the structure and feeding of WikiBooks, I will try to write a short tutorial introduction for EM authors to break them in relatively painlessly.

== Nice book structure ==

Paris,

I really like the structure of your book. I started a [[Human physiology]] book as a class project 7 weeks ago. I think you will agree that it is impressive what a small group of students can do in a couple of months (especially when they are getting graded on it!). I thought I would invite you to browse our book, make any corrections or improvements you like, and give us any insights from the field. My students are beginning pre-nursing students, and the class is introductory physiology. If there is something you learned in your beginning physiology class that proved particularly useful, or if there is something you wish you had learned, I would be very interested in hearing about it so we can be sure it is in our book. 

Good luck with your book. If you have a chance, I recommend getting an EMT class to contribute to your book as part of the class. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 23:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pazzah. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pazzah~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

__TOC__
== Description ==

'''''Function overloading''''' (also ''method overloading'') is a programming concept that allows programmers to define two or more functions with the same name.

Each function has a unique signature (or header), which is derived from:

# function/procedure name
# number of arguments
# arguments' type
# arguments' order
# arguments' name
# return type

Please note: Not all above signature options are available in all programming languages.

| style=&quot;background:LightCoral;&quot; | no
| style=&quot;background:LightCoral;&quot; | no
|}

Warning: Function overloading is often confused with function overriding. In Function overloading, a function with a different signature is created, adding to the pool of available functions. In function overriding, however, a function with the same signature is declared, replacing the old function in the context of the new function.

== Demonstration ==

Since functions' names are in this case the same, we must preserve uniqueness of signatures, by changing something from the '''''parameter list''''' (last three alienees).

If the functions' signatures are sufficiently different, the compiler can distinguish which function was intended to be used at each occurrence. This process of searching for the appropriate function is called '''''function resolution''''' and can be quite an intensive one, especially if there are a lot of equally named functions.

Programming languages supporting implicit type conventions usually use promotion of arguments (i.e. type casting of integer to floating-point) when there is no exact function match. The demotion of arguments is rarely used.

When two or more functions match the criteria in function resolution process, an '''''ambiguity error''''' is reported by compiler. Adding more information to compiler by editing the source code (using for example type casting), can address such doubts.

The example code shows how function overloading can be used. As functions do practically the same thing, it makes sense to use function overloading.

  '''function''' ''int'' generateNumber(''int'' MaxValue) {
    '''return''' rand * MaxValue
  }
 
  '''function''' ''int'' generateNumber(''int'' MinValue, ''int'' MaxValue) {
    '''return''' MinValue + rand * (MaxValue - MinValue)
  }

=== calling the first function ===

The first code block will generate numbers from 0 up to specified parameter ''MaxValue''. The appropriate function call is:

  ''int'' Number :- generateNumber(10)

=== calling the second function ===

The second requires another parameter ''MinValue''. Function will return numbers above or equals ''MinValue'' and lower than ''MaxValue''.

  ''int'' Number := generateNumber(6, 10)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the Sets chapter should be before the Graph chapter because the Graph interface could benefit from returning edge sets and node sets from its functions. What needs to be changed to accomplish this? --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 16:31, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:We should stick with the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations for graphs and present them before sets. A disjoint set will be radically different and is more advanced of a topic (and requires knowledge of trees; further, some non-disjoint sets should be efficient search trees themselves). To iterate over the edges requires only an edge iterator accessor. I suppose here, though, the design of BFS and DFS should dictate what will really be useful for the graphs chapter. We should simplify some of these interfaces and move closer to the Java version than the C++ library. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:05, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this lesson, we will learn how to create and modify files.  In doing so, we will create a portion of a text editor to handle reading and writing files to and from disk - the program won't be complete by the end of this chapter, but will be finished within Advanced Text Output. 

Let's start by setting up out main procedure:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
'$DYNAMIC
ON ERROR GOTO handler ' Prepares the error handler
DIM text(50) AS STRING ' Used to contain the text file.
maxlines = 50 ' Contains the current size of the buffer.

DO
  CLS 'clears the screen
  INPUT &quot;Would you like to create a (N)ew file, (L)oad an existing one, or (E)xit the program&quot;; choice$

  SELECT CASE UCASE$(choice$) 'UCASE$ converts strings to UPPER CASE
    CASE &quot;N&quot; 'New file
    CASE &quot;L&quot; 'Load a file
    CASE &quot;E&quot; 'Exit
      CLS
      END
  END SELECT
LOOP 'returns to the top of the program.

handler:
errorflag = ERR  ' Keep track of the error that occurred.
RESUME NEXT ' Proceeds with the next statement.  
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, we are using &lt;tt&gt;CASE&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;IF&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt;IF&lt;/tt&gt; statements can sometimes work better than case statements, but for now, we want to avoid ''spaghetti code'' (where there are too many &lt;tt&gt;GOTO&lt;/tt&gt;'s).

So far, we don't really have much, but it's a start.  We've asked the user what they want to do, and finished 1/3 options.  Not so shabby when you put it that way!

== The OPEN statement ==

The open statement allows either reading or writing information from the disk.  In general, the open statement follows this pattern:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
OPEN file$ FOR INPUT AS 1
OPEN file$ FOR OUTPUT AS 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;file$&lt;/tt&gt; determines the filename to use.  The &lt;tt&gt;FOR&lt;/tt&gt; portion indicates how the file will be accessed or operated - it may be APPEND, BINARY, INPUT, OUTPUT, and RANDOM.  The &lt;tt&gt;AS #&lt;/tt&gt; is the identifier used for the file handle in question - this may be a variable if desired.  

{{NOTE|If you allow the user to enter a filename that does not exist on disk, you need to implement error handling using &lt;tt&gt;ON ERROR&lt;/tt&gt; to react to this situation.}} 

== Input and output ==

When you need to access or write content to a file handle, the PRINT and INPUT statements expect a file handle to appear as the first parameter:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 INPUT #1, a$
 PRINT #2, a$
&lt;/source&gt;

In some cases, you need to detect if you are going to reach the end of file - this is performed by the EOF function, which accepts a filehandle that takes input.

== Reading the file from disk ==

We will now add a subroutine to read the complete file from disk, as lines of text, into an string array called text(). It is also possible to read a data file full of numerical values (and input these into a number array), however that is a different topic.

Note the code that finds the file 'size', by reading lines one at a time until the End Of File is reached, and the use of 'SEEK' to 'rewind' to the beginning again.

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
SUB LoadFile
  SHARED filename$
  SHARED lines, maxlines
  SHARED text() AS STRING
  SHARED errorflag
    
  INPUT &quot;Enter filename: &quot;; filename$

  OPEN filename$ FOR INPUT AS 1
  IF errorflag &lt;&gt; 0 THEN
    errorflag = 0
    CLOSE
    PRINT &quot;File not found - press return to continue.&quot;
    INPUT &quot;&quot;, a$
    EXIT SUB
  END IF

  ' Count the number of lines.
  lines = 0
  DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
    LINE INPUT #1, l$
    lines = lines + 1
  LOOP

  'Allocate enough space for input. 
  IF maxlines &gt; lines THEN
    REDIM text(lines + 25) AS STRING
    maxlines = lines + 25
  END IF
  SEEK #1, 1 ' Rewind to the beginning of the file.

  ' Read the lines into the buffer
  FOR cline = 1 TO lines
    LINE INPUT #1, text(cline)
  NEXT
  CLOSE 1
  errorflag = 0

END SUB

&lt;/source&gt;
The example above treats the file as type=text. If the file contains numbers (for example, a data array of N integers per line x M lines) these can be read (input #) one at a time, directly into a numeric array. Input will read the numbers one at a time, 'stopping' after each is input. Numbers can be separated by 'anything' (so lines of text will be skipped).

== Writing a file to the disk ==

The function for writing a file to disk is easier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;
SUB SaveFile (outfile$)
  SHARED filename$
  SHARED lines, maxlines
  SHARED text() AS STRING
  SHARED errorflag
  
  IF outfile$ = &quot;&quot; THEN
    LOCATE 1, 1
    INPUT &quot;Enter filename: &quot;; outfile$
  END IF

  OPEN outfile$ FOR OUTPUT AS 1
  IF errorflag &lt;&gt; 0 THEN
    errorflag = 0
    CLOSE
    PRINT &quot;Couldn't save file - press return to continue.&quot;
    INPUT &quot;&quot;, a$
    EXIT SUB
  END IF

  ' Write each line to the file
  FOR cline = 1 TO lines
    PRINT #1, text(cline)
  NEXT

  CLOSE 1
  errorflag = 0
  filename$ = outfile$

END SUB
&lt;/source&gt;

===[[QBasic/Files/2|Part 2: New file]]===
In order to create a new file, you have to open it for OUTPUT, then close it.
Example:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
OPEN NEWFILE FOR OUTPUT AS #1
CLOSE #1
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' If you accidently open an existing file, all of its contents will be overwritten!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Julie,

I am willing to contribute.  However, at the moment TC 211 is in the process of revising ISO 19111, based on the work done in OGC.  I am on the Editing Committee, which has just completed a two-day meeting going through all the comments received.  This has led to some (not many) changes in the model (minor change really) and in terminology.  I think the cookbook should reflect these changes, in order to be up-to-date.
Some of the changes to the document taken off-line affect some of the explanatory text.  I consider this explanatory text a prime candidate to include in this cookbook.

Roel,

Thank you for your willingness to participate.  I want the chapter to be consistent with ISO 19111 concepts and terminology, wherever possible.  The purpose of the chapter is to provide high level information for a basic understanding of global coordinate reference systems (e.g., WGS 84, ITRFxx/GRS80) and case studies from different regions and countries of the world about the challenges of tying their datums to global coordinate reference systems.   I think that such a chapter would be of benefit to developing countries or regions who are updating their national datums to tie into WGS 84 or ITRFxx/GRS 80.

Regards,
Julie


Julie,

As said we (Editing Committtee) are in the process of editing the original OGC document, which contained descriptions mainly from my hand.  Roger Lott and I are now editing the texts after which they need to be offered to the EC again.
This means I would like to hang on until these texts are considered (reasonably) final.

It is not quite clear to me what you mean by &quot;case studies&quot;.  Do you mean some examples to show how you actually define such a coordinate reference system and how you transform coordinates from one system to e.g. WGS 84 or ITRF xx?

&lt;/table&gt;

==The RGB Colours Program ==
This program shows you the RGB colours. You can change the values of each colour from 0 - 255 and you will see the special mixed colour, when you hit the commandbutton. 

Out of 3 decimal numbers, one hexadecimal number is build as a string using the following code: 

 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;

To get the program going , you will need 1 commandbutton, 1 drawingarea, 3 textboxes and 3 textlabels. 

What does it look like? See it here ( in German ) 
http://www.madeasy.de/7/prgfarbergb.htm

The Code: 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM sHex AS String
 DIM r AS Integer
 DIM g AS Integer
 DIM b AS Integer
 IF Textbox1.text = &quot;&quot; THEN Textbox1.Text = 0 
 IF Textbox2.text = &quot;&quot; THEN Textbox2.Text = 0 
 IF Textbox3.text = &quot;&quot; THEN Textbox3.Text = 0 
 r = Val(Textbox1.Text)
 g = Val(Textbox2.Text)
 b = Val(Textbox3.Text)
 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 DrawingArea1.BackColor = Val(sHEX)
 END 

==The Sunset Program ==

When you need a background for a program, you can use this little color sunset program. 

You will need a drawing area on your form to get the program going. You can choose different colours when you use the following scheme: 

Blue RGB(0, 0, i) Red RGB(i, 0, 0) Green RGB(0, i, 0) Yellow RGB(i, i, 0) Violett RGB(i, 0, i) Türkis RGB(0, i, i) Gray RGB(i, i, i) 

What does it look like ? 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 DIM r AS Integer
 DIM g AS Integer
 DIM b AS Integer
 DIM h AS Integer
 DIM he AS Integer
 DIM sHex AS String
 r = 0
 g = 0
 FOR b = 0 TO 255 
 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 Draw.begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Forecolor= Val(sHEX)
 Draw.LineWidth=5
 he = DrawingArea1.Height
 h = he * b \ 255
 Draw.Line(0, h, DrawingArea1.Width, h)
 Draw.End
 NEXT
 END

You can make the program better, when you add the following code and change the border of the form to Resizeable. 

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Resize()
 DrawingArea1.Move(0, 0, ME.ClientWidth, ME.ClientHeight)
 END

==The Spectrum program==
The natural colour spectrum is shown in the following program using a slidebar. 

You need a drawing area and a slidebar as controls.

 ' Gambas class file
 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 drawingarea1.BackColor = &amp;HC2020C&amp;
 scrollbar1.minvalue = 1
 scrollbar1.maxvalue = 1120
 END
 PUBLIC SUB ScrollBar1_Change()
 drawingarea1.BackColor = Val(spektrum(scrollbar1.value))
 END
 PUBLIC FUNCTION spektrum(ss AS Integer) AS String
 x AS Integer
 sHEX AS String
 s AS Integer 
 r AS Integer
 g AS Integer
 b AS Integer
 s = 0
 FOR x = 1  TO 255
 'red to yellow
 r = 255
 b = 0
 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(x,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 s = s + 1 
 'PRINT s
 IF s = ss THEN RETURN sHEX
 NEXT
 's = 255
 FOR x = 255  TO 1 STEP -1
 'from yellow to green 
 g = 255
 b = 0
 sHEX = Hex$(x,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 s = s + 1 
 'PRINT s
 IF s = ss THEN RETURN sHEX
 NEXT
 's = 510
 FOR x = 1  TO 255
 'from green to cyan 
 r = 0
 g = 255
 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(x,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 s = s + 1 
 'PRINT s
 IF s = ss THEN RETURN sHEX
 NEXT
 's = 765
 FOR x = 255  TO 1 STEP - 1
 'from cyan to blue 
 r = 0
 b = 255
 sHEX = Hex$(r,2) &amp; Hex$(x,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 s = s + 1 
 'PRINT s
 IF s = ss THEN RETURN sHEX
 NEXT
 's = 1020
 b = 255
 FOR x = 1  TO 100
 'from blue to violett
 g = 0
 sHEX = Hex$(x,2) &amp; Hex$(g,2) &amp; Hex$(b,2)
 sHEX = &quot;&amp;H&quot; &amp; sHEX &amp; &quot;&amp;&quot;
 b = b - 2
 s = s + 1 
 'PRINT s
 'PRINT shex
 IF s = ss THEN RETURN sHEX
 NEXT  
 's = 1120
 END

Maybe you can change the program, so that the colour value is shown in a textbox. 
1. Get a textbox out of the toolbox.
2. Add the following code 
 textbox1.text = spektrum(scrollbar1.value)
in the part  PUBLIC SUB ScrollBar1_Change()

A good program has comments.
They are very helpful to others trying to understand the program.
When the program is compiled, all the comments are skipped.
You can make comments as long as you want.

The difference between Gambas comments and VB comments is that Gambas has no such command as REM. '''Use the apostrophe''' instead.
 
'Apostrophe works.
Rem does not.

Comments begin with an apostrophe and continue to the end of the line. Multi-line comments are not allowed.
 
Example 
 
 'This is a comment and this is skipped during compilation.

You can comment or uncomment when you are testing a program. In the code window you can also mark some code and make a comment out of it with the shortcut '''Ctrl + K'''.
You can uncomment with '''Ctrl + U'''.

'''Poutine''' is common dish throughout the Quebec, Ontario and Atlantic regions of Canada which is made up of three items: beef [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]], [[Cookbook:French Fries|French fries]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese Curds|cheese curds]].

This recipe uses pre-canned gravy, mozzarella cheese, and fries the potatoes from scratch.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:L|L]] of vegetable oil for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]
*1 (290 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of beef gravy
*5 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*2 cups mozzarella or cheese curds

==Equipment==
*1 Deep fat fryer or large stove pot to fry the potatoes
*1 saucepan or cup suitable for warming gravy
*1 Serving dish

==Procedure==
# Slice potatoes into finger-width wedges and rinse them well to remove any dirt
# Begin warming gravy, keep the temperature low enough for a slow heating
# Heat oil to 185°C (365°F)
# Cook wedges in the oil, this should take about 5 minutes
# Remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel mat, to absorb excess oil
# Put cheese over the fries in serving dish
# Pour the gravy over the top and wait until the cheese starts to melt
* Et Voila! Vous avez une poutine.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Changing the cheese and gravy used in poutine completely changes the dynamic of the dish, a popular variant is to use a chicken or turkey based gravy with [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] instead of curds.

* Replacing gravy with [[Cookbook:Salsa | salsa]], the cheese curds with [[Cookbook:Sour Cream | sour cream]], adding diced onions and tomatoes turns poutine into mexipoutine, an item also carried by the likes of Taco Bell under the name &quot;Fries Supreme&quot;.

* Replacing the gravy with [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce | marinara sauce]], adding either loose lean ground beef or crumbled sausage and replacing the cheese curds with [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] changes the dish to poutine Italiano, not as popular as the mexipoutine alternative, but used in several fast food restaurants in Toronto, Ontario.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction: The &quot;New Right&quot;, Conservatism, and Demographic Shifts==

Ever since the 1964 election, in which the conservative Barry Goldwater failed to defeat incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, a grassroots (beginning on the local level) movement among other conservatives began growing. Slowly, a group of conservatives began changing their policies and marketing strategies until finally, President Reagan (the culmination of this movement) was elected in 1980. And so, the product of this reformation of the right wing of the political spectrum (the conservative side), became known as the '''New Right'''.

This new breed of conservatism emphasized, above all, &quot;smaller&quot; government. This entailed lowering taxes as a catalyst for increased consumer spending, and thus economic growth, at the cost of cutting governmental programs and welfare. Conservative economists pushed &quot;[[w:supply side economics|supply side economics]]&quot; and openly advocated doing away with the tax-funded welfare state created mostly by the New Deal reforms of the 40s in order to keep more money in the hands of consumers instead of the coffers of welfare programs. Additionally, while Goldwater openly opposed the involvement of religion in politics, Reagan ushered in a generation of evangelical Christian activists along with the New Right. During the 1980 election, Reagan openly expressed his commitment to his religion, and during his presidency spoke out strongly against abortion and in support of other issues dear to the religious. The New Right conservatives also notably supported a more hawkish, aggressive foreign policy in the face of communism. They mostly did away with Nixon's ''detente'' strategy in favor of a more threatening American world presence.

Meanwhile, a band of states in the south and southwest (called the &quot;Sun Belt&quot; because of their sunny climates) had been, since the 50s, experiencing growth that far outpaced the rest of the country. A number of factors contributed to this rapid relative growth. Southern states such as Florida and Texas and areas in the southwest such as southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico had year-round warm, sunny climates and large expanses of flat land suitable for building long tracts of suburban housing. With the widespread adoption of air conditioning by the 1950s, new housing in warm Sunbelt suburbs attracted those living in more seasonably cold climates, and in particular the Northeast. Retirement in the Sunbelt was also an attractive prospect to many of the elderly, and places such as southern Florida became popular places for retirees to relocate.

Simultaneously, the racially-charged phenomenon known as &quot;white flight&quot; was underway by the 1950s as an indirect result of court decisions (specifically Brown v. Board) and new laws encouraging the desegregation of urban neighborhoods. As blacks moved into predominantly white urban neighborhoods, white families, sometimes worried that as a result of desegregation property values would fall, would put their houses up for sale and move to the suburbs, which were often quieter, safer, and demographically whiter than inner cities. This contributed to the construction of suburbs around major Sunbelt cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Many families fleeing northern inner cities would eventually settle in these new suburbs. 

At the same time, the construction of long-distance, high-speed, high-capacity, limited-access roadways, such as those built as a part of Eisenhower's Interstate highway system, facilitated a lifestyle more dependent on the automobile--that is, it became practical and economical for most members of the workforce to live farther away from their jobs than they had ever lived. Whereas earlier in the century the norm had often been for workers to live near their jobs in cities and take a relatively short drive, ride public transportation, or even walk to work, in the second half of the century it became far more common to live in suburbs miles away from jobs (which often remained in dense urban areas) because expressways and inexpensive gasoline facilitated much longer commutes. As suburbs grew, so did American oil consumption. Traffic, environmental, and indirect health problems often arose as suburbs grew beyond the capacity of the infrastructure already in place. This trend would have important bearings on U.S. energy and environmental policy in the 70s and in the new millennium.

Importantly, some Sunbelt growth was also attributed to immigration from Mexico, and in places like southern California tensions would flare over the employment and taxpayer-funded welfare of illegal immigrants. Southern Florida's growth in the 70s and 80s also had a notable component of immigrants from Cuba, which fell to communism in 1959.

California experienced the greatest growth and surpassed New York as the most populous state, as did Texas (which became the second most populous state). Florida also exhibited very rapid growth. The Sun Belt was (and still generally is, with the notable exception of California and to a lesser extent Florida) committed to conservatism, and in part contributed to Nixon's and Reagan's electoral successes. The growth of this region was at the expense of the Northern cities. The effects of this period on cities are discussed in the final section of this chapter.

Other important demographic shifts were taking place during this period as well. Beginning in the early 60s, fertility rates began a sharp decline from an average of almost four children per family in the late 50s to an average of less than two by the 70s, signaling the end of the post-war baby boom and the birth of what is widely known as &quot;Generation X,&quot; the generation that came of age during the 80s and early 90s. This relative drop in fertility rates would later have extremely important repercussions for Social Security, Medicare, and the U.S. health care system as a whole.

==Ford and Rockefeller==

The world watched as Gerald Ford turned back towards the White House after seeing off former President Nixon in his helicopter. There, he took the oath of office and became the thirty eighth president of the United States. Washington was relieved to put the Watergate crisis behind it. He appointed Nelson Rockefeller, a popular Republican and the former governor of New York, as his Vice President. Many were excited of what would come of Ford's presidency.

===Controversy===

One of Ford's first acts in office would shatter the nation's trust. Using executive powers granted to him by the Constitution, Ford granted Nixon a pardon, on September 8, 1974, for any misconduct he may have exhibited as president. Even though Ford fiercely defended his actions, he never regained the popularity that he had in his first days in office. Many believed that Nixon and Ford had worked out a bargain in advance, with Nixon's resignation in exchange for a pardon from Ford.

Later that year, it was leaked to the American public that the CIA had been spying and keeping secret files on legitimate American citizens. Months later, it was leaked that the FBI was doing the same thing. Ford appointed a commission to investigate the inner workings of the two agencies. He, with the help of Congress, passed legislation to keep the agencies in check.

After recovering some trust, the President would again stir up controversy. He offered amnesty, or protection from the law, to those who had avoided the draft or deserted during the Vietnam War. While many approved, others did not, believing that the policy was far too lenient; after all, their loved ones had obeyed the law.

===Foreign Affairs===

Ford did not have major diplomatic experience, so he relied on Kissinger, who continued Nixon's policies. In 1974, Ford met with Brezhnev to again discuss nuclear weapons. In July 1975, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, a pledge between the western world and the Soviet Union to respect human rights. Ford also continued to work with China. The Chinese communist leader, Mao Zedong, died in 1976, and a more moderate, centrist government came to power. As a result, the U.S. and China continued to move closer.
Ford’s main issues during his presidency were the North Vietnamese victory over South Vietnam (1975), the Mayaguez Incident, Detente and human rights policy, the Middle East crisis, Arab oil power, and the first international economic summits. His actions to re-assert U.S. ability and prestige following the collapse of Cambodia and the humiliating Fall of Saigon in South Vietnam were energetic. On May 12, 1975, the American Merchant Marine ship, S.S. Mayaguez, with 39 crewmen aboard, was captured in international waters by Cambodian gunboats. The ship was retrieved and all crewmen were saved, but at the cost of 41 American servicemen's lives.

===Recession and Inflation===

As the 1970s progressed, it seemed that Europe and Japan might pass the United States in economic power. Japanese cars were popular throughout the nation and European made goods were strong competition to American made goods. Many factories were forced to close, and soon, many Americans were unemployed or underemployed, that is, when one works in a job for which he is overqualified. Another contributing factor to the economic hardships were the actions of the middle-eastern OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries). Even though the oil shortage had been for the most part resolved, OPEC kept its prices high, and the high prices led to inflation (the loss of value of a currency).

To help to reduce inflation, Ford launched Whip Inflation Now (WIN), which promoted the saving of money and advised people to grow their own vegetable gardens in an effort to avoid high food prices. The program led to a small but insignificant drop in inflation; the economy was still plunging into recession. Ford also tried to control inflation by cutting government spending. He vetoed many appropriations bills from Congress that allowed for more spending.

To stimulate the economy, Ford pressed Congress to pass a tax cut, believing that with the extra money saved on taxes, Americans might spend more money. Ford was right, but with less tax revenue, the federal deficit widened. Despite the things he tried, he could not make the economy recover.

===1976 Election===

In November 1975, Ford again was determined to win single handedly, noted that he would be competing in every primary. He vowed to, “go right down to the wire in the convention in Kansas City and win there.”  Ford was treated as a joke, just as Tom Branden had pointed out, that when &quot;the nation’s end men begin to treat a serious politician as a joke, he is though.” It all began during his trip to Australia in the Spring of 1975, Ford slipped on a rain-slickened ramp while getting off a plane in Salzburg and fell on the stairs. This incident happened in front of various cameramen and reporters, which meant it happened in front of the entire world. Instead of his presidency, Ford became famous for his social blunders, whether they were authentic or fabricated.So going into the 1976 election Ford hoped that, as the incumbent, he would win the election despite his past.

Americans had not quite forgotten about the Watergate crisis and Ford's subsequent actions, though. The Watergate Scandal opened the eyes of American people to see the corruption that was taking place in their own government. The scandal and the state of the economy hurt the Republican party and gave Carter the advantage of being viewed as a newcomer and a reformer. 

The 1976 election hollowed the financially conservative Ford against the more liberal Carter. The economic policies of the candidates’ became extremely important as the economy’s recovery from one of the worst post-WWII recessions slowed down. Ford held up a slow-growth policy to fight inflation, while Carter advocated stronger growth at the risk of inflation.

Jimmy Carter, a little known Democrat, slowly gained recognition in primaries, and he eventually won the Democratic nomination. Ford, on the other hand, struggled to win the nomination from his party, almost losing it to former California governor Ronald Reagan. On Election Day, the race was very close, but Carter eked out a victory over Ford, winning 50 percent of the popular vote to Ford's 48.

==Carter==

Jimmy Carter was born on October 1st, 1924.  Carter became the 39th president of the United States in 1977.  He won the Nobel peace prize in 2002 and is the only U.S. president to ever win it after his presidency.  Before serving as president, Carter was a governor and a senator.  His religion is Baptist. Carter, building his campaign on the fact that he was an &quot;outsider,&quot; had little experience with politics on the national level. Before he became president, Carter served two terms as a Georgia State Senator and one as the Governor of Georgia (1971-1975). He had been a peanut farmer from a tiny town called Plains. From the start of his presidency, Carter was very down-to-earth and informal; not very much like most politicians. Jimmy Carter also served as a naval officer on diesel-electric submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.

===Deregulation===

During his administration, Carter worked to deregulate many key sectors of the nation's economy, particularly the transportation and travel industry. The first major deregulation act passed during his presidency was the [[w:Airline Deregulation Act|Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978, which removed much of the Civil Aeronautics Board's control over commercial aviation. Before the passage of the act, airlines had to receive government approval of routes, sometimes waiting ten years before getting a decision. Many requests were rejected because, for example, the case had become &quot;stagnant.&quot; The [[w:Staggers Rail Act|Staggers Rail Act]], passed in 1980, had a similar effect on the railroad industry.

Another key piece of legislation passed during the Carter presidency was the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, passed in 1980. It lessened government control on the interest rates for money deposited and saved in banks, so that with higher interest rates, people would be encouraged to save their money.

===Energy &amp; Inflation===

High prices on oil imports caused inflation to skyrocket during the Carter administration by as much as 12 percent per year. A widening trade deficit (a higher value on imports than on exports) also contributed to the inflation. To stress the need to conserve energy, Carter symbolically turned down the thermostat in the White House. Five laws passed in 1978, collectively known as the National Energy Plan, created a Department of Energy, allotted money from the U.S. budget to go to alternative energy research and created tax incentives to encourage domestic oil production and energy conservation.

In March 1979, nuclear power would also become part of the nation's energy crisis. Nuclear power, which involves splitting atoms and releasing energy while creating hazardous radioactive material, made up more than ten percent of the nation's electricity. A partial meltdown at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, released radiation into the environment, alerting the nation to a potential hazard. Soon a protest movement against nuclear power spread, and while no further nuclear power plants were ordered in the United States, most already in operation continued in operation and most then under construction eventually went into operation.

===Camp David Accords===

During the 1976 election, peace talks between the middle east, Israel, and the U.S. had stalled. The newly-elected president Carter moved to restart these talks, but when the right-wing Likud Party of Israel took control of the government in an electoral sweep, hopes for continued peace talks seemed all but lost. But Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, frustrated with the stalled process and motivated by prospects that the U.S. might help its anemic economy, decided to visit Israel, thereby recognizing its existence. Israel received Sadat's initiative, and the two countries soon went into bilateral (instead of the multilateral talks with the entire Arab world that Carter and Sadat had hoped for) talks, witnessed by the president at Camp David in Maryland.

The secret negotiations were heated and dramatic, and the two countries had threatened to walk on multiple occasions. Carter had personally appealed to Sadat and Israel leader Menachem Begin to stay in the talks. After twelve days, an agreement was reached, and on September 17th, 1978, the Camp David Accords were signed at the White House.

===Hostage Crisis in Iran===

In the '70s, Iran was a very strong Persian Gulf ally to the U.S. The Iranian Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had built up a powerful military with U.S. help. Many Iranians complained about government corruption and the negative influence that the West had on Muslim values. In 1979 however, the shah was forced to leave the country after Islamic fundamentalists, (those who believe in very strict obedience to religious rules) led by the new Iranian ruler Ayatollah Khomeini, took control of the government.

Supported by the fundamentalists, Iranian students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran, the capital of Iran, and took 52 U.S. citizens hostage. The United States was horrified. Negotiations to release the hostages failed and a rescue attempt in the country ended with the death of eight U.S. soldiers.

Though fear of an American-backed return by the Shah was the publicly stated reason, the true cause of the seizure was the long-standing U.S. support for the Shah's government. Reza Pahlavi ruled Iran from 1941 to 1979, with a brief period of exile in 1953 when he fled to Italy due to a power struggle with Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. Because Mossadegh's policies and announcements created concern over access to Iranian oil, oil prices, and possible Soviet influence in Iran, the United States and British intelligence services aided Iranian military officers in a coup to overthrow the Prime Minister. After his return to power, the Shah established a very close alliance with the United States. The U.S. supplied weapons, training, and technical knowledge that aided the Shah in modernizing his country. However, the Shah ruled as a dictator, using SAVAK, his secret police, to terrorize his political enemies. The Shah was opposed by both the Marxist Tudeh Party, and by fundamentalist Islamic leaders who believed his policies and his reliance on the Americans were corrupting Iranian society.

The hostage crisis in Iran greatly lowered the public opinion of Carter, even though there was little else that Carter could do about it. The ordeal took a toll on his campaign for reelection in 1980; the public saw as a president who bargained with terrorists, and he lost to Ronald Reagan, 489 to 49 in the electoral college. An even greater disappointment for his failed campaign came in the last weeks of his term, in January 1981: with hard work, Carter secured the release of the hostages.

===Iran-Iraq War===
The Iran-Iraq War permanently altered the course of Iraqi history. It strained Iraqi political and social life, and led to severe economic dislocations. Viewed from a historical perspective, the outbreak of hostilities in 1980 was, in part, just another phase of the ancient Persian-Arab conflict that had been fueled by twentieth-century border disputes. Many observers, however, believe that Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Iran was a personal miscalculation based on ambition and a sense of vulnerability. Saddam Hussein, despite having made significant strides in forging an Iraqi nation-state, feared that Iran's new revolutionary leadership would threaten Iraq's delicate Sunni Shia balance and would exploit Iraq's geostrategic vulnerabilities--Iraq's minimal access to the Persian Gulf, for example. In this respect, Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Iran has historical precedent; the ancient rulers of Mesopotamia, fearing internal strife and foreign conquest, also engaged in frequent battles with the peoples of the highlands.

The Iran-Iraq War, also known as the Imposed War by Iraq, began when Iraq invaded Iran on 22 September 1980 following a long history of border disputes and fears of Shia insurgency among Iraq's long suppressed Shia majority influenced by Iran's Islamic revolution. Although Saddam's Iraq hoped to take advantage of revolutionary chaos in Iran and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and within several months were repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years Iran was on the offensive. Despite several calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council, hostilities continued until 20 August 1988. The last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003.

The war is noted for being very similar to World War I. Tactics used included trench warfare, manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, use of barbed wire, human wave attacks and Iraq's extensive use of chemical weapons (such as mustard gas) against Iranian troops and civilians as well as Iraqi Kurds.
====Land Mines====
This war is noted for the use of Land Mines, and for the use of them as an offensive weapon. Iran put the mines between the US military forces and their ships. Also there was believed to be a push by the Iranians to get human minesweepers, with &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;, which is believed to be the inspiration behind suicide bombing in Palestine.  Land mines were and still are today a great way to keep an enemy at bay.  Being well hidden, land mines are extremely dangerous.  Some are powerful enough to take out tanks because of the low amount of armor on the bottom side.  There are also mines in the seas that prevent submarines and ships of getting to close.

=Terrorism=
At the turn of the 19th century, terrorism in the form of political assassination became a major global phenomenon.  In the post-World War II years, other types of terrorism became strategies of choice for nationalist groups in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia in their struggles for independence.

In predominantly agrarian societies, this terrorism took the form of guerrilla warfare, with China and Indochina as the classic examples.
A number of these national political movements, which owed much of their success to violence, adopted a strategy in the war of semantics surrounding the use of violence. These newly created Third World Countries, as well as their brethren from the communist states, advanced the argument that their fight against colonial oppression was not terrorism but rather the hard work of dedicated freedom fighters. 

A significant turning point in the history of terrorism was the formation of Hezbollah (Party of God), formed in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  This Lebanon-based radical Shi’a group takes its ideological inspiration from the Iranian revolution and the teachings of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Its members were not only interested in carrying out the goals of the revolution but were also concerned with the social conditions of their fellow Shiites throughout the Middle East.  Hezbollah’s outreach in Lebanon during the 1980’s solidified Lebanese Shiite support and helped spawn smaller terrorist groups, the most recognizable of which was the Islamic Jihad. &lt;ref&gt;Kushner, Harvey. Encyclopedia of Terrorism. California. Sage Publications Inc. 2003. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reagan and &quot;Reaganomics&quot;==

In the years before and following Reagan's election, a conservative movement grew which complained that the government spent too much money and collected too many taxes. So, Reagan decided to cut taxes and spending. Reagan's policy of supply-side economics (increasing supply and services to stimulate the economy) soon became known simply as &quot;Reaganomics.&quot; Reagan took over the worst economy since the Great Depression, unemployment of 13% and inflation of 17%.  So called &quot;Reaganomics&quot; cut the top tax rate by half and lowered all other tax rates by a significant margin.  The deals struck with the Democratic controlled congress caused an INCREASE in spending and the DECREASED revenue from the tax cuts and smaller tax shelters could not cover the increases in spending on defense Reagan demanded.  The largest increase in spending was defense in a plan to bankrupt the Soviet Union. By 1983, the economy began a steady growth, doubling tax revenue, signaling that his plan was successful.

During his Presidency, Ronald Reagan pursued policies that reflected his optimism in individual freedom, expanded the American economy, and contributed to the end of the Cold War. The &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot;, as it came to be known, aimed to reinvigorate American morale, and reduce the people's reliance upon government

Reagan made progress in other areas too. He made up for Carter's general indecision by resolving an air traffic controller's strike quickly and cleanly. Although this action did subject the American flying public to a more hazardous aviation situation.

During the years of President Reagan 11,000 air traffic controllers went on strike to fight against so called unfair wages. The people on strike found quite the surprise when they discovered Reagan would not bargain with their request but instead have them fired and never be allowed to be rehired as air traffic controllers once again.

===Sandra Day O'Connor Supreme Court nomination===
In 1980, Ronald Reagan promised to nominate the first woman to the Supreme Court should he be elected. Then, on July 3, 1981, Associate Justice Potter Stewart, who had been appointed by Dwight Eisenhower in 1958, retired. Reagan fulfilled his promise and nominated Sandra Day O'Connor, a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals. The Senate confirmed her unanimously, and on September 25, 1981, she became the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. She served as Associate Justice until January 31, 2006, when her successor, Samuel Alito, was confirmed.

Reagan nominated two other Justices to the Court. In 1986, he successfully nominated Antonin Scalia, and in 1988, he nominated Anthony Kennedy.

===Defense===

As promised in his campaign, Reagan drastically increased military spending to a level of about $1.6 trillion in five years. This triggered a secondary arms race between the United States and the USSR, and relations between the two fell to levels not seen since the 60s. While Reagan favored drastically increasing spending on the military, the US confidence in full-scale ground war had been broken with the loss of Vietnam in the 70s. Because of this, Reagan favored funding trained insurgents to fight enemy governments instead of committing the army full-scale.

The first major military conflict during Reagan's administration was 1983's [[w:Operation Urgent Fury|Operation Urgent Fury]], the invasion of the Caribbean island nation of Grenada. When the island was taken over by Marxist [[w:Bernard Coard|Bernard Coard]], Reagan used the safety of 500 U.S. medical students working in the government as a pretext for the invasion. The new government was quickly and cleanly overthrown, and served as a model for future conflicts.

Reagan also, with the help of South Africa, funded insurgent groups fighting Soviet-backed regimes in the African nations of Mozambique and Angola. In Afghanistan, which had been invaded by the Soviet Union to the north, the U.S. government provided arms and humanitarian aid to [[w:mujahideen|mujahideen]] rebels fighting the Soviet-backed government. In 1985, [[w:Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachev]], a Communist party reformer, assumed leadership of Russia. Realizing that his Soviet troops were bogged down in a costly guerrilla war, and wanting to regain face with the international community, he announce in 1987 that the Soviet army would be withdrawing from the country. Withdrawal completed in 1989.

===Central America and Iran Contra===

Hostage takings in the middle east did not end after the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. In 1983, members of an Iranian militant organization were arrested for truck bombings in Kuwait, and an ally militant organization retaliated for the arrests by taking thirty hostages in Lebanon, six of whom were American. In order to free the hostages, the administration decided that it would secretly sell arms to Iran, one of America's greatest enemies, which was in the middle of a war with Iraq. Few countries were willing to supply Iran with weapons, and the United States sold the arms to Iran in the hopes that Iran would pressure the militants in Lebanon to free the hostages. This sale had the explicit approval of Reagan himself.

At the same time, a coup d'état in Nicaragua brought to power the socialist Sandinista government. The country had formerly been friendly territory for multinational corporations and a wealthy ruling class, and this resulted in a large poor class willing to hand power over to left-wing leaders. American interests in Central America seemed in jeopardy with the Sandinista government in power. When the CIA decided to conduct sabotage missions against the Sandinistas without congressional approval, the Republican senate angrily passed the [[w:Boland Amendment|Boland Amendment]], which banned the funding of the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels by certain governmental agencies.

Because of this, a few in the Reagan administration decided to, possibly without the President's knowledge, use the proceeds from the secret weapons sale with Iran to secretly fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

These dealings went on in violation of the Boland amendment, and in conflict with statements made by Reagan that he would not negotiate with terrorists. When a Lebanese magazine revealed the weapons-for-hostages dealings in 1986, scandal ensued. Reagan, with pressure from congressional Democrats and the media, created the Tower commission, led by former senator [[w:John Tower|John Tower]]. The commission in the end laid most of the blame for the dealings on Reagan himself for not paying more attention and not having more direct control over many governmental agencies. The scandal itself raised many separation of power and presidential ethics questions, but Reagan emerged from its aftermath relatively unscathed. By the end of his second term, Reagan once again was registering positive approval ratings.

==Changing Modern Society==

A broad shift in values and attitudes took place in the U.S. between 1970 and 1990 as financial prosperity spread through American society.  Across almost all social and economic groups, the trend was away from community and toward individualism.  Aspects of the change included resistance to taxation and support for tax cuts; distrust of government and belief in privatization of public functions on the argument that the private sector could carry them out more effectively; decreased support for public assistance to low-income groups and demands that these groups improve their own economic standing; and a general decrease in the type of public citizen involvement that earlier generations had practiced during the middle decades of the 20th century.  Politicians of both major parties hastened to follow these trends, with the Republicans in the lead under Reagan and the elder Bush, while the Democrats, seeing their broad base of voters increasingly drawn toward Republican positions, hastening to follow.  

===Urban Problems===
Many people believed that despite large change in the 60’s and 70’s, race relations were taking a major step back during the Reagan administration.  Reagan’s “New Right” caused a more apparent dividing of lines between religions and races.  In 1988 national report claimed that blacks and whites were once again segregating.  It pointed out the fact that more whites were living in nice suburban homes, while blacks and latinos lived in largely impoverished communities.  Although there were more white people living in poverty, the percentage of people of color living in poverty was nearly three times that of whites.  The living conditions of people of color living in poor urban communities continued to diminish and the neighborhoods became increasingly diminished as more struggled.  

One of the major causes of the danger in poor black neighborhoods was Crack.  One of the cheapest and most addictive drugs, Crack is a derivative of cocaine, often cut down and laced with dangerous chemicals such as Draino.  Crack first made an impact in New York in 1985, striking poor urban neighborhoods.  As more and more people became addicted to crack the business of drug dealing became more profitable and, therefore, more competitive.  America saw a steep incline of drug crimes and gang related violence.  In 1987 the death toll of gang related violence was at 387 in Los Angeles alone.  Many of the victims were innocent bystanders.  This increase in violence caused swift action.  Many states enacted laws that gave mandatory prison sentences for crack possession.  These laws made the punishment of holding 1 gram of crack the equivalent to having 100 grams of cocaine, the drug of choice for higher income whites.  These laws are still considered some of the most blatantly racist in recent history.  These laws, along with other crackdowns on people of color, caused a disproportion of black and latino convictions compared to people who were white.  By 2000, young black men were more likely to have been arrested than to have graduated from college.  Many see this as an obvious way to hold young black people down and keep them in impoverished, and even homeless, states. 

As the Sun Belt as a whole grew, it accompanied a nationwide trend of migration out of cities and into suburbs. This migration was easier to accomplish with more accessible transportation brought by cars. The service sector of the economy grew along with this shift, at the expense of the shrinking manufacturing industry. Cities in the northern and midwestern &quot;Rust Belt&quot; were left with smaller populations and thus smaller tax bases, and large, poverty-stricken minorities; bankruptcy loomed for many northern cities. Additionally, old downtown areas of cities exhibited [[w:gentrification|gentrification]], a phenomenon in which affluent, young middle class citizens move into restored urban areas. This displaced the lower class and poor and contributed to one of the biggest problems of the mid-80s-- homelessness.

===Conservative Movements===
'''Neoconservatism''' 
The neoconservative movement grew in the 1960s &amp; 1970s as a reaction to the growing antiwar counter-culture &amp; liberal social programs like the Great Society. Neoconservatism advocated a very hawkish, interventionist foreign policy, and was less committed to cutting governmental spending than mainstream conservatism was. While the Reagan administration was the first to show hints of neoconservatism, the movement would not be in the political mainstream until the rise of think tanks like the [[w:American Enterprise Institute|American Enterprise Institute]] and the [[w:Project for the New American Century|Project for the New American Century]] in the mid and late 90s. The culmination of this movement was the election of George W. Bush in 2000.

'''The Religious Right'''
Evangelical Christians constitute the main constituency of what is often referred to as the “religious right.” Like neo-conservatism, evangelical Christianity (often referring to themselves as “born-again”) grew in the 1960s &amp; 1970s. Organization such as the Moral Majority, founded in 1979 by televangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell, stressed “family values.”  

'''Conservative Coalition'''
Sharing membership and views on a variety of issues, neoconservatives and the religious right began to join forces in the late 1970s to form a conservative political coalition. The political platform of this coalition included moral opposition to drug use, pornography, and abortion, as well as opposition to the expensive liberal social programs of the 1960s and 1970s. The coalition also favored free-enterprise and foreign policy backed by a strong military.

The new coalition proved to be politically powerful, fueling a conservative victory in the national elections of 1980 when Republicans, supported by neoconservatives and the religious right, earned a majority in the U.S. Senate, while Ronald Reagan won in a landslide over Jimmy Carter in the presidential race. Specifically, California’s “Christian Voice” was influential in the 1980 election, swaying the vote in the South &amp; the Midwest. The Rev. Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority registered approximately 3 million voters from 1979 to 1980.

===African Americans in Politics===

By the 80s, African Americans saw a level of political empowerment and representation unseen during the course of the country's history. Mostly running as Democrats, the 80s saw the rise of many major black political players. Shirley Chisholm, a Brooklyn native, was elected to Congress in 1968, representing New York's 12th district. She was one of the founding members of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, which would eventually constitute a large chunk of the Democratic caucus itself. Today, the powerful group boasts 43 members, all Democrats. Eventually Chisholm would be the first African American and first woman to make a serious (though unsuccessful) bid for the Presidency, but it would not be until Obama that one would get on the ticket in the general election.

In 1984, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson decided to make a bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency and exceeded expectations, winning five southern primaries. Although he lost the nomination to Vice President Walter Mondale, Jackson was seen as a more credible candidate for the 1988 election. This proved to be an accurate prediction, with he and eventual nominee Michael Dukakis running neck and neck for the nomination. Briefly, Jackson was considered the frontrunner. Despite his loss, Jackson would remain politically active and would continue to push for progressive reform and civil rights for many minority groups, notably including homosexuals.

Other black politicians were appointed to positions of power as well. In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall to the supreme court. Marshall became the first African American to serve on the bench, and he did not retire until 1991. Clarence Thomas became the second black justice when he replaced Marshall that same year. As a general in the army, Colin Powell was appointed to the position of National Security Advisor, and was eventually elevated to the powerful position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As a civilian, Colin Powell was appointed to the position of Secretary of State by George W. Bush in 2001. This was the first time a black person had been appointed Secretary of State and was the highest ranking position that any African American had held before.

&lt;big&gt;Tacos&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:BeefBarbTacos.JPG|thumb|450px|right|Authentic taco plate]]

==Ingredients==
* ground beef, finely sliced, or chopped [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortillas]] or ready-made taco shells
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. ''about 1 to 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] per [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450 g) of beef (perhaps 11 to 44 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]/[[Cookbook:kg|kg]])''
* Your personal preference in an amount of [[Cookbook:Chili powder|chili powder]], if available.

Optional ingredients include:
* [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]] 
* shredded mild [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]], if desired
* fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] shredded or diced.
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]], or hot sauce, as hot as you would like
* [[Cookbook:Sour cream|sour cream]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]] or shredded cabbage
And if you would like you can add steak
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]]

==Procedure==
#If you would like to have 'build-your-own' tacos, dice the optional ingredients your desire as needed and place in separate bowls for use on the table. 
#Place the beef in a wide pan on a large burner. Ground beef will need to be broken up as it cooks; chopped or sliced beef needs to be stir-fried and may require oil. When using high-fat ground beef you may wish to drain and very, very lightly rinse the beef in a colander, or add water to float the fat, cool to solidify the fat, remove the fat, drain the water, and reheat.
#If you are using ground beef, which is quite alright, also see the [[Cookbook:Taco Meat]] recipe.
#Add lots of cumin to the beef. Cumin is the magic ingredient that makes a taco taste like a taco. You may also add a bit of salt, a bit of chili powder and/or diced onion.
#Prepare the outside covering.
## Pre-made shells can be reheated in the microwave as the package directs. 
## Plain corn tortillas can be used for soft tacos, although, for soft tacos, either a double layer of corn tortillas or a single layer of flour tortilla works best.   The tortillas should be microwaved, covered, in 15+ second stages, flipping between stages, until warm, and kept covered and warm prior to use. 
## You could make your own hard taco shells from corn tortillas, but rest very well assured that soft corn tortilla tacos are absolutely the most traditional.  If you need hard shells and can not find them pre-made, you may, with great effort and use of your time, use a [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat]] process, going one at a time and using a large spoon to form the shells into the normal U shape. Pan frying in 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch of oil will also work; be sure not to let the tortillas stiffen prior to being bent into the U shape you desire.
#Place hot beef into a hard shell or down the middle of a warm soft tortilla (two for corn).  A very simple, and quite authentic, taco would be to then add a sprinkling of finely diced onion and cilantro into the inside of the taco, fold the tortilla over (if soft) and serve with lime quarters for squeezing into the taco. See [[Cookbook:Tacos de Bistec]]. 
# You may also continue on to place cheese onto the beef. The heat of the beef should slightly melt the cheese. You may wish to microwave the taco a bit, especially if the cheese is cold or if you are using low-fat cheese.
# Add other toppings as the cook desires. 
# At some point, however, the tacos must be served, with a small or large assortment of items that people can add.  Traditionally, in a restaurant, this would amount to only Pico de Gallo or a hot sauce.  However, 'build-your-own' tacos with a good assortment of items to add can add a bit of fun to  a gathering or family dinner. 
# Find what works for you.

= The Movie Making Manual =

The Movie Making Manual is a practical guide to filmmaking taking the form of a wikibook.

Wikibooks are online books which are editable by anyone.  Anyone can update or change any page - this quickly produces accurate and detailed information.  The concept of freely editable online information has been proven by the phenomenal success of the Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org) which has now overtaken Encyclopedia Britannica in number of entries, is far more up-to-date and in many cases is more accurate.

The more contributors a project has the greater the breadth and depth of the information on offer.  We would like to invite you to come along and be an editor of/contributor to the Movie Making Manual.

Being an Editor entails doing one or more of the following:

* Contributing content
* Promoting the concept
* Telling everyone you know about it both online and offline
* Encouraging others to contribute to the project
* Checking submitted postings
* Dealing with vandalism (reverting pages)

== The principals of the Movie Making Manual ==

=== Free as in Freedom ===

The books will be released under an open content license that means that they are free forever. No one can keep you from using these materials, modifying them or distributing them. Also, the license guarantees that any works that are derived from these materials will be similarly free to modify and distribute, forever.

=== Free as in Money ===

Should filmmakers really spend $50 or more for a filmmaking book when they can get the same information for free? These texts are owned by the community and the world, not an individual or company.

=== Academia Meets the Real World ===

Our filmmaking book is started by filmmakers and is continually augmented by working filmmakers. These are no ex-filmmakers seeking additional income, these are the people at the coal face.

=== Up-to-the-minute Changes ===

Readers will never have to wait months or years for another edition to come out that incorporates the latest changes in the field. The very minute a discovery or advancement is made the text can be updated to reflect that change.  With the radical pace of change in the digital film era this is a good thing.

=== Built-in Feedback ===

Every module in the books has its own associated talk page where filmmakers can ask each other questions and help each other with the material.

=== Global Access ===

Filmmakers from around the world who have access to the Web can find quality educational information, regardless of financial status, local/regional educational restrictions, or proximity to an educational institution.

----

== Overview ==

'''Finnish''' (''suomi'' in Finnish) is a language belonging to the Finnic branch of the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family. It is not an Indo-European language. Its closest linguistic relatives are the Estonian, Karelian, and Sámi languages. It is also somewhat distantly related to Hungarian and several minor languages spoken in northern Russia. 

Altogether about six million people speak Finnish. It is spoken in Finland as an official language, as a minority language in Sweden (mainly in Northern Sweden and Stockholm), in the Russian Federation (in the Republic of Karelia and the province of Leningrad), in northern Norway (Finnmark) and in Finnish immigrant communities in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada.

== Language structure ==

The language is structured mostly in the fashion of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) like in English, but it also might go Object-Subject-Verb, Verb-Subject-Object or Object-Verb-Subject, as the word order is very flexible in Finnish. However its little quirks like the fashion of the prepositions (in Finnish, they are actually postpositions), vowel harmony and the absence of articles and sometimes pronouns, make it seem like a mishmash of consonants and vowels. For example the phrase “I am in the car” changes to “(I) am car|in”, '''''“olen autossa”'''''.

== Differences between spoken and written Finnish ==

There is a significant difference between formal written Finnish and colloquial spoken Finnish. Most Finns, especially the younger generation, speak the language in an informal way, and while the differences between colloquial Finnish and formal Finnish aren't enormous, it can be difficult to develop a natural conversational style purely based on literary study. In practice, you will be understood without difficulty, but one should not expect the conversation of native speakers to match the precise grammatical fashion in which the language is taught. See also the [[Finnish:Slang and Regional accents|slang and accents of Finnish]].

== Borrowed words ==

Finnish, like most languages, has &quot;borrowed&quot; words from other languages. However, many have been altered in the process of nativization to the extent that they may not even be recognizable. Finnish grammar does not allow words to end in any consonants other than a single 's', 'n', 't', 'l' or 'r', so in borrowing, a vowel is often added, e.g. ''vokaali''. In addition, if the preceding consonant is geminate, it is borrowed as such, e.g. ''konsonantti''. 

Also, Finnish does not differentiate voiced-unvoiced pairs like 'b' and 'p', or 'g' and 'k', although newer loans preserve the spelling, if not the pronunciation. Foreign spelling idiosyncrasies such as the letter 'c' are rarely used. Consonant clusters are usually removed in older loans. For example, ''strand'' &amp;rarr; ''ranta''. Phonemic long vowels may be added, e.g. '''''laki''''' &lt; lag (Swedish, cf. English &quot;law&quot;), but '''''laaki''''' &lt; slag (Swedish, cf. English &quot;slay&quot;).

Examples:

*'''baari''', '''pubi''' – bar, pub
*'''bussi''' – bus (the proper word is '''''linja-auto''''')
*'''dieetti''' – diet
*'''elefantti''' – elephant (though the more Finnish, but equally used word is '''''norsu''''')
*'''euro''' – euro (currency used in Finland)
*'''pankki''' – bank
*'''paperi''' – paper
*'''posti''' – post office
*'''radio''' – radio
*'''sekki''' (or '''shekki''') – cheque
*'''shampoo''' (or '''sampoo''') – shampoo
*'''tee''' – tea
*'''televisio''' – television
*'''turisti''' – tourist (although ''turisti'' is an international word, the more local word being '''''matkailija''''')

== False friends ==

Some of the false friends can be similar to Swedish, an example is '''appelsiini''' that is similar to the Norwegian and Swedish '''appelsin''' meaning orange (think of it as an apple from China).
There aren't many false friends in Finnish, but beware, because there are a few!

*'''ale''' – sale, not &quot;ale&quot;
*'''appelsiini''' – orange, not &quot;apple&quot;
*'''dokumentti''' – both documentary and document
*'''greippi''' – grapefruit, not &quot;grape&quot;
*'''kinkkinen''' – tricky, not &quot;kinky&quot;
*'''kudos''' - tissue (as in muscle tissue), not &quot;kudos&quot;
*'''he''' – they, not &quot;he&quot;
*'''me''' – we, not &quot;me&quot;
*'''motoristi''' – motocyclist, not &quot;motorist&quot;
*'''viina''' – liquor, not &quot;wine&quot;
*'''likööri''' - liqueur, not &quot;liquor&quot;

== Exercise Number One ==

Figure out what these Finnish words are in English. You will find the answers at the back of the book.

# '''historia'''
# '''projekti'''
# '''lista'''
# '''faksi'''
# '''galleria'''
# '''linkki'''
# '''skandaali'''
# '''kopio'''
# '''idiootti'''
# '''klassikko'''

== Exercise Number Two ==

These are more difficult. Many of them are loans from languages other than English but they still bear some similarity to their English translations.

# '''lamppu'''
# '''lasi'''
# '''pommi'''
# '''tikku'''
# '''tuhat'''
# '''naula'''
# '''mies'''
# '''kortti'''
# '''valkoinen'''
# '''torstai'''

This book is an introductory beginners course in the Finnish Language.

Being developed alongside this book are a [[Suomen kieli ulkomaalaisille|Grammar Reference Book]] and a [[Suomen kieli käyttöön|Guide to Modern Finnish]] which readers may find useful.

For very practical reasons, these other books cannot be merged with this basic introductory course book (see Discussion Page for further information).

'''Strudel''' - I learnt this version from my exchange hosts in Germany. Serve warm with ice cream.

==Ingredients==
*4 fresh apples, preferably red 
*1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
*2 tablespoons white sugar
*1/2 cup melted butter
*filo pastry sheets

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. 
#Peel, core and cube apples. 
#Combine apples, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix well. 
#Generously brush filo pastry sheets with butter. 
#Spread apple mixture over pastry sheet. 
#Alternate with two layers of filo pastry for every layer of apple mixture. 
#Brush with melted butter. 
#Bake for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*For more tartness, substitute for 3 red apples and 1 green apple.
*If you are unable to obtain ground cinnamon, substitute for cinnamon powder.

==What is this thing you call a &quot;Movie Making Manual WikiBook&quot;?==

Think of this as a manual. It is intended as a practical guide to filmmaking.  The Movie Making Manual is also a [[w:Wiki|wiki]] which means that anyone can edit it.  This is considered a Good Idea&amp;trade; because every reader effectively becomes an editor so the content matures and improves over time.  As more people read and edit, the content becomes more accurate, more up-to-date and more balanced.

In addition, you will find definitions and lists to supplement the information in the Movie Making Manual here at [[w:Film|The Wikipedia Film page]]. 

Join the discussion space for this wikibook [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual here].

===It's a Wiki!===

You can fully edit this book.  Please feel free to remove mistakes, flesh out existing pages or even to start entire new pages.  If you've never used a Wiki before then take a look at [[Help:Contents|the Help:Contents page]] to get started and [[meta:MediaWiki_User's_Guide|the MediaWiki users' guide]] for more detailed information.  Also have a look at the [[Movie Making Manual/To Do|To Do]] page.

==OK... sell it to me... why should I spend my time contributing?==

* It's fun showing off how clever you are.

* It's a pleasure to contribute to a wiki because it's a collaborative process.  What does that mean?  Well... you add a little bit and then you come back the next day to find that someone has added a little bit more and so on.  Remember those [[w:Garden_cress|cress]]-growing kits kids used to get before Play Stations were developed?  Contributing to a wiki is a little like growing [[w:Garden_cress|cress]]... you lay the seeds, let it grow a bit, then take some for your sandwhich, then let it grow some more (OK, crap analogy but you get the idea).  You get to participate in and nurture a growing document.

* As a filmmaker, you'll spend a lot of your time doing your own independent research (e.g. &quot;What tax breaks can I get in Prague?  Should I shoot my next short film on High Def?  What are the guidelines for submitting a music video to a broadcaster?&quot;).  Before you do your next bit of research, take a look at the Movie Making Manual to see if we already some answers to your questions.  If not, start a new page and use it to make your research notes on (you were gonna make notes anyway, right?).  Now you're killing two birds with one stone: not only are you doing yourself a favour by taking organised notes but you're also setting the foundations for a full-fleshed-out page that will help others.  Don't worry... you don't have to leave the page in a pristeen condition... just do what you can and others will add to it later.

* If you're a manufacturer then you might like to educate people about your product.  Explicit advertising is not allowed but there's nothing to stop you writing an informative article on how to use your particular tool.

* You get to feel like you're doing something useful with those hours spent in front of the computer!

==Yes, I want to contribute!  How do I get started?==

There are no concrete regulations but the following could be considered &quot;best practice&quot;:

# Register at WikiBooks (click the &quot;Create account&quot; link at the top right).  This is free and they wont spam you.  Registering will mean that your edits will be signed with your username.
# If you haven't done so yet then read up on how to edit WikiBooks [[Help:Contents|on this help page]] and [[meta:MediaWiki_User's_Guide|this users' guide for more detailed information]].
# Sign up to the [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual Movie Making Manual discussion forum].  Please discuss any large changes before doing them.
# Take a look at the [[Movie Making Manual/To Do|&quot;to do&quot; items for this book]].
# Add your name to the list of [[Movie Making Manual/Contributors|contributors]].
# Before contibuting, make sure the Movie Making Manual doesn't already contain the information you're planning to write about.
# Have a quick look over the formatting guide below...

==Formatting Guide==

===The Movie Making Manual and WikiPedia===

Before editing or writing an article, check to see if [[w:|WikiPedia]] has an article on what you're about to write about.  If it does then your job is to integrate the WikiPedia content into the Movie Making Manual.   First, link from the Movie Making Manual to [[w:|WikiPedia]] (this is easy using [[w:Interwiki links|interwiki links]], you just write a link like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Interesting WikiPedia page|Interesting WikiPedia page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  Then, if appropriate, link back from [[w:|WikiPedia]] to the Movie Making Manual.  Useful [[w:|WikiPedia]] categories include:
* [[w:Category:Video_and_movie_technology|Video and movie technology]]
* [[w:Category:Film_techniques|Film techniques]]
* [[w:Category:Film_production|Film production]]

It's very important that we don't try to duplicate what's already on WikiPedia.  The Movie Making Manual is focussed on the ''practical'' aspects of filmmaking.  For example, WikiPedia has some excellent articles on 16mm film but doesn't even begin to tell you how to shoot on 16mm film.

If you have found (or if you have added) a [[Movie Making Manual]] page that contains content that isn't covered in WikiPedia then it may be appropriate to start a WikiPedia stub article containing a brief, &quot;encyclopaedic&quot; introduction to the subject and then add a link to the MMM page.  For example, the Movie Making Manual has a page on the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Format/Genesis|Panavision Genesis]] HD camera which is way too technical for WikiPedia but we have added a [[w:Genesis (Panavision)|WikiPedia stub article on the Genesis]] which points the curious reader to the Movie Making Manual.

===Tone===

One of the fears with a collaborative book effort is that it loses any sense of &quot;voice&quot;.  Here are a few guidelines for this.

* Be direct.  Don't be afraid to give it to the reader straight.  
* Use a natural tone. Pretend you are explaining the topic to your best friend.
* Be positive - encourage, encourage, encourage.  There are enough naysayers in this industry, keep it outrageously upbeat.

===Style===

* Use the present tense.
* Use the active voice.  &quot;Take the lights&quot;, not &quot;The lights should be taken by you&quot;

===Practical versus theoretical===

This book is a manual so please keep the emphasis on the practical.  That said, some topics will require a brief discussion of what you could call &quot;practical theory&quot;.  That's fine.  All the theory in this book should directly inform decisions taken on set and in the edit suite.  Please don't discuss film criticism theory or film history in the Movie Making Manual - there is a separate book for film history [[Film_History|here]].

===Personal opinions and experiences===

The main narrative of this book should be impartial.  But don't shy away from expressing your own opinion.  Just make sure it's perfectly clear to the reader which sections are impartial and which bits are personal opinions.  For example, you might want to put your opinions or brief case studies in [[:Category:Box templates|Side Note Boxes]].

===Pictures===

# Upload your pictures to [http://commons.wikimedia.org Creative Commons]
# Name your picture MMM_picturename
# Link to your photo like this:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Circular_track.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Curved track]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

[[Image:Circular_track.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Curved track]]

For more details, have a look at [[meta:Help:Images_and_other_uploaded_files|this help page]] and [[meta:Help:Image_page|this one]]

===Registered trade mark===

Whenever you mention a copyrighted [[w:Registered_trade_mark|trade mark]] then you should put an &amp;reg; by the name and add a footnote to say to whome the trade mark is registered. The code to insert this symbol is:

 &amp;amp;reg;

===When to use WikiBooks===

For some reason, wikibooks seems to be fastest in the morning (GMT).  It slows down considerably as the evening wears on.  Hopefully things will get better as the MediaWiki Foundation get more funding.

==I want to do more than just edit... I want to start new pages and modify the structure of the book... what do I need to know?==

===Page naming conventions===

At the moment, we're using a slightly outdated naming convention of

 Movie Making Manual-Page name

But apparently this is outdated and may be made illegal.  See the [[:Wikibooks:Naming_policy|WikiBooks Naming Policy]] for more info.  We'll probably use the following page naming in the future:

 MMM/Chapter Name/Module Page

e.g.

 MMM/Cinematography
 MMM/Cinematography/Capture Mediums and Recording Formats
 MMM/Cinematography/Capture Mediums and Recording Formats/Electronic Capture and Storage

====Chapter names====

''PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE YET''

 Chapter name (examples of pages they contain)

 Preface (contributers, how you can help, how to naviate this book)
 Intro (basics of filmmaking)
 Writing
 Funding and Budgetting
 Contracts and Law
 Pre-production
 Paperwork
 Cinematography
 Audio
 Actors
 Directing
 Post-production
 Sales and Exhibition
 Training
 Short Films
 Music Videos
 Local Resources
 Film Festivals
 You the Filmmaker
 Tools and Equipment
 Case Studies

===Structure of the book===

The MMM has both a flat and a hierachical structure!  The naming is flat (i.e. out names are all of the form Movie Making Manual:Writing) but we also make good use of the [[w:Categorization|MediaWiki categorization]] system to provide a hierachical structure (see below for more information on the Movie Making Manual's categorization implementation).

(''This will soon change... we'll soon be using a hierarchical naming convention'')

===Headers===

Please put a link to one of our page header templates at the top of each new page created.  Just put one of these at the top of your new page:

''PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE YET - THEY ARE BEING ACTIVELY DISCUSSED IN THE [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Naming_convention_for_categories.3F|STAFF LOUNGE]] and in [[Wikibooks_talk:Naming_policy#Template_naming_conventions]]''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:Header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:preHeader}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:prodHeader}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:cinematographyHeader}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:postHeader}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM:s&amp;eHeader}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Categories===

The MediaWiki Category feature is a powerfull way to... well.. categorise pages!  There are several great things about this feature:

* Category indexes are generated automatically
* Each page can be in as many categories as you want.  Take &quot;Telecine&quot;  Should that be in the &quot;cinematography&quot; or the &quot;post-production&quot; category?  Easy!  Just put it in both!
* Categories allow the wiki to become more &quot;booklike&quot; whilst inheriting all the coolness that databases and hyperlinking provide.

Please put the correct category at the bottom of each page.  The availabe categories are (please note that they are all lowercase and that MediaWiki is case sensitive!:

''PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE YET - THEY ARE BEING ACTIVELY DISCUSSED IN THE [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Naming_convention_for_categories.3F|READING ROOM]]''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:development]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:writing]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:funding and budgetting]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:contracts and law]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:pre-production]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:equipment]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:actors]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:locations]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:scheduling]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:production]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:cinematography]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:audio]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:crew]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:directing]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:post-production]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:editing]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:effects]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:sales and exhibition]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:training for filmmakers]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:short films]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:music videos]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:features]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:low budget filmmaking]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:tools and equipment]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:you the filmmaker]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:preface]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:intro]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:case studies]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:local resources]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:film festivals]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;


You also have to put the name of the page into the category sort field like this (note that you have to use a capital letter at the start):

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:tools and equipment|Build your own editing computer]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Putting each page into a category means that MediaWiki can automatically make an index page for these categories.  Each page can be in several different categories, for example, the page on [[Movie Making Manual-Writing low budget|writing low budget]] would be put in both the &quot;writing&quot; and the &quot;low budget&quot; categories like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:writing|Writing low budget]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:MMM:low budget filmmaking|Writing low budget]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you start a new category then please put the following on the new category page:

=Promoting The Movie Making Manual=

We are actively looking for new contibutors to the Movie Making Manual.  If we can get enough contibutors this manual could be THE definitive independent filmmaking resource. 

If you wish to promote the MMM to users/contributors then you can use the following outline to 
[[Movie_making_manual-PromoteMMM|Promote the MMM]]

Before you promote the MMM check out the [[Movie_making_manual-MMMPromotionTracking|MMM Promotion Tracking Page]] to ensure someone else has not very recently publicised it where you were going to.  1 per month per forum should be plenty of promotion :-)!

[[Image:SaucepanFudgeCrackleCookies.jpg|right|thumb|256px|Saucepan Fudge Crackle Cookies and milk]]
These are true [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] cookies. They are brownie-like or cake-like. They tend to have a dome-like surface that stands 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch tall, and have a diameter of 2.5 to 5 inches. The surface is cracked.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Baking Chocolate|baking chocolate]]
* 1 cup granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 1/2 cup coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] (for example, 1/2-inch [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]] pieces)
* additional sugar for coating

==Procedure==
#Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.
#In a 3-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] on low heat, melt together the margarine and chocolate.
#Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat.
#Into the chocolate mixture, mix the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and nuts.
#Mix the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture.
#Cover and refrigerate until firm. Overnight would be good.
#Make 1.5-inch balls of the mixture. As you make them, roll them in coarse sugar and place them onto a cool, ungreased, insulated cookie sheet. Be sure to allow room for expansion.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|300°F]] for 20 minutes.
#Immediately remove the cookies from the cookie sheet. If you delay, the cookies will very strongly adhere to the cookie sheet.

==Variation==
The original used [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], which contaminates the taste of the chocolate. The insulated cookie sheet is also a recent modification, added to avoid burning parts of the cookie while failing to fully cook other parts. [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|Hazelnuts]] and [[Cookbook:Macadamia|macadamia nuts]] go well in this recipe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Query and Definability=
The problem of '''satisfiability''' is central to mathematical logic: for a logic L on a domain D of structures try to find a model in D for a given formula φ from L.  The more special problem of '''model-checking''' on a logic L and a domain D of structures tries to answer, does &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \vDash \psi\ &lt;/math&gt; hold for a given structure &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \in D&lt;/math&gt; and a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi\ \in L&lt;/math&gt;.  Model-checking is an important area in computer science. The concept of querying is leading beyond these 'true-false' evaluations, it introduces the result set as it's outcome.

==Query==
'''Motivation'''

Think of a customer-database.  Now one can query such a database e.g. &quot;All Customers in Africa&quot; that results in a list of all customers in Africa.  In case of a query like &quot;All customers and their countries&quot; the result consists of 2-ary tuples of a customer and a country, whereas the query &quot;(Do) we have a customer in Rwanda&quot; leads to either yes or no.  Similarly one can define queries on structures that deliver a set of elements of the universe, where the universe relates to the data in the database.  

'''Notion'''

First recapture the notion of bound and free variables: whereas a sentence (no free variables) like &lt;math&gt;\forall_x \exists_y xRy&lt;/math&gt; computes to either true or false the formula's &lt;math&gt;\forall_x xRy&lt;/math&gt; truth-value is relative to the free variable y and thus implies a set of values for y for which it is true. In general for a formular with n free variables we get a set of n-tuples (that may also be empty). In this sense sentences deliver 0-ary tuples in case they are true.

'''Definition'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; be a S-structure with universe A, m a nonegative integer and Q a mapping from S-structures to sets of subsets of A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, s.t. each &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; maps to a subset of A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.

Q is said to be a m-ary Query on S-structures iff Q is closed under isomorphism,

where closed (or preserved) under isomorphism is: if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \cong \mathfrak B&lt;/math&gt; by an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(Q(\mathfrak A)) = Q(\mathfrak B)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remarks'''

* A 0-ary Q is also called a boolean query. In this case Q maps to  A&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, that is a 0-tuple, or the empty set.  The former result is also called TRUE the latter FALSE.
* For a boolean query Q a subset C of S-structures can be defined by: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \in C&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;Q(\mathfrak A) = true&lt;/math&gt;
* the closedness condition ensures that only the 'shape' of structures is queried, i.e. it is unimportant what the universe consists of as long as its related in the same way.  Thus questions on the kind of elements of the universe cannot be answered by a query.
* From a unary query a substructure &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak B&lt;/math&gt; of the queried structure &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained with 
*: &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak B = R^{\mathfrak A} \cap Q^m&lt;/math&gt;, for an m-ary R and with an 1-1 mapping of constants. 

'''Examples'''

'''''Simple'''''

Take S = {&lt;}.  We query 'all elements that have no smaller element'.  This gives for a universe of {10, 11, 12} the result {(10)} (A set of 1-ary tuples).  The query for 'all elements that have a smaller element' gives {(11), (12)}.  A query for 'all directly succeeding
elements' gives {(10, 11), (11, 12)} (A set of 2-ary tuples).  The query 'there is a biggest element' results in {()} (The 0-ary element), whereas 'there is no biggest element' gives {} (false).

'''''Graphs'''''

Typical queries on graphs &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; are:
* transitive closure (smallest transitive extension) is a 2-ary query:
*:&lt;math&gt;\big\{(x, y ) \in V^2 |\mbox{ there is a path from x to y }\big\}&lt;/math&gt;
* isolated nodes is a 1-ary query:
*:&lt;math&gt;\{(x) \in V |\mbox{ there is no node connected with x }\}&lt;/math&gt;
* planarity is a 0-ary (boolean) query:
*:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \{()\} &amp; \mbox{if G is planar} \\ \{\} &amp; else \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;


==Definability==
On one hand we have queries that can be more or less 'complicated'.  Just think of a database-query simply for all customers with name = 'Ubuntu' compared to a query for customers named Ubuntu that are not situated in Africa or middle east.  On the other hand we have languages of different expressive power like FO and MFO (monadic first oder logic).  So one can ask if the expressive power of a language is strong enough to express (define) a certain query.

'''Definition for classes of structures'''

Let C be a class of finite structures and L be a logic.  C is said to be definable in the logic L iff there is a sentence φ in L s.t. C is the set of all finite models of φ.

'''Definition for queries'''

Let Q be a query, L a logic

Q is said to be definable in L iff it exists a formular φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of L in S s.t. for all &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; all elements of &lt;math&gt;Q(\mathfrak A)&lt;/math&gt; are an assignment on φ s.t. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

'''Examples'''

'''''Simple'''''

On a finite graph the query 'there is an element that is adjacent with all others' can be written in FO as &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \forall_y x R y&lt;/math&gt;.  The language can even be restricted further, e.g. by allowing only 2 variable per formula (and thus is definable in the logic FO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

'''''Negative'''''

Single step connectivity for graphs can be defined in FO as

&lt;math&gt;\forall_{x y} E(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

So we get 2-step connectivity as

&lt;math&gt;\forall_{x z} \exists_y E(x, y) \land E(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be continued to n-step connectivity for a fixed n, but not for arbitrary n since FO formluas are always of fixed length.  It would take some 'infinite conjunction' to expand the above approach to arbitrary length. And since there is no other way to express arbitrary connectivity in FO (what is omitted show here) we say the connectivity query is not definable in FO. It can be shown that it is expressible in UMSO (Universal Monadic Second Order Logic).

'''''Graphs'''''

The definability of the queries considered above is:
* the transitive closure query is not definable in FO
* the isolated node query is definable in FO as
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall_y \neg E(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
* planarity is not definable in FO

==Concept==

'''Definition'''

A Structure is said to be finite iff it's Universe is finite.

'''Examples'''


==The unusual effectiveness of finite structures in computer science==
Data structures in computer science are usually finite, e.g. a Database always holds finitely many entries.  But by restricting to finite structures we have to issues:
* We still have to deal with structures of arbitrary size, e.g. to sum from 1 to 3 one can write 1 + 2 + 3, from 1 to 4: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, but from 1 to an arbitrary natural number we must use a special operator like 'Σ' that extends our simple '+' language (Also the '...' notation doesn't help since it extends our language as well).
* We now have to deal with complexity issues, that we haven't had before. ''Example ...''



==Finite Model Theory==
So the Theory dealing with finite structures (Finite Model Theory (FMT)) is not just a simplification of the theory also covering infinite ones (Model Theory (MT)).  It has it's own character.  This is especially an issue when it comes to instruments for proofing.  One of the most important of such tools in MT is the compactness theorem, but it is completely useless when we deal with finite structures exclusively:

Consider the following sentence σ3

&lt;math&gt;\exists_x \exists_y \exists_z (x\ne y \and y\ne z \and x\ne z)&lt;/math&gt;

that says that there are at least 3 different elements in a universe.  One can expand σ3 easily for n other than 3.  So, let Σ = {σ1, σ2, σ3, ...} be the infinite set of all these sentences.  Now Σ is obviously not satisfiable by a finite model, although every finite subset of Σ is.  Ok, but why does that matter?  One of the most useful tools in general Model theory is the Compactness theorem, stating: &quot;Let Σ be a set of FO sentences.  If every finite subset of Σ is satisfiable, then Σ is satisfiable.&quot;  But as just shown this doesn't hold for the finite case, thus there is no Compactness theorem in Finite Model Theory!

And (unfortunately) this is the case for many other important theorems as well (actually the very most of them) like e.g. Gödel's Completeness theorem.  Moreover important definitions of MT must be adopted for the finite case.  For example the concept of types is a very central one in MT.  But applied to FMT it turns out to be quite useless since it already characterises finite structures up to isomorphism.  So the definition of types has to be refined in FMT (to a type concept in FO[k], depending on an integer k).

So Finite Model Theorists can not simply adopt the classic instruments from Model theory, they have to find their own.  The basic ones are presented in the 'Proofs' section.

==The Property of Elementary Equivalence==
Querying is about discrimination of structures.  So the basic question is &quot;Can i discriminate a structure from all different structures?&quot;, where different means not equal up to isomorphy.  This can be done for finite structures (but not for infinite ones). E.g. ...

==Properties for a finite Number of Structures==
So being of a certain structure can be seen as an elementary property, that discriminates a class of isomorphic structures from all others. Now we can think of properties that discriminate 2 different (nonisomorphic) structures from the rest.  They can also be descriminated by simply connecting the properties, like e.g. ...

This can be extended to properties for a finite number of structures, like e.g. ...

==Properties for an infinite Number of Structures==
Also properties that hold for an infinite number of structures can be thought of.  But these are not  discriminatable in the above way. E.g. ...

There are Logics that allow this sort of infinite disjunction, like ...

So, are there other ways to discriminate these structure in FO?  Sometimes, like in the case of ...

So we need a decision tool (method) that decides if structures with a certain property can be discriminated or not, i.e. responds either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; for all possible properties, i.e. is sound and complete.

This is a simple sweet-and-sour dish that works well as an everyday meal, even with leftover meat. It is best served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and perhaps also [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]]. The [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] alone (no [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]], or [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] chunks) can be poured over rice or used as a dip for [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]].

==Ingredients==

* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1/3 cup red wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 20 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (567 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] chunks in unsweetened juice
* maraschino [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]]
* cooked meat (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]

__NOTOC__
This is a rich non-greasy [[Cookbook:Frosting|frosting]] that goes on hot and stiffens as it cools.

==Ingredients==
* 5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Confectioners' Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Baking Chocolate|baking chocolate]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]]

==Procedure==
#Melt the chocolate and margarine together in a double-boiler or, carefully, in a saucepan on low heat.
#Mix in the vanilla extract and corn syrup, keeping the mixture somewhat hot.
#Mix in the sugar, still keeping the mixture somewhat hot. You might not use exactly 5 cups. Just keep adding sugar until the frosting is as thick as desired.
#While still hot, spread the mixture on cake or [[Cookbook:Brownie|brownies]].
#Mixture will stiffen.

==Warnings==
Steaming hot [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] will release moisture which may collect under a frosting. Cold cake may cause a frosting to stiffen prematurely. Thus, you should use a warm cake.

==Tip==
A very small amount of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] may be added if the mixture is unspreadable even while hot. Don't add more than you truly need.

== Interested ==

I am interested in learning Finnish and will continue to check up on your explanation, if you continue to write. Congrats on it thus far.
-Tas.

:Thank you. I at least am willing to continue on this Wikibook. I apologize for the mistakes I have possiby made and will make in the future, as I have found the Wikibooks just lately, after five months of using Wikipedia. I will definitely make clerical errors too, as my first language is Finnish, but that fact should just improve this book. Please, now that I should start planning on what to add here, give suggestions and comment, if something is unclear. - [[User:Zeal|Zeal]] 22:25, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
'''Egg rolls''' have very little [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] in them. Egg roll filling is essentially [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], but with smaller particles and less cooking. It goes hot into an egg roll wrapper, which is then cooked in a hot [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. Egg rolls may be eaten plain or dipped in [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet-and-sour]] sauce or [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki]] sauce.

Egg rolls keep about as well as any other fried food - not well at all. The filling alone will keep well. Leftover filling and wrappers may be used to make [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wonton soup]]. Leftover wrappers may be deep-fried alone, then immediately covered in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

Note that these egg rolls do not contain [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], which are used by commercial egg roll producers to cheapen the filling; as a result, the filling in these egg rolls is superior to the commercial product.

==Ingredients==
* egg roll wrappers (easiest bought ready-to-use, but see the [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrapper recipe]])
* [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat or poultry]] (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]], or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and perhaps [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Bamboo Shoot|bamboo shoots]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the filling, possibly including [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
* oil to fry the finished rolls, possibly including [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]

==Procedure==

===Filling===
#Cut the meat into tiny pieces. This is much easier to do if the meat is cooked, but the result will be better if you cut the meat raw and cook it after cutting.
#Cut the bamboo shoots into matchsticks.
#If using, chop the broccoli head into little pieces, perhaps 3/8-inch diameter. Cut the stalk into matchsticks.
#If using celery, cut the stalks lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide pieces and then crosswise into 1/8-inch slices.
#If using bok choy, cut the leaves away from the stalk. Treat the stalks as celery. Cut the leaves crosswise in 1/2-inch strips, then break the strips into 1.5-inch pieces.
#If using spinach, treat it much like the bok choy leaves.
#Wash the bean sprouts, discarding any that are not white and crisp.
#Place oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] and turn on the heat. High temperatures can produce a better result, but require rapid stirring to prevent burning. Beginners should use lower temperatures. Split the cooking into batches as needed to ensure that your wok is not too full; there should be plenty of room to stir and toss the food in your wok. You may prefer to cook each ingredient separately, then mix them at the end.
#Add the meat. If it is uncooked, lightly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] it now. Drain juices and add more oil as needed.
#You may add a small amount of sesame seed oil and/or [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] for flavor.
#Add soy sauce. For a typical wok full of food, add a [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]].
#Add ginger. About 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of ginger should be right, depending on taste. Ginger is somewhat hot.
#Add the broccoli, celery, and/or bok choy stalks. When done, they should be just slightly softened. Broccoli should end up being very bright green, losing the bluish cast but not gaining any hint of a yellow-brown cast.
#Add bok choy leaves and/or spinach. When done, they should be just barely wilted.
#Add the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, and turn off the heat. Do not overcook the bean sprouts.

===Construction and frying===
#Begin heating oil to fry the egg rolls. [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-fat frying]] works best, though [[Cookbook:Pan fry|pan frying]] in 3/4-inch of oil will also work. You will not need a basket; egg rolls may stick to a basket and rip. You will need [[Cookbook:Tongs|tongs]].
#Place an egg roll wrapper on a plate. Beginners may use [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] to help avoid sticking, but this will quickly foul the oil.
#Turn the plate so that the wrapper has one point toward you and one point away from you.
#Place some hot filling on the wrapper.
#Fold over the corner that faces away from you.
#Paint some egg white onto this corner to act as glue.
#Fold over the left-facing and right-facing corners.
#Paint some egg white onto these parts also, and also onto the remaining corner.
#Roll the egg roll toward you, onto the remaining corner of the wrapper.
#Examine the wrapper to ensure that it is fully sealed. Tears may be patched up with pieces from a spare wrapper and some egg white glue.
#Place the egg roll into the hot oil. You may be able to cook several at once, but do not allow the uncooked egg rolls to sit for long. Egg rolls that sit uncooked will become sticky and easy to tear.
#Turn the egg rolls over a few times as they cook, and dunk them under the oil. Be sure not to break them open as you do this.
#Remove the egg rolls when they are golden brown. Place them onto a fresh plate, so that they do not become contaminated with raw egg whites. Be sure to not handle the cooked egg rolls with hands that may be contaminated with raw egg whites.
#Serve quickly; they are best eaten hot.

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy (class K in the United States, class F in Europe.) An oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] is less likely to cause problems, including indoor air pollution and fire. Do not use water to extinguish an oil fire.

While we are all familiar with English grammar (if you can read this), it should be noted that every language has its own grammar that may not resemble that of other languages very closely at all.  Even closely related languages may differ greatly in their grammar.  Don't be tempted to just copy English grammar for your conlang &amp;mdash; the result would only be a [[Conlang/Types#Relexes|relex]] of English.

Unrelated languages may have grammars that seem to have nothing in common. The use of triggers or polysynthesis would strike many English speakers as quite alien. Japanese honorifics likely appear counterrevolutionary to socialists or at least unnecessary to the average English speaker. Nonetheless, they illustrate the massive variety in grammar.

There are two main parts of grammar:

* '''Morphology''', or how words are altered to mean different things.

* '''Syntax''', or how words are arranged in sentences to mean different things.

The difference between the present and past tense forms &quot;run&quot; and &quot;ran&quot; in English is an example of morphology.  The difference between the sentences &quot;The dog bit the man&quot; and &quot;The man bit the dog&quot; is an example of syntax.

== Morphology ==

A word can take different forms to show that the word has different properties, like singular/plural, or past/present/future.  Sometimes a property of a word can only be one way, like ''she'' that's always feminine (though this doesn't happen too much in English).  When properties of a word can change, the changes are shown by adding affixes; some different kinds of affixes were suggested in the [[../Words#Morphology|previous section]].  Different properties may be shown by separate affixes, but they don't have to be; it's common in natlangs for a single affix to show a certain combination of properties, like &quot;past second-person plural&quot;, or &quot;masculine accusative singular&quot;.

Here are some properties of words that you might choose to show in your morphology.

In verbs, morphology often shows tense, mood, aspect, and  voice, and sometimes person, number, and evidentiality.
*Tense is the time at which the action of a verb happened, such as past, present, or future.  You may have more than these three tenses, depending on whether you want to create tenses that describe that the action happened in the remote vs. near past, or the like.
*Mood is a way of describing the way the action took place: whether it happens, might happen, can happen, is commanded to happen, etc.
*Aspect describes the nature of the action in relation to its time: whether it has been done once, happens repeatedly, continues to happen, starts to happen, etc.
*Voice describes whether the subject does the action, the subject has the action done to it, or the subject does it to itself.
*Person and number are simply the verb agreeing with its subject &amp;mdash; or, in some languages, the verb agreeing with some other noun in the sentence, like the direct object.
*Evidentiality is how the speaker knows the action happened, and this is common in Amerindian languages.  &quot;John cut down that tree&quot; may be inflected different ways depending on whether the speaker saw John do it, has heard so, or is simply supposing so from evidence.

In nouns, morphology may show case, gender, and number.
*Case is a way of inflecting a noun to show syntactic roles in the sentence: subject, direct object, indirect object, etc.  It may also show the object of a certain preposition.
*Gender is a way of classifying nouns into groups.  Note that this need not be masculine/feminine: none of Swahili's seven genders correspond to sex.
*Number tells how many of the noun there are.  English has singular/plural, but Japanese does not differentiate between singular and plural.  Ancient Greek has the dual for pairs of things, and many Austronesian languages have the triadic for triplets.
*Person tells how the noun is related to the speaker and the audience.  Natlangs mainly use it on pronouns.  English has first, second, and third person, but there are other ways to go.  Some natlangs distinguish whether the first-person plural &quot;we&quot; does or doesn't include the audience, or whether a third person is or isn't closely related to the discussion.

Adjectives and adverbs can come in regular form/more/most (often called ''degrees'' or ''degrees of comparison''), and may also agree with properties of what they modify (like gender and number).

== Syntax ==

The three main parts of a sentence are the subject&amp;nbsp;(S), verb&amp;nbsp;(V), and object&amp;nbsp;(O).  Every natural language on Earth (okay, ''almost'' every language on Earth) has a &quot;neutral&quot; word order in which these bits of information can be conveyed without added information or special emphasis.  The default, unmarked word order of English is SVO.  (&quot;Mice eat cheese.&quot;)  Spanish uses SVO sometimes and SOV other times (&quot;Mice cheese eat&quot;).  Theoretically any order can be used, but some are more common than others.  SVO languages make up about 40% of the world's natural languages; SOV are another 40%, and VSO (&quot;Eat mice cheese&quot;) about 15%.  The other three combinations, OSV, VOS, and OVS, are much rarer among natural human languages, for some reason, but that doesn't keep you from using them in a conlang.  Klingon is OVS.  {{sec link auto|w|Teonaht|Teonaht|padlock=no}} uses OSV &amp;mdash; and apparently so does {{sec link auto|w|Yoda|Yoda|padlock=no}}'s native language, judging from the odd way he arranges his sentences in English (&quot;Your father he is&quot;).

Just because a language has a neutral order of these parts, that doesn't mean it always uses that order.  In English, some kinds of questions use a different order, as in &quot;Are you serious?&quot; (VSO), or &quot;What do you mean?&quot; (mainly OSV, with an extra twist in the auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot;).  The conlang {{sec link auto|w|Spocanian|Spocanian|padlock=no}} uses word order to show tense: SOV for past, SVO for present, and VSO for future.

The next most important thing to decide about word order is whether modifiers &amp;mdash; be they words, phrases, or clauses &amp;mdash; come before or after the word they modify.  For example, an adjective in English usually comes before its noun, so &quot;red brick&quot; is a building material with a certain color, rather than a color typical of that building material (which in English is called &quot;brick red&quot;); but in Spanish, an adjective usually comes ''after'' its noun, so &quot;rojo ladrillo&quot; &amp;mdash; word by word, literally &quot;red brick&quot; &amp;mdash; is a brick-like shade of red.

*In VSO languages, usually modifiers come after what they modify.
*In SOV languages, usually modifiers come before what they modify.
*In SVO languages, some kinds of modifiers may come before what they modify, and other kinds may come after (as in English, which usually puts adjectives before nouns, but modifying phrases and clauses after).
There are a few VSO and SOV languages that don't always follow these rules, positioning some kinds of modifiers differently.  And anyway, since you're building a conlang, you get to put things where ''you'' want them.

Modifying phrases and clauses are usually marked by special words:  English uses a ''preposition'' at the start of a modifying phrase, while other languages may use a ''postposition'' at the end of the phrase, and still others bound both sides of the phrase with a ''circumposition''.  Usually, there's a marking word between the phrase and what it modifies &amp;mdash; so that a preposition goes on a phrase after what it modifies (as in English), and a postposition goes on a phrase before what it modifies.

== Putting it all together ==

Languages can differ in how much they rely on morphology versus syntax, and how they specifically use each of these two aspects of grammar to convey meaning.  Some languages rely heavily on changes within words to indicate meaning, and let words be arranged somewhat freely within sentences, like Latin:  the neutral word order in Latin is SOV, but these main parts of the sentence are marked by their form, so that rearranging their order only changes which parts are most emphasized.  Other languages rely heavily on the order of words within sentences, like English.

A final thought on grammatical ambiguity.  In natural languages, ambiguity happens.  It happens because a sentence can be read in two different ways, and it happens because one language doesn't even try to specify something that another language goes to a lot of trouble to pin down.  Some languages don't even (grammatically) show past, present, and future tense!  So an ambiguity in your grammar isn't ''always'' a problem &amp;mdash; your conspeakers might have some rule for resolving it, or avoiding it, or they might not even notice it.

It's all very well having a conlang full of cool sounding words, but if you don't know how your conlang uses those words to form sentences then you won't be able to express even a concept as simple as &quot;The boy bounced the ball&quot;. This is what grammar is for.

As we [[../../Beginner/Grammar|noted earlier]], there are two main types of grammar:
* '''Morphology''', how words change their forms in different contexts and uses.
* '''Syntax''', how the arrangement of words in sentences indicates meaning.

Both of these processes are very important for the grammar of your conlang.  In this section we will learn more about how to create a good grammar.

== Morphology and Syntax ==

In the Beginner Grammar section we learned about the terms Morphology and Syntax and talked a little about what they mean, but we didn't really go into much depth. Let's do that now.

Linguists traditionally divide a language's grammar up into two sub-disciplines called Morphology and Syntax. Morphology deals with the way in which parts of words, called '''morphemes''', '''stems''' or '''affixes''', can be put together to make new words with new meanings. Syntax, on the other hand, deals with the way groups of words, called '''phrases''' or '''clauses''', can be rearranged within a sentence to make a new sentence with a new meaning. The important distinction here is that morphology happens inside words (using word-parts), while syntax happens outside words (using word-groups).

Sometimes it's hard to draw the line between these two sub-disciplines. In Mandarin (a language spoken in China), for example, the word &quot;to eat&quot; is 吃 ''chi1'', like in 吃面 ''chi1mian4'' &quot;to eat noodles&quot;. However, 吃 ''chi1'' is not used alone, so &quot;to eat&quot; without any object is translated 吃饭 ''chi1fan4'' (literally, &quot;to eat rice&quot;). It's hard to tell whether 吃面 ''chi1mian4'' and 吃饭 ''chi1fan4'' are phrases with a word 吃 ''chi1'' or new words with a root 吃 ''chi1''.

To be useful, a language's grammar has to be able to express all the kinds of things that a speaker of that language might want to say. Whether the grammar uses syntax or morphology to express these concepts depends on the language. Languages can be categorised by whether they use more syntax (called '''isolating''') or more morphology (called '''synthetic'''); for example, English has more syntax so it is isolating, whereas Ojibwe (a North-American indigenous language) has more morphology so it is synthetic.

== What's in this section? ==

The parts of this section are:
*'''Forms''': The different ways in which languages can express distinctions.
*'''Nouns''': Inflecting nouns.
*'''Verbs''': Verbs and how you use them to build sentences
*'''Adjectives &amp; Adverbs''': Creating more nuanced meanings
*'''Derivation''': Turning one kind of word into another
*'''Clauses''': Building more complex sentences&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

'''Fried rice''' is a simple dish that is easily modified and can be prepared in as little as five minutes. You may choose which ingredients to use and how much to use. Ingredients can be substituted and leftovers work great! 

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]] (Leftover rice that has been left refrigerated works well)
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Peas|Peas]]
* Fried [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]]
* [[Cookbook:Spring Onion|Spring onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|Bean sprouts]]
* [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|Bok choy]]
* [[Cookbook:Beans|Beans]]
* [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|Black Pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pineapple|Pineapple]] and sweetcorn
* [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] (exclude for vegans)
===Meat (optional)===
Optionally, meat can be included. Leftovers work here too. 
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]]
* Char siu (Chinese barbecue [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* Marinated [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]]
* [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] (add [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] for curry flavor)
* [[Cookbook:Prawn|Prawns]]

==Procedure==
===Prepare Ingredients===
#If using tofu, cook it.
#Cook the rice as you normally would, but be careful not to use too much water. The rice should not be too sticky. It may help to let the cooked rice sit overnight in the refrigerator.
#If using onions, dice them into whatever size you prefer. 
#If using bok choy, separate the stalk part from the leaf part. Slice the leaf part crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick strips, then tear the strips into 2-inch pieces. These pieces will be treated much like the bean sprouts, though perhaps with slightly more cooking. The stalk part will be treated as celery.
#If using bean sprouts, wash them and discard any that are not white and crunchy.
#If using meat, slice into desired sized pieces and cook.

===Cooking===
#Add a generous amount of oil to a large frying pan, more than you think you'd need to avoid sticking. If using a type of sausage or other excessively fatty meat, not as much oil may be needed because of the amount of fat. 
#Add the rice. Cook over the stove on medium high to high heat. 
#Add the soy sauce, meat(s), eggs, and all vegetables save for the onions and bean sprouts. 
#Add pepper, a pinch or two of sugar, and optionally some added salt. 
#Add the tofu, bean sprouts, and onion when the rice is almost done (depending on how fried you want them) being careful not to overcook them.

[[Image:CookbookBarbequeSauce.jpg|thumb|250px|Barbecue Sauce on [[Cookbook:Beef|Beef]]]]

This is a simple barbecue [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] that works well for everyday meals, even with leftover [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] and picky eaters. It is best served with [[Cookbook:Soda Pop|soda]] and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and perhaps also [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]].

The ideal meat to use would be thin slices of eye-of-round [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] roast. The sauce also goes well with [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], and [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]].

Note that the measurements are very rough, in part because molasses is too sticky to properly measure, and in part because liquid smoke flavoring strength will vary by supplier. You may need to adjust things a bit for the proper taste.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] (catsup)
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] &quot;concentrated&quot; [[Cookbook:Liquid Smoke|liquid smoke]] flavoring

==Procedure==
#Mix everything in a pot.

That's it. You'll want to heat the sauce with some pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] in it of course.

This is a simple [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] that works well for everyday meals, even with picky eaters. It is best served hot at the table, to be poured over lightly cooked pasta. Shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] may be added on top.

==Ingredients==

* 29 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (922 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of plain [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato puree]] or ground [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 2 teaspoons dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] (Albahaca)
* 1/2 teaspoon granulated [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Optionally, add:

* canned sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (ones sold in see-through jars are generally better quality)
* cooked ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or bits of steak (may be added at the table)

==Procedure==

#For more efficient use of the spices, you should grind them well with the salt. The salt helps to grind the spices. If you skip this step, increase the amount of spices. Also double the spices if you prefer a spicy sauce.
#Mix everything in a pot.
#Bring to a boil while stirring to prevent the sauce from burning to the bottom of the pan.
#Immediately remove from the heat and serve. Hot tomato products lose tomato flavor, so don't delay.

[[Image:TeriyakiChickenWithRice.jpg|thumb|right|192px|Teriyaki Chicken with Rice]]
The word ''teriyaki'' is a combination of two Japanese words, ''teri'', &quot;luster&quot;, and ''yaki'', &quot;to grill or broil&quot;. The [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] in the sauce gives a good luster to meat as it is cooked. Traditionally it was used with fish. It can also be used as a [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinade]] for pre-cooked meat and poultry, as well as a delicious [[Cookbook:Basting|baste]] for items on the grill or rotisserie. Teriyaki sauce is a complement to virtually any type of meat (as long as you adjust the flavors accordingly), especially steak, chicken, fish and pork.

==Ingredients of teriyaki==

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (2 parts) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1/4 cup (2 parts) [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] (sweetened rice wine for cooking)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (1 part) brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tsp of fresh, peeled, finely chopped ginger
* 1 tsp of fresh, peeled, finely chopped garlic
A litte bit of sake may also be added.

==Procedure==

#Mix everything in a 1-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] pot over low heat until the sugar dissolves.

That's it. You'll want to heat the [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] with some pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] in it of course, or use it to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] some raw meat overnight in the refrigerator.

==Variation==

*As given, this sauce is thin. Boil some [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Potato starch|potato starch]] or kuzu root starch (for Japanese authenticity) into it if you wish to thicken it.
*[[Cookbook:Pineapple|Pineapple]] juice might be a reasonable [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] substitute.
*Lime juice may also be added for a tart flavor.

__NOTOC__
These pancakes make a good [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] for a family. They go well with real [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]. They are healthy as well (providing you don't overdo the syrup) since whole wheat flour contributes to your fiber intake.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (130 g) [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (14 g) common granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (8 g) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] 
* 1/4 teaspoon (5.5 g) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1 cup (250 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 tablespoons (30 ml) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* additional oil for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==
#Oil a [[frying pan]].
#Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl.
#In another bowl, [[wikt:scramble|scramble]] the egg, then add the other wet (liquid) ingredients. This includes the 2 tablespoons of oil.
#Mix the dry and wet ingredients together, well enough to eliminate dry spots but no more.
#Heat the frying pan to medium temperature.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water dances around rather than simply boiling away.
#With a spoon, pour a pancake about 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter, using about 60 ml (a 1/4 cup) of [[batter]]. See below for making large and very large ones in a regular frying pan-
#The pancake will bubble. When the bubbling settles down and the edges are slightly dry, flip the pancake.
#When the pancake looks done, this is golden colour, remove it and start another one.

==Toppings==
Traditionally, pancakes are topped with butter and maple syrup.  Other toppings can include strawberries, applesauce, cinnamon, or sugar.

==Variations==

The pancakes will come out thinner if you overmix them, let the batter sit for a long time, use white flour instead of wheat, or increase the liquid. Doing the opposite will result in thick pancakes. Pouring the batter with a spiral motion will be needed to prevent very large pancakes from being too thick in the middle. If using white flour, the milk should be reduced to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup.

Large pancakes normally require a professional flat cooktop (no pan) and a very large turner. You can produce large pancakes one at a time in a normal small frying pan though, by air flipping. This is also known as the Boy Scout method, because it's a rather macho way to flip your pancakes. You should be using a non-stick pan. Loosen the pancake with a normal turner, so that the pancake slides freely. Put the turner down. Rapidly move the pan away from you, then up, then back just a bit toward you, and then very rapidly downward. Catch the pancake in the pan. You have to be brave in doing this; any hesitation will cause you to lose the pancake.

Filled pancakes can be made. Soon after pouring the pancake, take a spoonful of something (chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, wild (small) [[Cookbook:Blueberry|blueberries]], maple syrup, or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]) and put it in the middle. Cover the exposed filling with more batter. (direct contact between the filling and pan can overheat it and cause it to pop)

By increasing the sugar to 1/3 cup, you can make pancakes that don't require a sweetened topping.

You can also use cheese to cover one side of the pancake. You can do this right after pouring the batter, or use cheese as a topping when it's done. When adding them after pouring the batter you must be careful flipping the pancake, since the cheese will get stuck if you don't use a non-stick pan.

A PSYCHOLOGY OF STUDY

BEING A MANUAL FOR THE USE OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN THE
ADMINISTRATION OF SUPERVISED STUDY

BY

''HARRY D. KITSON, PH.D.''

PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY

1921




PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION


The kindly reception accorded to the first edition of this book has
confirmed the author in his conviction that such a book was needed, and
has tempted him to bestow additional labor upon it. The chief changes
consist in the addition of two new chapters, &quot;Active Imagination,&quot; and
&quot;How to Develop Interest in a Subject&quot;; the division into two parts of
the unwieldy chapter on memory; the addition of readings and exercises
at the end of each chapter; the preparation of an analytical table of
contents; the correction of the bibliography to date; the addition of
an index; and some recasting of phraseology in the interest of
clearness and emphasis.

The author gratefully acknowledges the constructive suggestions of
reviewers and others who have used the book, and hopes that he has
profited by them in this revision.

H.D.K.

April 1, 1921.




PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION


Educational leaders are seeing with increasing clearness the necessity
of teaching students not only the subject-matter of study but also
methods of study. Teachers are beginning to see that students waste a
vast amount of time and form many harmful habits because they do not
know how to use their minds. The recognition of this condition is
taking the form of the movement toward &quot;supervised study,&quot; which
attempts to acquaint the student with principles of economy and
directness in using his mind. It is generally agreed that there are
certain &quot;tricks&quot; which make for mental efficiency, consisting of
methods of apperceiving facts, methods of review, devices for arranging
work. Some are the fruits of psychological experimentation; others are
derived from experience. Many of them can be imparted by instruction,
and it is for the purpose of systematizing these and making them
available for students that this book is prepared.

The evils of unintelligent and unsupervised study are evident to all
who have any connection with modern education. They pervade the entire
educational structure from kindergarten through college. In college
they are especially apparent in the case of freshmen, who, in addition
to the numerous difficulties incident to entrance into the college
world, suffer peculiarly because they do not know how to attack the
difficult subjects of the curriculum. In recognition of these
conditions, special attention is given at The University of Chicago
toward supervision of study. All freshmen in the School of Commerce and
Administration of the University are given a course in Methods of
Study, in which practical discussions and demonstrations are given
regarding the ways of studying the freshman subjects. In addition to
the group-work, cases presenting special features are given individual
attention, for it must be admitted that while certain difficulties are
common to all students, there are individual cases that present
peculiar phases and these can be served only by personal consultations.
These personal consultations are expensive both in time and patience,
for it frequently happens that the mental habits of a student must be
thoroughly reconstructed, and this requires much time and attention,
but the results well repay the effort. A valuable accessory to such
individual supervision over students has been found in the use of
psychological tests which have been described by the author in a
monograph entitled, &quot;The Scientific Study of the College Student.&quot;[1]

[Footnote 1: Princeton University Press.]

But the college is not the most strategic point at which to administer
guidance in methods of study. Such training is even more acceptably
given in the high school and grades. Here habits of mental application
are largely set, and it is of the utmost importance that they be set
right, for the sake of the welfare of the individuals and of the
institutions of higher education that receive them later. Another
reason for incorporating training in methods of study into secondary
and elementary schools is that more individuals will be helped,
inasmuch as the eliminative process has not yet reached its
culmination.

In high schools where systematic supervision of study is a feature,
classes are usually conducted in Methods of Study, and it is hoped that
this book will meet the demand for a text-book for such classes, the
material being well within the reach of high school students. In high
schools where instruction in Methods of Study is given as part of a
course in elementary psychology, the book should also prove useful,
inasmuch as it gives a summary of psychological principles relating to
the cognitive processes.

In the grades the book cannot be put into the hands of the pupils, but
it should be mastered by the teacher and applied in her supervising and
teaching activities. Embodying, as it does, the results of researches
in educational psychology, it should prove especially suitable for use
in teachers' reading circles where a concise presentation of the facts
regarding the psychology of the learning process is desired.

There is another group of students who need training in methods of
study. Brain workers in business and industry feel deeply the need of
greater mental efficiency and seek eagerly for means to attain it.
Their earnestness in this search is evidenced by the success of various
systems for the training of memory, will, and other mental traits.
Further evidence is found in the efforts of many corporations to
maintain schools and classes for the intellectual improvement of their
employees. To all such the author offers the work with the hope that it
may be useful in directing them toward greater mental efficiency.

In courses in Methods of Study in which the book is used as a
class-text, the instructor should lay emphasis not upon memorization of
the facts in the book, but upon the application of them in study. He
should expect to see parallel with progress through the book,
improvement in the mental ability of the students. Specific problems
may well be arranged on the basis of the subjects of the curriculum,
and students should be urged to utilize the suggestions immediately.
The subjects treated in the book are those which the author has found
in his experience with college students to constitute the most frequent
sources of difficulty, and under these conditions, the sequence of
topics followed in the book has seemed most favorable for presentation.
With other groups of students, however, another sequence of topics may
be found desirable; if so, the order of topics may be changed. For
example, in case the chapter on brain action is found to presuppose
more physiological knowledge than that possessed by the students, it
may be omitted or may be used merely for reference when enlightenment
is desired upon some of the physiological descriptions in later
chapters. Likewise, the chapter dealing with intellectual difficulties
of college students may be omitted with non-collegiate groups.

The heavy obligation of the author to a number of writers will be
apparent to one familiar with the literature of theoretical and
educational psychology. No attempt is made to render specific
acknowledgments, but special mention should be made of the large
draughts made upon the two books by Professor Stiles which treat so
helpfully of the bodily relations of the student. These books contain
so much good sense and scientific information that they should receive
a prominent place among the books recommended to students. Thanks are
due to Professor Edgar James Swift and Charles Scribner's Sons for
permission to use a figure from &quot;Mind in the Making&quot;; and to J.B.
Lippincott Company for adaptation of cuts from Villiger's &quot;Brain and
Spinal Cord.&quot;

The author gratefully acknowledges helpful suggestions from Professors
James R. Angell, Charles H. Judd and C. Judson Herrick, who have read
the greater part of the manuscript and have commented upon it to its
betterment. The obligation refers, however, not only to the immediate
preparation of this work but also to the encouragement which, for
several years, the author has received from these scientists, first as
student, later as colleague.

THE AUTHOR.

HOW TO USE YOUR MIND




CHAPTER I

INTELLECTUAL PROBLEMS OF THE COLLEGE FRESHMAN


In entering upon a college course you are taking a step that may
completely revolutionize your life. You are facing new situations
vastly different from any you have previously met. They are also of
great variety, such as finding a place to eat and sleep, regulating
your own finances, inaugurating a new social life, forming new
friendships, and developing in body and mind. The problems connected
with mental development will engage your chief attention. You are now
going to use your mind more actively than ever before and should survey
some of the intellectual difficulties before plunging into the fight.

Perhaps the first difficulty you will encounter is the substitution of
the lecture for the class recitation to which you were accustomed in
high school. This substitution requires that you develop a new technic
of learning, for the mental processes involved in an oral recitation
are different from those used in listening to a lecture. The lecture
system implies that the lecturer has a fund of knowledge about a
certain field and has organized this knowledge in a form that is not
duplicated in the literature of the subject. The manner of
presentation, then, is unique and is the only means of securing the
knowledge in just that form. As soon as the words have left the mouth
of the lecturer they cease to be accessible to you. Such conditions
require a unique mental attitude and unique mental habits. You will be
obliged, in the first place, to maintain sustained attention over long
periods of time. The situation is not like that in reading, in which a
temporary lapse of attention may be remedied by turning back and
rereading. In listening to a lecture, you are obliged to catch the
words &quot;on the fly.&quot; Accordingly you must develop new habits of paying
attention. You will also need to develop a new technic for memorizing,
especially for memorizing things heard. As a partial aid in this, and
also for purposes of organizing material received in lectures, you will
need to develop ability to take notes. This is a process with which you
have heretofore had little to do. It is a most important phase of
college life, however, and will repay earnest study.

Another characteristic of college study is the vast amount of reading
required. Instead of using a single text-book for each course, you may
use several. They may cover great historical periods and represent the
ideas of many men. In view of the amount of reading assigned, you will
also be obliged to learn to read faster. No longer will you have time
to dawdle sleepily through the pages of easy texts; you will have to
cover perhaps fifty or a hundred pages of knotty reading every day.
Accordingly you must learn to handle books expeditiously and to
comprehend quickly. In fact, economy must be your watchword throughout.
A German lesson in high school may cover thirty or forty lines a day,
requiring an hour's preparation. A German assignment in college,
however, may cover four or five or a dozen pages, requiring hard work
for two or three hours.

You should be warned also that college demands not only a greater
quantity but also a higher quality of work. When you were a high school
student the world expected only a high school student's accomplishments
of you. Now you are a college student, however, and your intellectual
responsibilities have increased. The world regards you now as a person
of considerable scholastic attainment and expects more of you than
before. In academic terms this means that in order to attain a grade of
95 in college you will have to work much harder than you did for that
grade in high school, for here you have not only more difficult
subject-matter, but also keener competition for the first place. In
high school you may have been the brightest student in your class. In
college, however, you encounter the brightest students from many
schools. If your merits are going to stand out prominently, therefore,
you must work much harder. Your work from now on must be of better
quality.

Not the least of the perplexities of your life as a college student
will arise from the fact that no daily schedule is arranged for you.
The only time definitely assigned for your work is the fifteen hours a
week, more or less, spent in the class-room. The rest of your schedule
must be arranged by yourself. This is a real task and will require care
and thought if your work is to be done with greatest economy of time
and effort.

This brief survey completes the catalogue of problems of mental
development that will vex you most in adjusting your methods of study
to college conditions. In order to make this adjustment you will be
obliged to form a number of new habits. Indeed, as you become more and
more expert as a student, you will see that the whole process resolves
itself into one of habit-formation, for while a college education has
two phases--the acquisition of facts and the formation of habits--it is
the latter which is the more important. Many of the facts that you
learn will be forgotten; many will be outlawed by time; but the habits
of study you form will be permanent possessions. They will consist of
such things as methods of grasping facts, methods of reasoning about
facts, and of concentrating attention. In acquiring these habits you
must have some material upon which you may concentrate your attention,
and it will be supplied by the subjects of the curriculum. You will be
asked, for instance, to write innumerable themes in courses in English
composition; not for the purpose of enriching the world's literature,
nor for the delectation of your English instructor, but for the sake of
helping you to form habits of forceful expression. You will be asked to
enter the laboratory and perform numerous experiments, not to discover
hitherto unknown facts, but to obtain practice in scientific procedure
and to learn how to seek knowledge by yourself. The curriculum and the
faculty are the means, but you yourself are the agent in the
educational process. No matter how good the curriculum or how renowned
the faculty, you cannot be educated without the most vigorous efforts
on your part. Banish the thought that you are here to have knowledge
&quot;pumped into&quot; you. To acquire an education you must establish and
maintain not a passive attitude but an active attitude. When you go to
the gymnasium to build up a good physique, the physical director does
not tell you to hold yourself limp and passive while he pumps your arms
and legs up and down. Rather he urges you to put forth effort, to exert
yourself until you are tired. Only by so doing can you develop physical
power. This principle holds true of mental development. Learning is not
a process of passive &quot;soaking-in.&quot; It is a matter of vigorous effort,
and the harder you work the more powerful you become. In securing a
college education you are your own master.

In the development of physical prowess you are well aware of the
importance of doing everything in &quot;good form.&quot; In such sports as
swimming and hurdling, speed and grace depend primarily upon it. The
same principle holds true in the development of the mind. The most
serviceable mind is that which accomplishes results in the shortest
time and with least waste motion. Take every precaution, therefore, to
rid yourself of all superfluous and impeding methods.

Strive for the development of good form in study. Especially is this
necessary at the start. Now is the time when you are laying the
foundations for your mental achievements in college. Keep a sharp
lookout, then, at every point, to see that you build into the
foundation only those materials and that workmanship which will support
a masterly structure.

CHAPTER II

NOTE-TAKING


Most educated people find occasion, at some time or other, to take
notes. Although this is especially true of college students, they have
little success, as any college instructor will testify. Students, as a
rule, do not realize that there is any skill involved in taking notes.
Not until examination time arrives and they try vainly to labor through
a maze of scribbling, do they realize that there must be some system in
note-taking. A careful examination of note-taking shows that there are
rules or principles, which, when followed, have much to do with
increasing ability in study.

One criterion that should guide in the preparation of notes is the use
to which they will be put. If this is kept in mind, many blunders will
be saved. Notes may be used in three ways: as material for directing
each day's study, for cramming, and for permanent, professional use.
Thus a note-book may be a thing of far-reaching value. Notes you take
now as a student may be valuable years hence in professional life.
Recognition of this will help you in the preparation of your notes and
will determine many times how they should be prepared.

The chief situations in college which require note-taking are lectures,
library reading and laboratory work. Accordingly the subject will be
considered under these three heads.

LECTURE NOTES.--When taking notes on a lecture, there are two extremes
that present themselves, to take exceedingly full notes or to take
almost no notes. One can err in either direction. True, on first
thought, entire stenographic reports of lectures appear desirable, but
second thought will show that they may be dispensed with, not only
without loss, but with much gain. The most obvious objection is that
too much time would be consumed in transcribing short-hand notes.
Another is that much of the material in a lecture is undesirable for
permanent possession. The instructor repeats much for the sake of
emphasis; he multiplies illustrations, not important in themselves, but
important for the sake of stressing his point. You do not need these
illustrations in written form, however, for once the point is made you
rarely need to depend upon the illustrations for its retention. A still
more cogent objection is that if you occupy your attention with the
task of copying the lecture verbatim, you do not have time to think,
but become merely an automatic recording machine. Experienced
stenographers say that they form the habit of recording so
automatically that they fail utterly to comprehend the meaning of what
is said. You as a student cannot afford to have your attention so
distracted from the meaning of the lecture, therefore reduce your
classroom writing to a minimum.

Probably the chief reason why students are so eager to secure full
lecture notes is that they fear to trust their memory. Such fears
should be put at rest, for your mind will retain facts if you pay close
attention and make logical associations during the time of impression.
Keep your mind free, then, to work upon the subject-matter of the
lecture. Debate mentally with the speaker. Question his statements,
comparing them with your own experience or with the results of your
study. Ask yourself frequently, &quot;Is that true?&quot; The essential thing is
to maintain an attitude of mental activity, and to avoid anything that
will reduce this and make you passive. Do not think of yourself as a
vat into which the instructor pumps knowledge. Regard yourself rather
as an active force, quick to perceive and to comprehend meaning,
deliberate in acceptance and firm in retention.

After observing the stress laid, throughout this book, upon the
necessity for logical associations, you will readily see that the
key-note to note-taking is, Let your notes represent the logical
progression of thought in the lecture. Strive above all else to secure
the skeleton--the framework upon which the lecture is hung. A lecture
is a logical structure, and the form in which it is presented is the
outline. This outline, then, is your chief concern. In the case of some
lectures it is an easy matter. The lecturer may place the outline in
your hands beforehand, may present it on the black-board, or may give
it orally. Some lecturers, too, present their material in such
clear-cut divisions that the outline is easily followed. Others,
however, are very difficult to follow in this regard.

In arranging an outline you will find it wise to adopt some device by
which the parts will stand out prominently, and the progression of
thought will be indicated with proper subordination of titles. Adopt
some system at the beginning of your college course, and use it in all
your notes. The system here given may serve as a model, using first the
Roman numerals, then capitals, then Arabic numerals:

 I.
II.
   A.
   B.
     1.
     2.
       a.
       b.
         (1)
         (2)
            (a)
            (b)

In concluding this discussion of lecture notes, you should be urged to
make good use of your notes after they are taken. First, glance over
them as soon as possible after the lecture. Inasmuch as they will then
be fresh in your mind, you will be able to recall almost the entire
lecture; you will also be able to supply missing parts from memory.
Some students make it a rule to reduce all class-notes to typewritten
form soon after the lecture. This is an excellent practice, but is
rather expensive in time. In addition to this after-class review, you
should make a second review of your notes as the first step in the
preparation of the next day's lesson. This will connect up the lessons
with each other and will make the course a unified whole instead of a
series of disconnected parts. Too often a course exists in a student's
mind as a series of separate discussions and he sees only the horizon
of a single day. This condition might be represented by a series of
disconnected links:

               O O O O O

A summary of each day's lesson, however, preceding the preparation for
the next day, forges new links and welds them all together into an
unbroken chain:

              OOOOOOOOOO

A method that has been found helpful is to use a double-page system of
notetaking, using the left-hand page for the bare outline, with
largest divisions, and the right-hand page for the details. This device
makes the note-book readily available for hasty review or for more
extended study.

READING NOTES.--The question of full or scanty notes arises in reading
notes as in lecture notes. In general, your notes should represent a
summary, in your own words, of the author's discussion, not a
duplication of it. Students sometimes acquire the habit of reading
single sentences at a time, then of writing them down, thinking that by
making an exact copy of the book, they are playing safe. This is a
pernicious practice; it spoils continuity of thought and application.
Furthermore, isolated sentences mean little, and fail grossly to
represent the real thought of the author. A better way is to read
through an entire paragraph or section, then close the book and
reproduce in your own words what you have read. Next, take your summary
and compare with the original text to see that you have really grasped
the point. This procedure will be beneficial in several ways. It will
encourage continuous concentration of attention to an entire argument;
it will help you to preserve relative emphasis of parts; it will lead
you to regard thought and not words. (You are undoubtedly familiar with
the state of mind wherein you find yourself reading merely words and
not following the thought.) Lastly, material studied in this way is
remembered longer than material read scrappily. In short, such a method
of reading makes not only for good memory, but for good mental habits
of all kinds. In all your reading, hold to the conception of yourself
as a thinker, not a sponge. Remember, you do not need to accept
unqualifiedly everything you read. A worthy ideal for every student to
follow is expressed in the motto carved on the wall of the great
reading-room of the Harper Memorial Library at The University of
Chicago: &quot;Read not to contradict, nor to believe, but to weigh and
consider.&quot; Ibsen bluntly states the same thought:

&quot;Don't read to swallow; read to choose, for 'Tis but to see what one
has use for.&quot;

Ask yourself, when beginning a printed discussion, What am I looking
for? What is the author going to talk about? Often this will be
indicated in topical headings. Keep it in the background of your mind
while reading, and search for the answer. Then, when you have read the
necessary portion, close the book and summarize, to see if the author
furnished what you sought. In short, always read for a purpose.
Formulate problems and seek their solutions. In this way will there be
direction in your reading and your thought.

This discussion of reading notes has turned into an essay on &quot;How to
Read,&quot; and you must be convinced by this time that there is much to
learn in this respect, so much that we may profitably spend more time
in discussing it.

Every book you take up should be opened with some preliminary ceremony.
This does not refer to the physical operation of opening a new book,
but to the mental operation. In general, take the following steps:

1. Observe the title. See exactly what field the book attempts to
cover.

2. Observe the author's name. If you are to use his book frequently,
discover his position in the field. Remember, you are going to accept
him as authority, and you should know his status. You may be told this
on the title-page, or you may have to consult Who's Who, or the
biographical dictionary.

3. Glance over the preface. Under some circumstances you should read it
carefully. If you are going to refer to the book very often, make
friends with the author; let him introduce himself to you; this he will
do in the preface. Observe the date of publication, also, in order to
get an idea as to the recency of the material.

4. Glance over the table of contents. If you are very familiar with the
field, and the table of contents is outlined in detail, you might
advantageously study it and dispense with reading the book. On the
other hand, if you are going to consult the book only briefly, you
might find it necessary to study the table of contents in order to see
the relation of the part you read to the entire work.

5. Use the index intelligently; it may save you much time.

You will have much to do throughout your college course with the making
of bibliographies, that is, with the compilation of lists of books
bearing upon special topics. You may have bibliographies given you in
some of your courses, or you may be asked to compile your own. Under
all circumstances, prepare them with the greatest care. Be scrupulous
in giving references. There is a standard form for referring to books
and periodicals, as follows:

C.R. Henderson, Industrial Insurance (2d ed.; Chicago: The University
of Chicago Press, 1912), p. 321.

S.I. Curtis, &quot;The Place of Sacrifice,&quot; Biblical World, Vol. XXI (1902),
p. 248 _ff_.

LABORATORY NOTES.--The form for laboratory notes varies with the
science and is usually prescribed by the instructor. Reports of
experiments are usually written up in the order: Object, Apparatus,
Method, Results, Conclusions. When detailed instructions are given by
the instructor, follow them accurately. Pay special attention to
neatness. Instructors say that the greatest fault with laboratory
note-books is lack of neatness. This reacts upon the instructor,
causing him much trouble in correcting the note-book. The resulting
annoyance frequently prejudices him, against his will, against the
student. It is safe to assert that you will materially increase your
chances of a good grade in a laboratory course by the preparation of a
neat note-book.

The key-note of the twentieth century is economy, the tendency in all
lines being toward the elimination of waste. College students should
adopt this aim in the regulation of their study affairs, and there is
much opportunity for applying it in note-taking. So far, the discussion
has had to do with the _content_ of the note-book, but _its form_ is
equally important. Much may be done by utilization of mechanical
devices to save time and energy.

First, write in ink. Pencil marks blur badly and become illegible in a
few months. Remember, you may be using the notebook twenty years hence,
therefore make it durable.

Second, write plainly. This injunction ought to be superfluous, for
common sense tells us that writing which is illegible cannot be read
even by the writer, once it has &quot;grown cold.&quot; Third, take care in
forming sentences. Do not make your notes consist simply of separate,
scrappy jottings. True, it is difficult, under stress, to form
complete sentences. The great temptation is to jot down a word here
and there and trust to luck or an indulgent memory to supply the
context at some later time. A little experience, however, will quickly
demonstrate the futility of such hopes; therefore strive to form
sensible phrases, and to make the parts of the outline cohere. Apply
the principles of English composition to the preparation of your
note-book.

A fourth question concerns size and shape of the note-book. These
features depend partly upon the nature of the course and partly upon
individual taste. It is often convenient and practicable to keep the
notes for all courses in a single note-book. Men find it advantageous
to use a small note-book of a size that can be carried in the coat
pocket and studied at odd moments.

A fifth question of a mechanical nature is, Which is preferable, bound
or loose-leaf note-books? Generally the latter will be found more
desirable. Leaves are easily inserted and the sections are easily filed
on completion of a course.

It goes without saying that the manner in which notes, are to be taken
will be determined by many factors, such as the nature of individual
courses, the wishes of instructors, personal tastes and habits.
Nevertheless, there are certain principles and practices which are
adaptable to nearly all conditions, and it is these that we have
discussed. Remember, note-taking is one of the habits you are to form
in college. See that the habit is started rightly. Adopt a good plan at
the start and adhere to it. You may be encouraged, too, with the
thought that facility in note-taking will come with practice.
Note-taking is an art and as you practise you will develop skill.

We have noted some of the most obvious and immediate benefits derived
from well-prepared notes, consisting of economy of time, ease of
review, ease of permanent retention. There are other benefits, however,
which, though less obvious, are of far greater importance. These are
the permanent effects upon the mind. Habits of correct thinking are the
chief result of correct note-taking. As you develop in this particular
ability, you will find corresponding improvement in your ability to
comprehend and assimilate ideas, to retain and reproduce facts, and to
reason with thoroughness and independence.

CHAPTER III

BRAIN ACTION DURING STUDY


Though most people understand more or less vaguely that the brain acts
in some way during study, exact knowledge of the nature of this action
is not general. As you will be greatly assisted in understanding mental
processes by such knowledge, we shall briefly examine the brain and its
connections. It will be manifestly impossible to inquire into its
nature very minutely, but by means of a description you will be able to
secure some conception of it and thus will be able better to control
the mental processes which it underlies.

To the naked eye the brain is a large jelly-like mass enclosed in a
bony covering, about one-fourth of an inch thick, called the skull.
Inside the skull it is protected by a thick membrane. At its base
emerges the spinal cord, a long strand of nerve fibers extending down
the spine. For most of its length, the cord is about as large around as
your little finger, but it tapers at the lower end. From it at right
angles throughout its length branch out thirty-one pairs of fibrous
nerves which radiate to all parts of the body. The brain and spinal
cord, with all its ramifications, are known as the nervous system. You
see now that, though we started with the statement that the mind is
intimately connected with the brain, we must now enlarge our statement
and say it is connected with the entire nervous system. It is therefore
to the nervous system that we must turn our attention.

Although to the naked eye the nervous system is apparently made up of a
number of different kinds of material, still we see, when we turn our
microscopes upon it, that its parts are structurally the same. Reduced
to lowest terms, the nervous system is found to be composed of minute
units of structure called nerve-cells or neurones. Each of these looks
like a string frayed out at both ends, with a bulge somewhere along its
length. The nervous system is made up of millions of these little cells
packed together in various combinations and distributed throughout the
body. Some of the neurones are as long as three feet; others measure
but a fraction of an inch in length.

We do not know exactly how the mind, that part of us which feels,
reasons and wills, is connected with this mass of cells called the
nervous system. We do know, however, that every time anything occurs in
the mind, there is a change in some part of the nervous system.
Applying this fact to study, it is obvious that when you are performing
any of the operations of study, memorizing foreign vocabularies, making
arithmetical calculations, reasoning out problems in geometry, you are
making changes in your nervous system. The question before us, then,
is, What is the nature of these changes?

According to present knowledge, the action of the nervous system is
best conceived as a form of chemical change that spreads among the
nerve-cells. We call this commotion the nervous current. It is very
rapid, moving faster than one hundred feet a second, and runs along the
cells in much the same way as a &quot;spark runs along a train of
gunpowder.&quot; It is important to note that neurones never act singly;
they always act in groups, the nervous current passing from neurone to
neurone. It is thought that the most important changes in the nervous
system do not occur within the individual neurones, but at the points
where they join with each other. This point of connection is called the
synapse and although we do not understand its exact nature, it may well
be pictured as a valve that governs the passage of the nervous current
from neurone to neurone. At time of birth, most of the valves are
closed. Only a few are open, mainly those connected with the vegetative
processes such as breathing and digestion. But as the individual is
played upon by the objects of the environment, the valves open to the
passage of the nervous current. With increased use they become more and
more permeable, and thus learning is the process of making easier the
passage of the nervous current from one neurone to another.

We shall secure further light upon the action of the nervous system if
we examine some of the properties belonging to nerve-cells. The first
one is _impressibility_. Nerve-cells are very sensitive to impressions
from the outside. If you have ever had the dentist touch an exposed
nerve, you know how extreme this sensitivity is. Naturally such a
property is very important in education, for had we not the power to
receive impressions from the outside world we should not be able to
acquire knowledge. We should not even be able to perceive danger and
remove ourselves from harm. &quot;If we compare a man's body to a building,
calling the steel frame-work his skeleton and the furnace and power
station his digestive organs and lungs, the nervous system would
include, with other things, the thermometers, heat regulators, electric
buttons, door-bells, valve-openers,--the parts of the building, in
short, which are specifically designed to respond to influences of the
environment.&quot; The second property of nerve-cells which is important in
study is _conductivity_. As soon as a neurone is stimulated at one end,
it communicates its excitement, by means of the nervous current, to the
next neurone or to neighboring neurones. Just as an electric current
might pass along one wire, thence to another, and along it to a third,
so the nervous current passes from neurone to neurone. As might be
expected, the two functions of impressibility and conductivity are
aided by such an arrangement of the nerve-cells that the nervous
current may pass over definitely laid pathways. These systems of
pathways will be described in a later paragraph.

The third property of nerve-cells which is important in study is
_modifiability_. That is, impressions made upon the nerve-cells are
retained. Most living tissue is modifiable to some extent. The features
of the face are modifiable, and if one habitually assumes a peevish
expression, it becomes, after a time, permanently fixed. The nervous
system, however, possesses the power of modifiability to a marked
degree, even a single impression sufficing to make striking
modification. This is very important in study, being the basis for the
retentive powers of the mind.

Having examined the action of the nervous system in its simplicity, we
have now to examine the ways in which the parts of the nervous system
are combined. We shall be helped if we keep to the conception of it as
an aggregation of systems or groups of pathways. Some of these we shall
attempt to trace out. Beginning with those at the outermost parts of
the body, we find them located in the sense-organs, not only within
the traditional five, but also within the muscles, tendons, joints,
and internal organs of the body such as the heart, and digestive
organs. In all these places we find ends of neurones which converge at
the spinal cord and travel to the brain. They are called sensory
neurones and their function is to carry messages inward to the brain.
Thus, the brain represents, in great part, a central receiving station
for impressions from the outside world. The nerve-cells carrying
messages from the various parts of the body terminate in particular
areas. Thus an area in the back part of the brain receives messages
from the eyes; another area near the top of the brain receives messages
from the skin. These areas are quite clearly marked out and may be
studied in detail by means of the accompanying diagram.

There is another large group of nerve-cells which, when traced out, are
found to have one terminal in the brain and the other in the muscles
throughout the body. The area in the brain, where these neurones
emerge, is near the top of the brain in the area marked _Motor_ on the
diagram. From here the fibers travel down through the spinal cord and
out to the muscles. The nerve-cells in this group are called motor
neurones and their function is to carry messages from the brain out to
the muscles, for a muscle ordinarily does not act without a nervous
current to set it off.

So far we have seen that the brain has the two functions of receiving
impressions from the sense-organs and of sending out orders to the
muscles. There is a further mechanism that must now be described. When
messages are received in the sensory areas, it is necessary that there
be some means within the brain of transmitting them over to the motor
area so that they may be acted upon. Such an arrangement is provided by
another group of nerve-cells in the brain, having as their function the
transmission of the nervous current from one area to another. They are
called association neurones and transmit the nervous current from
sensory areas to motor areas or from one sensory area to another. For
example, suppose you see a brick falling from above and you dodge
quickly back. The neural action accompanying this occurrence consists
of an impression upon the nerve-cells in the eye, the conduction of the
nervous current back to the visual area of the brain, the transmission
of the current over association neurones to the motor area, then its
transmission over the motor neurones, down the spinal cord, to the
muscles that enable you to dodge the missile. The association neurones
have the further function of connecting one sensory area in the brain
with another. For example, when you see, smell, taste and touch an
orange, the corresponding areas in the brain act in conjunction and are
associated by means of the association neurones connecting them. The
association neurones play a large part in the securing and organizing
of knowledge. They are very important in study, for all learning
consists in building up associations.

From the foregoing description we see that the nervous system consists
merely of a mechanism for the reception and transmission of incoming
messages and their transformation into outgoing messages which produce
movement. The brain is the center where such transformations are made,
being a sort of central switchboard which permits the sense-organs to
come into communication with muscles. It is also the instrument by
means of which the impressions from the various senses can be united
and experience can be unified. The brain serves further as the medium
whereby impressions once made can be retained. That is, it is the great
organ of memory. Hence we see that it is to this organ we must look for
the performance of the activities necessary to study. Everything that
enters it produces some modification within it. Education consists in a
process of undergoing a selected group of experiences of such a nature
as to leave beneficial results in the brain. By means of the changes
made there, the individual is able better to adjust himself to new
situations. For when the individual enters the world, he is not
prepared to meet many situations; only a few of the neural connections
are made and he is able to perform only a meagre number of simple acts,
such as breathing, crying, digestion. The pathways for complex acts,
such as speaking English or French, or writing, are not formed at birth
but must be built up within the life-time of the individual. It is the
process of building them up that we call education. This process is a
physical feat involving the production of changes in physical material
in the brain. Study involves the overcoming of resistance in the
nervous system. That is why it is so hard. In your early school-days,
when you set about laboriously learning the multiplication table, your
unwilling protests were wrung because you were being compelled to force
the nervous current through new pathways, and to overcome the inertia
of physical matter. Today, when you begin a train of reasoning, the
task is difficult because you are opening hitherto untravelled
pathways. There is a comforting thought, however, which is derived from
the factor of modifiability, in that with each succeeding repetition,
the task becomes easier, because the path becomes worn smoothly and the
nervous current seeks it of its own accord; in other words, each act
and each thought tends to become habitualized. Education is then a
process of forming habits, and the rest of the book will be devoted to
the description and discussion of habits which a student should form.

CHAPTER IV

FORMATION OF STUDY-HABITS


As already intimated, this book adopts the view that education is a
process of forming habits in the brain. In the formation of habits
there are several principles that must be observed. Accordingly we
shall devote a chapter to the consideration of habits in general before
discussing the specific habits involved in various kinds of study.

Habit may be defined roughly as the tendency to act time after time in
the same way. Thus defined, you see that the force of habit extends
throughout the entire universe. It is a habit for the earth to revolve
on its axis once every twenty-four hours and to encircle the sun once
every year. When a pencil falls from your hand it has a habit of
dropping to the floor. A piece of paper once folded tends to crease in
the same place. These are examples of the force of habit in nonliving
matter. Living matter shows its power even more clearly. If you assume
a petulant expression for some time, it gets fixed and the expression
becomes habitual. The hair may be trained to lie this way or that.
These are examples of habit in living tissue. But there is one
particular form of living tissue which is most susceptible to habit;
that is nerve tissue. Let us review briefly the facts which underlie
this characteristic. In nerve tissue, impressibility, conductivity and
modifiability are developed to a marked degree. The nerve-cells in the
sense organs are impressed by stimulations from the outside world. The
nervous current thus generated is conducted over long nerve fibers,
through the spinal cord to the brain where it is received and we
experience a sensation. Thence it pushes on, over association neurones
in the brain to motor neurones, over which it passes down the spinal
cord again to muscles, and ends in some movement. In the pathway which
it traverses it leaves its impression, and, thereafter, when the first
neurone is excited, the nervous current tends to take the same pathway
and to end in the same movement.

It should be emphasized that the nervous current, once started, always
tends to seek outlet in movement. This is an extremely important
feature of neural action, and, as will be shown in another chapter, is
a vital factor in study. Movement may be started by the stimulation of
a sense organ or by an idea. In the latter case it starts from regions
in the brain without the immediately preceding stimulation of a sense
organ. Howsoever it starts you may be sure that it seeks a way out, and
prefers pathways already traversed. Hence you see you are bound to have
habits. They will develop whether you wish them or not. Already you are
&quot;a bundle of habits&quot;; they manifest themselves in two ways--as habits
of action and habits of thought. You illustrate the first every time
you tie your shoes or sign your name. To illustrate the second, I need
only ask you to supply the end of this sentence: Columbus discovered
America in----. Speech reveals many of these habits of thought. Certain
phrases persist in the mind as habits so that when the phrase is once
begun, you proceed habitually with the rest of it. When some one starts
&quot;in spite,&quot; your mind goes on to think &quot;of&quot;; &quot;more or&quot; calls up &quot;less.&quot;
When I ask you what word is called up by &quot;black,&quot; you reply &quot;white&quot;
according to the principles of mental habit. Your mind is arranged in
such habitual patterns, and from these examples you readily see that a
large part of what you do and think during the course of twenty-four
hours is habitual. Twenty years hence you will be even more bound by
this overpowering despot.

Our acts our angels are, or good, or ill,
Our constant shadows that walk with us still.

Since you cannot avoid forming habits, how important it is that you
seek to form those that are useful and desirable. In acquiring them,
there are several general principles deducible from the facts of
nervous action. The first is: Guard the pathways leading to the brain.
Nerve tissue is impressible and everything that touches it leaves an
ineradicable trace. You can control your habits to some extent, then,
by observing caution in permitting things to impress you. Many
unfortunate habits of study arise from neglect of this. The habit of
using a &quot;pony,&quot; for example, arises when one permits oneself to depend
upon a group of English words in translating from a foreign language.

Nerve pathways should then be guarded with respect to _what_ enters.
They should also be guarded with respect to the _way_ things enter.
Remember, as the first pathway is cut, subsequent nervous currents will
be directed. Consequently if you make a wrong pathway, you will have
trouble undoing it.

Another maxim which will obviously prevent undesirable pathways is, go
slowly at first. This is an important principle in all learning. If,
when trying to learn the date 1453, you carelessly impress it first as
1435, you are likely to have trouble ever after in remembering which is
right, 1453 or 1435. As you value your intellectual salvation, then, go
slowly in making the first impression and be sure it is right. The next
rule is: Guard the exits of the nervous currents. That is, watch the
movements you make in response to impressions and ideas. This is
necessary because the nervous current pushes on past obstructions,
through areas in the brain, until it ends in some form of movement, and
in finding the way out, it seeks those pathways that have been most
frequently travelled. In study, it usually takes the form of movements
of speech or writing. You will need to guard this part of the process
just as you did the incoming pathway You must see that the movement is
made which you wish to build into a habit. In learning the
pronunciation of a foreign word, for example, see that your first
pronunciation of it is absolutely right. When learning to typewrite
see that you always hit the right key during the early trials. The
point of exit of a nervous current is the point also where precautions
are to be taken in developing good form. The path should be the
shortest possible, involving only those muscles that are absolutely
necessary. This makes for economy of effort.

The third general principle to be kept in mind is that habits are most
easily formed in youth, for this is the period when nerve tissue is
most easily impressed and modified. With respect to habit formation,
then, you see that youth is the time when emphasis should be laid upon
the formation of as many useful habits as possible. The world
recognizes this to some extent and society is so organized that the
youth of the race are given leisure and protection so that they may
form useful habits. The world asks nothing of you during the next four
years except that you develop yourself and form useful habits which
will enable you in later life to take your place as a useful and stable
member of society.

In addition to the principles just discussed, there are a number of
other maxims which have been laid down as guides in the formation of
new habits. The first is, _make an assertion of will_. Vow to yourself
that you will form the habit, and keep that resolve ever before you.

The second maxim is, _make an emphatic start._ Surround yourself with
every aid possible. Make it easy at first to perform the act and
difficult not to perform it. For example, if you desire to form the
habit of arising at six every morning, surround yourself with a number
of aids. Buy an alarm clock, and tell some one of your decision. Such
efforts at the start &quot;will give your new beginning such a momentum that
the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise
might; and every day during which a breakdown is postponed adds to the
chances of its not occurring at all.&quot; Man has discovered the value of
such devices during the course of his long history, and has evolved
customs accordingly. When men decide to swear off smoking, they choose
the opening of a new year when many other new things are being started;
they make solemn promises to themselves, to each other, and finally to
their friends. Such customs are precautions which help to bolster up
the determination at the time when extraordinary effort and
determination are required. In forming the habits incidental to college
life, take pains from the start to surround yourself with as many aids
as possible. This will not constitute a confession of weakness. It is
only a wise and natural precaution which the whole experience of the
race has justified. The third maxim is, _never permit an exception to
occur_. Suppose you have a habit of saying &quot;aint&quot; which you wish to
replace with a habit of saying &quot;isn't.&quot; If the habit is deeply rooted,
you have worn a pathway in the brain to a considerable depth,
represented in the accompanying diagram by the line _A X B_.

     A
     |
     X
    / \
   B   C

Let us suppose that you have already started the new habit, and have said
the correct word ten times. That means you have worn another pathway
_A X C_ to a considerable depth. During all this time, however, the old
pathway is still open and at the slightest provocation will attract the
nervous current. Your task is to deepen the new path so that the nervous
current will flow into it instead of the old. Now suppose you make an
exception on some occasion and allow the nervous current to travel over
the old path. This unfortunate exception breaks down the bridge which
you had constructed at _X_ from _A_ to _C_. But this is not the only
result. The nervous current, as it revisits the old path, deepens it
more than it was before, so the next time a similar situation arises,
the current seeks the old path with much greater readiness than before,
and vastly more effort is required to overcome it. Some one has likened
the effect of these exceptions to that produced when one drops a ball
of string that is partially wound. By a single slip, more is undone
than can be accomplished in a dozen windings.

The fourth maxim is, _seize every opportunity to act upon your
resolution_. The reason for this will be understood better if you keep
in mind the fact, stated before, that nervous currents once started,
whether from a sense-organ or from a brain-center, always tend to seek
egress in movement. These outgoing nervous currents leave an imprint
upon the modifiable nerve tissues as inevitably as do incoming
impressions. Therefore, if you wish your resolves to be firmly fixed,
you should act upon them speedily and often. &quot;It is not in the moment
of their forming, but in the moment of their producing _motor effects_,
that resolves and aspirations communicate the new 'set' to the brain.&quot;
&quot;No matter how full a reservoir of _maxims_ one may possess, and no
matter how good one's _sentiments_ may be, if one has not taken
advantage of every concrete opportunity to _act_, one's character may
remain entirely unaffected for the better.&quot; Particularly at time of
emotional excitement one makes resolves that are very good, and a glow
of fine feeling is present. Beware that these resolves do not evaporate
in mere feeling. They should be crystallized in some form of action as
soon as possible. &quot;Let the expression be the least thing in the
world--speaking genially to one's grandmother, or giving up one's seat
in a ... car, if nothing more heroic offers--but let it not fail to take
place.&quot; Strictly speaking you have not really completed a resolve until
you have acted upon it. You may determine to go without lunch, but you
have not consummated that resolve until you have permitted it to
express itself by carrying you past the door of the dining-room. That
is the crucial test which determines the strength of your resolve. Many
repetitions will be required before a pathway is worn deep enough to be
settled. Seize the very earliest opportunity to begin grooving it out,
and seize every other opportunity for deepening it.

After this view of the place in your life occupied by habit, you
readily see its far-reaching possibilities for welfare of body and
mind. Its most obvious, because most annoying, effects are on the side
of its disadvantages. Bad habits secure a grip upon us that we are
sometimes powerless to shake off. True, this ineradicableness need have
no terrors if we have formed good habits. Indeed, as will be pointed
out in the next paragraph, habit may be a great asset. Nevertheless, it
may work positive harm, or at best, may lead to stagnation. The
fixedness of habit tends to make us move in ruts unless we exert
continuous effort to learn new things. If we permit ourselves to move
in old grooves we cease to progress and become &quot;old fogy.&quot;

But the advantages of habit far outweigh its disadvantages. Habit helps
the individual to be consistent and helps people to know what to expect
from one. It helps society to be stable, to incorporate within itself
modes of action conducive to the common good. For example, the respect
which we all have for the property of others is a habit, and is so
firmly intrenched that we should find ourselves unable to steal if we
wished to. Habit is thus a very desirable asset and is truly called the
&quot;enormous fly-wheel of society.&quot;

A second advantage of habit is that it makes for accuracy. Acts that
have become habitualized are performed more accurately than those not
habitualized. Movements such as those made in typewriting and
piano-playing, when measured in the psychological laboratory, are found
to copy each other with extreme fidelity. The human body is a machine
which may be adjusted to a high degree of nicety, and habit is the
mechanism by which this adjustment is made.

A third advantage is that a stock of habits makes life easier. &quot;There
is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual
but indecision, for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of
every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day and the
beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional
deliberation. Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding or
regretting of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as
practically not to exist for his consciousness at all.&quot; Have you ever
reflected how miserable you would be and what a task living would be if
you had to learn to write anew every morning when you go to class; or
if you had to relearn how to tie your necktie every day? The burden of
living would be intolerable.

The last advantage to be discerned in habit is economy. Habitual acts
do not have to be actively directed by consciousness. While they are
being performed, consciousness may be otherwise engaged. &quot;The more of
the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless
custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set
free for their own proper work.&quot; While you are brushing your hair or
tying your shoes, your mind may be engaged in memorizing poetry or
calculating arithmetical problems. Habit is thus a great economizer.

The ethical consequences of habit are so striking that before leaving
the subject we must give them acknowledgment. We can do no better than
to turn to the statement by Professor James, whose wise remarks upon
the subject have not been improved upon:

&quot;The physiological study of mental conditions is thus the most powerful
ally of hortatory ethics. The hell to be endured hereafter, of which
theology tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this
world by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could
the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of
habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic
state. We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be
undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its
never-so-little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play,
excuses himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, 'I won't count
this time!' Well! he may not count it and a kind heaven may not count
it; but it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells
and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering it, and storing
it up to be used against him when the next temptation comes. Nothing we
ever do is, in strict scientific literalness, wiped out. Of course this
has its good side as well as its bad one. As we become permanent
drunkards by so many drinks, so we become saints in the moral, and
authorities and experts in the practical and scientific, spheres, by so
many separate acts and hours of work. But let no youth have any anxiety
about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If
he keep faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely
leave the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count
on waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the competent
ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he has singled out.
Silently, between all the details of his business, the _power of
judging_ in all that class of matter will have built itself up within
him as a possession that will never pass away. Young people should know
the truth of this in advance. The ignorance of it has probably
engendered more discouragement and faintheartedness in youths embarking
on arduous careers than all other causes put together.&quot;

EXERCISE

Exercise 1. Point out an undesirable habit that you are determined to
eradicate. Describe the desirable habit which you will adopt in its
place. Give the concrete steps you will take in forming the new habit.
How long a time do you estimate will be required for the formation of
the new habit? Mark down the date and refer back to it when you have
formed the habit, to see how accurately you estimated.




CHAPTER V

ACTIVE IMAGINATION


A very large part of the mental life of a student consists in the
manipulation of images. By images we mean the revivals of things that
have been impressed upon the senses. Call to mind for the moment your
house-number as it appears upon the door of your home. In so doing you
mentally reinstate something which has been impressed upon your senses
many times; and you see it almost as clearly as if it were actually
before you. The mental thing thus revived is called an image.

The word image is somewhat ill-chosen; for it usually signifies
something connected with the eye, and implies that the stuff of mental
images is entirely visual. The true fact of the matter is, we can image
practically anything that we can sense. We may have tactual images of
things touched; auditory images of things heard; gustatory images of
things tasted; olfactory images of things smelled. How these behave in
general and how they interact in study will engage our attention in
this chapter.

The most highly dramatic use of images is in connection with that
mental process known as Imagination. As we study the writings of Jack
London, Poe, Defoe, Bunyan, we move in a realm almost wholly imaginary.
And as we take a cross-section of our minds when thus engaged, we find
them filled with images. Furthermore, they are of great variety--images
of colors, sounds, tastes, smells, touches, even of sensations from our
own internal organs, such as the palpitations of the heart that
accompany feelings of pride, indignation, remorse, exaltation. A
further characteristic is that they are sharp, clean-cut, vivid.

Note in the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, the number, variety
and vividness of the images:

&quot;But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green....
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness in her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy regions stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!&quot;

We may conclude, then, that three of the desirable attributes of great
works of the imagination are _number, variety_ and _vividness_ of
mental images.

One question that frequently arises concerning works of the imagination
is, What is their source? Superficial thinkers have loosely answered,
&quot;Inspiration,&quot; implying, (according to the literal meaning of the word,
&quot;to breathe in&quot;), that some mysterious external force (called by the
ancients, &quot;A Muse&quot;) enters into the mind of the author with a special
revelation.

Psychological analysis of these imaginative works shows that this
explanation is untrue. That the bizarre and apparently novel products
arise from the experiences of the author, revived in imagination and
combined in new ways. The horrendous incidents depicted in Dante's
&quot;Divine Comedy&quot; never occurred within the lifetime experience of the
author as such. Their separate elements did, however, and furnished the
basis for Dante's clever combinations. The oft-heard saying that there
is nothing new under the sun is psychologically true.

In the light of this brief analysis of products of the imagination we
are ready to develop a program which we may follow in cultivating an
active imagination.

Recognizing that images have their source in sensory experience, we see
that the first step to take is to seek a multitude of experiences. Make
intimate acquaintance with the objects of your environment. Handle
them, tear them apart, put them together, place them next to other
objects, noting the likenesses and differences. Thus you will acquire
the stuff out of which images are made and will stock your mind with a
number of images. Then when you wish to convey your ideas you will have
a number of terms in which to do it--one of the characteristics of a
free-flowing imagination.

The second characteristic we found to be variety. To secure this, seek
a variety of sensational experiences. Perceive the objects of your
experience through several senses--touch, smell, sight, hearing,
taste. By means of this variety in sensations you will secure
corresponding variety in your images.

To revive them easily sometimes requires practice. For it has been
discovered that all people do not naturally call up images related to
the various senses with equal ease. Most people use visual and auditory
images more freely than they do other kinds. In order to develop skill
in evoking the others, practise recalling them. Sit down for an hour of
practice, as you would sit down for an hour of piano practice. Try to
recall the taste of raisins, English walnuts; the smell of hyacinths,
of witch-hazel; the rough touch of an orange-skin. Though you may at
first have difficulty you will develop, with practice, a gratifying
facility in recalling all varieties of images.

The third characteristic which we observed in works of the imagination
is vividness. To achieve this, pay close attention to the details of
your sensory experiences. Observe sharply the minute but characteristic
items--the accent mark on _après_; the coarse stubby beard of the
typical alley tough. Stock your mind with a wealth of such detailed
impressions. Keep them alive by the kind of practice recommended in the
preceding paragraph. Then describe the objects of your experience in
terms of these significant details.

We discovered, in discussing the source of imaginative works, that the
men whom we are accustomed to call imaginative geniuses do not have
unique communication with heaven or with any external reservoir of
ideas. Instead, we found their wonder-evoking creations to be merely
new combinations of old images. The true secret of their success is
their industrious utilization of past experiences according to the
program outlined above. They select certain elements from their
experiences and combine them in novel ways. This is the explanation of
their strange, beautiful and bizarre productions. This is what Carlyle
meant when he characterized genius as &quot;the transcendent capacity for
taking trouble&quot; This is what Hogarth meant when he said, &quot;Genius is
nothing but labor and diligence.&quot; For concrete exemplification of this
truth we need only turn to the autobiographies of great writers. In
this passage from &quot;John Barleycorn,&quot; Jack London describes his methods:

&quot;Early and late I was at it--writing, typing, studying grammar,
studying writing and all forms of writing, and studying the writers who
succeeded in order to find out how they succeeded. I managed on five
hours' sleep in the twenty-four, and came pretty close to working the
nineteen waking hours left to me.&quot;

By saying that the novel effects of imagination come by way of
industry, we do not mean to imply that one should strain after novelty
and eccentricity. Unusual and happy combinations will come of
themselves and naturally if one only makes a sufficient number.

There are laws of combination, known as the psychological laws of
association, by which images will unite naturally. The number of
possible combinations is infinite. By industriously making a large
number, you will by the very laws of chance, stumble upon some that are
especially happy and striking.

In summarizing this discussion, we may conclude that an active fertile
imagination comes from crowding into one's life a large number of
varied and vivid experiences; storing them up in the mind in the form
of images; and industriously recalling and combining them in novel
relationships. Mental images occur in other mental processes besides
Imagination. They bulk importantly in memorizing, as we shall see in
Chapters VI and VII; and in reasoning, as we shall see in Chapter IX.
Throughout the book we shall find that as we develop ability to
manipulate mental images, we shall increase the adaptability of all the
mental processes.

CHAPTER VI

FIRST AIDS TO MEMORY; IMPRESSION


Of all the mental operations employed by the student, memory is
probably the one in which the greatest inefficiency is manifested.
Though we often fail to realize it, much of our life is taken up with
memorizing. Every time we make use of past experience, we rely upon
this function of the mind, but in no occupation is it quite so
practically important as in study. We shall begin our investigation of
memory by dividing it into four phases or stages--Impression,
Retention, Recall and Recognition. Any act of memory involves them all.
There is first a stage when the material is being impressed; second, a
stage when it is being retained so that it may be revived in the
future; third, a stage of recall when the retained material is revived
to meet present needs; fourth, a feeling of recognition, through which
the material is recognized as having previously been in the mind.

Impression is accomplished through the sense organs; and in the
foregoing chapter we laid down the rule: Guard the avenues of
impression and admit only such things as you wish to retain. This
necessitates that you go slowly at first. This is a principle of all
habit formation, but is especially important in habits of memorizing.
Much of the poor memory that people complain about is due to the fact
that they make first impressions carelessly. One reason why people fail
to remember names is that they do not get a clear impression of the
name at the start. They are introduced in a hurry or the introducer
mumbles; consequently no clear impression is secured. Under such
circumstances how could one expect to retain and recall the name? Go
slowly, then, in impressing material for the first time. As you look up
the words of a foreign language in the lexicon, trying to memorize
their English equivalents, take plenty of time. Obtain a clear
impression of the sound and appearance of the words.

Inasmuch as impressions may be made through any of the sense organs,
one problem in the improvement of memory concerns the choice of sense
avenues. As an infant you used all senses impartially in your eager
search after information. You voraciously put things into your mouth
and discovered that some things were sweet, some sour. You bumped your
head against things and learned that some were hard and some soft. In
your insatiable curiosity you pulled things apart and peered into them;
in short, utilized all the sense organs. In adult life, however, and in
education as it takes place through the agency of books and
instructors, most learning depends upon the eye and ear. Even yet,
however, you learn many things through the sense of touch and through
muscle movement, though you may be unaware of it. You probably have
better success retaining impressions made upon one sense than another.
The majority of people retain better things that are visually
impressed. Such persons think often in terms of visual images. When
thinking of water running from a faucet, they can see the water fall,
see it splash, but have no trace of the sound. The whole event is
noiseless in memory. When they think of their instructor, they can see
him standing at his desk but cannot imagine the sound of his voice.
When striving to think of the causes leading to the Civil War, they
picture them as they are listed on the page of the text-book or
note-book. Other people have not this ability to recall in visual
terms, but depend to greater extent upon sounds. When asked to think
about their instructor, they do it in terms of his voice. When asked to
conjugate a French verb, they hear it pronounced mentally but do not
see it on the page. These are extremes of imagery type, but they
illustrate preferences as they are found in many persons. Some persons
use all senses with ease; others unconsciously work out combinations,
preferring one sense for some kinds of material and another for other
kinds. For example, one might prefer visual impression for remembering
dates in history but auditory impression for conjugating French verbs.
You will find it profitable to examine yourself and discover your
preferences. If you find that you have greater difficulty in
remembering material impressed through the ear than through the eye,
reduce things to visual terms as much as possible. Make your lecture
notes more complete or tabulate things that you wish to remember, thus
securing impression from the written form. The writer has difficulty in
remembering names that are only heard. So he asks that the name be
spelled, then projects the letters on an imaginary background, thus
forming visual stuff which can easily be recalled. If, on the contrary,
you remember best the things that you hear, you may find it a good plan
to read your lessons aloud. Many a student, upon the discovery of such
a preference, has increased his memory ability many fold by adopting
the simple expedient of reading his lessons aloud. It might be pointed
out that while you are reading aloud, you are making more than auditory
impressions. By the use of the vocal organs you are making muscular
impressions, which also aid in learning, as will be pointed out in
Chapter X.

After this discussion do not jump to the conclusion that just because
you find some difficulty in using one sense avenue for impression, it
is therefore impossible to develop it. Facility in using particular
senses can be gained by practice. To improve ability to form visual
images of things, practise calling up visions of things. Try to picture
a page of your history textbook. Can you see the headlines of the
sections and the paragraphs? To develop auditory imagery, practise
calling up sounds. Try to image your French instructor's voice in
saying _élève_. The development of these sense fields is a slow and
laborious process and one questions whether it is worth while for a
student to undertake the labor involved when another sense is already
very efficient. Probably it is most economical to Arrange impressions
so as to favor the sense that is already well developed and reliable.

Another important condition of impression is repetition. It is well
known that material which is repeated several times is remembered more
easily than that impressed but once. If two repetitions induce a given
liability to recall, four or eight will secure still greater liability
of recall. Your knowledge of brain action makes this rule intelligible,
because you know the pathway is deepened every time the nervous current
passes over it.

Experiments in the psychological laboratory have shown that it is best
in making impressions to make more than enough impressions to insure
recall. &quot;If material is to be retained for any length of time, a simple
mastery of it for immediate recall is not sufficient. It should be
learned far beyond the point of immediate reproduction if time and
energy are to be saved.&quot; This principle of learning points out the fact
that there are two kinds of memory--immediate and deferred. The first
kind involves recall immediately after impression is made; the second
involves recall at some later time. It is a well-known fact that things
learned a long time before they are to be recalled fade away. If you
are not going to recall material until a long time after the
impression, store up enough impressions so that you can afford to lose
a few and still retain enough until time for recall. Another reason for
&quot;overlearning&quot; is that when the time comes for recall you are likely to
be disturbed. If it is a time of public performance, you may be
embarrassed; or you may be hurried or under distractions. Accordingly
you should have the material exceedingly well memorized so that these
distractions will not prove detrimental.

The mere statement made above, that repetition is necessary in
impression, is not sufficient. It is important to know how to
distribute the repetitions. Suppose you are memorizing &quot;Psalm of Life&quot;
to be recited a month from to-day, and that you require thirty
repetitions of the poem to learn it. Shall you make these thirty
repetitions at one sitting? Or shall you distribute them among several
sittings? In general, it is better to spread the repetitions over a
period of time. The question then arises, what is the most effective
distribution? Various combinations are possible. You might rehearse the
poem once a day during the month, or twice a day for the first fifteen
days, or the last fifteen days, four times every fourth day, _ad
infinitum_. In the face of these possibilities is there anything that
will guide us in distributing the repetitions? We shall get some light
on the question from an examination of the curve of forgetting--a curve
that has been plotted showing the rate at which the mind tends to
forget. Forgetting proceeds according to law, the curve descending
rapidly at first and then more slowly. &quot;The larger proportion of the
material learned is forgotten the first day or so. After that a
constantly decreasing amount is forgotten on each succeeding day for
perhaps a week, when the amount remains practically stationary.&quot; This
gives us some indication that the early repetitions should be closer
together than those at the end of the period. So long as you are
forgetting rapidly you will need more repetitions in order to
counterbalance the tendency to forget. You might well make five
repetitions; then rest. In about an hour, five more; within the next
twenty-four hours, five more. By this time you should have the poem
memorized, and all within two days. You would still have fifteen
repetitions of the thirty, and these might be used in keeping the poem
fresh in the mind by a repetition every other day.

As intimated above, one important principle in memorizing is to make
the first impressions as early as possible, for older impressions have
many chances of being retained. This is evidenced by the vividness of
childhood scenes in the minds of our grandparents. An old soldier
recalls with great vividness events that happened during the Civil War,
but forgets events of yesterday. There is involved here a principle of
nervous action that you have already encountered; namely, that
impressions are more easily made and retained in youth. It should also
be observed that pathways made early have more chances of being used
than those made recently. Still another peculiarity of nervous action
is revealed in these extended periods of memorizing. It has been
discovered that if a rest is taken between impressions, the impressions
become more firmly fixed. This points to the presence of a surprising
power, by which we are able to learn, as it were, while we sleep. We
shall understand this better if we try to imagine what is happening in
the nervous system. Processes of nutrition are constantly going on. The
blood brings in particles to repair the nerve cells, rebuilding them
according to the pattern left by the last impression. Indeed, the
entrance of this new material makes the impression even more fixed. The
nutritional processes seem to set the impression much as a hypo bath
fixes or sets an impression on a photographic plate. This peculiarity
of memory led Professor James to suggest, paradoxically, that we learn
to skate in summer and to swim in winter. And, indeed, one usually
finds, in beginning the skating season, that after the initial
stiffness of muscles wears off, one glides along with surprising
agility. You see then that if you plan things rightly, Nature will do
much of your learning for you. It might be suggested that perhaps
things impressed just before going to sleep have a better chance to
&quot;set&quot; than things impressed at other times for the reason that sleep is
the time when the reparative processes of the body are most active.

Since the brain pattern requires time to &quot;set,&quot; it is important that
after the first impression you refrain from introducing anything
immediately into the mind that might disturb it. After you have
impressed the poem you are memorizing, do not immediately follow it by
another poem. Let the brain rest for three or four minutes until after
the first impressions have had a chance to &quot;set.&quot;

Now that we have regarded this &quot;unconscious memorizing&quot; from the
neurological standpoint, let us consider it from the psychological
standpoint. How are the ideas being modified during the intervals
between impressions? Modern psychology has discovered that much
memorizing goes on without our knowing it, paradoxical as that may
seem. The processes may be described in terms of the doctrine of
association, which is that whenever two things have once been
associated together in the mind, there is a tendency thereafter &quot;if the
first of them recurs, for the other to come with it.&quot; After the poem of
our illustration has once been repeated, there is a tendency for events
in everyday experience that are like it to associate themselves with
it. For example, in the course of a day or week many things might arise
and recall to you the line, &quot;Life is real, life is earnest&quot;, and it
would become, by that fact, more firmly fixed in the mind. This
valuable semi-conscious recall requires that you must make the first
impression as early as possible before the time for ultimate recall.
This persistence of ideas in the mind means &quot;that the process of
learning does not cease with the actual work of learning, but that, if
not disturbed, this process runs on of itself for a time, and adds a
little to the result of our labors. It also means that, if it is to our
advantage to stand in readiness with some word or thought, we shall be
able to do so, if only this word or thought recur to us but once, some
time before the critical moment. So we remember to keep a promise to
pay a call, to make a remark at the proper time, even though we turn
our mind to other work or talk for some hours between. We can do this
because, if not vigorously prevented, ideas and words keep on
reappearing in the mind.&quot; You may utilize this principle in
theme-writing to good advantage. As soon as the instructor announces
the subject for a theme, begin to think about it. Gather together all
the ideas you have about the subject and start your mind to work upon
it. Suppose you take as a theme-subject The Value of Training in Public
Speaking for a Business Man. The first time this is suggested to you, a
few thoughts, at least, will come to you. Write them down, even though
they are disconnected and heterogeneous. Then as you go about your
other work you will find a number of occasions that will arouse ideas
bearing upon this subject. You may read in a newspaper of a brilliant
speech made before the Chamber of Commerce by a leading business man,
which will serve as an illustration to support your affirmative
position; or you may attend a banquet where a prominent business man
disappoints his audience with a wretched speech. Such experiences, and
many others, bearing more or less directly upon the subject, will come
to you, and will call up the theme-subject, with which they will unite
themselves. Write down these ideas as they occur, and you will find
that when you start to compose the theme formally, it almost writes
itself, requiring for the most part only expansion and arrangement of
ideas. While thus organizing the theme you will reap even more benefits
from your early start, for, as you are composing it, you will find new
ideas crowding in upon you which you did not know you possessed, but
which had been associating themselves in your mind with this topic even
when you were unaware of the fact.

In writing themes, the principle of distribution of time may also be
profitably employed. After you have once written a theme, lay it aside
for a while--perhaps a week. Then when you take it up, read it in a
detached manner and you will note many places where it may be improved.
These benefits are to be enjoyed only when a theme is planned a long
time ahead. Hence the rule to start as early as possible.

Before leaving the subject of theme-writing, which was called up by the
discussion of unconscious memory, another suggestion will be given that
may be of service to you. When correcting a theme, employ more than one
sense avenue. Do not simply glance over it with your eye. Read it
aloud, either to yourself or, better still, to someone else. When you
do this you will be amazed to discover how different it sounds and what
a new view you secure of it. When you thus change your method of
composition, you will find a new group of ideas thronging into your
mind. In the auditory rendition of a theme you will discover faults of
syntax which escaped you in silent reading. You will note duplication
of words, split infinitives, mixed tenses, poorly balanced sentences.
Moreover, if your mind has certain peculiarities, you may find even
more advantages accruing from such a practice. The author, for example,
has a slightly different set of ideas at his disposal according to the
medium of expression employed. When writing with a pencil, one set of
ideas comes to mind; with a typewriter slightly different ideas arise;
when talking to an audience, still different ideas. Three sets of ideas
and three vocabularies are thus available for use on any subject. In
adopting this device of composing through several mediums, you should
combine with it the principle of distributing time already discussed in
connection with repetition of impressions. Write a theme one day,
then lay it aside for a few days and go back to it with a fresh mind.
The rests will be found very beneficial in helping you to get a new
viewpoint of the subject.

Reverting to our discussion of memory, we come upon another question:
In memorizing material like the poem of our example, should one impress
the entire poem at once, or break it up into parts, impressing a stanza
each day? Most people would respond, without thought, the latter, and,
as a matter of fact, most memorizing takes place in this way.
Experimental psychology, however, has discovered that this is
uneconomical. The selection, if of moderate length, should be impressed
as a whole. If too long for this, it should be broken up as little as
possible. In order to see the necessity for this let us examine your
experiences with the memorization of poems in your early school days.
You probably proceeded as follows: After school one day, you learned
the first stanza, then went out to play. The next day you learned the
second one, and so on. You thought at the end of a week that you had
memorized it because, at the end of each day's sitting, you were able
to recite perfectly the stanza learned that day. On &quot;speaking day&quot; you
started out bravely and recited the first stanza without mishap. When
you started to think of the second one, however, it would not come. The
memory balked. Now what was the matter? How can we explain this
distressing blank? In psychological terms, we ascribe the difficulty to
the failure to make proper associations between stanzas. Association
was made effectively between the lines of the single stanzas, but not
between the separate stanzas. After you finished impressing the first
stanza, you went about something else; playing ball, perhaps. When you
approached the poem the next day you started in with the second stanza.
There was then no bridge between the two. There was nothing to link the
last line of the first stanza,

&quot;And things are not what they seem,&quot;

with the first line of the next stanza,

&quot;Life is real, life is earnest.&quot;

This makes clear the necessity of impressing the poem as a whole
instead of by parts.

According to another classification, there are two ways of
memorizing--by rote and by logical associations. Rote memorizing
involves the repetition of material just as it stands, and usually
requires such long and laborious drill that it is seldom economical.
True, some matter must be memorized this way; such as the days of the
week and the names of the months; but there is another and gentler
method which is usually more effective and economical than that of
brutal repetition. That is the method of logical association, by which
one links up a new fact with something already in the mind. If, for
example, you wish to remember the date of the World's Fair in Chicago,
you might proceed as follows: Ask yourself, What did the Fair
commemorate? The discovery of America in 1492, the four hundredth
anniversary occurring in 1892. The Fair could not be made ready in that
year, however, so was postponed a year. Such a process of memorizing
the date is less laborious than the method of rote memory, and is
usually more likely to lead to ready recall. The old fact already in
mind acts as a magnet which at some later time may call up other facts
that had once been associated with it. You can easily see that this new
fact might have been associated with several old facts, thus securing
more chances of being called up. From this it may be inferred that the
more facts you have in your mind about a subject the more chances you
have of retaining new facts. It is sometimes thought that if a person
stores so much in his memory it will soon be so full that he cannot
memorize any more. This is a false notion, involving a conception of
the brain as a hopper into which impressions are poured until it runs
over. On the contrary, it should be regarded as an interlacing of
fibers with infinite possibilities of inter-connection, and no one ever
exhausts the number of associations that can be made.

The method of logical association may be employed with telling effect
in the study of foreign languages. When you meet a new word scrutinize
it carefully for some trace of a word already familiar to you either in
that language or in another. This independent discovery of meanings is
a very great aid in saving time and in fixing the meaning of new words.
Opportunities for this method are especially frequent in the German
language, since so many German words are formed by compounding other
words. &quot;Rathausmarkt&quot; is a long and apparently difficult German word,
and one's first temptation is to look it up in the lexicon and promptly
forget it. Let us analyze it, however, and we shall see that it is only
a compound of already familiar words. &quot;_Rat_&quot; is already familiar as
the word for counsel (&quot;_raten&quot;_ to give advice); &quot;_haus_&quot; is equally
familiar. So we see that the first part of the word means
council-house; the council-house of a city is called a city hall.
&quot;_Markt_&quot; is equally familiar as market-square, so the significance of
the entire word stands, city-hall-square. By such a method of utilizing
facts already known, you may make yourself much more independent of the
lexicon and may make your memory for foreign words much more tenacious.

We approach a phase of impression the importance of which is often
unsuspected; namely, the intention with which memorizing is done. The
fidelity of memory is greatly affected by the intention. If, at the
time of impression, you intend to retain only until the time of recall,
the material tends to slip away after that time. If, however, you
impress with the intention to retain permanently the material stays by
you better. Students make a great mistake when they study for the
purpose merely of retaining until after examination time. Intend to
retain facts permanently, and there will be greater likelihood of their
permanence.

CHAPTER VII

SECOND AIDS TO MEMORY: RETENTION, RECALL AND RECOGNITION


Our discussion up to this point has centred around the phase of memory
called impression. We have described some of the conditions favorable
to impression and have seen that certain and accurate memory depends
upon adherence to them. The next phase of memory--Retention--cannot be
described in psychological terms. We know we retain facts after they
are once impressed, but as to their status in the mind we can say
nothing. If you were asked when the Declaration of Independence was
signed, you would reply instantly. When asked, however, where that fact
was five minutes ago, you could not answer. Somewhere in the recesses
of the mind, perhaps, but as to immediate awareness of it, there was
none. We may try to think of retention in terms of nerve cells and say
that at the time when the material was first impressed there was some
modification made in certain nerve cells which persisted. This trait of
nerve modifiability is one factor which accounts for greater retentive
power in some persons than in others. It must not be concluded,
however, that all good memory is due to the inheritance of this trait.
It is due partly to observance of proper conditions of impression, and
much can be done to overcome or offset innate difficulty of
modification by such observance.

We are now ready to examine the third phase of memory--Recall. This is
the stage at which material that has been impressed and retained is
recalled to serve the purpose for which it was memorized. Recall is
thus the goal of memory, and all the devices so far discussed have it
for their object. Can we facilitate recall by any other means than by
faithful and intelligent impressions? For answer let us examine the
state of mind at time of recall.

We find that it is a unique mental state. It differs from impression in
being a period of more active search for facts in the mind accompanied
by expression, instead of a concentration upon the external impression.
It is also usually accompanied by motor expressions, either talking or
writing. Since recall is a unique mental state, you ought to prepare
for it by means of a rehearsal. When you are memorizing anything to be
recalled, make part of your memorizing a rehearsal of it, if possible,
under same conditions as final recall. In memorizing from a book, first
make impression, then close the book and practise recall. When
memorizing a selection to be given in a public speaking class,
intersperse the periods of impression with periods of recall. This is
especially necessary in preparation for public speaking, for facing an
audience gives rise to a vastly different psychic attitude from that of
impression. The sight of an audience may be embarrassing or exciting.
Furthermore, unforeseen distractions may arise. Accordingly, create
those conditions as nearly as possible in your preparation. Imagine
yourself facing the audience. Practise aloud so that you will become
accustomed to the sound of your own voice. The importance of the
practice of recall as a part of the memory process can hardly be
overestimated. One psychologist has advised that in memorizing
significant material more than half the time should be spent in
practising recall.

There still remains a fourth phase of memory--Recognition. Whenever a
remembered fact is recalled, it is accompanied by a characteristic
feeling which we call the feeling of recognition. It has been described
as a feeling of familiarity, a glow of warmth, a sense of ownership, a
feeling of intimacy. As you walk down the street of a great city you
pass hundreds of faces, all of them strange. Suddenly in the crowd you
catch sight of some one you know and are instantly suffused with a glow
of feeling that is markedly different from your feeling toward the
others. That glow represents the feeling of recognition. It is always
present during recall and may be used in great advantage in studying.
It derives its virtue for our purpose from the fact that it is a
feeling, and at the time of feeling the bodily activities in general
are affected. Changes occur in heart beat, breathing; various glandular
secretions are affected, the digestive organs respond. In this general
quickening of bodily activity we have reason to believe that the
nervous system partakes, and things become impressed more readily. Thus
the feeling of recognition that accompanies recall is responsible for
one of the benefits of reviews. At such a time material once memorized
becomes tinged with a feelingful color different from that which
accompanied it when new. Review, then, not merely to produce additional
impressions, but also to take advantage of the feeling of recognition.

We have now discussed memory in its four phases and have seen clearly
that it operates not in a blind, chaotic manner, but according to law.
Certain conditions are required and when they are met memory is good.
After providing proper conditions for memory, then, trust your memory.
An attitude of confidence is very necessary. If, when you are
memorizing, you continually tremble for fear that you will not recall
at the desired moment, the fixedness of the impression will be greatly
hindered. Therefore, after utilizing all your knowledge about the
conditions of memorizing, rest content and trust to the laws of Nature.
They will not fail you.

By this time you have seen that memory is not a mysterious mental
faculty with which some people are generously endowed, and of which
others are deprived. All people of normal intelligence can remember and
can improve their ability if they desire. The improvement does not take
the form that some people expect, however. No magic wand can transform
you into a good memorizes You must work the transformation yourself.
Furthermore, it is not an instantaneous process to be accomplished
overnight. It will come about only after you have built up a set of
habits, according to our conception of study as a process of habit
formation.

A final word of caution should be added. Some people think of memory as
a separate division or compartment of the mind which can be controlled
and improved by exercising it alone. Such a conception is fallacious.
Improvement in memory will involve improvement in other mental
abilities, and you will find that as you improve your ability to
remember, you will develop at the same time better powers to
concentrate attention, to image, to associate facts and to reason.

CHAPTER VIII

CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION


Nearly everyone has difficulty in the concentration of attention. Brain
workers in business and industry, students in high school and college,
and even professors in universities, complain of the same difficulty.
Attention seems in some way to be at the very core of mental activity,
for no matter from what aspect we view the mind, its excellence seems
to depend upon the power to concentrate attention. When we examine a
growing infant, one of the first signs by which we judge the awakening
of intelligence is the power to pay attention or to &quot;notice things.&quot;
When we examine the intellectual ability of normal adults we do so by
means of tests that require close concentration of attention. In
judging the intelligence of people with whom we associate every day, we
regard one who is able to maintain close attention for long periods of
time as a person of strong mind. We rate Thomas Edison as a powerful
thinker when we read that he becomes so absorbed in work that he
neither eats nor sleeps. Finally, when we examine the insane and the
feeble-minded, we find that one form which their derangements take is
an inability to control the attention. This evidence, added to our own
experience, shows us the importance of concentration of attention in
study and we become even more desirous of investigating attention to
see how we may develop it.

We shall be better able to discuss attention if we select for analysis
a concrete situation when the mind is in a state of concentrated
attention. Concentrate for a moment upon the letter O. Although you are
ostensibly focussing all your powers of attention upon the letter,
nevertheless you are really aware of a number of things besides: of
other words on the page; of other objects in the field of vision; of
sounds in the room and on the street; of sensations from your clothing;
and of sensations from your bodily organs, such as the heart and lungs.
In addition to these sensations, you will find, if you introspect
carefully enough, that your mind also contains a number of ideas and
imaginings; thoughts about the paragraph you just read or about one of
your lessons. Thus we see that at a time when we apparently focus our
attention upon but one thing, we really have a large number of things
in our mind, and they are of a great variety. The mental field might be
represented by a circle, at the centre of which is the object of
attention. It may be an object in the external world perceived through
one of the senses, or it may be an idea we are thinking about, such,
for example, as the idea of infinity. But whether the thing attended to
is a perception or an idea, we may properly speak of it as the object
of attention or the &quot;focal&quot; object. In addition to this, we must
recognize the presence of a large number of other objects, both sensory
and ideational. These are nearer the margin of the mental field, so we
call them &quot;marginal.&quot;

The distinctive thing about a state of mind such as that just described
is that the focal object is much clearer than the marginal objects. For
example, when you fixated the letter O, it was only in the vaguest sort
of fashion that you were aware of the contact of your clothing or the
lurking ideas of other lessons. As we examine these marginal objects
further, we find that they are continually seeking to crowd into the
centre of attention and to become clear. You may be helped in forming a
vivid picture of conditions if you think of the mind as a stream ever
in motion, and as it flows on, the objects in it continually shift
their positions. A cross-section of the stream at any moment may show
the contents of the mind arranged in a particular pattern, but at the
very next moment they may be arranged in a different pattern, another
object occupying the focus, while the previous tenant is pushed to the
margin. Thus we see that it is a tendency of the mind to be forever
changing. If left to itself, it would be in ceaseless fluctuation, the
whim of every passing fancy. This tendency to fluctuate comes with more
or less regularity, some psychologists say every second or two. True,
we do not always yield to the fluctuating tendency, nevertheless we are
recurrently tempted, and we must exercise continuous effort to keep a
particular object at the focus. The power to exert effort and to
regulate the arrangement of our states of mind is the peculiar gift of
man, and is a prime function of education. Viewed in this light, then,
we see that the voluntary focusing of our attention consists in the
selecting of certain objects to be attended to, and the ignoring of
other objects which act as distractions. We may conveniently classify
the latter as external sensations, bodily sensations and irrelevant
ideas.

Let us take an actual situation that may arise in study and see how
this applies. Suppose you are in your room studying about Charlemagne,
a page of your history text occupying the centre of your attention. The
marginal distractions in such a case would consist, first, in external
sensations, such as the glare from your study-lamp, the hissing of the
radiator, the practising of a neighboring vocalist, the rattle of
passing street-cars. The bodily distractions might consist of
sensations of weariness referred to the back, the arms and the eyes,
and fainter sensations from the digestive organs, heart and lungs. The
irrelevant ideas might consist of thoughts about a German lesson which
you are going to study, visions of a face, or thoughts about some
social engagement. These marginal objects are in the mind even when you
conscientiously focus your mind upon the history lesson, and, though
vague, they try to force their way into the focus and become clear. The
task of paying attention, then, consists in maintaining the desired
object at the centre of the mental field and keeping the distractions
away. With this definition of attention, we see that in order to
increase the effectiveness of attention during study, we must devise
means for overcoming the distractions peculiar to study. Obviously the
first thing is to eliminate every distraction possible. Such a plan of
elimination may require a radical rearrangement of study conditions,
for students often fail to realize how wretched their conditions of
study are from a psychological standpoint. They attempt to study in
rooms with two or three others who talk and move about continually;
they drop down in any spot in the library and expose themselves
needlessly to a great number of distractions. If you wish to become a
good student, you must prepare conditions as favorable as possible for
study. Choose a quiet room to live in, free from distracting sounds and
sights. Have your room at a temperature neither too hot nor too cold;
68° F. is usually considered favorable for study. When reading in the
library, sit down in a quiet spot, with your back to the door, so you
will not be tempted to look up as people enter the room. Do not sit
near a group of gossipers or near a creaking door. Having made the
external conditions favorable for study, you should next address
yourself to the task of eliminating bodily distractions. The most
disturbing of these in study are sensations of fatigue, for, contrary
to the opinion of many people, study is very fatiguing work and
involves continual strain upon the muscles in holding the body still,
particularly those of the back, neck, arms, hands and, above all, the
eyes. How many movements are made by your eyes in the course of an
hour's study! They sweep back and forth across the page incessantly,
being moved by six muscles which are bound to become fatigued. Still
more fatigue comes from the contractions of delicate muscles within the
eyeball, where adjustments are made for far and near vision and for
varying amounts of light. The eyes, then, give rise to much fatigue,
and, altogether, are the source of a great many bodily distractions in
study.

Other distractions may consist of sensations from the clothing. We are
always vaguely aware of pressure of our clothing. Usually it is not
sufficiently noticeable to cause much annoyance, but occasionally it
is, as is demonstrated at night when we take off a shoe with such a
sigh of relief that we realize in retrospect it had been vaguely
troubling us all day.

In trying to create conditions for efficient study, many bodily
distractions can be eliminated. The study chair should be easy to sit
in so as to reduce fatigue of the muscles supporting the body; the
book-rest should be arranged so as to require little effort to hold the
book; the light should come over the left shoulder. This is especially
necessary in writing, so that the writing hand will not cast a shadow
upon the work. The muscles of the eyes will be rested and fatigue will
be retarded if you close the eyes occasionally. Then in order to lessen
the general fatigue of the body, you may find it advantageous to rise
and walk about occasionally. Lastly, the clothing should be loose and
unconfining; especially should there be plenty of room for circulation.

In the overcoming of distractions, we have seen that much may be done
by way of eliminating distractions, and we have pointed out the way to
accomplish this to a certain extent. But in spite of our most careful
provisions, there will still be distractions that cannot be eliminated.
You cannot, for example, chloroform the vocalist in the neighboring
apartment, nor stop the street-cars while you study; you cannot rule
out fatigue sensations entirely, and you cannot build a fence around
the focus of your mind so as to keep out unwelcome and irrelevant
ideas. The only thing to do then is to accept as inevitable the
presence of some distractions, and to realise that to pay attention, it
is necessary to habituate yourself to the ignoring of distractions.

In the accomplishment of this end it will be necessary to apply the
principles of habit formation already described. Start out by making a
strong determination to ignore all distractions. Practise ignoring
them, and do not let a slip occur. Try to develop interest in the
object of attention, because we pay attention to those things in which
we are most interested. A final point that may help you is to use the
first lapse of attention as a reminder of the object you desire to
fixate upon. This may be illustrated by the following example: Suppose,
in studying a history lesson, you come upon a reference to the royal
apparel of Charlemagne. The word &quot;royal&quot; might call up purple, a
Northwestern University pennant, the person who gave it to you, and
before you know it you are off in a long day-dream leading far from the
history lesson. Such migrations as these are very likely to occur in
study, and constitute one of the most treacherous pitfalls of student
life. In trying to avoid them, you must form habits of disregarding
irrelevant ideas when they try to obtrude themselves. And the way to do
this is to school yourself so that the first lapse of attention will
remind you of the lesson in hand. It can be done if you keep yourself
sensitive to wanderings of attention, and let the first slip from the
topic with which you are engaged remind you to pull yourself back. Do
this before you have taken the step that will carry you far away, for
with each step in the series of associations it becomes harder to draw
yourself back into the correct channel.

In reading, one frequent cause for lapses of attention and for the
intrusion of unwelcome ideas is obscurity in the material being read.
If you trace back your lapses of attention, you will often find that
they first occur when the thought becomes difficult to follow, the
sentence ambiguous, or a single word unusual. As a result, the meaning
grows hazy in your mind and you fail to comprehend it. Naturally, then,
you drift into a channel of thought that is easier to follow. This
happens because the mental stream tends to seek channels of least
resistance. If you introspect carefully, you will undoubtedly discover
that many of your annoying lapses of attention can be traced to such
conditions. The obvious remedy is to make sure that you understand
everything as you read. As soon as you feel the thought growing
difficult to follow, begin to exert more effort; consult the dictionary
for the meanings of words you do not understand. Probably the ordinary
freshman in college ought to look up the meaning of as many as twenty
words daily.

Again, the thought may be difficult to follow because your previous
knowledge is deficient; perhaps the discussion involves some fact which
you never did comprehend clearly, and you will naturally fail to
understand something built upon it. If deficiency of knowledge is the
cause of your lapses of attention, the obvious remedy is to turn back
and study the fundamental facts; to lay a firm foundation in your
subjects of study.

This discussion shows that the conditions at time of concentrated
attention are very complex; that the mind is full of a number of
things; that your object as a student is to keep some one thing at the
focus of your mind, and that in doing so you must continuously ignore
other mental contents. In our psychological descriptions we have
implied that the mind stands still at times, permitting us to take a
cross-section and examine it minutely. As a matter of fact, the mind
never stands still. It continually moves along, and at no two moments
is it exactly the same. This results in a condition whereby an idea
which is at one moment at the centre cannot remain there unless it
takes on a slightly different appearance from moment to moment. When
you attempted to fix your attention upon the letter O, you found a
constant tendency to shift the attention, perhaps to a variation in the
intensity of the type or to a flaw in the type or in the paper. In view
of the inevitable nature of these changes, you see that in spite of
your best efforts you cannot expect to maintain any object of study
inflexibly at the centre of attention. The way to do is to manipulate
the object so that it will appear from moment to moment in a slightly
different light. If, for example, you are trying to concentrate upon a
rule of English grammar long enough to memorize it, do not read it over
and over again, depending solely upon repetition. A better way, after
thoroughly comprehending it, is to think about it in several relations;
compare it with other rules, noting points of likeness and difference;
apply it to the construction of a sentence. The essential thing is to
do something with it. Only thus can you keep it in the focus of
attention. This is equivalent to the restatement of another fact
stressed in a previous chapter, namely, that the mind is not a passive
thing that stands still, but an active thing. When you give attention,
you actively select from a number of possible objects one to be clearer
than the rest. This selection requires effort under most conditions of
study, but you may be cheered by the thought that as you develop
interest in the fields of study, and as you develop habits of ignoring
distractions, you will be able to fixate your attention with less and
less effort. A further important fact is that as you develop power to
select objects for the consideration of attention, you develop
simultaneously other mental processes--the ability to memorize, to
economize time and effort and to control future thoughts and actions.
In short, power to concentrate attention means power in all the mental
processes.

EXERCISES

Exercise I. &quot;Watch a small dot so far away that it can just be seen.

go?&quot; Make what inference you can from this regarding the fluctuation of
attention during study.

eliminate them; to ignore the unavoidable ones?




CHAPTER IX

HOW WE REASON


If you were asked to describe the most embarrassing of your class-room
experiences, you would probably cite the occasions when the instructor
asks you a series of questions demanding close reasoning. As he pins
you down to statement of facts and forces you to draw valid
conclusions, you feel in a most perplexed frame of mind. Either you
find yourself unable to give reasons, or you entangle yourself in
contradictions. In short, you flounder about helplessly and feel as
though the bottom of your ship of knowledge has dropped out. And when
the ordeal is over and you have made a miserable botch of a recitation
which you thought you had been perfectly prepared for, you complain
that &quot;if the instructor had followed the book,&quot; or &quot;if he had asked
straight questions,&quot; you would have answered every one perfectly,
having memorized the lesson &quot;word for word.&quot;

This complaint, so often voiced by students, reveals the fundamental
characteristic which distinguishes the mental operation of reasoning
from the others we have studied. In reasoning we face a new kind of
situation presenting difficulties not encountered in the simpler
processes of sensation, memory, and imagery, and when we attempt to
substitute these simple processes for reasoning, we fail miserably, for
the two kinds of processes are essentially different, and cannot be
substituted one for the other.

Broadly speaking, the mental activities of study may be divided into
two groups, which, for want of better names, we shall call processes of
acquisition and processes of construction. The mental attitude of the
first is that of acquirement. &quot;Sometimes our main business seems to be
to acquire knowledge; certain matters are placed before us in books or
by our teachers, and we are required to master them, to make them part
of our stock of knowledge. At other times we are called upon to use the
knowledge we already possess in order to attain some end that is set
before us.&quot; &quot;In geography, for example, so long as we are merely
learning the bare facts of the subject, the size and contours of the
different continents, the political divisions, the natural features, we
are at the acquisitive stage.&quot; &quot;But when we go on to try to find out
the reasons why certain facts that we have learned should be as they
are and not otherwise, we pass to the constructive stage. We are
working constructively when we seek to discover why it is that great
cities are so often found on the banks of rivers, why peninsulas more
frequently turn southward than northward.&quot; You readily see that this
constructive method of study involves the setting and solving of
problems as its distinguishing feature, and that in the solution of
these problems we make use of reason.

A little reflection will show that though there is a distinct
difference between processes of acquisition and of construction,
nevertheless the two must not be regarded as entirely separate from
each other. &quot;In acquiring new facts we must always use a little reason,
while in constructive work, we cannot always rely upon having all the
necessary matter ready to hand. We have frequently to stop our
constructive work for a little in order to acquire some new facts that
we find to be necessary. Thus we acquire a certain number of new facts
while we are reasoning about things, and while we are engaged in
acquiring new matter we must use our reason at least to some small
extent.&quot; The two overlap, then. But there is a difference between them
from the standpoint of the student, and the terms denote two
fundamentally different attitudes which students take in study. The two
attitudes may be illustrated by contrasting the two methods often used
in studying geometry. Some students memorize the theorem and the steps
in the demonstration, reciting them verbatim at class-hour. Others do
not memorize, but reason out each step to see its relation to the
preceding step, and when they see it must necessarily follow, they pass
on to the next and do the same. These two types of students apparently
arrive at the same conclusions, but the mental operations leading up to
the Q.E.D. of each are vastly different. The one student does his
studying by the rote memory method, the other by the road of reasoning.
The former road is usually considered the easier, and so we find it
most frequently followed. To memorize a table, a definition, or a
series of dates is relatively easy. One knows exactly where one is, and
can keep track of one's progress and test one's success. Some people
are attracted by such a task and are perfectly happy to follow this
plan of study. The kind of mind that contents itself with such
phonographic records, however, must be acknowledged to be a commonplace
sort of affair. We recognize its limitations in ordinary life,
invariably rating it lower than the mind that can reason to new
conclusions and work independently. Accordingly, if we wish to possess
minds of superior quality, we see that we must develop the reasoning
processes.

When we examine the mental processes by which we think constructively,
or, in other words, reason, we find first of all that there is
recognition of a problem to be solved. When we start to reason, we do
it because we find ourselves in a situation from which we must
extricate ourselves. The situation may be physical, as when our
automobile stops suddenly on a country road; or it may be mental, as
when we are deciding what college to attend. In both cases, we
recognize that we are facing a problem which must be solved.

After recognition of the problem, our next step is to start vigorous
efforts to solve it. In doing this, we cast about for means; we summon
all the powers at our disposal. In the case of the automobile, we call
to mind other accidents and the causes of them; we remember that once
the spark-plug played out, so we test this hypothesis. At another time
some dust got into the carburetor, so we test this. So we go on,
calling up possible causes and applying appropriate remedies until the
right one is found and the engine is started. In bringing to bear upon
the problem facts from our past experience, we form a series of
judgments. In the case of the problem as to what college to attend, we
might form these judgments: this college is nearer home; that one has a
celebrated faculty; this one has good laboratories; that one is my
father's alma mater. So we might go on, bringing up all the facts
regarding the problem and fitting each one mentally to see how it
works. Note that this utilization of ideas should not consist merely of
fumbling about in a vague hope of hitting upon some solution. It must
be a systematic search, guided by carefully chosen ideas. For example,
&quot;if the clock on the mantle-piece has stopped, and we have no idea how
to make it go again, but mildly shake it in the hope that something
will happen to set it going, we are merely fumbling. But if, on moving
the clock gently so as to set the pendulum in motion, we hear it
wobbling about irregularly, and at the same time observe that there is
no ticking of any kind, we come to the conclusion that the pendulum has
somehow or other escaped the little catch that connects it with the
mechanism, we have been really thinking. From the fact that the
pendulum wobbles irregularly, we infer that it has lost its proper
catch. From the fact that there is no ticking, we infer the same thing,
for even when there is something wrong with the clock that will prevent
it from going permanently, if the pendulum is set in motion by force
from without it will tick for a few seconds before it comes to rest
again. The important point to observe is that there must be inference.
This is always indicated by the word _therefore_ or its equivalent. If
you reach a conclusion without having to use or at any rate to imply a
_therefore_, you may take it for granted that you have not been really
thinking, but only jumping to conclusions.&quot;

This process of putting facts in the form of judgments and drawing
inferences, may be likened to a court-room scene where arguments are
presented to the judge. As each bit of evidence is submitted, it is
subjected to the test of its applicability to the situation or to
similar situations in the past. It is rigidly examined and nothing is
accepted as a candidate for the solution until it is found by trial (of
course, in imagination) to be pertinent to the situation.

The third stage of the reasoning process comes when some plan which has
been suggested as a possible solution of the difficulty proves
effective, and we make the decision; the arguments support or overthrow
each other, adding to and eliminating various considerations until
finally only one course appears possible. As we said before, the
solution comes inevitably, as represented by the word _therefore_.
Little active work on our part is necessary, for if we have gone
through these other phases properly the decision will make itself. You
cannot make a wrong decision if you have the facts before you and have
given each the proper weight. When the solution comes, it is recognized
as right, for it comes tinged with a feeling that we call belief.

Now that we have found the reasoning process to be one of
problem-solving, of which the first step is to acknowledge and
recognize the difficulty, the second, to call up various methods of
solution, and the third, to decide on the basis of one of the solutions
that comes tinged with certainty, we are ready to apply this schema to
study in the hope that we may discover the causes and remedies for the
reasoning difficulties of students. In view of the fact that reasoning
starts out with a problem, you see at once that to make your study
effective you must study in problems. Avoid an habitual attitude of
mere acquisition. Do not memorize facts in the same pattern as they are
handed out to you. In history, in general literature, in science, do
not read facts merely as they come in the text, but seek the relations
between them. Voluntarily set before yourself intellectual problems.
Ask yourself, _why_ is this so? In other words, in your study do not
merely acquire, but also _construct_. The former makes use mostly of
memory and though your memorizing be done ever so conscientiously, if
it comprise the main part of your study, you fail to utilize your mind
to its fullest extent.

Let us now consider the second stage of the reasoning process as found
in study. At this stage the facts in the mind are brought forward for
the purpose of being fitted into the present situation, and the
essential thing is that you have a large number of facts at your
disposal. If you are going to reason effectively about problems in
history, mathematics, geography, it is absolutely indispensable that
you know many facts about the subjects. One reason why you experience
difficulty in reasoning about certain subjects is that you do not know
enough about them. Particularly is this true in such subjects as
political economy, sociology and psychology. The results of such
ignorance are often demonstrated in political and social movements. Why
do the masses so easily fall victims to doubtful reforms in national
and municipal policies? Because they do not know enough about these
matters to reason intelligently. Watch ignorant people listening to a
demagogue and see what unreasonable things they accept. The speaker
propounds a question and then proceeds to answer it in his own way. He
makes it appear plausible, assuring his hearers it is the only way, and
they agree because they do not have enough other facts at their command
to refute it. They are unable, as we say, to see the situation in
several aspects. The mistakes in reasoning which children make have a
similar basis. The child reaches for the moon, reasoning--&quot;Here is
something bright; I can touch most bright things; therefore, I can
touch this.&quot; His reasoning is fallacious because he does not have all
the facts. This condition is paralleled in the class-room when students
make what are shamefacedly looked back upon as miserable blunders. When
one of these fiascos occurs the cause can many times be referred to the
fact that the student did not have enough facts at his command.
Speaking broadly, the most effective reasoning in a field can be done
by one who has had the most extensive experiences in that field. If one
had complete acquaintance with all facts, one would have perfect
conditions for reasoning. Thus we see that effectiveness in reasoning
demands an extensive array of facts. Accordingly, in your courses of
study you must read with avidity. When you are given a list of readings
in a course, some of which are required and some optional, read both
sets, and every new fact thus secured will make you better able to
reason in the field.

But good reasoning demands more than mere quantity of ideas. The ideas
must conform to certain qualitative standards before they may be
effectively employed in reasoning. They must arise with promptness, in
an orderly manner, pertinent to the matter in hand, and they must be
clear. In securing promptness of association on the part of your ideas,
employ the methods described in the chapter on memory. Make many
logical associations with clearness and repetition. In order to insure
the rise of ideas in an orderly manner, pay attention to the manner in
which you acquire them.

Remember, things will be recalled as they were impressed, so the value
of your ideas in reasoning will depend upon the manner in which you
make original impressions. A further characteristic of serviceable
ideas is clarity. Ideas are sometimes described as &quot;clear&quot; in
opposition to &quot;muddy.&quot; You know what is meant by these distinctions,
and you may be assured that one cause for your failures in reasoning is
that your ideas are not clear. This manifests itself in inability to
make clear statements and to comprehend clearly. The latter condition
is easily illustrated. When you began the study of geometry you faced a
multitude of new terms; we call them technical terms, such as
projection, scalene, theory of limits. These had to be clearly
understood before you could reason in the subject. And when, in the
progress of your study, you experienced difficulty in reasoning out
problems, it was very likely due to the fact that you did not master
the technical terms, and as soon as you encountered the difficulties of
the course, you failed because your foundation laying did not involve
the acquisition of clear ideas. Examine your difficulties in reasoning
subjects and if you find them traceable to vagueness of ideas, take
steps to clarify them.

Ideas may be clarified in two ways: by definition and by
classification. Definition is a familiar device, for you have had much
to do with it in learning. The memorization of definitions is an
excellent practice, not as an end in itself, but as a means to the end
of effective reasoning. Throughout your study, then, pay much attention
to definitions. Some you will find in your texts, but others you will
have to make for yourself. In order to get practice in this, undertake
the manufacture of a few definitions, using terms such as charity,
benevolence, natural selection. This exercise will reveal what an
exacting mental operation definition is and will prove how vague most of
your thinking really is.

A large stock of definitions will help you to think rapidly. Standing
as they do for a large group of experiences, definitions are a means of
mental economy. For illustration of their service in reasoning, suppose
you were asked to compare the serf, the peon and the American slave. If
you have a clean-cut definition of each of these terms, you can readily
differentiate between them, but if you cannot define them, you will
hardly be able to reason concerning them.

The second means of clarifying ideas is classification. By this is
meant the process of grouping similar ideas or similar points of ideas.
For example, your ideas of serf, peon and slave have some points in
common. Group the ideas, then, with reference to these points. Then in
reasoning you can quickly place an idea in its proper group.

The third stage of the reasoning process is decision, based on belief,
and it comes inevitably, provided the other two processes have been
performed rightly. Accordingly, we need say little about its place in
study. One caution should be pointed out in making decisions. Do not
make them hastily on the basis of only one or two facts. Wait until you
have canvassed all the ideas that bear importantly upon the case. The
masses that listen top eagerly to the demagogue do not err merely from
lack of ideas, but partly because they do not utilize all the facts at
their disposal. This fault is frequently discernible in impulsive
people, who notoriously make snap-judgments, which means that they
decide before canvassing all the evidence. This trait marks the
fundamental difference between superficial and profound thinkers. The
former accept surface facts and decide immediately, while the latter
refuse to decide until after canvassing many facts.

In the improvement of reasoning ability your task is mainly one of
habit formation. It is necessary, first, to form the habit of stating
things in the form of problems; second, to form habits by which ideas
arise promptly and profusely; third, to form habits of reserving
decisions until the important facts are in. These are all specific
habits that must be built up if the reasoning processes of the mind are
to be effective. Already you have formed some habits, if not habits of
careful looking into things, then habits of hasty, heedless, impatient
glancing over the surface. Apply the principles of habit formation
already enunciated, and remember that with every act of reasoning you
perform, you are moulding yourself into a careless reasoner or an
accurate reasoner, into a clear thinker or a muddy thinker. This
chapter shows that reasoning is one of the highest powers of man. It is
a mark of originality and intelligence, and stamps its possessor not a
copier but an originator, not a follower but a leader, not a slave, to
have his thinking foisted upon him by others, but a free and
independent intellect, unshackled by the bonds of ignorance and
convention. The man who employs reason in acquiring knowledge, finds
delights in study that are denied to a rote memorizer. When one looks
at the world through glasses of reason, inquiring into the eternal
_why_, then facts take on a new meaning, knowledge comes with new
power, the facts of experience glow with vitality, and one's own
relations with them appear in a new light.

CHAPTER X

EXPRESSION AS AN AID IN STUDY


In our discussion of the nervous basis underlying study we observed
that nerve pathways are affected not only by what enters over the
sensory pathways, but also by what flows out over the motor pathways.
As the nerve currents travel out from the motor centres in the brain to
the muscles, they leave traces which modify future thoughts and
actions. This being so, it is easy to see that what we give out is
fully as important as what we take in; in other words, our
_expressions_ are just as important as our _impressions_. By
expressions we mean the motor consequences of our thoughts, and in
study they usually take the form of speech and writing of a kind to be
specified later.

The far-reaching effects of motor expressions are too infrequently
emphasized, but psychology forces us to give them prime consideration.
We are first apprised of their importance when we study the nervous
system, and find that every incoming sensory message pushes on and on
until it finds a motor pathway over which it may travel and produce
movement. This is inevitable. The very structure and arrangement of the
neurones is such that we are obliged to make some movement in response
to objects affecting our sense organs. The extent of movement may vary
from the wide-spread tremors that occur when we are frightened by a
thunderstorm to the merest flicker of an eye-lash. But whatever be its
extent, movement invariably occurs when we are stimulated by some
object. This has been demonstrated in startling ways in the
psychological laboratory, where even so simple a thing as a piece of
figured wall-paper has been shown to produce measurable bodily
disturbances. Ordinarily we do not notice these because they are so
slight, sometimes being merely twitches of deep-seated muscles or
slight enlargements or contractions of arteries which are very
responsive to nerve currents. But no matter how large or how small, we
may be sure that movements always occur on the excitation of a sense
organ. This led us to assert in an earlier chapter that the function of
the nervous system is to convert incoming sensory currents into
outgoing motor currents.

So ingrained is this tendency toward movement that we do not need even
a sensory cue to start it off; an idea will do as well. In other words,
the nervous current need not start at a sense organ, but may start in
the brain and still produce movement. This fact is embodied in the law
of ideo-motor action (distinguished from sensory-motor action), &quot;every
idea in the mind tends to express itself in movement.&quot; This motor
character of ideas is manifested in a most thorough-going way and
renders our muscular system a faithful mirror of our thoughts. We have
in the psychological laboratory delicate apparatus which enables us to
measure many of these slight movements. For example, we fasten a
recording device to the top of a person's head, so that his slightest
movements will be recorded, then we ask him while standing perfectly
still to think of an object at his right side. After several moments
the record shows that he involuntarily leans in the direction of the
object about which he is thinking. We find further illustration of this
law when we examine people as they read, for they involuntarily
accompany the reading with movements of speech, measurable in the
muscles of the throat, the tongue and the lips. These facts, and many
others, constitute good evidence for the statement that ideas seek
expression in movement.

The ethical consequences of this are so momentous that we must remark
upon them in passing. We now see the force of the biblical statement,
&quot;Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that
which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.&quot; Think what
it means to one's character that every thought harbored in the mind is
bound to come out. It may not manifest itself at once in overt action,
but it affects the motor pathways and either weakens or strengthens
connections so that when the opportunity comes, some act will be
furthered or hindered. In view of the proneness to permit base thoughts
to enter the mind, human beings might sometimes fear even to think. A
more optimistic idea, however, is that noble thoughts lead to noble
acts. Therefore, keep in your mind the kind of thoughts that you wish
to see actualized in your character and the appropriate acts will
follow of their own accord.

But it is with the significance of expressions in study that we are at
present concerned, and here we find them of supreme importance. We
ordinarily regard learning as a process of taking things into the mind,
and regard expression as a thing apart from acquisition of knowledge.
We shall find in this discussion, however, that there is no such sharp
demarcation between acquiring knowledge and expressing knowledge, but
that the two are intimately bound together, expressions being properly
a part of wise and economical learning.

When we survey the modes of expression that may be used in study, we
find them to be of several kinds. Speech is one. This is the form of
expression for which the class-recitation is provided. If you wish to
grow as a student, utilize the recitation period and welcome every
chance to recite orally, for things about which you recite in class are
more effectively learned. Talking about a subject under all
circumstances will help you learn. When studying subjects like
political economy, sociology or psychology, seize every opportunity to
talk over the questions involved. Hold frequent conferences with your
instructor; voice your difficulties freely, and the very effort to
state them will help to clarify them. It is a good plan for two
students in the same course to come together and talk over the
problems; the debates thus stimulated and the questions aroused by
mental interaction are very helpful in impressing facts more vividly
upon the mind.

Writing is a form of expression and is one thing that gives value to
note-taking and examinations. Its value is further recognized by the
requirements of themes and term-papers. These are all mediums by which
you may develop yourself, and they merit your earnest cooperation.

Another medium of expression that students may profitably employ is
drawing. This is especially valuable in such subjects as geology,
physiology and botany. Students in botany are compelled to do much
drawing of the plant-forms which they study, and this is a wise
requirement, for it makes them observe more carefully, report more
faithfully and recall with greater ease. You may secure the same
advantages by employing the graphic method in other studies. For
example, when reading in a geology text-book about the stratification
of the earth in a certain region, draw the parts described and label
them according to the description. You will be surprised to see how
clear the description becomes and how easily it is later recalled.

Let us examine the effects of the expressive movements of speech,
writing and the like, and see the mechanism by which they facilitate
the study process. We may describe their effects in two ways:
neurologically and psychologically. As may be expected from our
preliminary study of the nervous system, we see their first effects
upon the motor pathways leading out to the muscles. Each passage of the
nerve current from brain to muscle leaves traces so that the resulting
act is performed with greater ease upon each repetition. This fact has
already been emphasized by the warning, Guard the avenues of
expression.

Especially is it important at the first performance of an act,
because this determines the path of later performances. In such studies
as piano-playing, vocalizing and pronunciation of foreign words, see
that your first performance is absolutely right, then as the expressive
movements are repeated, they will be more firmly ingrained because of
the deepening of the motor pathways.

The next effect of acts of expression is to be found in the
modifications made in the sensory areas of the brain. You will recall
that every movement of a muscle produces nervous currents which go back
to the brain and register there in the form of kinaesthetic sensations.
To demonstrate kinaesthetic sensations, close your eyes and move your
index finger up and down. You can feel the muscles contracting and the
tendons moving back and forth, even into the back of the hand. These
sensations ordinarily escape our attention, but they occupy a prominent
place in the control of our actions. For example, when ascending
familiar stairs in the dark, they notify us when we have reached the
top. We are still further impressed with their importance when we are
deprived of them; when we try to walk upon a foot or a leg that has
gone &quot;to sleep&quot;; that is, when the kinaesthetic nerves are temporarily
paralyzed we find it difficult to walk. But besides being used to
control muscular actions, they may be used in study, for they may be
made the source of impressions, and impressions, as we learned in the
chapter on memory, are a prime requisite for learning. Each expression
becomes, then, through its kinaesthetic results, the source of new
impressions, when, for example, you pronounce the German word,
_anwenden_, with the English word &quot;to employ,&quot; in addition to the
impressions made through the ear, you make impressions through the
muscles of speech (kinaesthetic impressions), and these kinaesthetic
impressions enter into the body of your knowledge and later may serve
as the means by which the word may be revived. When you write the word,
you make kinaesthetic impressions which may later serve as forms of
revival. So the movements of expression produce sensory material that
may serve as tentacles by means of which you can later reach back into
your memory and recall facts.

We shall now consider another service of expressions which, though
little regarded, nevertheless is of much moment. When we make
expressive movements, much nervous energy is generated; much more than
during passive impression. Energy is sent back to the brain over the
kinaesthetic nerve cells, and the greater the extent of the movement,
the greater is the amount of new energy sent to the brain. It pours
into the brain and diffuses itself especially throughout the
association areas. Here it excites regions which could not be excited
by a more limited amount of energy. This means, in psychical terms,
that new ideas are being aroused. The obvious inference from this fact
is that you may, by starting movements of expression, actually summon
to your assistance added powers of mind. For example, when you are
called upon to recite in class, your mind seems to be a complete
blank--in a state of &quot;deadlock.&quot; You may break this &quot;deadlock&quot; and
start brain-action by some kind of movement. It may be only to clear
your throat, to ejaculate &quot;well,&quot; or to squirm about in the seat, but
whatever form the movement takes, it will usually be effective in
creating the desired nervous energy, and after the inertia is once
overcome the mental stream will flow freely. The unconscious
application of this device is seen when a man is called on suddenly to
make a speech for which he has not prepared. He usually starts out by
telling a story, thus liberating nervous energy to pour back into the
brain and start thinking processes. With increasing vehemence of
expression, the ideas come more and more freely, and the result is a
speech which surpasses the expectations of the speaker himself. The
gesticulations of many speakers have this same function, being
frequently of great service in arousing more nervous energy, which goes
back to the brain and arouses more ideas.

The device of stimulating ideas by expressive movements may be utilized
in theme- or letter-writing. It is generally recognized that the
difficult thing in such writing is to get a start, and the too common
practice is to sit listlessly gazing into space waiting for
&quot;inspiration.&quot; This is usually a futile procedure. The better way is to
begin to write anything about the topic in hand. What you write may
have little merit, either of substance or form. Nevertheless, if you
persist in keeping up the activity of writing, making more and more
movements, you will find that the ideas will begin to come in greater
profusion until they come so fast you can hardly write them down.

Having tried to picture the neural effect of expression, we may now
translate them into psychological terms, asking what service the
expressions render to the conscious side of our study. First of all, we
note that the expressions help to make the acts and ideas in study
habitual. We find ourselves, with each expression, better able to
perform such acts as the pronunciation of foreign words. Second, they
furnish new impressions through the kinaesthetic sense, thus being a
source of sense-impression. Third, they give rise to a greater number
of ideas and link them up with the idea dominant at the moment. There
is a further psychological effect of expression in the clarification of
ideas. It is a well-attested fact that when we attempt to explain a
thing to someone else, it becomes clearer in our own minds. You can
demonstrate this for yourself by attempting to explain to someone an
intricate conception such as the nebular hypothesis. The effort
involved in making the explanation makes the fact more vivid to you.
The habit of thus utilizing your knowledge in conversation is an
excellent one to acquire. Indeed, expression is the only objective test
of knowledge and we cannot say that we really know until we can express
our knowledge. Expression is thus the great clarification agency and
the test of knowledge. Before leaving this discussion, it might be well
to remark upon one phase of expression that is sometimes a source of
difficulty. This is the embarrassment incident to some forms of
expression, notably oral. Many people are deterred from utilizing this
form of expression because of shyness and embarrassment in the presence
of others. If you have this difficulty in such excess that it hinders
you from free expression, resolve at once to overcome it. Begin at the
very outset of your academic career to form habits of disregarding your
impulses to act in frightened manner. Take a course in public speaking.
The practice thus secured will be a great aid in developing habits of
fearless and free oral expression.

This discussion has shown that expression is a powerful aid in
learning, and is a most important feature of mental life. Cultivate
your powers of expression, for your college education should consist
not only in the development of habits of impression, but also in the
development of habits of expression. Grasp eagerly every opportunity
for the development of skill in clear and forceful expression. Devote
assiduous attention to themes and all written work, and make serious
efforts to speak well. Remember you are forming habits that will
persist throughout your life. Emphasize, therefore, at every step,
methods of expression, for it is this phase of learning in which you
will find greatest growth.

CHAPTER XI

HOW TO BECOME INTERESTED IN A SUBJECT


&quot;I can't get interested in Mediaeval History.&quot; This illustrates a kind
of complaint frequently made by college students. It is our purpose in
this chapter to show the fallacy of this; to prove that interest may be
developed in an &quot;uninteresting&quot; subject; and to show how.

In order to lay a firm foundation for our psychologizing, let us
examine into the nature of interest and see what it really is. It has
been defined as: &quot;the recognition of a thing which has been vitally
connected with experience before--a thing recognized as old&quot;; &quot;impulse
to attend&quot;; &quot;interest naturally arouses tendencies to act&quot;; &quot;the root
idea of the term seems to be that of being engaged, engrossed, or
entirely taken up with some activity because of its recognized worth&quot;;
&quot;interest marks the annihilation of the distance between the person and
the materials and results of his action; it is the sign of their
organic union.&quot;

In addition to the characteristics just mentioned should be noted the
pleasurableness that usually attends any activity in which we are
&quot;interested.&quot; A growing feeling of pleasure is the sign which notifies
us that we are growing interested in a subject. And it is such an aid
in the performance of work that we should seek earnestly to acquire it
in connection with any work we have to do.

The persons who make the complaint at the head of this chapter notice
that they take interest easily in certain things: a Jack London story,
a dish of ice cream, a foot-ball game. And they take interest in them
so spontaneously and effortlessly that they think these interests must
be born within them.

When we examine carefully the interests of man, and trace their
sources, we see that the above view is fallacious. We acquire most of
our interests in the course of our experience. Professor James asserts:
&quot;An adult man's interests are almost every one of them intensely
artificial; they have been slowly built up. The objects of professional
interest are most of them in their original nature, repulsive; but by
their connection with such natively exciting objects as one's personal
fortune, one's social responsibilities and especially by the force of
inveterate habit, they grow to be the only things for which in middle
life a man profoundly cares.&quot;

Since interests are largely products of experience, then, it follows
that if we wish to have an interest in a given subject, we must
consciously and purposefully develop it. There is wide choice open to
us. We may develop interest in early Victorian literature, prize-fight
promoting, social theory, lignitic rocks, history of Siam, the
collection of scarabs, mediaeval history.

We should not be deceived by the glibness of the above statements into
assuming that the development of interest is an easy matter. It
requires adherence to certain definite psychological laws which we may
call the laws of interest. The first may be stated as follows: _In
order to develop interest in a subject, secure information about it_.
The force of this law will be apparent as soon as we analyze one of our
already-developed interests. Let us take one that is quite common--the
interest which a typical young girl takes in a movie star. Her interest
in him comes largely from what she has been able to learn about him;
the names of the productions in which he has appeared, his age, the
color of his automobile, his favorite novel. Her interest may be said
actually to consist, at least in part, of these facts. The astute press
agent knows the force of this law, and at well-timed intervals he lets
slip through bits of information about the star, which fan the interest
of the fair devotee to a still whiter heat.

The relation of information to interest is still further illustrated by
the case of the typical university professor or scientist. He is
interested in certain objects of research--infusoria, electrons, plant
ecology,--because he knows so much about them. His interest may be
said to _consist_ partly of the body of knowledge that he possesses. He
was not always interested in the specific, obscure field, but by
saturating himself in facts about it, he has developed an interest in
it amounting to passionate absorption, which manifests itself in
&quot;absent-mindedness&quot; of such profundity as to make him often an object
of wonder and ridicule.

Let us demonstrate the application of the law again showing how
interest may be developed in a specific college subject. Let us choose
one that is generally regarded as so &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;abstract&quot; that
not many people are interested in it--philology, the study of language
as a science. Let us imagine that we are trying to interest a student
of law in this. As a first step we shall select some legal term and
show what philology can tell about it. A term frequently encountered in
law is indenture--a certain form of contract. Philological researches
have uncovered an interesting history regarding this word. It seems
that in olden days when two persons made an agreement they wrote it on
two pieces of paper, then notched the edges so that when placed
together, the notches on the edge of one paper would just match those
of the other. This protected both parties against substitution of a
fraudulent contract at time of fulfillment.

Still earlier in man's development, before he could write, it was
customary to record such agreements by breaking a stick in two pieces
and leaving the jagged ends to be fitted together at time of
fulfillment. Sometimes a bone was used this way. Because its critical
feature was the saw-toothed edge, this kind of contract was called
indenture (derived from the root _dent_--tooth, the same one from which
we derive our word dentist).

The formal, legal-looking document which we today call an indenture
gives us no hint of its humble origin, but the word when analyzed by
the technique of philology tells the whole story, and throws much light
upon the legal practices of our forbears. Having discovered one such
valuable fact in philology, the student of law may be led to
investigate the science still further and find many more. As a result
still he will become interested in philology.

By this illustration we have demonstrated the first psychological law
of interest, and also its corollary which is: _State the new in terms
of the old_. For we not only gave our lawyer new information culled
from philological sources; we also introduced our fact in terms of an
old fact which was already &quot;interesting&quot; to the lawyer. This is
recognized as such an important principle in education that it has
become embodied in a maxim: Proceed from the known to the unknown.

A classic example of good educational practice in this connection is
the way in which Francis W. Parker, a progressive educator of a former
generation, taught geography. When he desired to show how water running
over hard rocky soil produced a Niagara, he took his class down to the
creek behind the school house, built a dam and allowed the water to
flow over it. When he wished to show how water flowing over soft ground
resulted in a deltoid Nile, he took the class to a low, flat portion of
the creek bed and pointed out the effect. The creek bed constituted an
old familiar element in the children's experience. Niagara and the Nile
described in terms of it were intelligible.

Naturally in modern educational practice it is not always possible to
have miniature waterfalls and river bottoms at hand, still it is
possible to follow this principle. When, in studying Mediaeval History,
you read a description of the guilds, do not regard them as distant,
cold, inert institutions devoid of significance in your life. Rather,
think of them in terms of things you already know: modern Labor Unions,
technical schools, in so far as the comparison holds good. Then trace
their industrial descendants down to the present time. By thus thinking
about the guilds, hitherto distant and uninteresting, you will begin to
see them suffused with meaning, alight with significance, a real part
of yourself. In short, you will have achieved interest.

There is still another psychological law of interest: _In order to
develop interest in a subject, exert activity toward it_. We see the
force of this law when we observe a man in the process of developing an
interest in golf. At the start he may have no interest in it whatever;
he may even deride it. Yielding to the importunities of his friends,
however, he takes his stick in hand and samples the game. Then he
begins to relent; admits that perhaps there may be something
interesting about the game after all. As he practises with greater
frequency he begins to develop a warmer and still warmer interest until
finally he thinks of little else; neglecting social and professional
obligations and boring his friends _ad nauseum_ with recitals of
golfing incidents. The methods by which the new-fledged golfer develops
an interest in golf will apply with equal effectiveness in the case of
a student. In trying to become interested in Mediaeval History, keep
actively engaged in it. Read book after book dealing with the subject.
Apply it to your studies in Political Economy, English, and American
History. Choose sub-topics in Mediaeval History as the subjects for
themes in English composition courses. Try to help some other student
in the class. Take part in class discussions and talk informally with
the instructor outside of the classroom. Use your ingenuity to devise
methods of keeping active toward the subject. Presently you will
discover that the subject no longer appears cold and forbidding; but
that it glows warm with virility; that it has become interesting.

It will readily be noticed that the two laws of interest here set forth
are closely interrelated. One can hardly seek information about a
subject without exerting activity toward it; conversely, one cannot
maintain activity on behalf of a subject without at the same time
acquiring information about it. These two easily-remembered and
easily-applied rules of study will go far toward solving some of the
most trying conditions of student life. Memorize them, apply them, and
you will find yourself in possession of a power which will stay with
you long after you quit college walls; one which you may apply with
profit in many different situations of life.

We have shown in this chapter the fallacy of the assumption that a
student cannot become genuinely interested in a subject which at first
seems uninteresting.

We have shown that he may develop interest in any subject if he but
employs the proper psychological methods. That he must obey the
two-fold law--secure information about the subject (stating the new in
terms of the old) and exert activity toward it. That when he has thus
lighted the flame of interest, he will find his entire intellectual
life illuminated, glowing with purpose, resplendent with success.

In concluding this discussion we should note the wide difference
between the quality of study which is done with interest and that done
without it. Under the latter condition the student is a slave, a
drudge; under the former, a god, a creator. Touched by the galvanic
spark he sees new significance in every page, in every line. As his
vision enlarges, he perceives new relations between his study and his
future aims, indeed, between his study and the progress of the
universe. And he goes to his educational tasks not as a prisoner
weighted down by ball and chain, but as an eager prospector infatuated
by the lust for gold. Encouraged by the continual stores of new things
he uncovers, intoxicated by the ozone of mental activity, he delves
continually deeper until finally he emerges rich with knowledge and
full of power--the intellectual power that signifies mastery over a
subject.

CHAPTER XII

THE PLATEAU OF DESPOND


In our investigation of the psychology of study we have so far directed
our attention chiefly toward the subjective side of the question,
seeking to discover the _contents_ of mind during study. We shall now
take an objective view of study, examining not the contents of mind nor
methods of study, but the objective results of study. In doing this, we
choose certain units of measurement, the number of minutes required for
learning a given amount or the amount learned in a stated period of
time. We may do this for the learning of any material, whether it be
Greek verbs or typewriting. All that is necessary is to decide upon
some method by which progress can be noted and expressed in numerical
units. This, you will observe, constitutes a statistical approach to
the processes of study, such as is employed in science; and just as the
statistical method has been useful in science, so it may be of value in
education, and by means of statistical investigations of learning we
may hope to discover some of the factors operative in good learning.

Progress in learning is best observable when we represent our
measurements graphically, when they take the form of a curve, variously
called &quot;the curve of efficiency,&quot; &quot;practice curve,&quot; &quot;learning curve.&quot;
We shall take a sample curve for the basis of our discussion, showing
the progress of a beginner in the Russian language for sixty-five days
(indicated in the figure by horizontal divisions). The student studied
industriously for thirty minutes each day and then translated as
rapidly as possible for fifteen minutes, the number of words translated
being represented by the vertical spaces on the chart. Thus, on the
tenth day, twenty-five words were translated, on the twentieth day,
forty-five words.

[Illustration (graph): STUDY OF RUSSIAN]

In making an analysis of this typical curve, we note immediately an
exceeding irregularity. At one time there is extraordinary
improvement, but a later measurement registers pronounced loss. This
irregularity is very common in learning. Some days we do a great amount
of work and do it well, but perhaps the very next day shows marked
diminution in our work.

The second characteristic we note is that there is extremely rapid
progress at the beginning, the curve slanting up quite sharply. This is
common in learning, and may be accounted for in several ways. In the
first place, the easiest things come first. For example, when you are
beginning the study of German, you are given mostly monosyllabic words
to learn. These are easily remembered, hence progress is rapid. A
second reason is that at the beginning there are many different
respects in which progress can be made. For example, the beginner in
German must learn nouns, case endings, declension of adjectives, days
of the week; in short, a vast number of new things all at once. At a
later period however, the number of new things to be learned is much
smaller and improvement cannot be so rapid. A third reason why learning
proceeds more rapidly at first is that the interest is greater at this
time. You have doubtless many times experienced this fact, and you know
that when a thing has the interest of novelty you work harder upon it.

If you will examine the learning curve closely, you will note that
after the initial spurt, there is a slowing up. The curve at this point
resembles a plateau and indicates cessation of progress if not
retrogression. This period of no progress is regarded as a
characteristic of the learning curve and is a time of great
discouragement to the conscientious student, so distressing that we may
designate it &quot;the plateau of despond.&quot; Most people describe it as a
time when they feel unable to learn more about a subject; the mind
seems to be sated; new ideas cannot be assimilated, and old ones seem
to be forgotten. The plateau may extend for a long or a short time,
depending upon the nature of the subject-matter and the length of time
over which the learning extends. In the case of professional training,
it may extend over a year or more. In the case of growing children in
school, it sometimes happens that an entire year elapses during which
the learning of an apparently bright student is retarded. In a course
of study in high school or college, it may come on about the third week
and extend a month or more. Something akin to the plateau may come in
the course of a day, when we realize that our efficiency is greatly
diminished and we seem, for an hour or more, to make no progress.

Inasmuch as the plateau is such a common occurrence in human activity,
we should analyze it and see what factors operate to influence it. It
is interesting to note that the plateau generally occurs just before an
abrupt rise in efficiency. This is significant, for it may mean that
the plateau is necessary in learning, especially just before reaching
the really advanced stages of proficiency. Accordingly, when you are
experiencing a plateau in the mastery of some accomplishment, you may
perhaps derive some comfort from the prospect of an approaching rise in
efficiency. On the theory that it is a necessary part of learning, it
has been regarded as a resting place. We are so constituted by nature
that we cannot run on indefinitely; nature sometimes must call a halt.
Consequently, the plateau may be a warning that we cannot learn more
for the present and that the proper remedy is to refrain for a little
while from further efforts in that line. We have possible justification
for this interpretation when we reflect that a vacation does us much
good, and though we begin it feeling stale, we end it feeling much
fresher and more efficient.

But to stop work temporarily is not the only way to meet a plateau, and
fatigue or ennui is probably not the sole or most compelling
explanation. It may be that we should not regard the objective results
as the true measure of learning; perhaps learning is going on even
though the results are not apparent. We discovered something in the
nature of unconscious learning in our discussion of memory, and it may
be that a period of little objective progress marks a period of active
unconscious learning.

Another meaning which the plateau may have is simply to mark places of
greater difficulty. As already remarked, the early period is a stage of
comparative ease, but as the work becomes more difficult, progress is
slower. It is also quite likely that the plateau may indicate that some
of the factors operative at the start are operative no longer. Thus,
although the learning was rapid at the beginning because the material
learned at that time was easy, the plateau may come because the things
to be learned have become difficult. Or, whereas the beginning was
attacked with considerable interest, the plateau may mean that the
interest is dying down, and that less effort is being exerted.

If these theories are the true explanation of the plateau, we see that
it is not to be regarded as a time of reduction in learning, to be
contemplated with despair. The appropriate attitude may be one of
resignation, with the determination to make it as slightly disturbing
as possible. But though the reasons just described may have something
to do with the production of the plateau, as yet we have no evidence
that the plateau cannot be dispensed with. It is practically certain
that the plateau is not caused entirely by necessity for rest or
unconscious learning. It frequently is due, we must regretfully admit,
to poor early preparation. If at the beginning of a period of learning
an insecure foundation is laid, it cannot be expected to support the
burden of more difficult subject-matter.

We have enumerated a number of the explanations that have been advanced
to account for the plateau, and have seen that it may have several
causes, among which are necessity for rest, increased difficulty of
subject-matter, loss of interest and insufficient preparation. In
trying to eliminate the plateau, our remedy should be adapted to the
cause. In recognition of the fact that learning proceeds irregularly,
we see that it is rational to expect the amount of effort to be exerted
throughout a period of learning, to vary. It will vary partly with the
difficulty of subject-matter and partly with fluctuations in bodily and
mental efficiency which are bound to occur from day to day. Since this
irregularity is bound to occur, you may well make your effort vary from
one extreme to the other. At times, perhaps your most profitable move
may be to take a complete vacation. The vacation might cover several
weeks, a week-end, or if the plateau is merely a low period in the
day's work, then ten minutes may suffice for a vacation. As an adjunct
to such rest periods, some form of recreation should usually be
planned, for the essential thing is to permit the mind to rest from the
tiresome activity.

If your plateau represents greater difficulty of subject-matter and
loss of interest, your duty is plainly to work harder. In exerting more
effort, make some changes in your methods of study. For example, if you
have been accustomed to study a certain subject by silent reading,
begin to read your lessons aloud. Change your method of taking notes,
or change the hour of day in which you prepare your lesson. In short,
try any of the methods described in this book, and use your own
ingenuity, and the change in method may overcome the plateau.

If a plateau is due to our last-mentioned cause, insufficient
preparation, the remedy must be drastic. To make new resolutions and to
put forth additional effort is not enough; you must go back and relay
the foundation. Make a thorough review of the work which you covered
slightingly, making sure that every step is clear. This process was
described in an earlier chapter as the clarification of ideas and is
absolutely essential in building up a structure of knowledge that will
stand. Indeed, as you take various courses you will find that your
study will be much improved by periodical reviews. The benefits cannot
all be enumerated here, but we may reasonably claim that a review will
be very likely to remove a plateau, and used with the other remedies
herein suggested, will help you to rid yourself of one of the most
discouraging features of student life.

CHAPTER XIII

MENTAL SECOND-WIND


Did you ever engage in any exhausting physical work for a long period
of time? If so, you probably remember that as you proceeded, you became
more and more fatigued, finally reaching a point when it seemed that
you could not endure the strain another minute. You had just decided to
give up, when suddenly the fatigue seemed to diminish and new energy
seemed to come from some source. This curious thing, which happens
frequently in athletic activities, is known as second-wind, and is
described, by those who have experienced it, as a time of increased
power, when the work is done with greater ease and effectiveness and
with a freshness and vigor in great contrast to the staleness that
preceded it. It is as though one &quot;tapped a level of new energy,&quot;
revealing hidden stores of unexpected power. And it is commonly
reported that with persistence in pushing one's self farther and
farther, a third and fourth wind may be uncovered, each one leading to
greater heights of achievement.

This phenomenon occurs not alone on the physical plane; it is
discernible in mental exertion as well. True, we seldom experience it
because we are mentally lazy and have the habit of stopping our work at
the first signs of fatigue. Did we persist, however, disregarding
fatigue and ennui, we should find ourselves tapping vast reserves of
mental power and accomplishing mental feats of astonishing brilliancy.

The occasional occurrence of the phenomenon of second-wind gives ground
for the statement that we possess more energy than we ordinarily use.
There are several lines of evidence for this statement. One is to be
found in the energizing effects of emotional excitement. Under the
impetus of anger, a man shows far greater strength than he ordinarily
uses. Similarly, a mother manifests the strength of a tigress when her
young is endangered. A second line of evidence is furnished by the
effect of stimulants. Alcohol brings to the fore surprising reserves of
physical and psychic energy. Lastly, we have innumerable instances of
accession of strength under the stimulus of an idea. Under the
domination of an all-absorbing idea, one performs feats of
extraordinary strength, utilizing stores of energy otherwise out of
reach. We have only to read of the heroic achievements of little Joan
of Arc for an example of such manifestation of reserve power.

When we examine this accession of energy we find it to be describable
in several ways--physiologically, neurologically and psychologically.
The physiological effects consist in a heightening of the bodily
functions in general. The muscles become more ready to act, the
circulation is accelerated, the breathing more rapid. Curious things
take place in various glands throughout the body. One, the adrenal
gland, has been the object of special study and has been shown, upon
the arousal of these reserves of energy, to produce a secretion of the
utmost importance in providing for sudden emergencies. This little
gland is located above the kidney, and is aroused to intense activity
at times, pouring out into the blood a fluid that goes all over the
body. Some of its effects are to furnish the blood with chemicals that
act as fuel to the muscles, assisting them to contract more vigorously,
to make the lungs more active in introducing oxygen into the system, to
make the heart more active in distributing the blood throughout the
body. Such glandular activity is an important physiological condition
of these higher levels of energy. In neurological terms, the increase
in energy consists in the flow of more nervous energy into the brain,
particularly into those areas where it is needed for certain kinds of
controlled thought and action. An abundance of nervous energy is very
advantageous, for, as has been intimated in a former chapter, nervous
energy is diffused and spread over all the pathways that are easily
permeable to its distribution. This results in the use of considerable
areas of brain surface, and knits up many associations, so that one
idea calls up many other ideas. This leads us to recognize the
psychological conditions of increased energy, which are, first, the
presence of more ideas, second, the more facile flow of ideas; the
whole accompanied by a state of marked pleasurableness. Pleasure is a
notable effect of increased energy. When work progresses rapidly and
satisfactorily, it is accomplished with great zest and a feeling almost
akin to exaltation. These conditions describe to some degree the
conditions when we are doing efficient work.

Since we are endowed with the energy requisite for such efficient work,
the obvious question is, why do we not more frequently use it? The
answer is to be found in the fact that we have formed the habit of
giving up before we create conditions of high efficiency. You will note
that the conditions require long-continued exertion and resolute
persistence. This is difficult, and we indulgently succumb to the first
symptoms of fatigue, before we have more than scratched the surface of
our real potentialities.

Because of the prominent place occupied by fatigue in thus being
responsible for our diminished output, we shall briefly consider its
place in study. Everyone who has studied will agree that fatigue is an
almost invariable attendant of continuous mental exertion. We shall lay
down the proposition at the start, however, that the awareness of
fatigue is not the same as the objective fatigue in the organs of the
body. Fatigue should be regarded as a twofold thing--a state of mind,
designated its subjective aspect, and a condition of various parts of
the body, designated its objective aspect. The former is observable by
introspection, the latter by analysis of bodily secretions and by
measurement of the diminution of work, entirely without reference to
the way the mind regards the work. Fatigue subjectively, or fatigue as
we _feel_ it, is not at all the same as fatigue as manifested in the
body. If we were to make two curves, the one showing the advancement of
the _feeling_ of fatigue, and the other showing the advancement of
impotence on the part of the bodily processes, the two curves would not
at all coincide. Stated another way, fatigue is a complex thing, a
product of ideas, feelings and sensations, and sometimes the ideas
overbalance the sensations and we think we are more tired then we are
objectively. It is this fact that accounts for our too rapid giving up
when we are engaged in hard work.

A psychological analysis of the subjective side of fatigue will make
its true nature more apparent. Probably the first thing we find in the
mind when fatigued is a large mass of sensations. They are referred to
various parts of the body, mostly the part where muscular activity has
been most violent and prolonged. Not all of the sensations, however,
are intense enough to be localizable, some being so vague that we
merely say we are &quot;tired all over.&quot; These vague sensations are often
overlooked; nevertheless, as will be shown later, they may be
exceedingly important.

But sensations are not the only contents of the mind at time of
fatigue. Feelings are present also, usually of a very unpleasant kind.
They are related partly to the sensations mentioned above, which are
essentially painful, and they are feelings of boredom and ennui. We
have yet to examine the ideas in mind and their behavior at time of
fatigue. They come sluggishly, associations being made slowly and
inaccurately, and we make many mistakes. But constriction of ideas is
not the sole effect of fatigue. At such a time there are usually other
ideas in the mind not relevant to the fatiguing task of the moment,
and exceedingly distracting. Often they are so insistent in forcing
themselves upon our attention that we throw up the work without further
effort. It is practically certain that much of our fatigue is due, not
to real weariness and inability to work, but to the presence of ideas
that appear so attractive in contrast with the work in hand that we say
we are tired of the latter. What we really mean is that we would rather
do something else. These obtruding ideas are often introduced into our
minds by other people who tell us that we have worked long enough and
ought to come and play, and though we may not have felt tired up to
this point, still the suggestion is so strong that we immediately begin
to feel tired. Various social situations can arouse the same
suggestion. For example, as the clock nears quitting time, we feel that
we ought to be tired, so we allow ourselves to think we are.

Let us now examine the bodily conditions to see what fatigue is
objectively. &quot;Physiologically it has been demonstrated that fatigue is
accompanied by three sorts of changes. First, poisons accumulate in the
blood and affect the action of the nervous system, as has been shown by
direct analysis. Mosso ... selected two dogs as nearly alike as
possible. One he kept tied all day; the other, he exercised until by
night it was thoroughly tired. Then he transfused the blood of the
tired animal into the veins of the rested one and produced in him all
the signs of fatigue that were shown by the other. There can be no
doubt that the waste products of the body accumulate in the blood and
interfere with the action of the nerve cells and muscles. It is
probable that these accumulations come as a result of mental as well as
of physical work.

&quot;A second change in fatigue has been found in the cell body of the
neurone. Hodge showed that the size of the nucleus of the cell in the
spinal cord of a bee diminished nearly 75 per cent, as a result of the
day's activity, and that the nucleus became much less solid. A third
change that has been demonstrated as a result of muscular work is the
accumulation of waste products in the muscle tissue. Fatigued muscles
contain considerable percentages of these products. That they are
important factors in the fatigue process has been shown by washing them
from a fatigued muscle. As a result the muscle gains new capacity for
work. The experiments are performed on the muscles of a frog that have
been cut from the body and fatigued by electrical stimulation. When
they will no longer respond, their sensitivity may be renewed by
washing them in dilute alcohol or in a weak salt solution that will
dissolve the products of fatigue. It is probable that these products
stimulate the sense-organs in the muscles and thus give some of the
sensations of fatigue. Of these physical effects of fatigue, the
accumulation of waste products in the blood and the effects upon the
nerve cells are probably common both to mental and physical fatigue.
The effect upon the muscles plays a part in mental fatigue only so far
as all mental work involves some muscular activity.&quot;

By this time you must be convinced that the subject of fatigue is
exceedingly complicated; that its effects are manifested differently in
mind and body. In relieving fatigue the first step to be taken is to
rest properly. Man cannot work incessantly; he must rest sometimes, and
it is just as important to know how to rest efficiently as to know how
to work efficiently. By this is not meant that one should rest as soon
as fatigue begins to be felt. Quite the reverse. Keep on working all
the harder if you wish the second-wind to appear. Perhaps two hours
will exhaust your first supply of energy and will leave you greatly
fatigued. Do not give up at this time, however. Push yourself farther
in order to uncover the second layer of energy. Before entering upon
this, however, it will be possible to secure some advantage by resting
for about fifteen minutes. Do not rest longer than this, or you may
lose the momentum already secured and your two hours will have gone for
naught. If one indulges in too long a rest, the energy seems to run
down and more effort is required to work it up again than was
originally expended. It is also important to observe the proper mental
conditions during rest. Do not spend the fifteen minutes in getting
interested in some other object; for that will leave distracting ideas
in the mind which will persist when you resume work. Make the rest a
time of physical and mental relief. Move cramped muscles, rest your
eyes and let your thoughts idly wander; then come back to work in ten
or fifteen minutes and you will be amazed at the refreshed feeling with
which you do your work and at the accession of new energy that will
come to you. Keep on at this new plane and your work will take on all
the attributes of the second-wind level of efficiency.

Besides planning intelligent rests, you may also adjust yourself to
fatigue by arranging your daily program so as to do your hardest work
when you are fresh, and your easiest when your efficiency is low. In
other words, you are a human dynamo, and should adjust yourself to the
different loads you carry. When carrying a heavy load, employ your best
energies, but when carrying only a light load, exert a proportionate
amount of energy. Every student has tasks of a routine nature which do
not require a high degree of energy, such as copying material. Plan to
perform such work when your stock of energy is lowest.

One of the best ways to insure the attainment of a higher plane of
mental efficiency is to assume an attitude of interestedness. This is
an emotional state and we have seen that emotion calls forth great
energy.

A final aid in promoting increase of energy is that gained through
stimulating ideas. Other things being equal, the student who is
animated by a stimulating idea works more diligently and effectively
than one without. The idea may be a lofty professional ideal; it may be
a desire to please one's family, a sense of duty, or a wish to excel.
Whatever it is, an idea may stimulate to extraordinary achievements.
Adopt some compelling aim if you have none. A vocational aim often
serves as a powerful incentive throughout one's student life. An idea
may operate for even more transient purposes; it may make one oblivious
to present discomfort to a remarkable degree. This is accomplished
through the aid of suggestion. When feelings of fatigue approach, you
may ward them off by resolutely suggesting to yourself that you are
feeling fresh.

Above all, the will is effective in lifting one to higher levels of
efficiency. It is notorious that a single effort of the will, &quot;such as
saying 'no' to some habitual temptation or performing some courageous
act, will launch a man on a higher level of energy for days and weeks,
will give him a new range of power. 'In the act of uncorking the
whiskey bottle which I had brought home to get drunk upon,' said a man
to me, 'I suddenly found myself running out into the garden, where I
smashed it on the ground. I felt so happy and uplifted after this act,
that for two months I wasn't tempted to touch a drop.'&quot; But the results
of exertions of the will are not usually so immediate, and you may
accept it as a fact that in raising yourself to a higher level of
energy you cannot do it by a single effort. Continuous effort is
required until the higher levels of energy have _formed the habit_ of
responding when work is to be done. In laying the burden upon Nature's
mechanism of habit, you see you are again face to face with the
proposition laid down at the beginning of the book--that education
consists in the process of forming habits of mind. The particular habit
most important to cultivate in connection with the production of
second-wind is the habit of resisting fatigue. Form the habit of
persisting in spite of apparent obstacles and limitations. Though they
seem almost unsurmountable, they are really only superficial. Buried
deep within you are stores of energy that you yourself are unaware of.
They will assist you in accomplishing feats far greater than you think
yourself capable of. Draw upon these resources and you will find
yourself gradually living and working upon a higher plane of
efficiency, improving the quality of your work, increasing the quantity
of your work and enhancing your enjoyment in work.

CHAPTER XIV

EXAMINATIONS


One of the most vexatious periods of student life is examination time.
This is almost universally a time of great distress, giving rise in
extreme cases to conditions of nervous collapse. The reason for this is
not far to seek, for upon the results of examinations frequently depend
momentous consequences, such as valuable appointments, diplomas,
degrees and other important events in the life of a student. In view of
the importance of examinations, then, it is natural that they be
regarded with considerable fear and trepidation, and it is important
that we devise what rules we can for meeting their exactious demands
with greatest ease and effectiveness.

Examinations serve several purposes, the foremost of which is to inform
the examiner regarding the amount of knowledge possessed by the
student. In discovering this, two methods may be employed; first, to
test whether or not the student knows certain things, plainly a
reproductive exercise; second, to see how well the student can apply
his knowledge. But this is not the only function of an examination. It
also shows the student how much he knows or does not know. Again the
examination often serves as an incentive to harder work on the part of
the student, for if one knows there will be an examination in a
subject, one usually studies with greater zeal than when an examination
is not expected. Lastly, an examination may help the student to link up
facts in new ways, and to see them in new relationships. In this
aspect, you readily see that examinations constitute a valuable device
in learning.

But students are not very patient in philosophizing about the purpose
of examinations, declaring that if examinations are a necessary part of
the educational process, they wish some advice that will enable them to
pass examinations easily and with credit to themselves. So we shall
turn our attention to the practical problems of passing examinations.

Our first duty in giving advice is to call attention to the necessity
for faithful work throughout the course of study. Some students seem to
think that they can slight their work throughout a course, and by
vigorous cramming at the end make up for slighted work and pass the
examination. This is an extremely dangerous attitude to take. It might
work with certain kinds of subject-matter, a certain type of
student-mind and a certain kind of examiner, but as a general practice
it is a most treacherous method of passing a course. The greatest
objection from a psychological standpoint is that we have reason to
believe that learning thus concentrated is not so permanently effective
as that extended over a long period of time. For instance, a German
course extending over a year has much to commend it over a course with
the same number of recitation-hours crowded into two months. We already
discussed the reasons for this in Chapter VI, when we showed the
beneficial results coming from the distribution of impressions over a
period of time.

Against cramming it may further be urged that the hasty impression of a
mass of new material is not likely to be lasting; particularly is this
true when the cramming is made specifically for a certain examination.
As we saw in the chapter on memory, the intention to remember affects
the firmness of retention, and if the cramming is done merely with
reference to the examination, the facts learned may be forgotten and
never be available for future use. So we may lay it down as a rule that
feverish exertions at the end of a course cannot replace conscientious
work throughout the course. In spite of these objections, however, we
must admit that cramming has some value, if it does not take the form
of new acquisition of facts, but consists more of a manipulation of
facts already learned. As a method of review, it has an eminently
proper place and may well be regarded as indispensable. Some students,
it is true, assert that they derive little benefit from a
pre-examination review, but one is inclined to question their methods.
We have already found that learning is characteristically aided by
reviews, and that recall is facilitated by recency of impression.
Reviewing just before examination serves the memory by providing
repetition and recency, which, as we learned in the chapter on memory,
are conditions for favorable impression.

A further value of cramming is that by means of such a summarizing
review one is able to see facts in a greater number of relations than
before. It too often happens that when facts are taken up in a course
they come in a more or less detached form, but at the conclusion of the
course a review will show the facts in perspective and will disclose
many new relations between them.

Another advantage of cramming is that at such a time, one usually works
at a high plane of efficiency; the task of reviewing in a few hours the
work of an entire course is so huge that the attention is closely
concentrated, impressions are made vividly, and the entire mentality is
tuned up so that facts are well impressed, coordinated and retained.
These advantages are not all present in the more leisurely learning of
a course, so we see that cramming may be regarded as a useful device in
learning.

We must not forget that many of the advantages secured by cramming are
dependent upon the methods pursued. There are good methods and poor
methods of cramming. One of the most reprehensible of the latter is to
get into a flurry and scramble madly through a mass of facts without
regard to their relation to each other. This method is characterized by
breathless haste and an anxious fear lest something be missed or
forgotten. Perhaps its most serious evil is its formlessness and lack
of plan. In other words the facts should not be seized upon singly but
should be regarded in the light of their different relations with each
other. Suppose, for example, you are reviewing for an examination in
mediaeval history. The important events may be studied according to
countries, studying one country at a time, but that is not sufficient;
the events occurring during one period in one country should be
correlated with those occurring in another country at the same time.
Likewise the movements in the field of science and discovery should be
correlated with movements in the fields of literature, religion and
political control. Tabulate the events in chronological order and
compare the different series of events with each other. In this way the
facts will be seen in new relations and will be more firmly impressed
so that you can use them in answering a great variety of questions.

Having made preparation of the subject-matter of the examination, the
next step is to prepare yourself physically for the trying ordeal, for
it is well known that the mind acts more ably under physically
healthful conditions. Go to the examination-room with your body rested
after a good night's sleep. Eat sparingly before the examination, for
mental processes are likely to be clogged if too heavy food is taken.

Having reached the examination-room, there are a number of
considerations that are requisite for success. Some of the advice here
given may seem to be superfluous but if you had ever corrected
examination papers you would see the need of it all. Let your first
step consist of a preliminary survey of the examination questions; read
them all over slowly and thoughtfully in order to discover the extent
of the task set before you. A striking thing is accomplished by this
preliminary reading of the questions. It seems as though during the
examination period the knowledge relating to the different questions
assembles itself, and while you are focusing your attention upon the
answer to one question, the answers to the other questions are
formulating themselves in your mind. It is a semi-conscious operation,
akin to the &quot;unconscious learning&quot; discussed in the chapter on memory.
In order to take advantage of it, it is necessary to have the questions
in mind as soon as possible; then it will be found that relevant
associations will form and will come to the surface when you reach the
particular questions.

During the examination when some of these associations come into
consciousness ahead of time, it is often wise to digress from the
question in hand long enough to jot them down. By all means preserve
them, for if you do not write them down they may leave you and be lost.
Sometimes very brilliant ideas come in flashes, and inasmuch as they
are so fleeting, it is wise to grasp them and fix them while they are
fresh.

In writing the examination, be sure you read every question carefully.
Each question has a definite point; look for it, and do not start
answering until you are sure you have found it. Discover the
implications of each question; canvass its possible interpretations,
and if it is at all ambiguous seek light from the instructor if he is
willing to make any further comment.

It is well to have scratch paper handy and make outlines for your
answers to long questions. It is a good plan, also, when dealing with
long questions, to watch the time carefully, for there is danger that
you will spend too much time upon some question to the detriment of
others equally important, though shorter.

One error which students often commit in taking examinations is to
waste time in dreaming. As they come upon a difficult question they sit
back and wait for the answer to come to them. This is the wrong plan.
The secret of freedom of ideas lies in activity. Therefore, at such
times, keep active, so that the associative processes will operate
freely. Stimulate brain activity by the method suggested in Chapter X,
namely, by means of muscular activity. Instead of idly waiting for
flashes of inspiration, begin to write. You may not be able to write
directly upon the point at issue, but you can write something about it,
and as you begin to explore and to express your meagre fund of
knowledge, one idea will call up another and soon the correct answer
will appear.

After you have prepared yourself to the extent of your ability, you
should maintain toward the examination an attitude of confidence.
Believe firmly that you will pass the examination. Make strong
suggestions to yourself, affirming positively that you have the
requisite amount of information and the ability to express it
coherently and forcefully. Fortified by the consciousness of faithful
application throughout the work of a course, reinforced by a thorough,
well-planned review, and with a firm conviction in the strength of your
own powers, you may approach your examinations with comparative ease
and with good chances of passing them creditably.

CHAPTER XV

BODILY CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY


It is a truism to say that mental ability is affected by bodily
conditions. A common complaint of students is that they cannot study
because of a headache, or they fail in class because of loss of sleep.
So patent is the interrelation between bodily condition and study that
we cannot consider our discussion of study problems complete without
recognition of the topic. We shall group our discussions about three of
the most important physical activities, eating, sleeping and
exercising. These make up the greater part of our daily activities and
if they are properly regulated our study is likely to be effective.

FOOD.--It is generally agreed that the main function of food is to
repair the tissues of the body. Other effects are present, such as
pleasure and sociability, but its chief benefit is reparative, so we
may well regard the subject from a strictly utilitarian standpoint and
inquire how we may produce the highest efficiency from our eating. Some
of the important questions about eating are, how much to eat, what kind
of food to eat, when to eat, what are the most favorable conditions for
eating?

The quantity of food to be taken varies with the demands of the
individual appetite and the individual powers of absorption. In
general, one who is engaged in physical labor needs more, because of
increased appetite and increased waste of tissues. So a farm-hand needs
more food than a college student, whose work is mostly indoors and
sedentary. Much has been said recently about the ills of overeating.
One of the most enthusiastic defenders of a decreased diet is Mr.
Horace Fletcher, who, by the practice of protracted mastication,
&quot;contrives to satisfy the appetite while taking an exceptionally small
amount of food. Salivary digestion is favored and the mechanical
subdivision of the food is carried to an extreme point. Remarkably
complete digestion and absorption follow. By faithfully pursuing this
system Mr. Fletcher has vastly bettered his general health, and is a
rare example of muscular and mental power for a man above sixty years
of age. He is a vigorous pedestrian and mountain-climber and holds
surprising records for endurance tests in the gymnasium.

&quot;The chief gain observed in his case, as in others which are more or
less parallel, is the acquiring of immunity to fatigue, both muscular
and central. It is not claimed that the sparing diet confers great
strength for momentary efforts--'explosive strength,' as the term
goes--but that moderate muscular contractions may be repeated many
times with far less discomfort than before. The inference appears to be
that the subject who eats more than is best has in his circulation and
his tissues by-products which act like the muscular waste which is
normally responsible for fatigue. According to this conception he is
never really fresh for his task, but is obliged to start with a
handicap. When he reduces his diet the cells and fluids of his body
free themselves of these by-products and he realizes a capacity quite
unguessed in the past.

&quot;The same assumption explains the fact mentioned by Mr. Fletcher, that
the hours of sleep can be reduced decidedly when the diet is cut down.
It would seem as though a part of our sleep might often be due to
avoidable auto-intoxication. If one can shorten his nightly sleep
without feeling the worse for it this is an important gain.&quot;

But the amount of food is probably not so important as the kind. Foods
containing much starch, as potatoes and rice, may ordinarily be taken
in greater quantities than foods containing much protein, such as meats
and nuts. So our problem is not so much concerned with quantity as with
the choice of kinds of food. Probably the most favorable distribution
of foods for students is a predominance of fruits, coarse cereals,
starch and sugar and less prominence to meats. Do not begin the day's
study on a breakfast of cakes. They are a heavy tax upon the digestive
powers and their nutritive value is low. The mid-day meal is also a
crucial factor in determining the efficiency of afternoon study, and
many students almost completely incapacitate themselves for afternoon
work by a too-heavy noon meal. Frequently an afternoon course is
rendered quite valueless because the student drowses through the
lecture soddened by a heavy lunch. One way of overcoming this
difficulty is by dispensing with the mid-day meal; another way is to
drink a small amount of coffee, which frequently keeps people awake;
but these devices are not to be universally recommended.

The heavy meal of a student may well come at evening. It should consist
of a varied assortment of foods with some liquids, preferably clear
soup, milk and water. Meat also forms a substantial part of this meal,
though ordinarily it should not be taken more than once a day. Much is
heard nowadays about the dangers of excessive meat-eating and the
objections are well-founded in the case of brain-workers. The
undesirable effects are &quot;an unprofitable spurring of the metabolism--
more particularly objectionable in warm weather--and the menace of
auto-intoxication.&quot; Too much protein, found in meat, lays a burden upon
the liver and kidneys and when the burden is too great, wastes, which
cannot be taken care of, gather and poison the blood, giving rise to
that feeling of being &quot;tired all over&quot; which is so inimical to mental
and physical exertion. When meat is eaten, care should be taken to
choose right kinds. &quot;Some kinds of meat are well known to occasion
indigestion. Pork and veal are particularly feared. While we may not
know the reason why these foods so often disagree with people, it seems
probable that texture is an important consideration. In both these
meats the fibre is fine, and fat is intimately mingled with the lean. A
close blending of fat with nitrogenous matter appears to give a fabric
which is hard to digest. The same principle is illustrated by
fat-soaked fried foods. Under the cover of the fat, thorough-going
bacterial decomposition of the proteins may be accomplished with the
final release of highly poisonous products. Attacks of acute
indigestion resulting from this cause are much like the so-called
ptomaine poisoning.&quot;

Much of the benefit of meat may be secured from other foods. Fat, for
example, may be obtained from milk and butter freed from the
objectionable qualities of the meat-fibre. In this connection it is
important to call attention to the use of fried fat. Avoid fat that is
mixed with starch particles in such foods as fried potatoes and
pie-crust.

The conditions during meals should always be as pleasant as possible.
This refers both to physical surroundings and mental condition. &quot;The
processes occurring in the alimentary canal are greatly subject to
influences radiating from the brain. It is especially striking that
both the movements of the stomach and the secretion of the gastric
juice may be inhibited as a result of disturbing circumstances.
Intestinal movements may be modified in similar fashion.&quot;

&quot;Cannon has collected various instances of the suspension of digestion
in consequence of disagreeable experiences, and it would be easy for
almost anyone to add to his list. He tells us, for example, of the case
of a woman whose stomach was emptied under the direction of a
specialist in order to ascertain the degree of digestion undergone by a
prescribed breakfast. The dinner of the night before was recovered and
was found almost unaltered. Inquiry led to the fact that the woman had
passed a night of intense agitation as the result of misconduct on the
part of her husband. People who are seasick some hours after a meal
vomit undigested food. Apprehension of being sick has probably
inhibited the gastric activities.

&quot;Just as a single occasion of painful emotion may lead to a passing
digestive disturbance, so continued mental depression, worry, or grief
may permanently impair the working of the (alimentary) tract and
undermine the vigor and capacity of the sufferer. Homesickness is not
to be regarded lightly as a cause of malnutrition. Companionship is a
powerful promoter of assimilation. The attractive serving of food, a
pleasant room, and good ventilation are of high importance. The lack of
these, so commonly faced by the lonely student or the young man making
a start in a strange city, may be to some extent counteracted by the
cultivation of optimism and the mental discipline which makes it
possible to detach one's self from sordid surroundings.&quot;

Almost as important as eating is drinking, for liquids constitute the
&quot;largest item in the income&quot; of the body. Free drinking is recommended
by physiologists, the beneficial results being, &quot;the avoidance of
constipation, and the promotion of the elimination of dissolved waste
by the kidneys and possibly the liver.&quot; In regard to the use of water
with meals, a point upon which emphatic cautions were formerly offered,
recent experiments have failed to show any bad effects from this, and
the advice is now given to drink &quot;all the water that one chooses with
meals.&quot; Caution should be observed, however, about introducing hot and
cold liquids into the stomach in quick succession.

Other liquids have been much discussed by dietitians, especially tea
and coffee. &quot;These beverages owe what limited food value they have to
the cream and sugar usually mixed with them. They give pleasure by
their aroma, but they are given a peculiar position among articles of
diet by the presence in them of the compound caffein, which is
distinctly a drug. It is a stimulant to the heart, the kidneys, and the
central nervous system.&quot;

&quot;Individual susceptibility to the action of caffein varies greatly.
Where one person notices little or no reaction after a cup of coffee,
another is exhilarated to a marked degree and hours later may find
himself lying sleepless with tense or trembling muscles, a dry, burning
skin, and a mind feverishly active. Often it is found that a more
protracted disturbance follows the taking of coffee with cream than is
caused by black coffee.

&quot;It is too much to claim that the use of tea and coffee is altogether
to be condemned. Many people, nevertheless, are better without them.
For all who find themselves strongly stimulated it is the part of
wisdom to limit the enjoyment of these decoctions to real emergencies
when uncommon demands are made upon the endurance and when for a time
hygienic considerations have to be ignored. If young people will
postpone the formation of the habit they will have one more resource
when the pressure of mature life becomes severe.&quot;

Before concluding this discussion a word might be added concerning the
relation between fasting and mental activity. Prolonged abstinence from
food frequently results in highly sharpened intellectual powers.
Numerous examples of this are found in the literature of history and
biography; many actors, speakers and singers habitually fast before
public performances. There are some disadvantages to fasting,
especially loss of weight and weakness, but when done under the
direction of a physician, fasting has been known to produce very
beneficial effects. It is mentioned here because it has such marked
effects in speeding up the mental processes and clearing the mind; and
the well-nourished student may find the practice a source of mental
strength during times of stress such as examinations.

SLEEP.--&quot;About one-third of an average human life is passed in the
familiar and yet mysterious state which we call sleep. From one point
of view this seems a large inroad upon the period in which our
consciousness has its exercise; a subtraction of twenty-five years from
the life of one who lives to be seventy-five. Yet we know that the
efficiency and comfort of the individual demand the surrender of all
this precious time. It has often been said that sleep is a more
imperative necessity than food, and the claim seems to be well
founded.&quot; It is quite likely that some students indulge in too much
sleep. This may sometimes be due to laziness, but frequently it is due
to actual intoxication, from an excess of food which results in the
presence of poisonous &quot;narcotizing substances absorbed from the
burdened intestine&quot;. This theory is rendered tenable by the fact that
when the diet is reduced the hours of sleep may be reduced. If one is
in good health, it seems right to expect that one should be able to
arise gladly and briskly upon awaking. By all means do not indulge
yourself in long periods of lying in bed after a good night's rest. If
we examine the physical and physiological conditions of sleep we shall
better understand its hygiene. Sleep is a state in which the tissues of
the body which have been used up may be restored. Of course some
restoration of broken-down tissue takes place as soon as it begins to
wear out, but so long as the body keeps working, the one process can
never quite compensate for the other, so there must be a periodic
cessation of activity so that the energies of the body may be devoted
to restoration. Viewing sleep as a time when broken-down bodily cells
are restored, we see that we tax the energies of the body less if we go
to sleep each day before the cells are entirely depleted. That is the
significance of the old teaching that sleep before midnight is more
efficacious than sleep after midnight. It is not that there is any
mystic virtue in the hours before twelve, but that in the early part of
the evening the cells are not so nearly exhausted as they are later in
the evening, and it is much easier to repair them in the partially
exhausted stage than it is in the completely exhausted stage. For this
reason, a mid-day nap is often effective, or a short nap after the
evening dinner. By thus catching the cells at an early stage of their
exhaustion, they can be restored with comparative ease, and more energy
will be available for use during the remainder of the working hours.

A problem that may occasionally trouble a student is sleeplessness and
we may properly consider here some of the ways of avoiding it. One
prime cause of sleeplessness is external disturbance. The disturbance
may be visual. Although it is ordinarily thought that if the eyes are
closed, no visual disturbances can be sensed, nevertheless, as a matter
of fact the eye-lids are not wholly opaque. Sight may be obtained
through them, as you may prove by closing your eyes and moving your
fingers before them. The lids transmit light to the retina and it is
quite likely that you are frequently awakened by a beam of light
falling upon your closed eye-lids. For this reason, one who is inclined
to be wakeful should shut out from the bed-room all avenues whereby
light may enter as a distraction.

The temperature sense is also a source of distraction in sleep, and it
is a common experience to be awakened by extreme cold. The ears, too,
may be the source of disturbance in sleep; for even though we are
asleep, the tympanic membrane is always exposed to vibrations of air.
In fact, stimuli are continually playing upon the sense-organs and are
arousing nervous currents which try to break over the boundaries of
sleep and impress themselves upon the brain.

For this reason, one who wishes to have untroubled sleep should remove
all possible distractions.

But apart from external distractions, wakefulness may still be caused
by distractions from within. Troublesome ideas may be present and
persist in keeping one awake. This means that brain activity has been
started and needs suppression. Various devices have been suggested. One
is to eat something very light, just enough to draw the surplus blood,
which excites the brain, away from the brain to the digestive tract.
This advice should be taken with caution, however, for eating just
before retiring may use up in digestion much of the energy needed in
repairing the body, and may leave one greatly fatigued in the morning.

One way to relieve the mind of mental distractions is to fill it with
non-worrisome, restful thoughts. Read something light, a restful essay
or a non-exciting story, or poetry. Another device is to bathe the head
in cold water so as to relieve congestion of blood in the brain. A
tepid or warm bath is said to have a similar effect.

Dreams constitute one source of annoyance to many, and while they are
not necessarily to be avoided, still they may disturb the night's rest.
We may avoid them in some measure by creating conditions free from
sensory distractions, for many of our dreams are direct reflections of
sensations we are experiencing at the moment. A dream with an arctic
setting may be the result of becoming uncovered on a cold night. To use
an illustration from Ellis: &quot;A man dreams that he enlists in the army,
goes to the front, and is shot. He is awakened by the slamming of a
door. It seems probable that the enlistment and the march to the field
are theories to account for the report which really caused the whole
train of thought, though it seemed to be its latest item.&quot; Such dreams
may be partially eliminated by care in arranging conditions so that
there will be few distractions. Especially should they be guarded
against in the later hours of the sleep, for we do not sleep so soundly
after the first two hours as we do before, and stimuli can more easily
impress themselves and affect the brain.

Before leaving the subject of sleep, we should note the benefit to be
derived from regularity in sleep. All Nature seems to move rhythmically
and sleep is no exception. Insomnia may be treated by means of
habituating one's self to get sleepy at a certain time, and there is no
question that the rising process may be made easier if one forms the
habit of arising at the same time every morning. To rhythmize this
important function is a long step towards the efficient life.

EXERCISE.--Brain workers do not ordinarily get all the exercise they
should. Particularly is this true of some conscientious students who
feel they must not take any time from their study. But this denotes a
false conception of mental action. The human organism needs exercise.
Man is not a disembodied spirit; he must pay attention to the claims of
the body. Indeed it will be found that time spent in exercise will
result in a higher grade of mental work. This is recognized by colleges
and universities by the requirement of gymnasium work, and the
opportunity should be welcomed by the student. Inasmuch as institutions
generally give instruction in this subject, we need not go specifically
into the matter of exercises. Perhaps the only caution that need be
urged is that against the excessive participation in such exhausting
games as foot-ball. It is seriously to be questioned whether the
strenuous grilling that a foot-ball player must undergo does not
actually impair his ability to concentrate upon his studies.

If you undertake a course of exercise, by all means have it regular.
Little is gained by sporadic exercising. Adopt the principle of
regularity and rhythmize this important phase of bodily activity as
well as all other phases.

In concluding our discussion of physical hygiene for the student, we
cannot stress too much the value of relaxation. The life of a student
is a trying one. It exercises chiefly the higher brain centres and
keeps the organism keyed up to a high pitch. These centres become
fatigued easily and ought to be rested occasionally. Therefore, the
student should relax at intervals, and engage in something remote from
study. To forget books for an entire week-end is often wisdom; to have
a hobby or an avocation is also wise. A student must not forget that he
is something more than an intellectual being. He is a physical organism
and a social being, and the well-rounded life demands that all phases
receive expression. We grant that it is wrong to exalt the physical and
stunt the mental, but it is also wrong to develop the intellectual and
neglect the physical. We must recognize with Browning that,

      all good things
Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now,
  than flesh helps soul.

__NOTOC__

'''Turkey Soup''' works well as a meal for an ordinary day. 

Chicken may be used in place of turkey, but is not as nice and often costs more per pound.

==Ingredients==
* Raw [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or cooked turkey and canned [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Celery|Celery]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|Broccoli]]
* Wide [[Cookbook:Egg noodles|egg noodles]]
* [[Cookbook:Sage|Sage]]
* [[Cookbook:Rosemary|Rosemary]]
* [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]]

Optionally, add:
* [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] or egg white
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Asparagus|Asparagus]]
* Frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
* [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|Bay leaf]]

==Procedure==
===If you have raw turkey===
#Thaw the turkey in the refrigerator. This may take a few days.
#Wash the turkey, including the inside. There may be a bag of organ meat inside the turkey; some of this will be needed.
#Discard the liver, often found in the organ bag.
#Discard the kidneys if you can find them. They are usually still attached to the inside of the turkey. Your broth will taste better if you can get rid of the kidneys and the liver.
#Place the turkey in a pan, preferably on a wire rack to keep the turkey out of the broth.
#Poke holes in the turkey to let the broth drain. Do this also to the neck.
#Place the neck, heart, and gizzards in the pan. To protect them from the heat, shove them under the edge of the turkey a bit.
#Cook the turkey, following directions for temperature. Increased time will get you more broth and make the meat nearest to the skin be as if it were fried. At regular intervals, collect broth from the pan and replace it with a small amount of water to prevent burning. (the broth in the pan will burn if it is allowed to go completely dry) You may wish to eat the heart part-way through the cooking time.
#Eat the turkey meal, saving the sliceable parts for sandwiches and the softer parts for soup. Save the skin and bones.
#Place the skin, bones, wing tips, neck, gizzards, and so on into a large pot. Leave out any severely burned parts. Crush the bones down a bit, and cover with water, and add a lid.
#Bring to a boil reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer the longer the better; 30 minutes will do but an hour or two would be better. You may need to add water from time to time to replace any lost water. Do not allow the water to fully boil away. This is critical; it is very easy to ruin this by boiling away the water.
#Strain the liquid from this pot into another container.
#Mix some of the liquid from the boiling of the bones into the broth you collected while cooking. You'll have to go by taste and experience. If you use too many bones in the broth, the result will have an overly strong flavor you may add water to taste. Note that a proper broth solidifies like gelatin when it is refrigerated.
#If you have a great deal of fat, you may wish to scrape some off after it solidifies. Do not remove all of the fat, you will lose a lot of the flavor.

===Once you have the broth and cooked turkey===
#Cut the turkey into chunks similar in size to your egg noodles. Most ingredients should be cut to this size.
#Place the broth, spices, and celery into a large pot.
#Bring the pot to a simmer.
#If using an egg, this is the time to add it. Mix the egg in a bowl, or just use the white. From just above the surface of the liquid in your pot, dribble the egg into the pot while moving across the pot. Do not stir until the egg has set. This should produce egg filaments.
#Add the noodles, turkey and, optionally, the frozen corn.
#If your broth did not have much fat, add some oil.
#If the noodles are not soft yet, wait until they are soft.
#Add the broccoli and, optionally, the asparagus. When the broccoli loses the bluish cast and becomes bright green, serve the soup. Do not allow the broccoli to cook any more, especially not to the point where it begins to get a yellow-brown cast. You may use ice to stop the cooking and more quickly bring the soup to an eatable temperature.

This book is great. Polishing up the grammar would make it really nice. Exercises would make it excellent, as currently the reader can learn a great deal, but not practice with the knowledge they've gained.

==Pages with problems==

== Getting to the text-book ==

I can't figure out how to actually get to a non-print version  of it. This makes it very difficult to read. [[user:Bawolff]] (not logged in)

:I hope I have fixed this problem [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad.Irwin]] 22:56, 29 April 2007 (UTC)


== Simple Harmonic Motion ==

There doesn't seem to be any mention of pendulums or oscillations of a spring in the wave chapter of the book.  To me, this seems like a logical place to put it. Is this something that hasn't been put in yet or is it somewhere else?

== Units in LaTeX Math Environment ==

By default, any text placed in a displaymath environment (or other types of math rendering environments) will be rendered as a variable, and mathematical spacing will be applied. I suggest using the following format:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1000\text{ joules}}{1000\text{ seconds}} = 1\text{W}&lt;/math&gt;

As opposed to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1000 joules}{1000 seconds} = 1W&lt;/math&gt;

The solution is simple - use the \text{} function:

\frac{1000&lt;b&gt;\text{&lt;/b&gt; joules&lt;b&gt;}&lt;/b&gt;}{1000&lt;b&gt;\text{&lt;/b&gt; seconds&lt;b&gt;}&lt;/b&gt;} = 1&lt;b&gt;\text{&lt;/b&gt;W&lt;b&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; as opposed to \frac{1000 joules}{1000 seconds} = 1W

Hi

This is the framework for the material developed by the FHST group. Over the next few weeks I will upload the content into the appropiate pages.

Your book is now the Book of the Month. Do you (the people working on this book) have an image we could use on the front page? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 11:52, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Orphaned book module ==

The following is an orphaned book module.  I'm not going to add the link to where it belongs, as I'll leave it to the participants to decide where it should go.  This somehow was not linked into the main index and needs to be put in there somewhere:

*[[FHSST Physics Collisions Explosions:Types of Collisions]]

--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:21, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

I had a look and I don't understand what you mean by orphaned? There is a link to this page from 
the index page for FHSST_Physics, is that not sufficient? [[User:Marknewlyn|Marknewlyn]]

== Coordinate with Connections Physics? ==
[http://cnx.org/member_profile/Sunil_Singh Sunil Singh], a Physicist in India, has been developing some great cc-by materials for Connextions: see for instance his [http://cnx.org/content/m13600/latest/ kinematics fundamentals].  The images and presentation are quite polished; this might make a good source of material to coordinate with the next iteration of tihs FHSST text.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:41, 1 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

An '''omelet''' or '''omelette''' is a breakfast food consisting of an egg-based wrapper around a filling of your choice.

==Ingredients==

* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] and 2 [[cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s for a typical (6 inch) pan
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

Suggested fillings include:

* pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] or most other seasonal vegetables
* [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], optionally with the seeds and pulp removed
* [[cookbook:Pan Frying|pan fried]] [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], [[cookbook:mushroom|mushroom]]s, and [[cookbook:fennel|fennel]]
* [[cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]] and [[cookbook:leek|leek]]s
* [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]], e.g. [[cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]], [[cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano]], goat's chevre and fresh herbs (e.g. [[cookbook:basil|basil]])
* any blue cheese
* [[cookbook:spinach|spinach]], goat cheese, and [[cookbook:Pine Nut|pinenut]]s
* [[cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] spinach
* [[cookbook:pancetta|pancetta]]
* wood-fired or lightly [[cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] baby [[cookbook:potato|potato]]es and fresh [[cookbook:herb|herb]]s
* wood-fired baby potatoes, mushrooms, and [[cookbook:Brie Cheese|Brie]]
* Spanish sausage, mushrooms, and blue cheese
* [[cookbook:Salmon|smoked salmon]], crispy potatoes and herb [[cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* smoked salmon, Brie, and fresh herbs
* [[Cookbook:Shrimp|prawns]] and Brie with fennel confit
* pancetta, bocconcini, and basil
* Feta cheese, garlic , cheddar cheese

==Procedure==
Omelettes take little time to complete. Always ensure your fillings are either pre-cooked, able to be finished in the time available, or edible when raw but warmed.

An omelette can be served folded in half or thirds.

'''Note:''' Before non-stick coating became common, many cooks would keep a special omelette pan which would not be used for any other purpose. '''It is important to use a very clean pan, especially if it is not a &quot;non-stick&quot; pan'''. If keeping a pan solely for omelettes, after cooking, wipe well with a clean cloth or paper-towel and then apply a thin coating of clean vegetable oil.

===If you only have a normal frying pan===
#Chop up the filling.
#Mix the eggs well. You may add [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] to thin them (up to 1 Tbsp for each egg).
#Pour the eggs into a cool frying pan.
#Heat the pan, stirring constantly.
#Stop stirring as soon as solid egg begins to form.
#As the egg solidifies, pry it loose around the edges.
#If you didn't stir enough earlier, you may have difficulty solidifying the egg on top. In this case, you may pry up an edge while tilting the pan to let liquid egg flow under the solid egg. It is best to avoid this problem though.
#Keep loosening the egg from the edges until you can slide it around.
#Now you need to flip the egg without ripping it. If you have a very wide turner (or two smaller ones), you can use that. Otherwise, you'll have to flip the egg in the air. To do so, rapidly move the pan away from you then up, back toward you a bit, and then very rapidly downward. Catch the egg in the pan.
#Place filling on the egg.
#When the egg is done, wrap it around the filling. Serve.

===If you have a large flat professional-style cooktop===
#Chop up the filling.
#Mix the eggs well. You may add milk or cream to thin them.
#Heat your cooktop. (you're doing this without a pan, on the cooktop)
#Pour the eggs, using a spiral motion to spread them wide and thin.
#When the egg has set, gently add fillings on top.
#Using a large (3-inch by 12-inch, or 75 x 300mm) turner, fold the egg over the filling.
#When you think the bottom has cooked, flip the omelette over to cook the other side.

==Variations==
*Use 3 eggs and a dash of milk or [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] instead of the 2 eggs and 2 egg whites.
*Use eggs and hot water instead of milk or cream '''(do not use boiling water; that will cook the eggs)
*Fry the omelette in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]].
*After folding the omelette, top with grated cheddar and place frying pan under a grill until the cheese begins to brown.
*Garnish with [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], sour cream or other thickened dairy product with a fragrant sprig of a fresh herb or edible flower.
*Fry the omelet in excess oil and butter (covering the top)
*Put the entire frying pan under a pre-heated grill to melt cheese before folding, and make the top go golden.

__NOTOC__
[[Image:CookbookWontonSoup.jpg|thumb|256px|wonton soup]]
Wonton filling is essentially [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], but with smaller particles and less cooking. It goes hot into a [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrapper]] (equal to 1/4 of an [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] wrapper), which is then cooked in a hot [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]].

Note that these wontons do not contain [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], which are used by commercial wonton producers to cheapen the filling. The filling in these wontons is superior.

==Ingredients==
* wonton wrappers, or egg roll wrappers cut into quarters
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]], or plain [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat or poultry]] (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]], or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and perhaps [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
* bamboo shoots
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the filling, possibly including [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]

==Procedure==

===Filling===
#Cut the meat into tiny pieces. This is much easier to do if the meat is cooked, but the result will be better if you cut the meat raw, then cook it.
#Cut the bamboo shoots into matchsticks.
#Chop the broccoli head into little pieces, perhaps 3/8-inch diameter. Cut the stalk into matchsticks.
#If using celery, cut the stalks lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide pieces and then crosswise into 1/8-inch slices.
#If using bok choy, cut the leaves away from the stalk. Treat the stalks as celery. Cut the leaves crosswise in 1/2-inch strips, then break the strips into 1.5-inch pieces.
#If using spinach, treat it much like the bok choy leaves.
#Wash the bean sprouts, discarding any that are not white and crisp.
#Place oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] and turn on the heat. High temperatures can produce a better result, but require rapid stirring to prevent burning. Beginners should use lower temperatures. Split the cooking into batches as needed to ensure that your wok is not too full; there should be plenty of room to stir and toss the food. You may prefer to cook each ingredient separately, then mix them at the end.
#Add the meat. If it is uncooked, lightly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] it now. Drain juices and add more oil as needed.
#You may add a small amount of sesame seed oil and/or [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] for flavor.
#Add soy sauce. For a typical wok full of food, add a [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]].
#Add ginger. About 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of ginger should be right, depending on taste. Ginger is somewhat hot.
#Add the broccoli, and the celery and/or bok choy stalks. When done, they should be just slightly softened. Broccoli should end up being very bright green, losing its bluish cast but not gaining any hint of a yellow-brown cast.
#Add bok choy leaves and/or spinach. When done, they should be just barely wilted.
#Add the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, and turn off the heat. Do not overcook the bean sprouts.

===Construction and boiling===
#Begin heating water or chicken broth to cook the wontons. You will need this pot to be at a high [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] or low [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] to cook the wontons, though such temperatures can damage the taste of dashi and miso soup. Thus, if using dashi or miso soup, you must do the initial cooking in water.
#Place a small amount of filling onto a wonton wrapper. Pull the corners of the wrapper up, so that all four corners touch each other. Pinch and/or fold the edges to seal the wonton. Repeat as needed.
#Gently lower some wontons into the pot. Do not overfill the pot. Initially, wontons are easy to unseal by accident. While these cook, you can make more wontons.
#Cook the wontons for 3 minutes. Remove them with a [[Cookbook:Slotted Spoon|slotted spoon]] and place them aside. Keep adding and removing wontons until all are cooked.
#To serve, place some wontons in a bowl and pour your choice of liquid over them.

==Variation==
You can use [[Cookbook:Tamales|tamale]] filling.

[[Image:Munster.jpg|right|thumb|Meunster cheese]]

A semi-soft cheese that varies in flavor depending on source.  The original Muenster cheeses from France have a stronger taste because they are aged longer, while the Muenster/Munster bought in the United States from a deli is usually domestic and is much milder.

Muenster cheese will melt over low heat, but not as quickly as [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] or cheese stuffs.  This property makes it a good choice for heated sandwiches versus [[Cookbook:Provolone Cheese|Provolone]] or [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss]].

*:made with [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], the soup has a red color&lt;br&gt;
''If you don't know the difference between New England and Manhattan clam chowders: the one with tomatoes has a &quot;t&quot; in the name!''
*[[Cookbook:Rhode Island Clam Chowder|Rhode Island Clam Chowder]]
*:a soup with a clear broth, without added cream or tomatoes.

:''See: [[Cookbook:Grilled Cheese Sandwich|Grilled Cheese Sandwich]]''
[[File:Grilled cheese with soup.jpg|thumb|right|A grilled cheese sandwich, sometimes paired with [[tomato soup]] in North America]]
A '''Toasted Cheese Sandwich''' works well as an everyday lunch. It goes well with soda (pop) or [[Cookbook:Tomato Soup|tomato soup]]. Quality greatly depends on ingredient selection and cooking temperature. A good '''Toasted Cheese Sandwich''' has a crispy outside, and is not mushy.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Mild Cheddar Cheese]], chosen to be low in moisture. When buying cheese, most likely you will find that the cheeses are labeled for fat, protein, and total weight. Consider the unmentioned part to be moisture, and choose the cheese which minimizes this. For any given amount of protein per weight, choose the cheese with the highest fat content. Likewise, for any given amount of fat per weight, choose the cheese with the highest protein content.
* [[Cookbook:Bread|Sturdy low-moisture bread]]. Multi-grain bread tends to work well. Sourdough and English toasting bread should also work OK.

==Procedure==
#Slice the cheese 1/8-inch thick.
#Butter the two slices of bread in one side.
#Cover a bread slice with cheese, over the unbuttered side. If you leave gaps, distribute them evenly throughout the middle.
#Finish the sandwich with the other slice of bread; again, buttered side out.
#Place the sandwich into a cool 2-sided contact-based cooking device. Namely a sandwich-iron or you can use a waffle iron or a grill intended for cooking burgers. The George Foreman brand is reported to work fine. 
#Heat the sandwich.
#Remove the sandwich when all the cheese has melted and the outside is medium-dark brown and crispy.
#Eat immediately. If you must set this sandwich down, use a heated plate or a loose paper towel to avoid letting condensation ruin the surface.
#Remember to cool the cooking device a bit before cooking another sandwich.

==Variation==
Add relatively dry [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], or [[Cookbook:Pastrami|pastrami]]. After cooking, you may pry open the sandwich to add [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]], [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]], or sweet chilli sauce.

A bit of Worcestershire Sauce poured on the cheese before cooking also works well.

Instead of butter/margarine on the outside of the bread, you can substitute mayonnaise for a tangier sandwich.

Thinly sliced tomato is a nice addition to the sandwich, as are wilted spinach or roasted red peppers. You can also add sliced onion with the tomato to give a more exotic feel.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or other [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]].
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] with, possibly including [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]]

==Procedure==
#Cut raw meat into small pieces.
#Chop the broccoli head into medium-small pieces, perhaps 1.2-inch diameter. Cut the stalk to be like disks, 1/8-inch thick.
#Place oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] and turn on the heat. High temperatures can produce a better result, but require rapid stirring to prevent burning. Slow beginners should use lower temperatures. Split the cooking into batches as needed to ensure that your wok is not too full; there should be plenty of room to stir and toss the food in your wok. You may prefer to cook each ingredient separately, then mix them at the end.
#Place sesame seeds into the wok. Stir fry them until they are golden-brown. Remove them, and put them aside for later.
#[[Cookbook:Stir-frying|Stir-fry]] the meat. Drain juices and add more oil as needed.
#Add soy sauce. For a typical wok full of food, add a tablespoon. If using low-salt soy sauce, you can add much more without making the food too salty.
#Add back the sesame seeds.
#If using ginger, add about 1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]], depending on taste. Ginger is somewhat hot.
#Add the broccoli, stalks first. When done, the broccoli should be just slightly softened. Broccoli should end up being very bright green, losing the bluish cast but not gaining any hint of a yellow-brown cast.

==Variation==
Near the end, you can add: well-drained canned straw [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], well-drained canned [[Cookbook:Water Chestnut|water chestnuts]], and crisp white [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]]. Don't forget that [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] is an option.

Sprouts make for an excellent salad, both tastier and more nutritious than a lettuce-based salad.
Placement as directed ensures that the salad is easily forkable (the fork loosely passes through the top layers to embed in the lowest layer) and ensures that the oil will not
all puddle at the bottom. This salad serves two adults, assumed to be eating from the same dish.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 package (4&quot; by 4&quot;, sprout height) of plain [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of real [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] bits
* 2 to 4 very ripe medium-sized [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 3 stalks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1/3 cup of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1/3 cup of red wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]

== Procedure ==

#Cut the tomatoes into chunks, about 1.2 inches in diameter. If using tomatoes that are small, cut each one at least once. Remove the core and, optionally, the gooey parts.
#Cut the celery crosswise, with 1-inch spacing near the thick base and 2-inch spacing near the narrow top.
#Distribute the celery and tomato pieces evenly in the bottom of a wide bowl. (the salad bowl)
#Holding the sprouts so that they do not separate and entangle themselves, wash them under running water.
#Place the sprouts into a bowl full of water. Gently dunk them and change the water a few times, removing the seed casings without getting the sprouts all tangled up.
#Drain the sprouts well. You may need to shake them a bit.
#Spread the sprouts over the tomatoes and celery, still being careful not to make a tangled mess.
#Sprinkle the bacon bits over top of the sprouts. The sprouts should be well-covered; use more bacon if needed.
#Drizzle oil over the bacon. The oil will adhere to the bacon better than it does to the sprouts.
#Sprinkle vinegar over everything.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Garnish it with raisins and crunchy dry roasted peanuts.

----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Carbocations are carbon atoms in an organic molecule bearing a positive formal charge.  Therefore they are ''carbo''n ''cations''.  Carbocations have only six electrons in their valence shell making them electron deficient.  Thus, they are unstable electrophiles and will react very quickly with nucleophiles to form new bonds.  Because of their reactivity with heteroatoms, carbocations are very useful intermediates in many common organic reactions.

==Carbocation Structure==
The orbitals of carbocations are generally sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized so that the three full orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry about the carbon nucleus.  The remaining p orbital is empty and will readily accept a pair of electrons from another atom.  Because of the symmetry of this geometric arrangement, nucleophilic attack is equally favorable above or below the plane formed by the full orbitals.

==Carbocation Stability==
Carbocations are generally unstable and fairly hard to form.  They usually cannot be isolated from a reaction as they will react immediately to fill their empty p orbital.  Because they are electron deficient, attaching electron donating groups (such as alkyl groups) to the carbocation will help stabilize the carbocation.  In general:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Stability of Alkyl Carbocations&lt;/H2&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Clearly, the tertiary carbocation is the most stable, as it is surrounded by three other carbon atoms that share the burden of its positive charge.  Primary and especially methyl carbocations are rarely seen in organic reactions except under special circumstances like in the case of benzylic or allylic cations.

Carbocations can also be stabilized through resonance by neighboring lone pairs or pi-electrons.  In general, this stabilization is greater than one degree of substitution, so a secondary carbocation stabilized by resonance will be more stable than a tertiary carbocation with no resonance stabilization, and a primary carbocation stabilized by resonance will be more stable than a secondary carbocation with no resonance stabilization.

==Formation of Carbocations==
Carbocation intermediates are formed in three main types of reactions: additions to pi bonds, unimolecular eliminations, and unimolecular nucleophilic substitution.
On a bridge head a positive carbon is rare.
The 3-cyclopropyl carbocation is the most stable carbocation.

==Reactions of Carbocations==
In general, carbocations will undergo three basic types of reactions:

===1. Nucleophile Capture===
Carbocations will react with even mild nucleophiles (such as water) to form a new bond.and formation of carbon free radical

===2. Elimination to form a pi bond===
Carbons alpha to the carbocation  will often lose a proton to form a double (or, in some cases) triple bond from the carbocation.  Such a reaction requires only a mild base (e.g. chloride) to remove the proton.

===3. Rearrangement===
A secondary carbocation may rearrange to form a tertiary carbocation before the ion is stabilized using one of the above-mentioned reactions.  Since a cation constitutes a deficiency of electrons, the empty orbitals do not move; rather, a hydrogen atom bonded to a nearby carbon is moved to stabilize the secondary carbocation, of the hydrogen atom creates a new tertiary carbocation, which is more stable and will be substituted to lead to the final product.  See [[w:carbocation rearrangement]].

'''Cashew Chicken''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Broccoli Stir Fry|stir-fry]], but with a somewhat thick sauce. In this dish, the cashews become soft (but see '''Variations''' below). This dish goes well served over rice.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* vegetables
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] with
* whole roasted [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashews]], salted or not
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* vegetables

==Procedure==
#Begin boiling the cashews in a covered pot. Be sure to add water from time to time so that the cashews are kept wet.
#Prepare the chicken and vegetables as you would for [[Cookbook:Broccoli Stir Fry|Broccoli Stir Fry]] or [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|Egg Roll]] filling, with particle sizes around 1-inch diameter.
#For the sauce, start with 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Bring this to a boil while stirring. Add additional corn starch or chicken broth as needed to control the thickness. You may also wish to add some sugar, orange juice, and additional soy sauce.
#Add the sauce and cashews to the rest of the dish.
#Serve with rice.

==Variation==
Instead of stir-frying the chicken and boiling the cashews, you can add unboiled cashew and batter-fried chicken on top of the dish as you serve it. In this case, you may wish to pour the sauce over the top. Such a dish would need to be served quickly, before the breading gets soggy. For details, see the [[Cookbook:Leong's Cashew Chicken|Leong's Cashew Chicken]] recipe.

The cashews may also be stir-fried alone, with or without boiling.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computers for Beginners''' is a book for people with little or no prior computer knowledge. 
It will teach basics moving slowly toward more advanced topics. The primary learning technique will be tutorial examples since they facilitate learning more effectively. There will be adequate theory prior to and explaining the examples so the user learns what the computer is doing instead of just memorizing keystrokes and mouse clicks.

The '''smoke point''' of an [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or fat is the temperature at which it gives off smoke. When oil is smoking, it gives off bad fumes and is prone to bursting into flame. Flames from a pot of burning oil will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. The smoke point of an oil should be high when the oil is used for [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep-fat frying]] or when it will be exposed alone on surfaces such as cookie sheets. The numbers here are common values; oils will vary. 

Olive oil is particularly variable; higher quality cold-pressed grades have lower smoke points than cheaper solvent-extracted and refined grades. It is better not to use high-quality olive oil for deep frying&amp;mdash;save it for your salads.

Whenever i go in to see a new or wikibook in progress people like to show the table of contents. Maybe it's just me but don't people usually talk about the class before they pull out the syllabus. Usually people talk about the what people are going to learn in the class before they bust out the syllabus. After they talk about the class they explain the syllabus. These are just a few of the problems I have noticed with wikibooks.

Another thing I would like to say is that I would like to see more visuals inside of the texts. Having media and visual presentation can help many people so they can grasp better understanding of how things work. You can say that cells are an internal circuit having convential flow while external circuits have electron flow, but none of that is going to make sense without a good visual for the person. 

When I look at the contents of a wikibook I don't know what to click on half of the time so I just click anywhere and everywhere. This is not a good thing for people trying to learn. It's like giving a person a textbook with all the chapters in a random order and telling them to learn about OHMs law before they know what an electron is. I wouldn't say it's the best thing to do. I really would like to see more wikibooks with an introduction to what the whole subject is about and the contents included. Sadly I didn't see this much in the Physics book and I really would like to learn more physics.- [[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]]</text>

== To those who wish to edit my stuff ==

Don't edit and delete a lot of things I worked hard to make. If you have added something or fixed it up nicely, hey I'm impressed. I like to keep a type of learning process going that isn't super scientific. But I want it easily understood for common people with a common English vocabulary. Keep Wikipedia in layman terms, people.

If I seriously leave a project behind to die, and I mean it's seriously scattered, take it off the mainpage. Like the A+ project. Please take it off. I haven't done anything with it. I tried deleting it. Someone put it back. I had a different account called Nezumi. Can't find the password. People want the project to stay, however.

= What are Cyberman's Current Projects? =

== Wikipedia ==

I tend to my studies more than writing up Wikipedia articles. It seems this place gets enough business, so oldbies like me aren't needed. But I will enforce the old school layman's terms ideology. These days I skim through an article for knowledge. If I find a grammar, spelling, or punctuation error, then I'll correct it.

== Wikibooks ==

* Introduction to Psychology.
#[[Cyberman_Psychology|Resources for Introduction to Psychology]] [[image:5percent-bar.png]]

* College Survival Guide

I'd like to finish a book, but I never could. The one I did decently was the the '''College Survival Guide'''. I created it because I had obtained a &quot;B&quot; in college. Everything else I have is an A. If I were more preared, had I read that Wikibook ahead of time, I wouldn't have obtained that B grade.

== BOTM, April 2005 ==

Hey... I've checked the history for [[How To Build A Computer]], and saw that you made some edits to it.  It's been nomintated for Book Of The Month, and it would be good if you could cast a vote for it.  You can do so [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/April 2005 voting|Here]].  --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:47, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)


== How can i contribute? ==

Hey i have been looking at ur 90 days to calculus II, and was wondering what you would like done, because i have plenty of time (currently writing A level Maths book) but if u want me to contribute /fill in a page or ten..Just contact me --[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 07:41, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== Electronics Wikibook ==

I saw your comment on the [[Electronics]] Wikibook, and I understand your sentiment that the current incarnation of the book is far to expansive and &quot;too physics intense&quot;. My proposed solution (although i have moved it beyond the stage of a meer proposal) is to expand the [[Engineering bookshelf#Electrical Engineering|Electrical Engineering bookshelf]]. In the EE bookshelf, we have broken alot of the topics down into smaller, more focused wikibooks that are geared towards an engineer, and not towards a general physicist. This way, we can get directly to the heart of the matter, and not be bogged down the with mathematical physics details. If you want to help out with this project, it would be very appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 20:24, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[How to Cause Havoc]] ==

I wanted to let you know that the book [[How to Cause Havoc]] has been nominated for deletion at [[WB:VFD]]. Further more, I am going through to temporarily delete any images or text which are deemed to be offensive enough to consitute vandalism. For starters, I have deleted the page [[Causing Havoc/Preface]], because it contained an image of a middle finger, and a statement that essentially said &quot;screw you&quot; to other wikibooks contributers. This kind of material is clearly unacceptable in wikibooks, and this comment constitutes a final warning that additional contributions of that kind (even in the context of a book) could easily be considered vandalism, and you will be labled as a vandal. I don't mean to come off as attacking you, but i want to warn you that these kinds of things can get a user in trouble. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:37, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Introduction to Psychology ==

I'm very interested in contributing to your [[Introduction_to_Psychology]] wikibook, but I'm wondering what thoughts or concerns you have in relations to the [[Psychology]] wikibook. From the table of contents it would seem both have difference scopes. Do you plan on keeping them seperate? [[User:Tom Foolery|Tom Foolery]] 21:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

== Some suggestions if you want to be helpful ==

I've been looking over some of the things that you have done for your new Wikibook [[College Survival Guide]].  Don't worry, I'm not trying to delete this content or anything like that.

Some things that would really help out administrators if you are trying to reorganize the content:

# Don't just copy and paste whole pages from one place on Wikibooks to another.  As a registered user you have the &quot;Move&quot; tab at the top of the page next to &quot;edit this page&quot; and &quot;discussion&quot;.  This allows you to rename pages instead of having to do the copy and paste.  More important, it keeps the full edit history in tact for legal purposes, to let everybody know who added what and when.  By doing a copy and paste to somewhere else, this edit history is lost.  BTW, there is a procedure to merge two forked pages back into one, but it is a pain in the rear to do and can only be done by an administrator.  It would be better to avoid going through that hassle if possible.
# Please don't just blank pages.  While that is eventually caught and reviewed, it is difficult to try and determine exactly ''why'' the page was deleted.  There is a page markup tag that uses the syntax '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|&lt;state your reason here&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' that lets administrators know that the content needs to be removed.  This give the opportunity to get a second opinion on why it needs to go (I use that template even) and means the content is usually deleted much earlier than through blanking.  Page blanking is also a common vandalism tactic, so it generally takes much more time to go through examining page blankings as opposed to reviewing deletion requests that state a reasonable justification for its removal.


None of this is actually required of users, but it is a way to be polite and be able to keep friendly relations with the people who are working to police the content.  BTW, thank you for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you continue to help us through your continued involvement here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:10, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

== Blank pages ==

Generally, there shouldn't be any blank pages. If you don't need a page, please mark it for deletion with {{tl|delete}}. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:34, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;^&gt;---o  
* (--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 19:35, 6 April 2006 (UTC))

== [[Cyberman Psychology]] ==
Don't forget about this! I suggest that you move your notes and updates thus far to [[Introduction to Psychology]] and its talk pages and mark [[Cyberman Psychology]] for deletion with {{tl|delete}}. If you would rather work on it separately from [[Introduction to Psychology]], move its pages to &quot;[[User:Cyberman/Psychology]]&quot; to signify that it's not a separate book. Best regards, --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 06:17, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Talk:A+_Certification#Multi-Page_Format]] ==

I submitted an idea to break the [[A+ Certification]] book up from a single monolithic page into a multi-page book format. Since you are a major contributor over there, I would definately appreciate your input on this matter. If the general concensus is to go ahead with this new structure (or a variant thereof) I will gladly put in the time to make the changes myself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:18, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cyberman. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cyberman~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Camembert''' is a soft cows' milk cheese originally made in Normandy, France. It is made in small round shapes, with the soft cheese surrounded by a firmer, edible, rind. It can be made with pasteurised or unpasteurised milk, and is at its best when runny.

[[Image:Brie 01.jpg|right|thumb|Brie de Meaux]]
'''Brie''' is a soft cow's milk cheese named after Brie, the French province in which it originated (roughly corresponding to the modern département of Seine-et-Marne). It is pale in color with a slight grayish tinge under crusty white mold; it is very soft, buttery, creamy, and savory with a hint of ammonia (the white moldy rind is flavorless).

There are now many varieties of Brie made all over the world, including plain Brie, herbed varieties, and versions of Brie made with other types of milk. Brie is perhaps the most well-known French cheese, and is popular throughout the world. Despite the variety of Bries, the French government officially certifies only two types of Brie to be sold under that name: Brie de Meaux (right) and Brie de Melun.

== Notes &amp; Tips ==

* The rind is edible (and is usually eaten).
* Brie should be eaten at room temperature (or higher, if the dish requires it).
* The interior should be soft, with a satin like sheen. It should have a slight yellow-brown color; white Brie is under-ripe.
* A whole, uncut round can be frozen for up to six months.
* Brie plays very nicely with [[Cookbook:Gruyère Cheese|Gruyère]] on a cheese platter and combined with a little butter, hot sauce, and mustard you have yourself a very nice cheese spread.

'''Lomo Saltado''' is a dish of marinated steak, vegetables and fried potatoes, usually served over white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. It is one of the most popular recipes in Peru and is often found on the menu at many smaller restaurants at a very reasonable price.

==Ingredients==
* 3[[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (900[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] tenderloin or other tender steak
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] red [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]], e.g., Burgundy
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of crushed [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] cut in strips
* 4 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], seeds removed, [[Cookbook:Purée|puréed]] in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] peeled and cut into strips for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Aji amarillo|yellow Peruvian Chili Pepper]] (aji) cut into thin strips
* 1 Tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 2 Tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for frying
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Culantro|culantro]] (or substitute with [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]])

==Procedure==
# Cut the meat into thin strips and [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] them in the wine for 1 hour.
# Use a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] to cook garlic in oil over medium heat and add the meat. Reserve the juice.
# Add the tomato purée, salt and pepper. Cook a few minutes.
# Add the soy sauce while stirring the meat in the wok.
# Add the onions, aji strips, cilantro and vinegar. Combine the juice from the meat.
# Fry the potatoes in a separate pan and add to the other ingredients.
# Serve the dish with white rice.


The real recipe does not include tomato purée, tomato should be fresh and cut in wedges. The meat does not have to be marinated. 
If you do not have aji strips, do not use a substitute.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Variations to the recipe might use the tomatoes cut in slices instead of as a purée or not using the wine but a greater quantity of vinegar. 
* Using a different kind of hot pepper changes the flavor of this dish completely.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Cuisine of Peru]]

''Arros tapado'' (Spanish for molded rice) is very popular in Peru and is a favorite among children because the recipe calls for molding rice and minced beef into a shape.

The minced beef preparation is very similar to ''[[cookbook:picadillo|picadillo]]'' (Spanish for minced meat) which is popular throughout Latin America and the Philippines. In most other countries ''picadillo'' is served with white rice on the side.

==Ingredients==
* 3 cloves of [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], minced
* 2 tablespoons of [[cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
* [[cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* [[cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 4 cups (1 litre) water
* 1 pound (450 g) washed [[cookbook:rice|rice]]
* 1 [[cookbook:onion|onion]], finely chopped
* 2 pounds (900 g) of [[Cookbook:Ground Beef|ground beef]]
* 2 [[cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]], finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 4 tablespoons of [[cookbook:raisin|raisins]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]], chopped
* 3 [[cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]; two chopped, one whole
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]], finely minced
''Note: Use only the egg whites from the hard boiled egg and mince a low-fat cut of beef to reduce the fat at cholesterol in this dish.''

==Preparation==
# [[cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] the garlic in oil, add a few drops of lemon juice, salt and the water and bring to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]]. 
#Add rice and cook until tender. This should take 20 to 25 minutes. 
# In another pan, stir in onions and sauté. 
# Add meat, tomatoes, tomato paste, raisins, olives, egg and parsley.
# Take an eight-ounce measuring cup and coat the inside with a little oil. Fill halfway with rice, add some meat filling and add more rice to top of cup. Invert onto a plate and carefully remove cup.
#Cut the remaining hard-boiled egg in half and serve the two halves along side the ''arroz tapado'' on the same plate.

{{recipesummary|Appetizer recipes|6-8|3 hours|2|Image=[[Image:Ceviche.png|300px]]}}

==Ingredients==
* 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of [[cookbook:Fish|white fish]] (mahi mahi is an excellent choice)
* juice from about 8 large [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
* 3 [[cookbook:Chili Pepper|red peppers]], diced
* 3 finely diced [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño peppers]]s (to your preference)
* [[cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 3 large [[cookbook:onion|onion]], sliced into half-rings
* bunch of finely chopped [[cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]]

;Sides:
* 3 [[cookbook:lettuce|lettuce]] leaves per plate
* 16 to 24 [[cookbook:Corn|corn]] cobs cut into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces, cooked as usual
* 5 or 6 [[cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]]es, boiled and peeled

==Procedure==
# Wash and de-bone the fish and cut them into ½ inch x ½ inch (about 1 cm x 1 cm) chunks.
# Season the fish with salt, pepper, red pepper and jalapeño. [[cookbook:Marinating|Marinate]] the fish for 1 hour to ”cold cook”. You should have enough lime juice to completely cover the fish.
# Add onion. Mix gently. Marinate for 1 more hour.
# Serve on a bed of lettuce and add two pieces of corn on the cob and a portion of sweet potato.

==Notes==
* Ceviche (an alternate spelling) can be eaten as an entrée as well. In this case, this will be enough for about two people.
* More traditional recipes call for much less marinating. In fact, some will marinate it for as little as 10 minutes total (basically just the time it takes to get the sides ready). If marinating for a small amount of time be aware that the acidity of the lime is the only thing that &quot;cooks&quot; the fish.

==Ingredients==
* 10 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (new or red a good choice)
* 1 pound of [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (Romano, Mexican or feta work well) 
* 4 aji amarillo, seeded and deveined (Peruvian yellow chili peppers)

* 3 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]]

==Preparation==
# Peel and boil potatoes as you normally would. Drain water, and allow them to cool.
# In a blender, mix the cheese, peppers, milk, oil, garlic, crackers, mustard, salt and pepper. The sauce should be fairly thick; add more crackers if not, or add milk if too thick
# Lay a bed of lettuce in a serving dish and place the potatoes on top. Cover with the sauce. Cut the hard boiled eggs in half and place on top of the potatoes. Add black olives if desired
# This dish can be served slightly cold
# Some recipes suggest the use of Huacatay, but this is a confusion. Huacatay is a key ingredient of Ocopa, another Peruvian sauce

      <text xml:space="preserve">= What is a computer? =

Simply put, a computer is a machine that performs mathematical and logical calculations. 

== Brief History ==
[[Image:Analog_Computing_Machine_GPN-2000-000354.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A large computer used in the 1940's.]]

Computers, by our above definition, have been around for thousands of years. One of the earliest computers was the abacus, a series of beads arranged on metal rods. Beads could be slid back and forth to operate on numbers. This was a very rudimentary device and is not commonly thought of as a computer in modern times. Our idea of computers involves electricity and electronics.

Electricity makes computers much more efficient. The first computers used an incredible amount of electricity, which changed voltages in vacuum tubes to operate the computer. These computers were given instructions using punch cards, and were behemoths, taking up entire floors of buildings. Only the more privileged universities and government facilities had access to them.

In the 1960's, the vacuum tube was replaced by the integrated circuit and  transistor. These greatly reduced the size and power consumption of computers. They were still very large by today's standards, but more institutions had access to computing power than ever before. At the end of the decade, the microchip was invented, which reduced the size of the computer even more.

By the end of the 1970's, computers were widespread in businesses. Using a computer involved typing on a terminal (a keyboard and monitor connected to a large central computer). Soon, parts became small enough to allow many users to have a computer at their home. Thus the Personal Computer, or PC, was born.

Since then, personal computer has have become tremendously more efficient. They are much smaller, and yet have seen extreme performance gains. In addition to these improvements, computers have become affordable enough for many families worldwide.

= Hardware =
Hardware is the stuff you can touch, as opposed to software which is abstract and exists only in a virtual world as computer code. Hardware is made of materials found in the universe and are subject to the laws of physics. Contrary to the latter, software is bound only by the creator's imagination and the user's willingness to believe what the creator wants them to.
== The Insides ==
Inside the computer case are various components that allow the computer to run.
===SSD===
The SSD, or otherwise known as a Solid State Drive, is a storage device using RAM modules instead of a spinning disk. These storage devices are much faster than HDDs because they don't have to spin up. The SSD can have transfer speeds up to 10x as fast because of this.
=== CPU ===
[[File:Sockel7-cpus.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Several CPU microchips.]]
The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, does nearly all the calculating. It is the main microchip in the computer that distributes tasks to all other parts of the computer.  When most people talk about the processor, or chip, it is actually the CPU they are referring to.

=== Memory ===
RAM (Random Access Memory), commonly called just '''memory''', holds computer code that needs to be operated on quickly. RAM is plugged into special slots on the motherboard. There is a large link (known as a bus) from the memory to the CPU, allowing information held in memory to quickly interact with the CPU. The amount of RAM available is limited and therefore needs to be constantly cleared and refilled (don't worry; all computers do this automatically). RAM is just one part of the computer that determines your speed. 

RAM is referred to as &quot;volatile&quot; memory because the information stored in it disappears when the power is turned off. Hard drives and flash drives, on the other hand, contain non-volatile memory, which is like paper: it can be destroyed or erased, but when properly taken care of, can last forever.

=== Hard Drive ===
[[Image:Harddisk-full.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A partially dismantled hard drive, showing the disc inside.]]
The hard drive is the main storage area in the computer. It is usually where you put your data to be stored permanently (until you choose to erase it), and it retains data after power is removed.

Virtually all of your data is stored on your hard drive. A hard drive is composed of disk(s), where the data is recorded onto the surface, similar to records, CDs, and DVDs. The size of the hard drive (today's are usually in gigabytes) is determined by how dense (small) the recording is.  Many of today's major programs (such as games and media creating and editing programs like Photoshop) and files (such as pictures, music, or video) use a considerable amount of space. Most low-end computers, as of 2011, are shipped with a 160GB (gigabyte) or larger hard drive. Currently, in 2014, it is common to find desktop computers with 1000GB (1 Terabyte) hard drive. As an example, an average .mp3 file takes between 7.5 and 15MB (megabytes) of space. A megabyte is 1/1024th of a gigabyte, thus allowing most new computers to store thousands of such files.

Users who wish to store a lot of media on a computer will want a larger hard drive, as will users who want to store numerous large programs, like modern games, which require a lot of space. Most video games today are distributed via DVD discs that store data, called DVD-ROM (read only memory, which can be read off the disk, but not modified), which can be anywhere from 4.7GB for a single layer disk to 8.5GB for a double layered disk...and many large programs are already taking up more than one disk.

Another concern for users who want higher performance is hard drive speed, measured in RPM (rotations per minute). Most desktop hard drives today are 7200RPM models, with lower end 4200RPM models not commonly seen in new systems (other than laptops), and higher end 10,000RPM hard drives generally seen only in gaming and other extremely high performance computers due to their cost. For example, a 1TB 7200RPM drive costs around 85$ (as of January, 2011), while a 300GB 10,000RPM drive costs almost 300$ (as of February 2011).

Hard drives are constantly increasing in size, both because technology allows, and because of demand for more storage space. For example, an Apple iMac in the late nineties shipped with a 4GB hard drive, and sold for 1,300$ US (although it should be noted that the cost alone is not indicative of the hard drive, or vice versa), compared to a modern iMac which sells for 1000$ US and carries a 160GB hard drive(As of April 2007). Compare to the original IBM PC, which carried only a 10MB hard drive, or 10/1024th of a GB.

Some high end computers already have more than 2 Terabytes, and within decades Petabytes (thousands of Terabytes) and even exobytes (Thousands of Petabytes) will not be unheard of.

== The Peripherals ==
Peripherals are hardware attached to a computer, but external to the main case that houses the CPU, Hard drives, and other such equipment.  They are basically devices that allow people to communicate to the computer. It is generally a good idea, although not as important as it used to be, to add and remove hardware from the computer while it is turned off. Things such as USB storage devices and keyboards/mice can generally be inserted and removed at a whim with no consequence, however more advanced things such as printers should be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions, which may include shutting down your computer.

=== Keyboard and Mouse ===
The keyboard and mouse are basic input devices.

====Keyboard====
[[Image:Cherry-keyboard-big-Enter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A keyboard with a QWERTY layout.]]
The keyboard has keys that, when pressed, send information to the computer. The keyboard is the most widely used device for interacting with a computer, and even many modern operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows XP can be operated with nothing but the keyboard or little but the keyboard. The most commonly used keyboard, by far, is the QWERTY layout, which almost all keyboards sold use. This is the same layout as most typewriters sold within the last century. The second most common, but a very distant follower, is the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard. While this is technically better, the industry and consumer market as a whole has mostly rejected it. 

The QWERTY keyboard was designed to prevent typewriters from jamming while keys were being pushed at a fast rate, by keeping keys as far apart as possible. The Dvorak keyboard layout was designed for computers, where this is obviously not a problem, and thus places the most commonly used keys where they are easy to reach, and because of that, quicker. However, because of the popularity QWERTY had, the Dvorak keyboard layout never became popular, for two main reasons. The first being that because most people already know how to use QWERTY keyboards, and people are thus unlikely to switch, and the second being that because most people know how to use a QWERTY keyboard, there is very little use of Dvorak. 

It is generally advised that you use a QWERTY keyboard, as even though Dvorak users gain significantly faster typing speeds, the rarity of the layout makes it hard for people who use Dvorak to use most other computers.

Keyboards vary in appearance. Those attached to a desktop computer are frequently large with an additional number pad built in on the right side, while laptop keyboards are attached to the computer and are often much smaller. Some keyboards also offer special buttons to control the mouse on the screen or to play music.

====Mouse====
[[Image:Wheel_mouse.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A three button mouse.]]

The mouse is an input device which is primarily used by physically moving the device across a surface, which causes a pointer symbol, called a &quot;cursor&quot;, to move across the screen, and secondarily by pressing a button while the cursor is over an object on the monitor, or &quot;clicking&quot;. All mice have at least one button, with the most common layout having three. 

*One button mice: The Apple mighty mouse is the only mouse known to most people which uses a single button. This button is usually activated by pushing on the front of the mouse, or pushing the entire mouse down. This has the benefit of being a simpler interface, and arguably more attractive, but suffers from this of being slightly more of a hassle to use, with tradition &quot;right click&quot; needs being changed to pressing a &quot;control&quot; or &quot;ctrl&quot; key on the keyboard while pressing the main button. These are only used with Macintosh OS, such as Mac OS X.

*Two button mice: The second most common layout, more common in older computers, which has a button on the left and right, usually for the index and middle finger. While less useful than a three button mouse, they are, when teamed with a standard keyboard, capable of performing almost all computer tasks. 

*Three button mice: The most common layout, Fundamentally the same as a two button mice, but with a third button added between the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; click buttons. While the mouse technically has three buttons, this may be confusing to some users, as the &quot;middle&quot;/&quot;center&quot; click button is also a scroll wheel. This design allows the user to scroll through documents, make selections, and do other tasks by moving a finger, rather than pressing an arrow key or &quot;Page up/Page down&quot; key on a keyboard. The center button can also be press inwards to create a &quot;middle click&quot; button, which although not common, is used in some programs to perform a simple function, such as the Firefox web browser, which uses the middle click to open a link in a new tab.

*Four (or more) button mice: Usually seen only on gaming and multimedia specialization mice, extra buttons generally do not serve any native purpose, and rather are assigned a function to perform by the user. For example, a user who uses the mouse to play games might assign the additional buttons to switch between weapons in a shooter, or cast spells in a fantasy game.

There are two other major differences in mice, which is Optical/Laser mice, and Ball mice. This is how the mice tells where it is, with the laser measuring the distance it crosses when it is moved, and the ball measuring how it rotates. The laser is generally more accurate and less of a hassle to use, and can be used on more surfaces, but the ball mouse is cheaper. Ball mice are rarely seen today. 

The last important consideration when buying a mouse is size. You should always try to put your hand on a mouse and move it around, to see how well it feels in your hand. If it feels awkward, small, big, long, or short, look for something better! Not only will your hands thank you, but you will be more efficient.

=== Media Devices (Floppy, CD-ROM, DVD, USB) ===
These devices carry data, in the same way that a hard drive does, but are much more portable. They are the primary method of storing data outside of a computer, and the main method of transferring information between computers without the use of a network, such as the internet.

There are three main types of these in use today:
*CD-ROM: Capable of storing 700MB of data, CDs have been the most common method of storing data for most of the last decade or so. They are being largely replaced by DVDs and USB drives (see below).
*DVD: Capable of storing 4.7GB of data in their single layer form and 8.5GB in their double layer form, they are the most common method today for most store-bought programs, as well as videos.
*USB/Flash: While not usually used by commercial software, USB 'sticks' and Flash 'cards' have become popular ways of storing data because of their ease of use and low cost. While sizes range from 2GB on old units to 256GB on larger, more expensive modern units, the average stick today is 4 or 8GB, with an average 4GB USB stick costing about 15$ US.

The floppy disk has been phased out.

=== Monitor ===
The monitor is the main method for the computer to produce output, in the same way a book has pages. A book filled with letters, but in a way you can't possible understand or even see is of no use to you, and the same is true for a computer. While older monitors, CRTs, were rather bulky like TVs, newer monitors, or LCDs, are much more compact, and can be easily lifted.

For much of the history of computers, the most common monitors were CRTs, short for Cathode Ray Tubes.  They work on the same principle as a television. They were generally heavy, had a lower image quality, and were in general less reliable than an LCD. They come in two forms, the normal version, which has a curved monitor, and &quot;Flat Screen&quot;, where the display is completely level (although it still has the bulky back end). It is suggested that if you plan to remove a CRT, it is better for the environment to safely dispose of it (not just into a bin, an electronic waste bin), as CRT's contain high levels of toxic chemicals.
The most common type of monitor today is an LCD, or Liquid Crystal Display, which is much lighter, although slightly more expensive. They have a smaller form, a higher image quality, and are overall better than CRT monitors. 

''Tip: To take proper care of your monitor, always be sure that the screen is not left on a static image for long periods of time. This can &quot;burn&quot; the image into the monitor, meaning that it will have a ghosting effect, even when that image is not displayed. This can not only be highly annoying, but in some cases, make it so the monitor needs to be replaced. To avoid this, either set a moving screensaver, which will trigger after a set amount of time, or simply turn the monitor off''

=== Printer ===
If you have a printer attached to your computer you can print your information and keep a physical copy of data.  Depending on what type of printer you have, you can print in color, double-sided or book form.  The output quality of some printers goes from draft (to save ink) all the way to photo quality.

Printers come in all price ranges and in many types.  The most common for home use are ink jets (bubble jets) and laser.  There are specialized printers for data plotting (mapping), photos only, labels and more.  

A lot of printers are &quot;all-in-ones&quot; which simply means they combine more than one function.  They can be any combination of printer, copier, fax and scanner.  If you are looking to buy an all-in-one make sure it has all the features ''you'' are looking for.  You don't want to get it home and find out you still need a separate fax machine or scanner that you thought was included!

=Software=
==What is Software?==
Computer software, or simply software, also known as computer programs, is the non-tangible component of computers. Computer software contrasts with computer hardware, which is the physical component of computers. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used without the other.

Computer software includes all computer programs regardless of their architecture; for example, executable files, libraries and scripts are computer software. Yet, it shares their mutual properties: software consists of clearly-defined instructions that upon execution, instructs hardware to perform the tasks for which it is designed. Software is stored in computer memory and cannot be touched, just as a 3D model shown in an illustration cannot be touched.[1]

At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor – typically a central processing unit (CPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location inside the computer – an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also (indirectly) cause something to appear on a display of the computer system – a state change which should be visible to the user. The processor carries out the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to &quot;jump&quot; to a different instruction, or interrupted.

Software is usually written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to natural language) than machine language.[2] High-level languages are compiled or interpreted into machine language object code. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, essentially, a vaguely mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet. Assembly language is converted into object code via an assembler.

TYPES OF SOFTWARE

    Application software uses the computer system to perform useful work or provide entertainment functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself.
    System software is designed to operate the computer hardware, to provide basic functionality, and to provide a platform for running application software.[3] System software includes:
        Operating system, an essential collection of computer programs that manages resources and provides common services for other software. Supervisory programs, boot loaders, shells and window systems are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has an operating system.
        Device driver, a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; thus a computer needs more than one device driver.
        Utilities, software designed to assist users in maintenance and care of their computers.
    Malicious software or malware, computer software developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes.

Nature, or domain of execution

    Desktop applications such as web browsers and Microsoft Office, as well as smartphone and tablet applications (called &quot;apps&quot;).
    Server software
    Scripts, such as JavaScript scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded, without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is ActionScript scripts, which are supported by the Adobe Flash plugin.
    Web applications usually run on the web server and output dynamically-generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. PHP, Java or ASP.NET, or even JavaScript that runs on the server; in modern times they commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.
    Plugins and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;
    Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as cars and televisions (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can themselves be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).[4] In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run embedded operating systems, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always ran).
    Microcode is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor itself how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code.[5] It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.

Programming tools
Main article: Programming tool

Programming tools are software in the form of programs or applications that software developers (also known as programmers, coders, hackers or software engineers) use to create, debug, maintain (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise support software. Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as compilers, debuggers, interpreters, linkers, and text editors, that can be combined together to accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object, or they may be an integrated development environment (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. An IDE may do this either by invoking the relevant individual tools on behalf of the programmer, or by reimplementing their functionality in a new way. Almost all programming language implementations (a notable exception being Smalltalk) provide the option of using individual tools rather than an IDE, because some programmers prefer not to use IDEs for various reasons, and IDEs usually take longer to be developed to an &quot;acceptable&quot; standard than individual tools - indeed, initially, new programming languages (which are created every year) would not typically have IDEs available for them.

= Setup and Boot =
The first thing to do after taking your computer out of the box is to set it up. While many stores offer at home installation, this is generally unneeded for anyone able to operate a computer, as a computer can be hooked up with about the same effort as a television and components.

The basic parts are:
*The Case: Also known as the 'tower', or incorrectly as the 'CPU', the case is what stores all of the brains of the computer- the graphics card, processor, hard drives, etc. This is the most important and expensive part of your setup, and technically the 'computer' itself.
*The monitor
*The keyboard/mouse
You may want Speakers, microphones and webcams to be able to hear sound, input sound or input film clips.

Simply place the case wherever you wish to have it, plug the monitor's cable into the appropriate slot on the back of the computer (should have a monitor picture on the slot), place the monitor where you wish to have it, plug the monitor's cable into the monitor (the ends are usually a white (DVI-D) or blue (VGA, being phased out), plug the keyboard and mouse into the appropriate slots on your computer (USB), and lastly plug the power cable into the power supply on the back of the computer, and into a standard wall outlet. You should consider using a surge protector to protect the delicate electronics inside a computer from any power surge, or loss. You may also consider using a power backup, which will allow you time to shut your computer down safely during a blackout, or even continue to use it until the power is restored, in some cases.

You may have a laptop/notebook computer, which all of the components are integrated into a single compact source that you can carry in a briefcase/backpack. In that case you need only plug in your battery and power cord. Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the computer for putting the battery in the laptop/notebook and plugging in the power cord.

Some additional models differ from the above two designs. For example, the iMac series of Apple computers have the internals and monitor housed in one case, with only the keyboard and mouse separate. Please refer to your instruction manual for setup instructions (Apple usually has very clear instructions). '''Note:''' Many of the instructions in this Wikibook require a Windows computer.

After everything is assembled, proceed to turn on your computer and your peripherals. It is important to turn the monitor and speakers on first so that you can hear and see any error sounds or messages. You should also pay attention to your computer, and be ready to turn the power off immediately if there are any problems, such as the fans not starting. Though you should be careful, as computer fans can be extremely quiet, if the fans do not start, immediately turn the computer off to prevent the CPU and other delicate components from overheating.

= Operating Systems =
The major software application on a computer is called the operating system. The operating system is like the driver of a car. While it might seem like it's only telling the car (computer) what to do, it is in fact also interfacing with the different parts of it, as well as taking any new input (say, a map, or instructions on where to go- which equates to other software) and performing these tasks to the best of its ability. Although many things are compatible across platforms, more involved programs, such as photo editing tools and games, will not work across all platforms, in the same way that if you started giving your cab driver directions in French, he'd probably tell you to get out, unless you were of course, in France!

An operating system, aka &quot;OS&quot;, is the middleman between you and the computer. It creates an environment where the user can interact with the computer in an efficient manner.

There are three major OS that you should consider using for your first desktop/notebook PC.

* Windows: The most recent edition of Windows is Windows 8, previous versions are Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, and so on. 
* Mac: The second most common OS in desktop systems, Mac OS X is comparatively compared to Windows, although it's market share is increasing. Macs have been designed to be very easy for people to use, and are thus a good choice for a first system, as long as you don't mind not having as many software and games options as Windows users. Many Mac users are extremely loyal to the OS, due to the popularity of the iPod MP3 device, and various other Apple iDevices.
* Linux: While it is also rare compared to Windows, Linux does have it's advantages. Linux is open source, which means that anyone can change the code around and redistribute it as they want, resulting in many different versions. Though it can be daunting, a Google search can help the average person decide which version of the OS would be best for them. There is a wide range of versions, called distros, ranging from one that's meant to fit on a 50MB business card sized CD to ones that are meant to be easier to use than Windows! Linux can be harder to use than Windows at times, especially because it is almost required that you use the command line occasionally, however users who are willing to put in the effort to search for a solution (usually quick and easy) and copy/paste the answer into the command line will generally appreciate it, with some being as devoted or more so than the aforementioned Mac users! Linux suffers many of the same downfalls as Mac, however, including a lack of commercial software, especially games. This is slightly remedied by the large amount of free, open source Linux games, and the WINE program, which can run many Windows programs, including games, under Linux, without having to emulate the Windows OS. While many 'hardcore' gamers are disappointed by the lack of games, even compared to the Mac, there are many games which are either native to Linux, or work well enough under WINE that most casual gamers will not have a problem. The most popular Linux distro, Ubuntu, has a clean interface and a thorough help system.

= Basic Operating Tasks =
=== Moving the Mouse ===
The mouse controls the movement of an on-screen pointer, called the cursor, that often appears as a small white arrow. When you move the mouse, the pointer on-screen moves too, usually in the same direction as the mouse. In other words, move the mouse toward you to move the on-screen pointer toward the bottom of the screen, you move the mouse to the away from you and the arrow moves to the top, and so on. You indicate to the computer what parts of the screen you want to interact with by placing the pointer over those areas on the screen.

=== Keyboard  ===
The keyboard is used for inputing text into the computer. It is designed so that users can type all the letters of the alphabet without moving their hands. Many programs from word processors, media players utilize the keyboard.

* The numbers at the right of the keyboard can work in two ways. While in normal mode, the keys will function as another set of arrow keys, in num lock mode, they will instead be an alternate way of inputting numbers. This is mainly useful when putting in more than a few digits at a time, when using the numbers over the letters becomes more of a hassle than a time saving method.

* The keys labeled F1, F2, F3 ... at the top of the keyboard are the &quot;function keys&quot;. F1 is usually assigned as a &quot;help&quot; key, which will open a help dialog when pressed. If you are having trouble with a program, or just want tips, reading these files can often be useful or insightful.

* &quot;Ctrl&quot; and &quot;Alt&quot; at the bottom means &quot;control&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot;. These keys are normally used to type special symbols or for '''shortcuts'''. More on that below.

== GUI (Gooey) ==
Almost all programs that you will be working with will have a '''GUI''' or '''Graphical User Interface'''. The GUI is the 'pretty' part of a computer ― the windows, buttons, scroll bars, and task trays. The GUI is really just a front for the command line, which is what does the actual process and such. While almost all Windows and Mac users do not need to worry about this, it is important for users of Linux to know, as they will use the command line for tasks which either cannot be done or are more efficient to do through the command line terminal.

=Windows XP=
==Booting for the first time==
Turn on the computer as described above.

The boring process of booting up will begin. Booting is just starting up the computer.  (Remember to turn on peripherals first!).  This may take a few minutes, so be patient. Your computer is testing itself and running a bunch of internal functions that you'll probably never have to worry about.  You don't care what's happening inside when you turn on your TV.  You just want it on.  It's the same with the computer.  Just let it do its thing!

If it is the first time booting up the computer running XP operating system, a prompt asking you to choose a user name and password will appear; you may enter up to five different users.  Note:  if you want the computer to just boot up straight into Windows XP every time you use it, you should create only one user and not enter a password.  In Windows XP Home edition, different users have the same programs installed, but may choose different backgrounds for their desktop (more on this later), and have different program icons on it as well; if you have Windows XP Professional, the differences are much fewer.  Passwords should be secure, but not as secure as if it were an online password, as you only need to prevent people accessing the actual computer itself- make sure if you choose a password you can remember and ''write it down'', as this is one password you simply ''cannot'' afford to lose.  DON'T ever tape your password to a keyboard or other part of your system.  That's the first place everyone looks!  There will be some questions that show up on the screen. Answer them the best you can and if you're not sure, use the default.  You may be asked to activate your software if the installer has not done so.  Microsoft requires you to activate XP.  If you don't activate it will quit working and you'll have to install it all over.  Activation is usually done over the internet but can also be done by phone.  The number will appear on the screen.  Register it ASAP!

== Running Windows XP ==
Now Windows XP has booted up, hopefully, and is running.  You should now be looking at a rolling green hillside with a blue sky and clouds.  This view is called the '''desktop''', which makes sense.  The rolling green hillside is called the '''background''' and can be changed to a variety of pictures installed with Windows XP, or to one you yourself load onto your computer.  You'll probably notice a couple of pictures with words like &quot;AOL Free Trial&quot; or &quot;Shortcut to...something&quot; beneath them (don't panic if these particular ones aren't present).  These are called '''icons''' and are linked to specific actions, usually opening a '''program''' (see below).  You can create your own icons, as well as delete ones you do not want.  Don't worry, this will be explained later.  The blue bar at the bottom of the screen is called the '''taskbar'''.  If you have a program open, it will be represented with a little icon and a name here.  On the far left of the taskbar is a large green button which says START; this is logically known as the '''Start menu'''.  If you left click (hereafter simply referred to as &quot;click&quot;) it with your mouse, you will open a '''menu''' which contains links to almost everything in your computer (the first time you ever start Windows XP, the Start menu will automatically be displayed).  On the far right of the taskbar, you will see a notification area known as the '''system tray'''.  It contains both temporary and constant notification icons.  Right now, it probably has only the clock and a button with a message, asking you to click it if you want to take the Windows XP tour.  If you are unfamiliar with computers, it is highly recommended that you take the tour.  If you wish to wait, you can take it later by clicking on the '''Start menu''', clicking '''All Programs''', clicking '''Accessories''', and clicking '''Tour Windows XP''' (this type of menu action will from here on be represented as '''START -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Tour Windows XP''').

===Some useful keyboard shortcuts in Windows===

The following keyboard shortcuts are used for frequently performed tasks and will speed up your computing. 
They normally work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
('''NOTE:''' When you are asked to press multiple buttons at once, you can first press the buttons Ctrl, Alt and Shift, and while keeping them pressed, press the remaining button. For example, to press Alt+Tab you first press and hold down Alt, then momentarily press tab, and then let go of the Alt key.)

* When filling out a form or a dialogue, enter the text, the press &quot;tab&quot; to get to the next text box or button. To go backwards, press Shift-Tab. Press &quot;enter&quot; to press a button. This will save you from taking your hands off the keyboard to use the mouse.

* To copy a selected text, or a selected file or folder, press &quot;Ctrl+C&quot;
 
* To paste the text or file into a new location, press &quot;Ctrl+V&quot;

* To select all the text (or items) press &quot;Ctrl+A&quot;

* To switch between open windows press &quot;Alt-Tab&quot;

* To log off from you session or to shut down the computer press &quot;Ctrl-Alt-Delete&quot;

* To select a piece of text or a list of files or folders, click the left mouse button on the starting position, then press and hold &quot;Shift&quot;, then click on the end position, then release &quot;Shift&quot;

*To select text, files, or folders that are not contiguous (side-by-side or together), select the first item by clicking; next press and hold the &quot;Ctrl&quot; (control), click the next item, release the &quot;Ctrl&quot;, repeat if necessary.

==Launching and Working with Programs and Windows==
====Background Information====
A program does something. Programs can process words, play music, and much much more. One simple program is called Notepad, and it is on many computers. Microsoft Word is a program, AbiWord is a program, and Mozilla Firefox is a program. They will be explained later.

====Opening a Window====
Now it is time for a tutorial.
# Left click on the Start Menu. It is in the lower left corner of the screen.
# Put the mouse over the words that say &quot;All Programs&quot; or &quot;Programs&quot; (This depends on if you have the classical start menu or not which will be discussed in '''a chapter about customization''')
# More menus will come out of the arrow. Bring the mouse up to accessories and let it expand.
# Click on Notepad.

Another way to say steps 1-3 in a simple fashion is '''Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Notepad'''.

====Modifying the Window====
After doing this, many things happen. First of all, a window appears on the screen. Notice that there are three boxes in the upper right hand corner of the window.Here is what they do:

# Click the first box going from left to right. Oh no! It's gone! Don't be startled because Notepad hasn't been lost in oblivion. It's just been minimized.
# To get it back, look at the bottom of the screen. You will see a rectangular box that says &quot;Untitled - Notepad&quot;. Almost every program will have this little box located in the task bar. When it is gone, the program's not running. Now, click on the box to see Notepad again.
# Click the middle square. Notepad now takes up most of the screen. This is called maximizing. Look at the icon that you just clicked. It has changed.
# To get it back to normal, click the same button. That is called restoring.
# Click the last square (with a big X on it) to close the window. It is gone for good and will never come back (until you do what you did in step one of Opening a Window again). This button is called the &quot;X&quot; button. If someone wanted someone else to press this, they could say &quot;X it out.&quot;

====Moving a Window====
Now it's time to learn how to move windows.

# To begin, open Notepad again with your new skills.
# The place in the border where the three buttons are located is called the titlebar.
# Click anywhere on the titlebar except the boxes and hold the mouse button down.
# While still holding the button, move the mouse pointer. This is called &quot;dragging&quot;. The window will follow the mouse and become an extension of your hand.
# When the window is in that perfect location, let go of the button.

====Working with Multiple Windows====
The great thing about computers is that they allow for multi-tasking. You can listen to your favorite tunes, write a book, get work done, chat with their friends, and check your e-mail all at the same time. This can be done with much ease if learned correctly.

Time to get busy.

# Open Notepad again.
# Open Wordpad, which is located in '''Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Wordpad'''.

There should now be two windows on the screen. The Wordpad window is the active window. We know this because its titlebar is brighter than Notepad's. Also, Wordpad's taskbar rectangle is a different color than Notepad's. When a program is active, keyboard and mouse input will go to that program.

# Type &quot;Hello.&quot; The text is in Wordpad's window because this is the active one. (If nothing shows up, then click in the part where you would type in the Wordpad program).
# To make Notepad active, click on its titlebar. If it is covered by Wordpad, move it out of the way (by dragging it). Notepad will come on top of Wordpad once it is activated.
# To make Wordpad active again, click its rectangle in the taskbar.
# Play with the two programs until you get the hang of working with multiple windows. Use the maximize and minimize buttons. Don't really click any of the buttons on the programs yet. You'll learn that soon enough...

===Task Bar===
There are a few more things you should know that you can do with the '''task bar''' to customize its appearance and behavior:

# You can '''lock''' it (preventing other alterations listed below)
#* To check if the task bar is locked, hover the mouse over some part of the task bar not occupied by an icon, then click the right mouse button.  A '''pop-up menu''' will appear, with an item &quot;Lock the Taskbar&quot; on it (among others).  It can either have a checkmark next to it on the left, or not.  If there is a check mark, the task bar is locked.  If not, then it's not locked.
#* To change the locked state of the task bar, click on the &quot;Lock the Taskbar&quot; menu item, and the state will change to its opposite - if it was locked before, clicking unlocks it; if it was not locked, clicking locks it.
# You can '''resize''' it (made larger, smaller, or even concealed, vertically)
#* To do this, the task bar must be unlocked (see immediately above)
#* Click and hold the thin border immediately above the task bar (you should see the cursor change to an up-and-down arrow), and &quot;drag&quot; it upward.  You'll see that the task bar becomes fatter, giving it more room for program and quick-launch icons.  Dragging it downward does the opposite.  If you drag it all the way to the bottom of the screen, the task bar vanishes (except for its sizing border, which you can drag upward again to bring back the task bar.)
# You can also '''move''' it to the top, right, or left edge of the screen
#* To do this, hover the mouse over some part of the task bar with no icon, then click the left mouse button and hold it down.  Then move the mouse up, to the left, or to the right, and observe that the task bar will vanish from the bottom of the screen and reappear at the left, top, or right (according to which direction you dragged it.)  When you release the mouse, the task bar will stay where you placed it.
# You can select which of its component '''tool bars''' are displayed on it
#* ''(how-to goes here)''
# You can resize (horizontally) the visible '''tool bars'''
#* ''(how-to goes here)''
# You can set other '''properties''' of the task bar, such as whether the clock appears on it, or whether the task bar '''auto-hides''' itself
#* ''(how-to goes here)''

===Menu Bar===
# Open Notepad.
#* Right under the titlebar, there will be a menu bar. There will be File, Edit, Help, and more.
# Put your mouse over the word File and click.
#* A menu will pop up under the word and some choices will appear.
# Click Open.
#* This will open up a dialog to open an existing text file. You don't have to open anything yet but you may if you want.
# Click Exit.
#* This will close the program. It's another way of pressing X.
# Open up Notepad and explore the menus.
#* Nothing will break. If you see something confusing, press cancel. Remember that a great way to learn about the computer is to do stuff on your own. Try opening up other programs from the menu and see what they do. Just try to get comfortable with using the computer.

==== Common Menu Bar Features ====
Most programs share at least some similar menu bar items. Below is an overview of basic buttons found in the menu bar. It is broken down the same way that the menu bar is. Try these out.
* '''File''' - Basic tasks like saving, opening, printing, and quitting are in the File menu.
* '''Edit''' - The Edit menu can do a number of things:
** '''Cut, Copy, Paste''' - This is the same thing as right clicking where the curser is and pressing cut, copy, or paste. That means also that it's the same thing as Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c, and Ctrl-v, respectively. To learn more about cutting, copying, and pasting, click here.
** '''Undo/Redo''' - If you ever make a mistake that's hard to fix, like deleting your 10 page paper, a great thing to try is Undo. Most of the time, programs will let you undo numerous times. Redo redoes what you undid with the Undo button. It's like pressing Back and Forward in a web browser. Also, Ctrl-z and Ctrl-y are for Undo and Redo.
** '''Find/Replace''' - Find and Replace are very useful tools, and they are incorporated into many programs. One example below will show how to use find, and the other will show how to use replace.
**# Let's say that a woman is on a webpage about muffins, but the only thing that she cares about are blueberry muffins. In order to save time, she goes to Edit -&gt; Find. Then, she types &quot;blueberry&quot;. The computer shows her every time that the word &quot;blueberry&quot; is on the page. This also works on other things such as word processors.
**# Another person writes a 5 page essay that was supposed to be in third-person. However, he has a whole bunch of &quot;you&quot;s in his paper. In order to fix that, the person goes to Edit -&gt; Find/Replace. In Find What, he puts &quot;you&quot; (without quotes), and in Replace With, he puts &quot;one&quot; (without quotes). After clicking &quot;find&quot; and &quot;replace&quot; enough, all the instances of &quot;you&quot; were changed to &quot;one&quot;, and whoever wrote the essay got an A+.
* '''View''' - Options in here can change the appearance of a program. Most of it depends on the program you're using.
** '''Toolbars''' - This lets you decide what toolbars to display if the program has a lot of them. An example of a toolbar is the one with the Save, Open, and New buttons.
* '''Help'''
** If you are wondering how to do something in a program, a good place to look is in Help. After opening the Help menu, you can find help by choosing &quot;Contents&quot; or &quot;Help Contents&quot; or &quot;Online Help&quot;.
** '''About''' - A general description of the program you are using is in here. Another useful thing found in here is the version number of the program.
* '''Preferences'''
** Many options for customizing a program can be found in Preferences. It is a window that comes up and is usually organized with tabs. Preferences can usually be found in Edit -&gt; Preferences or Tools -&gt; Options.

===Scroll Bar===
When there is too much stuff in a program to be displayed on the screen, a scroll bar appears in the right hand side of the window. Using this scroll bar, one can go up or down through the text or whatever needs scrolling. Scroll bars can also appear on the bottom of a window to scroll left and right. You scroll by using the following methods:

* Click the squares with the arrow icons. Up is for up, and down is for down. Every time you click the arrows, the bar between them (known as the &quot;scroll bar&quot;) goes up or down automatically.
* Click and hold the scroll bar and drag it. Dragging it down scrolls down the text, and dragging up scrolls up. Release the mouse when finished.
* There may be a small wheel on your mouse. This is called a &quot;scroll wheel&quot;. It will most likely be between the two mouse buttons. You can use this to scroll up and down.
* The Page Up and Page Down buttons on the keyboard will scroll up and down in large increments.
* The arrow keys on your keyboard can sometimes be used for scrolling.

On some occasions, there will be scroll bars inside of scroll bars. This may be confusing, but you'll get the hang of it.

=Linux=

Linux is an operating system, much like Windows is. The word &quot;Linux&quot; comes from the name of its kernel, which was originally created by Linus Torvalds, while he was still in college. There are other important parts which define the operating system (at least in the sense of the term in which user’s programs are part of an operating system), so you may find other names for the same thing: &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; and &quot;GNU&quot;. In its early stages, it had a command interface (that's where you HAVE to type exactly what you want the computer to do), but has now grown into fully featured OS used by enterprises, developers, and power-users at home.

Known worldwide as the core of the Open Source world, Linux is &quot;free&quot; (as in &quot;freedom&quot;) by allowing the average user to observe and make changes to the source code of Linux as needed. That means if YOU want some kind of special functionality, YOU can implement it. You can also make copies of GNU/Linux and other free (as in freedom) programs, and give them to other people, while sharing a copy of Windows or Mac OS X is illegal in some countries. For that reason, Linux is as diverse as the humans that inhabit the Earth. Unlike Windows, where there are only a few choices of the OS, there exist literally hundreds of variations of Linux, each of which is created and maintained to perform a specific function for a community of users.

==Installing an operating system==

A computer needs an operating system to start running, like a car needs an engine to start moving.
But installing an operating system is not for beginners, like installing a car engine is not for beginners.
Many excellent car drivers have never installed a car engine.

Recent versions of Linux are widely considered the easiest-to-install operating system so far -- some people say &quot;a chicken could install Linux&quot;.
However, installing any operating system is not recommended for beginners, and so is outside the scope of this book.
After you finish this book, you may be ready to go on to a book that discusses booting a LiveCD or even installing an operating system, for example [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Linux#Live CDs]].

==K Desktop (KDE)==
{{cleanup}}
KDE is a Desktop Environment which basically is a style of your GUI for your open source operating system. The project was founded on the 14th of October 1996. It has many, many tools such as [http://kde.org/applications/multimedia/k3b/ K3B], [http://www.koffice.org/ Koffice], and [http://kile.sourceforge.net/ Kile]. KDE is very user friendly.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's get a few terms out of the way and define them:

: programme : a file which can be executed, serves a specific purpose
: suite : a set of programmes which work in conjunction to perform a set of tasks
: product : the result of one's programming, can be a singular programme, a suite or entire operating system
: source code : the entire collection of the programming put into a product
: open source : used to describe any software where you can obtain the source code
: freeware : a programme which can be obtained free of charge
: Open Source : a label for anything approved by the OSI
: Free Software : a label for anything approved by the FSF

When someone says the word &quot;open&quot;, what do you immediately think of?  Do you think of something that is ajar?  Of something which is obvious?  Where anyone can see it?  Unobstructed?  Or maybe something that is available for immediate usage?  When you're in the programming world those possibilities come close but fall short of what open means.  And what of the word &quot;free&quot;?  Do you think of something that you don't need to pay for?  Or do you think  something that is unrestricted?  Once again, it's a little more complicated in the world of programmers.

To the layman Open Source and Free Software are the same thing; however, these two groups hold tense and sometimes hostile relations with one another. These programming sects believe in particular freedoms and work towards the betterment of these goals through the development of their software.

People often like to think of this intellectual property in the same way they would physical property.  If the various open source models are looked at in this manner then the public domain is public property and no one can deny access to that code for any reason or use.  GPL code is private property that is granted to the public under the condition that all released works generated from it remains in the same position.  BSD is property anyone can use for any reason or use on the condition that they maintain due credit.

End this chapter with something along the lines of, &quot;much like with a rented car, you've using licensed code or software, you've got responsibilities you must uphold.&quot;  Which then leads into the next chapter.

== &quot;As for me...&quot; ==

'This whole sentence means &quot;As for me, I am ___.&quot; '

I'm just beginning with Japanese, but I've noticed that a lot of translations use the phrase &quot;As for ___&quot; to translate &quot;___ は&quot;.  Why?  Although it is technically correct, no English speaker in the world introduces himself with: &quot;As for me, I am Bob.&quot;  The sentence really 'means' &quot;I am ___,&quot; so why not just say that?

It seems to me that &quot;as for ___&quot; is an attempt to keep an English translation's phrases in the same order as the Japanese words, but it reads poorly and only goes halfway.  If showing the correspondence between Japanese and the English translation is important, I think it would be better to show an intermediate translation, like &quot;I (subject marker) ___ are&quot;, and then show the actual translation, &quot;I am ___&quot;.

Also, I am confused by the term &quot;copula verb&quot; which shows up a couple times on this page.  I'm sure it makes sense to grammaticians and linguists -- people who casually throw around words like &quot;schwa&quot; and &quot;gerund&quot; -- but it is not helpful to a person trying to make sense of a new language.

[[User:Jclee|Joe Lee]] 01:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

:Hi. I think, in this case(when you say your name), you don't need &quot;As for me&quot;. I've never seen the Japanese textbooks in the English world, but at least in the English texts we use in Japan, はじめまして is &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; and わたしはBobです is just &quot;I am Bob.&quot;
:However, it's true that &quot;___ は&quot; ''generally'' might have the nuance &quot;As for ___&quot;. For example; 

:Imagine there're Bob and I here. Now if I say, 「Bob は 読書(reading books) が 好き(likes) です」, then you can interpret this in the two ways:
:#Bob likes reading books. (Just that. I don't say I like or not)
:#Bob likes reading books, ''but I do not''.
:If I say は weak(naturally), probably it's the case 1. If I emphasize は, it ''can be'' the case 2.

:Application: Imagine there're Bob, Jack and I here. Now if I say, 「Bob は 読書(reading books) が 好き(likes) です」...
:#Bob likes reading books. (Just that)
:#Bob likes reading books, but I do not. (I don't know about Jack)
:#Bob likes reading books, ''but I guess Jack does not''.
:#Bob likes reading books, ''but I do not and I guess Jack does not, neither''.
:In another word, &quot;At least this can be said: Bob likes reading books.&quot; or &quot;As for Bob, he likes reading books.&quot; Does it make sense? I don't know this is something to do with the word order... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 05:00:17, 2005-08-26 (UTC)

::Hi.  Yes, that makes more sense to me, thanks.  I suppose this is something like stresses in spoken English, like the difference between &quot;Bob likes reading books&quot; and &quot;''Bob'' likes reading books.&quot;  I still don't like &quot;As for ___&quot; -- after all, all your interpretations above don't use it and sound much better for it -- but now I understand that it's a convenient way of emphasizing the subject of a sentence.

::I also like your &quot;Nice to meet you&quot; better than &quot;I am meeting you for the first time&quot;, as it is given in the lesson.  But wouldn't &quot;Nice to meet you&quot; be a better translation for &quot;どうぞ　よろしく&quot;?  Or do both phrases roughly serve the same purpose as &quot;Nice to meet you&quot; in English?

::Thanks. [[User:Jclee|Joe Lee]] 21:49, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

:::A-ha, yeah, smiliar to the stresses in English, I think it's right.
:::Speaking of &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;, ... well, in fact I don't think I understand enough the situations where &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; is used but... When you use どうぞよろしく, it should be placed at the end of your self-introduction (though I feel よろしくお願いします is much more common). Thus, the suitable ''English expression for どうぞよろしく'' might be &quot;Thank you.&quot; at the end of the speech. Please see the [http://www2.alc.co.jp/ejr/index.php?word_in=%82%C7%82%A4%82%BC%82%E6%82%EB%82%B5%82%AD&amp;word_in2=%82%A9%82%AB%82%AD%82%AF%82%B1&amp;word_in3=PVawEWi72JXCKoa0Je search results of Eijiro, a famaous online Ja&amp;harr;En dictionary]. However, thinking about the inverse case(English to Japanese), I'm not so sure whether &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; can be translated to どうぞよろしく. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 05:24:22, 2005-08-27 (UTC)

::::I agree that ''as for 〜'' is totally unnatural English. Furthermore, I agree that it's unnecessary in simple sentences like ''watashi wa 〜 desu''. Maybe it should be removed from the Introductions, and it should be avoided once the student has mastered ''wa''.  Having said that,  I think that it's a useful way to think about ''wa'' in sentences where the topic is not the grammatical subject. This is very common in Japanese.
::::: ''watashi wa ashi ga nagai desu''
::::: I [topic marker] leg [subject marker] are long [polite ending] 
::::: As for me, (my) legs are long.
::::: I have long legs.
:::: I don't know about you, but I find the word-for-word translation harder to read and less informative than &quot;as for me&quot;. I mean, if you know enough to understand all the [ 〜　marker] labels, then the word-for-word version probably doesn't add much to your understanding. Any thoughts?
::::-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 06:33, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

:::: There's no reason to expect a natural English translation of ''yoroshiku onegaishimasu''. English speakers don't say anything like that. [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 06:40, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

== kochira koso ==

For the first conversation, comparing the Romaji and English:

* Hayasaka: Kochira koso, yoroshiku o-negai shimasu. 
* Hayasaka: Likewise. 

When this is translated into English, does &quot;Kochira koso, yoroshiku o-negai shimasu&quot; literally translate to &quot;Likewise, I look forward to working with you&quot;?  Does the rest of the sentence need to follow &quot;Kochira koso&quot; to emphasize what is likewise?  I'm a little confused, perhaps because I read too literally into things.

--[[User:Fushigidane|Fushigidane]] 05:04, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:With a few reservations, I would say, yes, it literally translates to &quot;Likewise, I look forward to working with you&quot;. And, no, you do not always ''have'' to repeat the sentence after ''kochira koso'', but at least in this case (formal introductions), I think it sounds better if you do repeat it. Maybe a better literal translation of ''kochira koso'' would be &quot;It is '''me''' who (is looking forward to working with you)&quot;. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 08:32, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::I am sorry to say this ToothingLummox, but your answer to Fushigade's question is not correct. The correct answer to Fushigidane's question here is '''NO''', it does '''NOT''' litterally translate to &quot;Likewise, I look forward to working with you&quot;!!!
::As with lots of Japanase words and phrases, also this one is difficult to translate litterally. What is said here, is the following: 
::こちらこそ, {{furi|宜|よろ}}しく お{{furi|願|ねが}}いします。 (Kochira koso, yoroshiku onegai shimasu).
::*こちら, ''kochira'': &quot;this side/way&quot;
::*こそ, ''koso'': &quot;for sure&quot;.
::*こちらこそ, ''kochira koso'' can be translated as &quot;it is I who should say so&quot; (usually used in cases where you want to say &quot;the thanks is all mine&quot;).
::*{{furi|宜|よろ}}しく, ''yoroshiku'': &quot;well (in the adverbial sense of &quot;good&quot;), properly, suitably&quot;, also (more freely) translates as &quot;best regards&quot;.
::*お{{furi|願|ねが}}いします, ''onegai shimasu'': &quot;do this humble request&quot;. ''Shimasu'' comes from the verb ''suru'' (to do), ''negai'' is a request or a wish and the ''o'' in front of  ''negai'' makes it humble and therefore this makes the sentence more polite, so that it can be translated as &quot;please, grant me this wish&quot;.
::*{{furi|宜|よろ}}しく お{{furi|願|ねが}}いします, ''yoroshiku onegai shimasu'' can now be translated as &quot;please, treat me nice/good&quot;, but it can also be used as &quot;(please), my best regards&quot;. In a first meeting with somebody it can be freely translated as &quot;nice to meet you&quot;...

::So, coming back to the complete sentence, if you want to translate it litterally (which you should not want do with Japanese! ;-) ) it would come to something like: &quot;This side for sure, treat me good&quot;. But a better translation into an English sentence that would be used in similar situations is something like &quot;Likewise (or: the pleasure is mine), it's nice to meet you&quot;. The last one you might find contradictory with ''Hajimemashite'', wich was also used in the same conversation in the module and this also translates as &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;. However, also this is not a litteral translation. ''Hajimemashite'' litterally means &quot;we have started&quot;, and the Japanese combine this in a formal introduction with ''&quot;(douzo) yoroshiku onegai shimasu&quot;''. Personally, I think it's better to translate ''hajimemashite'' into &quot;How do you do&quot; which is used in the same way in (British) English, and ''yoroshiku onegai shimasu'' into &quot;it's nice to meet you&quot;.
::Japanese is and remains difficult to translate litterally, but it's sometimes interesting to do that... [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 06:41, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Kanji&quot; ==

Someone has been a little overenthusiastic here, or has read a dictionary without ever reading a Japanese book.  There are also some places where the writer seems not to know the language.

The greetings that are all in kanji aren't generally used as such unless one is reading Edojidaibungaku.

''Ohayou'' is always kana, and ''Kon'nichiwa'' likewise, because you can't differentiate ''Kyou wa'' (today is) from ''Kon'nichi wa'' &quot;Nowadays&quot; from the greeting. ''youkoso'' is never in kanji.  The translation for ''yoroshiku onegai shimasu'' is wrong. ''Kochira koso'' is never in kanji, and neither is ''arigatou gozaimasu'' (and it should be ''Doumo arigatou gozaimasu'' anyway, because it's more formal). ''dou itashimashite'' is also never in kanji.

If the usage notes say there is a mixture of forms, then the chart is useless as it stands, because not only does the reader not know what's what yet, the chart says formal greetings.  Ohayou can be used the first time you meet somebody on a given day, as long as it's not too late in the day.

The grammatical constructions are wrong, or at least fanciful: &quot;ohayou&quot; doesn't come from an adjective; if it comes from anything, it comes from a Classical Japanese ''verb'', hence the &quot;-oo&quot; ending only goes on verbs.  Moreover, these are all ''kimarimonku'', or set phrases, and therefore constructing them is unnecessary; you just need to learn them like words.

I'm going to make some changes to fix some of this.

* I have removed the kanji for greetings.
* I have fixed the romanization.
* I have removed the grammatical construction section, as the greetings are all set phrases.

I'll fix the Japanese when I'm on a Japanese enabled machine. [[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 18:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

:Speaking of kanji, should the names (and also ''onegai'') really be in kanji? I know that the names have furigana over them so that people will still be able to read them using the hiragana chart, but isn't it just confusing for a beginner to add in kanji symbols in the introductory chapters? 

:It makes sense in the vocabulary section where words that aren't going to appear until later are used as examples, but even then, ''kun'' should just be written in hiragana to match ''san''. 

:I guess you could say that it makes it easier to see where the names are in the sentences because they look so different, but I think it would be better to stick with the kana in the introductory lessons and then add in kanji in the basic lessons. Hiragana is much easier to read than th furigana sitting on the kanji IMO [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 02:22, 3 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

=Magnetism=
{{PSG/eq | &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}_B=q\boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;}}

The '''magnetic force''' exerted on a moving particle in a magnetic field is the [[wikipedia:Cross product|cross product]] of the '''magnetic field''' and the '''velocity''' of the particle, multiplied by the '''charge''' of the particle.
----
Because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the particle's velocity, this causes [[Physics Study Guide/Torque|uniform circular motion]].  That motion can be explained by the following 

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{mv}{qB}&lt;/math&gt;}}

The '''radius''' of this circle is directly proportional to the '''mass''' and the '''velocity''' of the particle and inversely proportional to the '''charge''' of the particle and the '''field strength''' of the magnetic field.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi m}{qB}&lt;/math&gt;}}

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m} = \frac{v}{2\pi r}&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''period''' and '''frequency''' of this motion (referred to as the [[wikipedia:Cyclotron|cyclotron]] period and frequency) can be derived as well. 
----
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi y}&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

The '''magnetic field''' created by charge flowing through a straight wire is equal to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by the '''current''' flowing through the wire and divide by the '''distance''' from the wire.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 \mu}{4\pi x^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

The '''magnetic field''' created by a magnetic dipole (at distances much greater than the size of the dipole) is approximately equal to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by the '''dipole moment''' divided by the cube of the '''distance''' from the dipole.  EDIT:  This forumla is incomplete.  The field from a dipole is a vector that depends not only on the distance from the dipole, but also the angle relative to the orientation of the magnetic moment.  This is because of the vector nature of the magnetic moment and its associated magnetic field.  The field component pointing in the same directions as the magnetic moment is the above formula multiplied by (3*(Cos[theta])^2-1).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;B = \mu_0 n I&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

The '''magnetic field''' created by an ideal [[wikipedia:Solenoid|solenoid]] is equal to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, times the '''number of turns''' of the solenoid times the '''current''' flowing through the solenoid. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 n I}{2\pi r}&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

The '''magnetic field''' created by an ideal [[wikipedia:Toroid|toroid]] is equal to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, times the '''number of turns''' of the toroid times the '''current''' flowing through the toroid divided by the '''circumference''' of the toroid.
----
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;F_B = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2 \ell}{2\pi d}&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''magnetic force''' between two wires is equal to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;, times the '''current in one wire''' times the '''current in the other wire''' times the '''length''' of the wires divided by the '''distance''' between the wires.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;\tau = I\vec A\times\vec B&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''torque''' on a current loop in a magnetic field is equal to the [[wikipedia:Cross product|cross product]] of the '''magnetic field''' and the '''area''' enclosed by the current loop (the area vector is perpendicular to the current loop).
----
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;\vec \mu = I\vec An&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''dipole moment''' of a current loop is equal to the '''current''' in the loop times the '''area''' of the loop times the '''number of turns''' of the loop.
----
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;math&gt;U_B = -\vec\mu\cdot\vec B&lt;/math&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''magnetic potential energy''' is the opposite of the [[wikipedia:Dot product|dot product]] of the '''magnetic field''' and the '''dipole moment'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikibooks.  

I saw your requests on my talk page, and came here to reply.  Most of the issues you have brought up are due to the [[Cookbook]] being a part of the overall Wikibooks project.  The link to categories takes you to a list of all the categories used in all wikibooks.  [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons] has renamed this link to be more clear, perhaps we should as well.  Feel free to suggest a change at [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|the staff lounge]].  The same is true of the recent changes.  All the recent changes in the English Wikibooks make it onto that list, and you're correct, random module does in fact take you to any module in the project.  The thing all of Wikibooks share is that they are intended to be instructional projects.  Other than that, it is quite a diverse project.  

Adding &quot;Cookbook&quot; to the front of all pages is needed to keep the different wikibooks from walking all over each other.  The Cookbook and the Gardening Book share many titles, so a disambiguation scheeme was implimented early on, and some other books also have conflicting pages (while the Cookbook doesn't have one, lots of books have a Table of Contents, for example). Early on (before I got here) the psudo namespace &quot;Cookbook:&quot; was chosen to be the standard used in the cookbook.  Other [[Wikibooks:naming conventions|naming conventions]] were chosen by other books.

In the past, seperate namespaces were suggested for each book, [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]] documents the discussion.  While I think it is still possible to make &quot;Cookbook:&quot; a full fledged namesapce (which would eliminate the case-sensitivity problem) nothing was ever done about it.  Additionally, on the [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook's talk page]] there was some early discussion of splitting the cookbook off to it's own domain, but again, this fizzled.  New projects are discussed at [[m:Proposals for new projects|Proposals for new projects]] at [[m:|Meta]].

I hope this helps you understand why the things are the way they are, and might motivate you to make things better.  Happy editing, and thanks for all the contributions you've been making, they're great. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:40, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

PS: to sign a comment, like I did above, just add four tildies {&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to add a link to your user page and a date stamp.  Three tildies leaves just your user name, while 5 leaves just a time stamp. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

== Deletionism ==
A simple majority does seem overly harsh, but I don't see any reason to up the limit to 85%. I think the policy ought to focus more on reasons for deleting, and setting policies which show when something is not appropriate rather than relying purely on votes. Something like the [[w:Wikipedia:Deletion requests|deletion requests]] process that [[w:User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] proposed might work better here than the standard Wikipedia VfD system. For example, if &quot;getting a girl&quot; does not fit the mission of Wikibooks, and already violates the policies of what can be included here, then it ought not matter how many votes it gets on VfD. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 19:34, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Question==
:''pages with real content sometimes disappear (in clear violation of policy) without even a vote''
Your statement interests me. Would you like to cite such an example? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:08, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:: I did look into that matter. However, my opinion is that the action taken was not done so in bad faith, for one. Regardless, 
::: ''I need admin rights to even investigate this sort of thing.''
:: Not necessarily. You can always ask another administrator to show you copies of deleted content; however in me saying this, I do not intend it to be a discouragement or disincentive for your request for adminship.
:: Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:11, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Albert, there is nothing saying that pages with content cannot be deleted: Jimbo himself agreed that the infamous Getting a girl &quot;book&quot; should be deleted. (Also, I'm not sure why you are convinced that the deletion of the Human cookbook entry was out of line.) Further, I would appreciate it if you would not slander me on other people's talk pages. We all have different ideas of what the ideal wikibooks would be, but we'll never get their through inuendo and slandering. You don't have to agree with me, but I'd expect anyone nominating himself to be an admin would act in good faith. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:45, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Bean nomenclature ==

Hello Albert,

I am always happy to find someone else who prefers standard names!

Personally, I find ''blackeye'' more orthographically pleasing than the hyphenated, verbally conjugated form, and I would say the thing is clearly a bean, since I prefer to restrict the word ''pea'' to ''Pisum sativum''.  However personal preferences aside, I think ''Black-eyed pea'' has a strong case for being the standard name because it wins the Google test by a large ratio (77,800 hits over 14,100 for ''Black-eye pea'', 2,810 for ''Black-eyed bean'', and fewer for the other obvious variants), and because that's the title of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-eyed_pea Wikipedia article].

On the other hand, ''cowpea'' beats all of those names in the Google test.  Although the term can be used to include the yardlong bean, the crowder bean, and the catjang, we might consider them interchangeable in the kitchen.

As for the ''black''/''turtle''/''black turtle''/''black (turtle)'' bean, I think the question is difficult.  ''Black bean'' is the familiar term for me, and I believe it is the most common term, but it is unfortunately ambiguous.  Besides the small black variety of ''Phaseolus vulgaris'' (which I assume is the one we are talking about), it could also be taken to mean (at least) the Chinese fermented black bean (used to make black bean sauce), the Indian black gram, or the black varieties of the soybean or the azuki bean.

''Turtle bean'' is clearly a much less used term, but it is far from unattested.  It's commonly given as a synonym, and I believe it is unambiguous.  Here are some references:

* [http://www.woodlandfoods.com/products/BEANS_AND_LENTILS.html Woodland Foods]
* [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MV018 University of Florida Agricultural Extension]
* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/blackbeanchillichoco_2411.shtml BBC Recipe]
* [http://www.beanthinking.co.uk/Cooked%20beans.htm Bean Thinking]
* [http://www.botany.com/phaseolus.html Botany.com]
* [http://www.foodreference.com/html/artblackbeans.html Foodreference.com]

Although I acknowledge that it is not a perfect choice, I believe that ''black turtle bean'' has the advantages of both unambiguity and understandability, and is the best of the available names.

What do you think?

Regards, [[User:Pekinensis|Pekinensis]] 02:51, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Hello Albert,

Thank you for your prompt response, and apologies for my tardy one.

As a philosophical point, I disagree with your criteria for judging which things judge as conflicts and which do not, but I have no strident objection to using the name ''black bean'', assuming a clear explanation of the possible confusions, along with appropriate redirects.

(The conflict would come when a user with a bag from an Asian market, labeled ''Chinese black beans'', tried to find information here, under that name.  A black bean soup made this way would likely shock the poor user!  Granted, it's unfortunate that food manufactures, importers and so on are often very casual about names, but I don't have much hope for improvement in this.)

If I understand correctly, we can both live with the names ''black-eyed pea'' and ''black bean'', with explanations and redirects as appropriate.  If we are in agreement, I am happy to take care of implementing this.

Hi AlbertCahalan,

Well, I would tend to trust a magazine which when commenting on trends on the internet, such as certain types of ads, admits to using them itself or having used them in the past.  This kind of honesty seems to lend credibility to their other stories.

==Cookbook navigation==
I don't know if there's any standard navigation. You say you use &quot;|&quot; to seperate the links. Other pages I see using &quot;|&quot; for links tend to be placed at random with no structure. I used &quot;&gt;&quot; to show that it's a subsection of another page:
*Cookbook | Index of Ingredients | Basic foodstuffs | Cereal | Corn
*Cookbook &gt; Index of Ingredients &gt; Basic foodstuffs &gt; Cereal &gt; Corn
I didn't know someone else was also trying to standardize the links, so I'll let you get on with it.

==Recipe rant==
You say that my recipe for [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake]] is incorrectly weighted. You are talking patent nonsense.

The recipe is intended to be scalable. It is not feasible to define a fixed weight for the ingredients in this recipe, for the very reasons you explain. The recipe is five generations old (the earliest I have traced it to is my grandmother's grandmother) and has been rigorously and constantly tested over those 140+ years: I have never tasted a better cake. Have you actually tried this recipe? 

If the eggs have lost water, the amount of flour, sugar, etc will have been reduced accordingly by this recipe.

Also, your ridiculous 'fact' about most households not possessing a kitchen scale is ludicrous. If I were to define the amount of butter as being 'half a pound' or something like that then the recipe would be thrown off proportions, and also I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people wishing to bake to possess a $5 scale!

''copied from [[User talk:Redlentil]]''

:I'll jump in here with an answer.  The database at wikipedia has been having problems with new pages not showing up immediatly. If the same new page is saved twice, it appears twice on the new pages list, and the servers have also been having problems saving pages but not displaying the results.  As wikibooks is hosted on the same servers, it's likely that the same problems would appear here. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:37, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, i know i didnt get rid of them all; when i started i didnt realise there were so many.

I'm planning on setting up a new page for a table comparing different products in a table and putting a link to the table at the bottom of the page. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 00:16, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Naming Conventions and Cultural Sensitivity ==

Thanks for the helpful comment that you made on my talk page when I first started about a week or so ago.

Regarding the discussion on naming conventions... We both agreed that it does not matter what a page is called, as long as the displayed name was consistent within a list. Why then are you insisting of moving the names of the pages I create to all upper case when there is no formal naming convention? I've tried to leave yours alone.

More seriously, you have moved the name of every page that I have created under titles that use my local term for items to Americanisms (I'm a New Zealander) without any discussion on its talk page (I found that quite offensive, and made a comment on the talk pages the first couple of times that you did it). Even though, in every case, I've tried to to provide a redirect from all of the other names that I could think of at the time. Worse, in [[Cookbook:Bakeware|bake ware]], when you moved [[Cookbook:Oven tray|oven tray]] to [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]], you removed the link from the contents list to '''oven tray''' (making it a virtually orphaned page). You should realise that there is an international audience for this cookbook, and we need to list all of the known terms for items in lists to facilitate use by people from other cultures. Why not just leave the names as they are, and be satisfied that a redirect has been provided from the term that you like to use (if there isn't one, feel free to create it). I have fixed your changes made to the '''Bake ware''' section. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 23:10, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Regarding really obscure names (on [[User_talk:Geocachernemesis]]) ==

Yes, '''oven tray''' or '''baking sheet''' may be less popular terms than '''cookie sheet''', but I've ensured that I've included a reference to other common terms in my articles (e.g., An '''oven tray'''  (also known as a  '''baking sheet''' or '''cookie sheet''') is...). My main concern is that you are moving pages unilaterally, without any prior discussion and consensus on the talk pages, and without any clear mandate to do so (as far as I can see; I'm beginning to sound a bit like the UN ;)). See [[Talk:Cookbook:Beater]] where we discuss it after the fact, and  [[Talk:Cookbook:Waffle Maker]] where I'm surprised that you did it again. Later, I didn't bother to comment again on the individual Talk pages.

On Wikipedia, there are guidelines for handling this kind of problem. There, pages are generally left in the original type of English, because much animosity has been caused by people ''correcting'' the spelling on pages in the past (just because they didn't like the way that it looked). I don't think that Google constitutes a majority; we need feedback from real users. You say that my policy of including all of the more obscure terms for an item in the list is cumbersome and annoying for you. That may be so, but as this cookbook is a truly international project, we need to cater to the needs of other cultures too.

As far as capitalization goes, you previously argued that it does not matter how a page is capitalized, as broken links will be made whatever the convention is followed, and the display name can be changed easily in lists. So, it doesn't matter if we agree to disagree. I can continue to use Wikipedias page naming convention, and you can use yours. If you really dislike linking to my page titles, then simply create a page with your favourite format of name, and then redirect it to mine.

I know I'm new to the cookbook, but I have a contribution to make. I know it seems that I'm coming in and fiddling with things in your domain, but I have the same goal, I want to be part of creating a truly useful cookbook. When there are definite written guidelines to follow, I will happily follow them.  [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 01:23, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I notice that the [[Cookbook:Grunt_Work|definite written guidelines]] were written almost entirely by you, so of course they are going to say what you want them to.;) But, I do think there needs to be some sort of vote to settle the matter once an for all. I'm sure that you will survive the lack of a few capital letters in my page names. BTW, the whole reason I'm creating so many pages, is because I read on Grunt Work that more images were need for ingredients and utensils. So, I'm helping out by adding some.

Yes, I'm quite familiar with American cultural imperialism. It may surprise you to learn that a majority of the world's English speakers don't speak American English (think about India). I'm sure that most American English speakers are intelligent enough to work out how to read an article on the oven tray (when redirected from cookie tray), as it is pointed out that it is the same as a cookie tray at the beginning of the article.

Google is not an administrator for the cookbook, and I don't think that it should be majority rule all of the time. I have simply been saying that it would have been more polite to take the cautious approach and leave the pages I created as they were. As it is, I'm getting a bad first impression of the community here. It feels like it has to be, your way, or no way. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 03:07, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I didn't intend to imply that you had written the guidelines with me in mind. But, the naming section is your work, and appears to be your opinion.

I'm sorry to hear that the administrators have been heavy handed with you. But, a deletion by an administrator is not the same you moving the names of others' pages.

I know an international cookbook seems like too much trouble to you, but I'm willing to give it a go. If you think that the wiki is hostile to Americans, then you should try being in my shoes for a change.

Anyway, I had better get back to adding my photos, otherwise I'll never finish. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 09:00, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Regarding sugar formatting ==

I'm sorry if my edits were not properly justified. I'm using Mozilla Firefox, and for some reason I was getting huge vertical gaps between sections. I thought that it would be best to use the simplest mark up possible.

I know that it's unconventional to have the images in that order (white then brown), but they look unnatural in the other order (brown then white), the perspective is all wrong (try both combinations for yourself). It doesn't really matter if the images don't match exactly to the sections for such a short list, as they are only there to give a general impression of the topic of the list.

I'm also revisiting some of the pages that I've added images to, and changing their size to the standard thumb size (180px; i.e., by not specifying their width), unless there is a good reason to use a larger version (e.g., a single highly-complex image). This should help to save bandwidth (users can simply click on the thumb for a larger view). Also, if and when Wikimedia changes the standard thumb size in the future, our articles will still look presentable. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 00:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I'm obviously a bit rusty, and I tend to avoid using '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. I understood what you were trying to do, but as you see, it looks better with white sugar at the top. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 01:12, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Request for a small rewrite ==

Hi AlbertCahalan,
I hope it's ok to post here. 

An expert user added a lot of detail about shells to BSD and Linux, but s/he lost your useful qualitative comments for newbies in the process. Could you look at this, and if possible work your comments into hirs? If you can comment on differentiating the other shells from a newbie perspective, that would be helpful too. Btw, I didn't understand why csh was incompatible or why sh was less-friendly (no backspacing, at all? That's the one that makes me unhappy when logging into a strange shell).
Milo [[User:4.252.99.104|4.252.99.104]] 08:27, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
*Bash is the default shell in Linux, and in the MacOS X distribution of BSD.
Bash is well-suited to both interactive use and shell programming. Most BSD
distributions use the less-friendly sh for the root account and for scripts,
while using the incompatible csh for general interactive use. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ * [[bash]], an extended version of the original [[sh]] is the default
shell on most Linux operating systems as well as on [[MacOS X]]. bash is well-
suited to both interactive use and shell programming and is used for both on
these systems. Many of these systems link sh to bash. 
  +   
  + * FreeBSD, NetBSD and DragonFlyBSD default to using [[csh]] for root and
new users, with [[pdksh]], a completely [[sh]]-compatible shell, for use with
scripts - linking pdksh to sh. OpenBSD defaults to a modified pdksh which has
extended functionality. csh is the default for shell usage because of it's
Unix heritage, which traditionally favours csh to other shells. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
== Wikibook: C Programming ==
Thank's for fixing the section on relational and logical operators. Back when I first learned C,  expressions such as 10 &gt; 4 were not guaranteed to evaluate to 1. The only guarantee was that they evaluated to some non-zero number, sometimes it would be -1. That's why I was refraining from using 1 as the true value. But my descriptions were certainly unsatisfactory.  I'm glad you noticed the omission of the shift operators in the bitwise operator section as well.  I knew I was forgetting something. Unlike you, I've got no objection to defining false and true values, but these would be strictly for assigning to variables, not for testing against. Testing against them is asking for problems. 

I also noticed you had to tone down some of the editorializing against gotos.  I've had to tone the editorializing down in other places as well, like using macros for instance. 

I've written much of the section on pointers.  Sometimes my descriptions are rather terse and not very clear. You might have something to add in that section too. Of course some of the earlier sections in the book really need some reorganization. Rodney Drenth --[[User:71.32.166.119|71.32.166.119]] 06:53, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

== Editions ==

You said: ''Teaching any sort of class from a live wiki would be insane. Never mind the bad changes: a really nice reorganization could seriously mess up a sylabus''

:That's why I think we should make a plan where if books reach a first edition or v1.0 stage we should provide a &quot;stable build&quot; of it. Either a PDF or just some locked pages. I think this would also have other good effects: It would focus book development to reach that first edition goal, instead of contributors spending more time on tangents and less on the core material. Naturally for the cookbook this model wouldn't apply, since making the cookbook is much more like making wikipedia, whereas making a ciriculum book is much more like making a kernel. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:39, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

== Evolution of Operating Systems Designs ==

Albert, you simply don't understand the subject matter and I'm convinced you never will. As a result of this, things you '''add''' are almost okay until they can be assimilated (unless they're interpretations in which case they're crap and have to be neutralized, like your notion that voice recognition is unworkable) but things you delete all have to be reverted. You simply do not '''understand'''. So stop fucking with me and '''do not''' delete stuff. I don't enjoy cleaning up the messes you leave behind under the pretense of &quot;fixing&quot; things.

Case in point, Unix file descriptors are low-level, flat and centralized, so they're not a kind of capability but merely examples of a kind of capability I identified. And while adding this redundant example, you deleted a reference to capabilities of a different kind. Great fucking job; a net loss of information.

Oh and Albert? The reason you will never, ever understand OS design is because you are contemptuous of it. This fact is evident in everything you have written, everything you have deleted, everything you have done, from Day 1. And that is precisely why I am contemptuous of ''you''. Not because you are contemptuous of OS design or because you don't understand it. No, it's because you think you ''do'' understand it despite being contemptuous of it. But you can't because no one can, and your resistance to that universal truth makes you a knuckle-dragging bonehead. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 11:07, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

Listen Cahalan you little shithead, I got myself out of your stupid biased book because you dominated it. Now I'm talking about the subject I want to talk about from the perspective that I want to talk about it (it's in the goddamn title of the book) which is a perspective you deliberately claimed was worthless so guess what? Stay the fuck away from it! Do NOT dare to fucking undermine it you asshole. You're trying to subvert a book so that it no longer even matches the title, which is DESIGN, by putting in pejoratives and insults throughout (and I consider dismissing my definition as &quot;academic&quot; to be a pejorative given that the entire book is supposed to be fucking academic). The next step is to just revert your edits in that book sight unseen, which is something I don't think I have ever done but you've reserved yourself a special place in my heart with your deeply insulting, dismissive behaviour.

I fully support keeping the subject of the new book in line with the title. I don't however support throwing vicious and unjustified insults at mainstream computing and other wikibooks contributers. In keeping with the new book title it is appropriate to discuss many failed designs, no matter if the failures were technical or business-related. FYI, my career has included a job as a developer of a non-UNIX (no shell, /dev, or fork) real-time distributed OS with a nanokernel. You could probably play buzzword bingo with that.

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==Vandalism==

Could you do a favor for me? I need an administrator to delete part of the history of [[The Computer Revolution]]. Someone vandalised this page and the vandalism has been reverted, but they also vandalised the edit summary, so every time I look at the history of this article I see the word ____ written over and over again. I understand if you don't want to do it, you might not want to if you don't want to look at words like that. Thank you! --[[User:24.71.223.148|24.71.223.148]] 19:21, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

'''Recipes appropriate for this [[Cookbook:Special Diets|diet]] are being categorized at [[:Category:Gluten-free recipes]] - look there for a list.'''
&lt;/div&gt;

== What is Gluten? ==

'''Gluten''' is a protein most notably found in [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]], but also present in a number of other common
[[Cookbook:grain|grain]]s.  It permits the flexibility of [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] as a baking material.  Gluten's elasticity allows the cells that form in bread, and keep baked goods from crumbling.  The elasticity of gluten increases when it is worked and decreases if it is permitted to rest.

== Where is it present? ==

Gluten is present in the following grains: wheat (including [[cookbook:spelt|spelt]] and [[Cookbook:triticale|triticale]]), [[Cookbook:barley|barley]], and [[Cookbook:rye|rye]] (including triticale) and almost any foods made therefrom; although [[Cookbook:oats|oats]] are not themselves dangerous they are (certainly in the USA) contaminated to some degree with wheat and must be, at best, a suspect ingredient.  Gluten may be present in many unexpected places. Fermented, undistilled alcoholic beverages made from these grains ''do'' contain gluten, as may such seemingly innocuous products as cold cuts, [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], or hard candies. Additionally, many ingredients that are commonly found in processed foods, such as modified food starch, can be made from wheat and therefore contain gluten.

Another place you will find gluten, though not obvious, is in the production of many foods that do not contain wheat or substances in their ingredients. One common example of this are foods that do not contain gluten in their recipe, but the conveyor belts where the food is processed is dusted with flour to prevent sticking. Many &quot;energy bars&quot; fit this description. 

There is no other way to know if this is the case by reading the label; you must call the vendor to be sure.

== Why Gluten Free? ==

This diet is necessary for those with gluten sensitivity, gluten intolerance and auto-immune diseases like [[w:Coeliac disease|Celiac Disease]]. A gluten-free diet can be useful for those suffering from an [[w:allergy|allergy]] to one or more of the grains (mainly wheat, barley and rye) this diet excludes. There are over 190 medical conditions that have been linked to gluten sensitivity and gluten intolerance, Celiac Disease being one of them.  Celiac Disease is often still undiagnosed. Some people find that a gluten-free diet is beneficial for children with [[w:autism|autism]]. It should be noted, however, that there is no evidence for an autism-gluten link. A distinction is important, because wheat and gluten are high quality food sources, not to be rejected on the basis of unfounded speculation.

It is important to note that Celiac Disease is NOT itself an allergy, but an auto-immune disorder - the body rejects its own digestive proteins used to process gluten and produces antibodies against them. In essence, the body is fighting itself, in the presence of gluten, and doing damage to the small intestine in the process. Celiac Disease becomes a two-fold issue due to the damage done to the villi in the small intestine creating a nutrient malabsorption problem that is not reversible.

== How can gluten be avoided? ==

Careful and constant reading of ingredients is necessary to purchase truly gluten free foods. If flour (which means &quot;wheat flour&quot; unless otherwise specified), starch (including &quot;modified food starch&quot;, &quot;food starch&quot;), malt, or any grain containing gluten is present, do not purchase the food. Unfortunately for the person with gluten sensitivity or gluten intolerance, it may be necessary to also investigate every step of the handling of the products, due to widespread wheat contamination of certain foods by way of shared equipment, containers, and processing rooms. Cross contamination is a big issue that many do not think about when it comes to storing, handling and preparing food.  Finally the utensils, equipment, and surfaces for cooking and eating must be free of accumulations containing gluten, especially ones which have been hardened on by heat, especially in toasters and bakeware.

A gluten-free diet can only be achieved by complete removal of ''all'' gluten from your foods, medicines, and any cosmetic products which will accidentally enter the [[w:gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]] (in practice, probably all of them); reducing the amount will not be a sufficient treatment. Be aware that gluten can be hidden in many processed foods and products you may normally use.

== Cooking gluten-free ==

To cook appetizing gluten-free meals, it’s a good idea to be aware of what function the flour is performing in your recipe before you attempt to replace it. 
Wheat flour can perform multiple functions: thickening, binding, adding flavour, changing texture, and absorbing moisture. 
No alternative to wheat flour can do all these things in the same way as wheat flour. 
The most difficult behaviour to replicate is gluten's binding ability.

For this reason it is commonly advised that you mix several flours or starches when substituting for wheat. 
Different mixtures are suggested: no one mixture is ideal in all cases, and experimentation and customization are advised.

Many, if not all, gluten-free products do not have preservatives, so it is important that they be kept frozen or used soon after purchase. Do not store cooked gluten-free breads, cakes or confections for days at a time, or they will rapidly degrade and mold.  Foods containing a significant proportion of [[cookbook:Potato Starch|potato starch]], a common ingredient in gluten-free breads, are particularly susceptible to spoilage.

You must also be aware of the presence of gluten on the surfaces and utensils you use. Flour gets in the air and can't be cleaned. So avoid cooking one thing that is non-gluten free and gluten free in the same area when using flour. Also make sure you thoroughly clean all surfaces and utensils you use for both. Remember, you can never be too careful when it comes to your health.

== Other useful starches and ingredients==

Anything containing natural oils can become rancid at room temperature.  Refrigerate flours in airtight packaging.

=== Amaranth flour ===

[[cookbook:Amaranth flour|Amaranth flour]] The yield of grain amaranth is comparable to rice or maize. It was a staple food of the Aztecs, and was used as an integral part of Aztec religious ceremonies.  Amaranth is a complete protein.

=== Chia ===

[[cookbook:Chia|Chia]] seeds produce a gel-like substance when moistened that can assist when baking raised doughs.  They also function as an egg replacement in baked goods.  Ground chia seed can make the end product softer and more pliable.

=== Cornstarch ===

[[cookbook:Cornstarch|Cornstarch]] is ideal for thickening, but does not have a pleasant flavour. Too much corn starch in a liquid sauce will give a jelly-like consistency. In baking, corn starch often gives a more pleasant texture, but can give a very hard, dense consistency.

=== Flaxseed ===

[[cookbook:Flaxseed|Flaxseed]] meal produces a gel-like substance when moistened that can assist when baking raised doughs, and can also be used as an egg susbstitute in baking.

=== Millet flour ===

[[Cookbook:Millet flour|Millet flour]] Millet flours are also known as Bajari, Rotla, Bhakri, Rotti. Millets, like sorghum, are predominantly starchy. The protein content is comparable to that of wheat and maize. 

=== Potato starch ===

[[Cookbook:Potato Starch|Potato starch]] is a light starch that will rise with [[cookbook:egg|egg]] as the leavening agent.  Allows lighter baked goods.  Use is limited by the short shelf life of products made using this starch.  This includes Sweet Potato Starch.

=== Potato flour ===

[[Cookbook:Potato Flour|Potato flour]] is a pleasant thickener for gravies and can also be used in baked goods. Some bread recipes also use mashed potato flakes!

=== Rice flour ===

[[Cookbook:Rice Flour|Rice flour]] is close to wheat flour in behaviour, taste, absorption, and thickening. However, it lacks any binding ability whatsoever, and works best when combined with other flours and starches in baked goods; delicate baked goods may fail if attempted with rice flour alone. 

Sweet rice and white rice flour is finer than brown rice flour, although mills are now producing fine brown rice flours for the gluten-free market. Choose the finest grind possible for gluten-free baking; coarser grinds are slightly gritty.

Brown rice flour is a whole grain flour containing higher protein than the white rice flours, and imparts a pleasant heft to baked goods.  Sweet white rice flour from a Chinese or Asian grocery is as fine and powdery as cornstarch, and behaves similarly in baked goods. Sweet rice flour can be used as a thickener in gravies. Brown rice flour also makes a good [[cookbook:roux|roux]] for cheese sauces, gumbos, or brown sauces.

=== Teff flour ===

[[Cookbook:Teff flour|Teff flour]] Teff is an important food grain in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it is used to make injera, and less so in India and Australia. It is now raised in the U.S., in Idaho in particular, with experimental plots in Kansas. In addition to people from traditional teff-consuming countries, customers include those on gluten-restricted diets.[3]

=== Xanthan Gum ===

A strong binding agent that is used to replace the &quot;stretchy&quot; quality inherent in gluten, [[cookbook:xanthan gum|xanthan gum]] is often added to gluten-free flour blends to promote an improved texture. 
Use sparingly in bread, cake and cookie recipes. Xanthan gum is the fermentation product of the bacteria ''Xanthomonas campestris''.

Celiacs who cannot tolerate Xanthan gum, due to corn allergy or trehalose intolerance, must find other alternatives.

=== Other binders and gums ===

Xanthan gum is the most popular binding agent, but others can be used too.  These include [[cookbook:soy lecithin|soy lecithin]], [[cookbook:guar gum|guar gum]], [[Cookbook:carageenan|carageenan]], agar, [[cookbook:carob|carob]] (locust bean) gum, gum Arabic/acacia, fenugreek gum, tara gum, konjac gum, tragacanth gum, slippery elm powder, and even [[Cookbook:gelatin|gelatin]] and pectin.  Methyl Cellulose (MC) and Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose(HPMC) are commonly found in processed and package goods. These agents are often used in combination with each other.

=== Tapioca starch ===

[[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|Tapioca starch]] is a thickening agent often used in [[cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese foods]] and gum candies.  This starch is derived from [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]] (aka manioc) roots; it is the same tapioca as in [[Cookbook:Tapioca Pearls|tapioca pearls]], or tapioca pudding. Best used in combination with other gluten-free flours.

=== Chickpea Flour ===

[[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|Flour made from chickpeas]], a popular alternative to gluten flours.  This flour is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]] and can often be found in Indian or Asian grocery stores, sometimes labelled &quot;besan&quot;.  It has an unpleasant taste when raw but has a good approximation of wheat flour's texture when cooked.  Unfortunately, some may find that it promotes flatulence.

=== Sorghum Flour ===

[[Cookbook:Sorghum|Sorghum flour]] (also known as sweet sorghum or jowar) makes an excellent wheat flour substitute in quick-leavened baked goods such as muffins or banana bread. It is ground from the small, millet-like grains of the sorghum plant (used to make sorghum syrup). Sweet white sorghum flour is a pale pinkish-brown in color and has a pleasant, faintly sweet and grassy taste. It is best combined with a gluten-free starch such as cornstarch or tapioca and creates a fine crumb, good texture.

=== Skim Milk Powder ===

Gluten-free bread recipes often contain [[cookbook:skim milk powder|skim milk powder]].  It adds protein and also has beneficial effects on the end product.  The casein in milk makes it a good emulsifier, and it makes for a finer crumb and better consistency. People who are allergic to dairy can try substituting [[cookbook:Soy Milk Powder|soy milk powder]], but the results will not be as good.

=== Soya flour ===

[[Cookbook:Soya flour|Soya flour]] is also often added to gluten-free bread recipes to add protein.

== Tips: ==

Base meals around whole foods that are naturally gluten-free, such as [[Cookbook:Meat and Poultry|meat, chicken]], or [[Cookbook:fish|fish]], eggs, potatoes or rice, and plenty of fresh [[cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s, salad and [[Cookbook:fruit|fruit]].

When cooking gluten free, it is simplest to look for dishes that require the least customization.  A pasta dish may only require the substitution of a rice pasta, for instance.  Soups may only require a substitution for thickening (rice flour, cornstarch, or potatoes also thicken soup). Gravies and sauces can be made using [[cookbook:arrowroot starch|arrowroot starch]] or sweet rice flour instead of wheat flour. Recipes calling for bread crumbs may be translated into gluten-free by using leftover gluten-free breads and crackers, and even baked items, processed into crumbs. Cooked rice or potatoes may also be substituted in many recipes calling for bread crumbs.

Sandwiches can be made with [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortilla]]s (grilled tuna melts, Mexican-style quesadillas, turkey and cheese, refried beans) -- though the ingredients label of commercial tortillas should be checked, as some commercial firms include wheat flour in apparently &quot;corn&quot; tortillas -- and also with salad leaf wraps (Boston and Romaine lettuce wrapped around filling such as egg salad, tuna, turkey, ham and Swiss, etc.), and moistened [[cookbook:Rice Wafer|rice paper]] wraps.

Cuisines from cultures that rely less on wheat can simplify menu planning. Many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]], [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]], [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South American]], [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle-Eastern]] and [[Cookbook:Fusion cuisines|Pacific Fusion]] recipes use no gluten containing ingredients.

Cakes, cookies and brownies can be made with a mix of alternative flours; including nut meal. Nut meal/flours can lower the carbohydrate content in a recipe, and up the protein that is often lacking in alternative starches and gluten-free flours. Other higher protein gluten-free flours include [[cookbook:quinoa|quinoa]], [[Cookbook:buckwheat|buckwheat]], [[Cookbook:soy|soy]], and [[Cookbook:amaranth|amaranth]].

Cookies depend more on the physical properties of sugar than on the characteristics of gluten.  Substitute any gluten-free flour or blend for wheat flour on a cup-for-cup basis, but refrigerate the dough at least two hours before baking.

Cakes also depend heavily on sugar.  Add starches and possibly some guar gum until you find an effective balance.

Pies require a gluten-free crust, and possibly a new thickening agent for the filling. Use packaged gluten-free cookies to create a crumb crust.

Flatbreads such as pancakes are relatively easy to produce with the right starches and gums.  Loaves are more difficult, as they need some strong, elastic gel-like behavior for the air bubbles.  
Xanthan gum produces an acceptable loaf, if the gum is tolerated.  If Xanthan gum cannot be tolerated, try gelatin, chia seeds/meal, and/or flaxseed meal in combination with gluten-free starches and flours.

== Grocery Shopping ==

=== Avoid ===

Avoid these ingredients:

;[[Cookbook:Bulgur|Bulgur]]
:Bulgur is wheat that's been cracked and steamed. (Note: A good substitute for bulgur, in dishes such as tabouleh, is cooked [[cookbook:quinoa|quinoa]].)

;[[Cookbook:Couscous|Couscous]]
:Couscous are actually tiny round pasta spheres, and outside of Africa, couscous is almost always made from wheat flour. (Again, a good substitute is cooked quinoa, or cooked millet.)

;[[Cookbook:Durum|Durum]] and [[cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]]
:These are specific strains of wheat.

;[[Cookbook:Modified Food Starch|Modified Food Starch]] 
:May be made from cornstarch OR wheat starch. Look for products which specify &quot;corn starch&quot; instead.

;[[cookbook:Spelt|Spelt]] and [[Cookbook:Kamut|Kamut]]/QK-77
:These are species of wheat. (Other names include spelta, Polish wheat, einkorn, and small spelt.)

;[[Cookbook:Triticale|Triticale]]
:This is a grain cross-bred from wheat and rye.

=== Caution ===

Use these ingredients with caution:

;[[Cookbook:Buckwheat|Buckwheat]] 
:Buckwheat is completely unrelated to wheat, and contains no gluten. However, buckwheat flour is reportedly often contaminated with wheat. To avoid wheat in your buckwheat, one alternative is to buy only whole-grain buckwheat, and check it before using the same way you would check your raw beans for a stone. Buckwheat grains are small and triangular, and a wheat grain will stand out like a sore thumb.  Another way is to use only buckwheat flour that has been tested for gluten. Bob's Red Mill no longer has gluten free buckwheat flour.

;[[Cookbook:Oats|Oats]] 
:Oats are biologically unrelated to wheat, and do not contain ''wheat'' gluten.  People with a simple wheat intolerance may have no trouble with uncontaminated oats, unless they have a separate allergy to oats. However, some people with celiac disease also report sensitivity to oats.  There's an ongoing controversy over whether or not people with celiac disease can or should eat oats.  See [http://www.celiac.com/st_main.html?p_catid=14  celiac.com] for a summary of some of the research.  Note that commercial oats may be contaminated with wheat; some people think this risk is higher for oats because their grains resemble wheat grains in size and shape, some people think the risk of oat contamination is the same as for any other gluten-free flour.  It comes down to an individual decision.  Oat flour is not a key ingredient in gluten-free baking, but rolled oats are a nutritious, delicious, versatile, and easily available food.

=== Check ===

Check the label on these ingredients:

;[[Cookbook:Baking Powder|Baking powder]]
:Some baking powders, especially in the United Kingdom, use wheat flour or starch as a carrier for the reactive ingredients.  Check the label for a baking powder that uses cornstarch.

=== Soup ===

*Amy's Kitchen produces gluten-free soup in cans. Amy's tests every batch of gluten free products to 20ppm to ensure that they are Gluten Free.
*Campbell's Soups are not gluten-free; wheat is used as a thickener.
*Pacific and Imagine soups produce many gluten-free broths and soups packaged in cartons.
*Progresso soups label foods that contain the top allergens such as wheat, milk, eggs, soy, etc.; some are gluten-free. Always read ingredient labels. Pearled barley is barley, and is not gluten-free.
*Thai Kitchen produces soup in cans and rice noodle/broth packages; many are gluten-free, always check labels.

&lt;!-- Start Here --&gt;
&lt;!--
:''Give four different uses of computers.''

:''2. Give three examples of programming languages and what types of programming they are used for.''

Some possible examples:
*[[w:HTML|HTML]] is used to make webpages.
*[[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]] is used to make webpages more dynamic.
*[[Programming:C_plus_plus|C++]] is used to make large and complex programs and operating systems, such as Windows and Linux.
*[[w:Befunge|Befunge]] is not used by anybody.

To learn about the vast number of programming languages not listed here, see [[w:List of programming languages|List of programming languages]]

:''3. Describe a source program and an object program.''

Historically, a &quot;source program&quot; really refers to what is more commonly referred to today as source code, or the human readable instructions written by the programmer(s).With 
traditional programming languages, source code needs to be transformed or compiled into an &quot;object program&quot; which is a machine readable (binary executable) file. 

With some newer languages, including Javascript and HTML, the source is compiled in a realtime basis, or &quot;on the fly&quot; and does not require pre-compiling.

==Requirement 3==
:''Show how the following may be stored in computer memory: text, numbers, pictures, and sound.''

See [[w:Computer storage|Computer storage]]

==Requirement 5==
:''Do TWO of the following:''

:''1. Visit a business or industry that uses computers. Study what the computer accomplishes and be prepared to discuss what you observed.''
:''2. Use a computer attached to a local area network or equipped with a modem to connect to a computer network or bulletin-board service such as Prodigy, CompuServe, or America Online. Send a message to someone on the network or download a program or file from the network.''


:''3. Use a general-purpose programming language to write a program application of your choice, subject to approval by your counselor.''

See [[w:List of programming languages]] a good overview of the languages out there. Some good ones to start with are [[QBasic]], [[C++]] and [[PHP]].

==Requirement 6==
:''Be prepared to discuss several terms used in each of the following categories:''
:''1. Input/output devices''

==How much would I weigh on ...==
Why did you change all of these sections? To say that one would weigh the same on Pluto as on the Earth is wrong (as you clearly know) and misleading. Please revert. (en user zeimusu wasn't logged in to write this)

:Nonsense!  It is not wrong, not as the English word &quot;weight&quot; is quite properly and legitimately used in the medical sciences and in sports, the primary reasons we weigh ourselves.  Didn't you even read it?  What specifically do you think is in error in my explanations?

:You know damn well that people around the world (even most hospitals in the United States) weigh themnselves in kilograms.  You know that kilograms are units of mass.  You know that those kilograms do not change when you go to another planet.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:25, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I think that the point of the question about weight is to show that other planets have different gravitional forces from Earth, so we should use units that would vary in different gravitional fields like Newtons. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 08:07, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::Unless you teach the teachers as well as the students, you are going to have lots of damn fool teachers telling them that those newtons are the units they should normally be using to measure their weight.  That is not true.  We do not use newtons, and we should not use them, for the normal purposes for which we measure our weight, for health and fitness purposes.  The pounds (mass) and kilograms which we do use for this are the proper units for this purpose.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 09:20, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::[[w:Weight|Weight]] is not the same as [[w:mass|mass]]. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:20, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::It is more often than it is not.  But yes, there are also many times when they are not the same.  Maybe you just didn't read your own references very well?  Of course, for the second, you might also need to follow that link given on the first line of the article you linked to, to [[w:mass (disambiguation)|mass]] in this disambiguation entry.
::::Most relevant to the discussion above, they may even be different from each other &quot;in the doctor's office&quot;, but the &quot;weight&quot; there is the same thing as &quot;mass&quot; in a physics laboratory, and &quot;mass&quot; there has a couple of other meanings as well as seen in my link above, different from that quantity called &quot;mass&quot; in a physics lab and called &quot;weight&quot; in a doctor's office.  Both are ambiguous words, each with several different meanings. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 18:12, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::::I take issue with several of your statements from above: 1)&quot;...weigh themnselves in kilograms. &quot; However, this misses the fact that kilograms are measured with a balance, while pounds are measured on a scale. Scales are most often spring-loaded, and therefore act as a measurement of force. Standing on a scale on the moon will give you a different ''weight''. standing on a balance on the moon would give you the same ''mass''. 2) &quot;Both are ambiguous words&quot; They are only ambiguous if you redefine them every time you forget to use the proper word for the quantity you are trying to describe. 3) Also, whether people measure the quantity of fat that they have (mass), or the downward force that pulls at their fat (weight) does not matter, but the fact that people frequently use both does not make the quantites eqivalent.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:57, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::What????!!
::::::First of all, the terms &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; are not two mutually exclusive sets of objects.  The term scale is generally a broader term; it includes balances.  With an adjective, you might narrow down the group of &quot;scales&quot; under discussion.
::::::Second, the people who weigh themselves in kilograms and the people who weigh themselves in pounds (who can, of course, in some cases be the same people) do not do anything one bit differently when they weigh themselves.  Furthermore, the weighing can often be the same scale; it might be two different dials on a bathroom spring scale or on one of those balances with a dial readout (HONEST WEIGHT, NO SPRINGS) you still sometimes see in public places, though they used to be more common.  It can also be done on the platform type beam balance in my local doctor's office; the main beam can be flipped over, giving you a different set of detents for the weights to fit into.  On many modern electronic scales with built-in microprocessors, the display can often be changed by pushing a button.  
::::::Hospital scales are calibrated on site; with people often transferred between hospitals, or to different floors on the same hospital, they want comparable medical records.  There is absolutely nothing different in the way that they are calibrated for a readout in pounds from the way they are calibrated for a readout in kilograms, or for a readout in either or both units, as is often the case.  

::::::If you wonder how accurate your bathroom scale is, and many people often do, it is quite common to compare its reading to a generally more accurate one from the doctor's office or the gym, where the scale is more likely to be calibrated for accurate readings (readings of mass, never for accurate readings of force).  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:32, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

The original definition of weight, still in common use today, is synonymous with mass.  Before the spring scale was invented (era of Isaac Newton), things were always '''weighed''' on balances.  This weighing is a measure of mass.

In physics-speak, weight is defined as the force caused by an acceleration acting on a mass.  When we are talking about weighing ourselves on a spring scale in our bathroom, the acceleration is the one due to gravity (Less the &quot;centrifugal&quot; force and the buoyancy of the atmosphere, of course).  The bathroom scale is calibrated to show us mass in pounds or kg, if we use it on the Earth's surface (not underwater, though).

In everyday-speak, weight is the amount of flour in a sack.  Before Newton, there was no real way to talk about the force caused by the acceleration due to gravity acting on a mass.  There were also no spring scales -- they were invented in the same era.  And, before Newton, nobody was testing weight, mass, balances, and spring scales by going to the moon.

[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Gene_Nygaard/weight.htm Gene Nygaard's Weight page] has a nice discussion.  Wikipedia's [[w:Weight|Weight]] is coming around to a balanced presentation of the older, common usage and the more recent definition dreamed up by physicists.

The confusion/disussion/argument comes, I think, because the word &quot;weight&quot; means two different things in two different contexts.  If we took a balance scale around the universe, we would weigh the same any place a balance scale can work (original definition).  But, if we use a spring scale, we would see that our weight (physicist's definition; force) varies on different planets.  

Too bad the early physicists didn't come up with a new word to use instead of weight!  Is this whole debate Newton's fault?

&quot;Weight is different from mass&quot; is true in the context of astronomy or astrophysics, but not in &quot;everyday&quot; life. Of course, the everyday life of a physicist may be a lot different from the everyday life of a grocer.

The challenge, in [[Wikijunior Solar System]], is to present to kids, using words they can understand, the idea that they would feel heavier or lighter on other planets, even though their mass is unchanged. Just saying &quot;if you weighed yourself on a bathroom scale&quot; may be enough.  We don't have to explain, in every little section, that if they weighed themselves on their doctor's-office balance, they would weigh the same. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:28, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

==Scales problem, 81 kg answer==

Exactly how is 81Kg correct for [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Scales and Weights/Solution 2|Scales_and_Weights_Solution_2]]? The total mass of all the masses is 80Kg. Please clarify how you could distinguish between 81 Kg and/or any other higher value. [[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] July 4, 2005 23:27 (UTC)

:In assessing your change, I was just going by the numbers I had seen as the bottom line in the linked page, when I had visited it earlier in the day.  I did not follow it to see that you had just changed that page as well; and I did not double-check the calculations on that page when I had visited it earlier.  I just assumed incorrectly that the reason you had changed it is that you had imagined some symmetry between the links to 40 kg and to 80 kg answers.

:So you appear to be right, and I apologize for the reversion.  Go ahead, fix that one again.  It wasn't my answer in the first place, and the only reason I had the page containing the link on my watchlist was because I had edited it earlier in the day.  But just don't use &quot;Kg&quot; or I'll have to come back and fix that, too; the only acceptable symbol for kilograms is &quot;kg&quot;.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 5 July 2005 05:35 (UTC)

== Where to put the Proofreading Plan ==

There are many ways to create a page for discussing the pros and cons of the proofreading plan I proposed.  

Please be bold. Create a subpage or move the page to the main name space. 

Start the discussion.  Improve the proofreading process.

Thanks

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 13:54, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:I raised the problem and deferred to you or others involved in setting this up, because somebody knows better than I do how everything is arranged.
:I had looked for it (at least on other proofreading pages), but didn't see the link, at the top of the page I edited for a page, which was set aside for discussion.
:I think all the actual plan subpages should be in separate &quot;Module&quot; rather than &quot;Talk&quot; pages, with an overview proofreading page including general discussion of the plan, and specifics about the detailed subpages could then be discussed on the corresponding talk page.
:I don't have a good picture of the map of these pages; you are in a better position to do the rearranging, or explain to me exactly what the arrangement is now, and how the pages re linked together.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:03, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::BTW, I have added some comments at [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading/discussion]].

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before.  I have been busy with other things, of course.  We are all volunteers here. What I want to say to you is -- be bold.  If you think you can make big improvements by moving pages around, I think you should go for it.  Study the situation first.  Create a sandbox book which exists solely to be reorganized in a variety of ways, and apply what you learn to the work in progress.  Finish up by making sure that the newly-reorganized book and all of its supporting pages is still properly interconnected.

Be bold! If you have a good idea of how to cut, organize, and rearrange information to create the 48-page printed wikibook, please make a start of it!  Start a brand new book, the &quot;Wikijunior Solar System Booklet&quot;.  Once we finish proofreading a module of [[Wikijunior Solar System]], you can move it to the Booklet and start removing pieces of it.

I had no standing at wikibooks when I started editing.  I demonstrated my good intentions by doing some work on the book as it was.  Then I proposed the proofreading plan because I thought some kind of plan would help.  When nobody altered or opposed the plan, I plastered it all over the place.  Now people treat it like it is obviously the way to work.  They treat me like some kind of expert on editing books.  I am not. 

You could have the same kind of influence on the way things are done.  Make a plan. Propose the plan to others.  Ask them to improve it.  Start using it in a small way.  Refine it.  Introduce it in a big way. If you succeed in leading people toward a better book, people should be happy with the change. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:04, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity]] ==

Hello. Re using &quot;bulky&quot; in the above, I realise it's not as accurate a word as &quot;mass&quot;, but I'm trying to avoid using &quot;mass&quot; (and units, etc) so this version of the module might remain as uncontroversial as possible. I'm intrigued that you altered only the final instance.

With say a couple of illustrations and a table, do you think this version of the module is a starter?

{{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Vectors}} supplies a container (''Vector'') which can store any [[ada Programming/Subtypes#Definite_subtype|definite subtype]] in a consecutive list. This makes an {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Vectors}}.Vector similar to an array - however a Vector can change size after it has been declared, which an array can't do.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada encourages the division of code into separate modules called ''packages''. Each package can contain any combination of items.

Some of the benefits of using packages are:
* package contents are placed in a separate namespace, preventing naming collisions,
* implementation details of the package can be hidden from the programmer (information hiding),
* object orientation requires defining a type and its primitive subprograms within a package, and
* packages can be separately compiled.

Some of the more common package usages are:
* a group of related subprograms along with their shared data, with the data not visible outside the package,
* one or more data types along with subprograms for manipulating those data types, and
* a generic package that can be instantiated under varying conditions.

The following is a quote from the current Ada Reference Manual {{Ada/RM|7|title=Packages. RM 7(1)}}

{{quote|Packages are program units that allow the specification of groups of logically related entities. Typically, a package contains the declaration of a type (often a private type or private extension) along with the declaration of primitive subprograms of the type, which can be called from outside the package, while their inner workings remain hidden from outside users.}}

== Separate compilation ==

It is very common for package declarations and package bodies to be coded into separate files and separately compiled. Doing so places the package at the ''library level'' where it will be accessible to all other code via the '''with''' statement&amp;mdash;if a more restricted scope is desired, simply declare the package (and package body, if needed) within the appropriate scope. The package body can itself be divided into multiple files by specifying that one or more subprogram implementations are '''separate'''.

One of the biggest advantages of Ada over most other programming languages is its well defined system of modularization and separate compilation. Even though Ada allows separate compilation, it maintains the strong type checking among the various compilations by enforcing rules of compilation order and compatibility checking. Ada uses separate compilation (like [[w:Modula-2|Modula-2]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]] and [[w:C Sharp programming language|C#]]), and not independent compilation (as [[w:C programming language|C]]/[[w:C++|C++]] does), in which the various parts are compiled with no knowledge of the other compilation units with which they will be combined.

A note to C/C++ users: Yes, you can use the preprocessor to emulate separate compilation &amp;mdash; but it is only an emulation and the smallest mistake leads to very hard to find bugs. It is telling that all C/C++ successor languages including [[w:D_programming_language|D]] have turned away from the independent compilation and the use of the preprocessor.

So it's good to know that Ada has had separate compilation ever since Ada-83 and is probably the most sophisticated implementation around.

== Parts of a package ==

A package generally consists of two parts, the specification and the body. A package specification can be further divided in two logical parts, the visible part and the private part. Only the visible part of the specification is mandatory. The private part of the specification is optional, and a package specification might not have a package body&amp;mdash;the package body only exists to complete any ''incomplete'' items in the specification. Subprogram declarations are the most common ''incomplete'' items. There must not be a package body if there is no incomplete declaration, and there has to be a package body if there is some incomplete declaration in the specification.

To understand the value of the three-way division, consider the case of a package that has already been released and is in use. A change to the visible part of the specification will require that the programmers of all using software verify that the change does not affect the using code. A change to the private part of the declaration will require that all using code be recompiled but no review is normally needed. Some changes to the private part can change the meaning of the client code however. An example is changing a private record type into a private access type. This change can be done with changes in the private part, but change the semantic meaning of assignment in the clients code. A change to the package body will only require that the file containing the package body be recompiled, because ''nothing'' outside of the package body can ever access anything within the package body (beyond the declarations in the specification part).

A common usage of the three parts is to declare the existence of a type and some subprograms that operate on that type in the visible part, define the actual structure of the type (e.g. as a record) in the private part, and provide the code to implement the subprograms in the package body.

=== The package specification &amp;mdash; the visible part ===

The visible part of a package specification describes all the subprogram specifications, variables, types, constants etc. that are visible to anyone who wishes to use the package.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Public_Only_Package {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Range_10 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Public_Only_Package;

Since Range_10 is an integer type, there are a lot of operations declared implicitly in this package.

=== The private part ===

The private part of a package serves two purposes:
* To complete the deferred definition of private types and constants.
* To export entities only visible to the children of the package

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Package_With_Private {{Ada/kw|is}}
      
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 10) {{Ada/kw|of}} Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Package_With_Private;

Since the type is private, clients cannot make any use of it as long as there are no operations defined in the visible part.

=== The package body ===

The package body defines the implementation of the package. All the subprograms defined in the specification have to be implemented in the body. New subprograms, types and objects can be defined in the body that are not visible to the users of the package.
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Package_With_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Set_A (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Basic_Record;
                     An_A : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Integer);
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_A (This : Basic_Record) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}} 
          A : Integer;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}} ;
 
    {{Ada/pragma|Pure_Function}}  (Get_A);  -- not a standard Ada pragma
    {{Ada/pragma|Inline}} (Get_A);
    {{Ada/pragma|Inline}} (Set_A);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Package_With_Body;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Package_With_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Set_A (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Basic_Record;
                     An_A : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Integer) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       This.A := An_A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Set_A;
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_A (This : Basic_Record) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} This.A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Get_A;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Package_With_Body;

; {{Ada/pragma|Pure_Function}}: Only available when using [[w:GNAT|GNAT]].

=== Two Flavors of Package ===

The packages above each define a type together with operations of the type.
When the type's composition is placed in the private part of a
package, the package then exports what is known to be
an [[w:Abstract_data_type|Abstract Data Type]] or ADT for short.
Objects of the type are then constructed by calling one of the subprograms
associated with the respective type.

A different kind of package is the Abstract State Machine or ASM.
A package will be modeling a single item of the problem domain, such as the
motor of a car. If a program controls one car, there is typically
just one motor, or ''the'' motor. The public part of the package specification
only declares the operations of the module (of the motor, say), but no type.
All data of the module are hidden in the body of the package
where they act as state variables to be queried, or
manipulated by the subprograms of the package.
The initialization part sets the state variables to their initial values.

 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Package_With_Body{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} {{Ada/keyword|body}} Package_With_Body {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    The_A{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Set_A {{Ada/delimiter|(}}An_A {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|begin}}

 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
 
    The_A {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Package_With_Body{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

(A note on construction:
The package initialization part after {{Ada/kw|begin}} corresponds to a construction subprogram
of an ADT package. 
However, as a state machine ''is'' an “object” already, “construction” is
happening during package initialization.
(Here it sets the state variable &lt;tt&gt;The_A&lt;/tt&gt; to its initial value.)
An ASM package can be viewed as a [[w:Singleton_pattern|singleton]].)

== Using packages ==

{{sectstub}}

To utilize a package it's needed to name it in a '''with''' clause, whereas to have direct visibility of that package it's needed to name it in a '''use''' clause.

For C++ programmers, Ada's '''with''' clause is analogous to the C++ preprocessor's '''#include''' and Ada's '''use''' is similar to the '''using namespace''' statement in C++.  In particular, '''use''' leads to the same namespace pollution problems as '''using namespace''' and thus should be used sparingly.  Renaming can shorten long compound names to a manageable length, while the '''use type''' clause makes a type's operators visible.  These features reduce the need for plain '''use'''.

=== Standard with ===

The standard with clause provides visibility for the public part of a unit to the following defined unit. The imported package can be used in any part of the defined unit, including the body when the clause is used in the specification.

=== Private with ===

=== Making operators visible ===

Suppose you have a package Universe that defines some numeric type T.

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}  {{Ada/comment| illegal}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

This program fragment is illegal since the operators implicitly defined in Universe are not directly visible.

You have four choices to make the program legal.

Use a use_package_clause. This makes &lt;b&gt;all declarations&lt;/b&gt; in Universe directly visible (provided they are not hidden because of other homographs).

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|use}}  Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Use renaming. This is error prone since if you rename many operators, cut and paste errors are probable.

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   {{Ada/keyword|function}} &quot;*&quot; {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Left{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Right{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/keyword|renames}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}&quot;*&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|function}} &quot;/&quot; {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Left{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Right{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/keyword|renames}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}&quot;*&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|;}}  {{Ada/comment| oops}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Use qualification. This is extremely ugly and unreadable.

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}&quot;*&quot; {{Ada/delimiter|(}}V{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Use the use_type_clause. This makes only the &lt;b&gt;operators&lt;/b&gt; in Universe directly visible.

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|use}} {{Ada/keyword|type}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

There is a special beauty in the use_type_clause. Suppose you have a set of packages like so:

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Pack {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   {{Ada/keyword|subtype}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} Universe{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}  {{Ada/comment| illegal}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Now you've got into trouble. Since Universe is not made visible, you cannot use a use_package_clause for Universe to make the operator directly visible, nor can you use qualification for the same reason. Also a use_package_clause for Pack does not help, since the operator is not defined in Pack.
The effect of the above construct means that the operator is not nameable, i.e. it cannot be renamed in a renaming statement.

Of course you can add Universe to the context clause, but this may be impossible due to some other reasons (e.g. coding standards); also adding the operators to Pack may be forbidden or not feasible. So what to do?

The solution is simple. Use the use_type_clause for Pack.T and all is well!

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   V{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|use}} {{Ada/keyword|type}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|.}}T{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   V {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} V {{Ada/operator|*}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

== Package organisation ==

{{sectstub}}

=== Nested packages ===

A nested package is a package declared inside a package.
Like a normal package, it has a public part and a private part.
From outside, items declared in a nested package N
will have visibility as usual; the
programmer may refer to these items using a full dotted name like
&lt;code&gt;P.N.X&lt;/code&gt;. (But not &lt;code&gt;P.M.Y&lt;/code&gt;.)

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} P {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    D{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/comment| a nested package:}}
    {{Ada/keyword|package}} N {{Ada/keyword|is}}
       X{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|private}}
       Foo{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} N{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    E{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|private}}
    {{Ada/comment| another nested package:}}
    {{Ada/keyword|package}} M {{Ada/keyword|is}}
       Y{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|private}}
       Bar{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} M{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} P{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Inside a package, declarations become visible as they are introduced, in textual order.
That is, a nested package N that is declared ''after'' some other declaration D can refer to this declaration D.
A declaration E following N can refer to items of N&lt;ref&gt;For example,
&lt;code&gt;E: Integer := D + N.X;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
But neither can “look ahead” and refer to any declaration that
goes after them.
For example, spec &lt;code&gt;N&lt;code&gt; above cannot refer to &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; in any way.

In the following example, a type is derived in both of the two nested packages &lt;tt&gt;Disks&lt;/tt&gt;
and &lt;tt&gt;Books&lt;/tt&gt;.
Notice that the full declaration of parent type &lt;tt&gt;Item&lt;/tt&gt; appears before the two
nested packages.

A package may also be nested inside a subprogram. In fact, packages can be declared
in any declarative part, including those of a block.

=== Child packages ===

Ada allows one to extend the functionality of a unit (package) with so-called children (child packages).
With certain exceptions, all the functionality of the parent is available to a child.
This means that all public and private declarations of the parent package are visible to
all child packages.
 
The above example, reworked as a hierarchy of packages, looks like this. Notice that
the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Unbounded}} is not needed by the top
level package &lt;tt&gt;Shelf&lt;/tt&gt;, hence its with clause doesn't appear here. (We have added a
match function for searching a shelf, though):

The name of a child package consists of the parent unit's name followed by the
child package's identifier, separated by a period (dot) `{{Ada/delimiter|.}}'.

&lt;tt&gt;Book&lt;/tt&gt; has two components of type &lt;tt&gt;Unbounded_String&lt;/tt&gt;,
so {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Unbounded}} appears in a with clause of the child package.
This is unlike the nested packages case which requires that all
units needed by any one of the nested packages be listed in the context clause of the enclosing package
(see {{Ada/2005/RM3|10|1|2|Context Clauses - With Clauses}}).
Child packages thus give better control over package dependences. With clauses are more local.

The new child package &lt;tt&gt;Shelf.Disks&lt;/tt&gt; looks similar. The &lt;tt&gt;Boxes&lt;/tt&gt; package which was
a nested package in the private part of the original &lt;tt&gt;Shelf&lt;/tt&gt; package is moved to a private
child package:

 {{Ada/keyword|private}} {{Ada/keyword|package}} Shelf{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Boxes {{Ada/keyword|is}}
     {{Ada/keyword|type}} Treasure{{Ada/delimiter|(}}Identifier{{Ada/delimiter|:}} ID{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|limited}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Shelf{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Boxes{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The privacy of the package means that it can only be used by equally private client
units. These clients include private siblings and also the bodies of siblings
(as bodies are never public).

Child packages may be listed in context clauses just like normal packages.
A {{Ada/keyword|with}} of a child also 'withs' the parent.

=== Subunits ===

A subunit is just a feature to move a body into a place of its own when otherwise the enclosing body will become too large. It can also be used for limiting the scope of context clauses.

The subunits allow to physically divide a package into different compilation units without breaking the logical unity of the package. Usually each separated subunit goes to a different file allowing separate compilation of each subunit and independent version control history for each one.

  {{Ada/keyword|package}} {{Ada/keyword|body}} Pack {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Proc {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|separate}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|end}} Pack{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Abstract ==
Wikipedia, an international project that uses Wiki software to
collaboratively create an encyclopaedia, is becoming more and more popular.
Everyone can directly edit articles and every edit is recorded. The
version history of all articles is freely available and allows a
multitude of examinations. This research-in-progress paper gives an
overview on Wikipedia research. Wikipedia’s fundamental components that
are articles, authors, edits, and links are analysed as well as content
and quality. Possibilities of research are explored including examples
and first results. Several characteristics that are found in Wikipedia,
such as exponential growth and scale-free networks, structures which are all known
in other contexts however the Wiki architecture also possesses some intrinsic
specialities. General trends are measured that are typical for all
Wikipedias but vary between languages in detail.

== Conclusions ==
There is still little research about Wikipedia and Wikis. This
research-in-progress paper presented a first overview on Wikipedia
research. After a linear phase, Wikipedias grow exponentially with
different rates per language. The growth rate of the number of articles
is typically smaller than other ratios. Different Wikipedias can be
compared with simple methods such as counting growth rates, namespaces
and article types. Article sizes are lognormal distributed with a linear
growing median. For articles with 5 or more distinct authors its number
follows a power law as well as the number of distinct articles per
author. More detailed methods for measuring edits exist. Because every
Wikipedia article covers a single concept and links to related ones, you
can derive thesaurus-like structures out of the network of articles.
The network is scale-free on internal links, external links and broken links. There
are many possibilities for deeper investigation, especially regarding
quality and content. Like Wikimedia &lt;!---media or pedia? ---&gt; itself, its research is in the very
beginning but very promising.</text>

Storyboards are drawings of the sequence of shots for a script. It helps to pre-visualize how the director wants the screenplay to be shot. As an image says more than a thousand words it is very useful as a basis to communicate the director's ideas to the crew and the producers. Some directors will storyboard every scene and camera angle to save time and money when they are on set. Others however feel that this can inhibit their creativity and will have very few graphic representations done before shooting commences.

==Getting Started==

To get an idea of how you can storyboard your movie, grab a comic book off the shelf at a bookstore. Many large productions will have storyboards that are somewhere between stick-man quality and full comic book illustrations. If you can draw fairly well yourself, it may seem tedious, but you will gain a lot from trying to draw out a few of the most complex sequences. Every time you storyboard you will take that moment to see the shot through the camera. It's a heck of a lot less expensive than having a cast and crew waiting for you to &quot;discover your vision&quot; right there on the spot.

For the definitions of some of the concepts please refer to [[cinematography]]. Storyboarding is mainly there to get a first idea of what the film will look like. It gives indications of the size of the shot, the camera angle and the sequence of the shots. It is rarely followed exactly but it is a helpful guideline during the shooting of a film.  It's very common while a crew is tearing down all the lighting rigs and moving to the next shot, the Director and DP will be looking at the storyboard trying decide what is best before everything needs to be placed. Since they have those plans, they are more capable of improvising. 

The main areas where storyboarding is regarded as essential are in the planning of elaborate stunts, special effects sequences and designing make-up and costumes.

==Animatic==

An animatic is a movie which has been edited from the storyboards.  Animatics are useful for determining the timing of a shot, particularly an expensive shot such as an effects shot.

==Software==


1.  '''Thumbnails''' are storyboards no bigger than a thumbnail.  There is little detail in thumbnail storyboards.  Each person's head is represented by a circle.  Thumbnails are done with pencil and paper.


2.  There are '''2D storyboard programs''' such as [http://www.storyboardquick.com StoryBoard Quick] and [http://www.storyboardartist.com StoryBoard Artist].  They are fast ways to make high quality storyboards.

3.  There are '''3D storyboarding programs''' such as [http://www.frameforge3d.com FrameForge 3D Studio], Antics (which is no longer in business) and [http://sketchup.google.com SketchUp Pro].  Designed for creating storyboards, these programs can be faster than the other kinds of 3D animation software.  Free limited demo versions of FrameForge 3D Studio and SketchUp are available.  

4.  There are many kinds of '''3D animation programs''' which work for creating accurate shots such as Blender 3d, Maya, 3D Studio Max, and Lightwave 3D.  There is a free version of Maya for non-commercial use called [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=7639525 Personal Learning Edition].

5. There are '''specialized 3D animation programs''' such as [http://my.smithmicro.com/dr/poser.html Poser] and [http://www.daz3D.com DAZ Studio] (freeware) which use 3D figures called '''digital puppets''' or '''Poser models'''.  Use predefined figures is much faster than creating your own figures.   Digital puppets that work with Poser and DAZ studio are inexpensive ($12 to $100).  The advantage of creating storyboards with these programs is you can use the same lens that the camera will use.  That can be valuable for effects shots.

6. If you are storyboarding for 3D animation, there is a program called [http://www.redboard.tv Redboard] which allows you to quickly draw in 2D over accurate 3d models, then export your cameras to Maya. A valuable time-saver if you're thinking about working in 3D.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Piezoelectric actuators are actuators that take advantage of the piezoelectric effect found in certain materials.

=== Piezoelectric Effect ===
[[Image:Piezoeletriceffect.jpg|thumb|264px|The piezoelectric effect as shown when an electric potential is applied]]

Certain materials have a characteristic of generating an electric potential when compressed or expanded. The amount of potential across the surface is determined by the force of displacement. 

Because an electric potential is created from a change in volume, a change in temperature also has the ability of generating an electric potential.

The piezoelectric effect also has an inverse effect. When a voltage is applied to a material with piezoelectric properties, the material expands or contracts depending on the polarity of the voltage applied. The inverse piezoelectric effect is the basis of piezoelectric motors.{{ref|EEHandbook}}

==== Materials with the Piezoelectric properties ====
Piezoelectricity naturally occurs in symmetrical crystals. Piezoelectric materials can also be manufactored as ceramics.

Crystals
*Quartz
*Tourmaline
Ceramics
*Barium Titanate

More Materials can be found by going [http://www.matweb.com/search/MaterialGroupSearch.aspx here], and filtering for the piezoelectric category.

=== Piezoelectric Actuators ===

The ability to change shape when a voltage is applied can be used to displace objects. This basically allows electrical energy to be converted to mechanical energy.{{ref|elecman}}  This can be used to rotate motors or even 

==== Piezoelectric Motors ====
===== Linear =====
The concept behind a linear piezo motor is layering a stack of piezoelectric discs that will push on each other and eventually push on a surface at an angle which will propel the object forward. The distance the propeller pushes is limited, but the frequency can be very rapid. The input voltage can change the output speed and allows a great amount of accurate movements. The force exerted is minimal and lessens the worry of breaking smaller objects.

===== Rotary =====
A rotary motor can work in the same fashion as the linear motor, except when you apply this concept at a much steeper angle to an axle, the linear motion is turned into a rotational motion. Two of these linear motors applied on both sides of a disc in the same direction can spin the disc. This is the same concept in a pitching machine used to sling baseballs.

===== Stepper =====
Using a piezoelectric material for a stepper motor can give you better precision due to the short distances involved. By placing piezoelectric motors in oppposing directions operating at frequencies that are slightly out-of-phase, the rotation is slight between the time when piezoelectric motors have the disc in a “hold” state. The slight movements and rapid response allow the rotation to be precise.

===== Squiggle Motor{{ref|squiggle}} =====

New Scale Technologies has taken this concept and applied it to a nut and bolt to create a type of screwing effect. The vibrations caused by the piezoelectric material cause the nut to exhibit a “hula hoop” effect to the threads, moving the screw up or downward depending on polarity. This can be used to push an object on a small scale very accurately.

=== Robotics Applications ===

Piezoelectric motors have the benefit of being very precise at very fast frequencies. They can also operate on a very small scale allowing robots to become smaller. Piezoelectric motors have the benefit of being able to exert a large displacement with a low driving voltage. Another benefit is the minimal amount of EMI/RFI noise created.

They can be wired in such a way to be senors as well. They can be used to determine the number of rotations, or if there is a force being exerted against a surface.

==Membranes And Lipids==
All cells, from simple prokaryotic bacteria to complex multicellular organisms are surrounded by a '''membrane'''. The membrane acts as a selective barrier, letting some substances into the cell and preventing other substances from entering,and it also actively transports substances between the inside and outside of the cell, using cellular energy to do so. This is important in regulating the concentration of many substances which must be maintained within strict limits. The cell also contains membrane bound compartments, where the membrane acts as a barrier for the separation of different environments, like lysosomes which have a high pH that would be toxic to the rest of the cell. Furthermore, lipids are polar molecules that are generally soluble in organic solvents due to large number of nonpolar bonds in lipids. Their ability to form membranes are as a result of their hydrophobic properties, which is contributed by their fatty acids. Membranes are amphipatic.

==The Lipid Bilayer==
The first person to link lipids with the cell membrane may have been Charles Ernest Overton, who was studying heredity in plants. Part of his studies involved studying which substances absorbed into plant cells most quickly. After characterizing a large number of substances, he came up with the idea that cell membranes were composed of something similar to the lipids found in vegetable oils, and that substances are absorbed into the cells by dissolving through the membrane.

The next big step came when Gorter and Grendel extracted the lipids from red blood cells and compared the surface area of the lipids spread out on water compared to the surface area of the red blood cells. They found the lipid surface area was twice that of the red blood cells, and concluded that the lipids must be arranged in a layer two lipid molecules thick. Lipid bilayer is a double layer membrane formed from phospholipids. Phospholipids are composed of a polar head group and non-polar fatty acid tails. The arrangement of the phospholipids makes the cell membrane permeable.

===Fatty Acids===
A fatty acid is a linear of carboxylic acid with a long hydrocarbon chain. In fatty acids, the non-polar hydrocarbon chain gives the molecule a non- polar character
Fatty acids usually have between 14 and 24 carbon atoms and their carbon chain may have one or more double bonds. In naturally occurring fatty acids, these double bonds are mostly in cis configuration. 
Fatty acids have both common names and systematic names. The systematic name is based on the alkane or alkene with the same number of carbon atoms, with the final ''e'' of the hydrocarbon replaced with ''oic acid'', if the carbon chain of the fatty acid is saturated (without double bond in its carbon chain), and &quot;enoic acid&quot; if there is double in its carbon chain.  For example Laurate (Figure x) [[Image:Laurate.png]] is a fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms and no double bonds, so the systematic name is dodecanoic acid, and the ionized form is dodecanoate. 
(saturated fatty acid table)
If there are double bonds, the location is marked with the symbol Δ with a superscript number indicating the location of the double bond and preceded by ''cis'' or ''trans'' to indicate configuration (but almost invariably ''cis''). Carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl end, as in Figure x, so a dodecenoate acid with a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10 would be: ''cis''-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-dodecenoate.

The number 2, 3 and last carbon atom are called the α, β and ω atoms, respectively. 


Biological fatty acids usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, with numbers of 16 and 18 being most common. The length of the fatty acid chain and the degree of saturation contributes largely to their distinct properties. The shorter the chain length and the more unsaturation in the fatty acid enhances their fluidity, thus lowering their melting point.

===Phosphoglycerides===
Phosphoglycerides are esters of two fatty acids, phosphoric acid and a trifunctional alcohol- glycerol. The fatty acids are attached to the glycerol at the 1 and 2 positions on glycerol through ester bonds.
Phosphoglycerides are composed of a glycerol back bone with substituents in the following arrangements:
* Hydroxyl #1 of glycerol is usually esterified to a saturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #2 of glycerol is usually esterified to an unsaturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #3 of glycerol is esterified to a phosphate group
[[Image:Phospholipid.svg]] 
The simplest phosphoglyceride is phosphatidate (picture). Other phosphoglycerides can be made when a group with a hydroxyl is esterified to the phosphate group of phosphatidate. There are four common substituents for phosphatidate. Serine, ethanolamine and choline are structurally similar, while inositol is different:
[[Image:Cholinemet.png]]
[[File:Inositol monochrome.svg]]

===Sphingolipids===
Sphingolipids are a second type of lipid found in cell membranes, particularly nerve cells and brain tissues. They do not contain glycerol, but retain the two alcohols with the middle position occupied by an amine and have the same overall shape as phosphoglycerides but have different chemistry, using sphingosine in place of glycerol. Sphingosine has a long hydrocarbon tail similar to fatty acids attached to a structure that is similar to the amino acid serine. A fatty acid can attach to the amine group, and a &quot;head&quot; group can attach to a hydroxyl (see Figure x). Sphingolipids are named according to this head group:
* If there is no head group it is called a ceramide
* If the head group is phosphate and choline, it is called sphingomyelin
* If the head group is a sugar, it is called a glycosphingolipid (or a glycolipid)

The majority of sphingolipids are of the third type, glycosphingolipids. It is thought they have functions in cell recognition and protection in addition to their structural role in the membrane.

===Formation Of The Bilayer===
If we compare the structures of phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids, we see that they are very similar compounds. Each lipid has two long hydrophobic hydrocarbon &quot;tails&quot; and a single polar &quot;head&quot;. Since the molecule has both polar and nonpolar moieties, it is said to be '''amphipathic'''.  It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that causes them to form bilayers, mediated by four forces:
* The hydrophobic effect- this causes the hydrophobic tails to come together. This is the strongest force driving the formation of the bilayer. It is a consequence of the increased entropy in water molecules when non polar substances are aggregated in water.
* Van der Walls forces between the hydrophobic tails.
* Electrostatic forces of the head groups.
* Hydrogen bonds between the head groups.

One possible structure that satisfies the above forces is called a '''micelle''' (pictures). This is common with free fatty acids, but not with most phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids because these groups have twice as many acyl chains per head than the fatty acid (picture), and it is difficult to pack them all into the center of the micelle. Phospholipids and sphingolipids more often form a bilayer in a sheet or a sphere (picture). This is the so called lipid bilayer.
Lipid bilayer is permeable to water molecules and other small, uncharged molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide. 
A bimolecular sheet formed by amphipathic molecules in which the hydrophobic moieties are on the inside of the sheet and the hydrophilic ones are on the aqueous outside.

===Lipid Motion===
====Studying Motion====
NMR, ESR, X-Ray, Differential scanning calorimetry
====Intramolecular Motion====
There are three basic kinds of motion within the lipid molecules: stretching between bonds, rotating between bonds, and wagging between bonds (?). [picture] 99% of motion within liquid crystal is due to rotation about carbon-carbon bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids rotate more often. This is because of the packed arrangement of the lipid bilayer. When there is rotation about one bond, an adjacent bond rotates to compensate for steric clashes [pictures]. Since double bonds in fatty acids are nearly always cis, they introduce kinks in the fatty acid. When a bond adjacent to a double bond rotates, the other bond adjacent to the double bond also rotates, and the whole thing moves like an old fashioned bit and brace [pictures]. It takes more energy to rotate the double bonds closer to the head groups due to [angle thing picture]. Double bonds react with O2 readily and create poisons [more] bacteria have [cyclopropane picture].
Furthermore, NMR rotating frame relaxation studies of the intramolecular motion in methionine-enkephalin.

====Diffusion====
One of the most notable properties of the lipid membrane is the ability of a single lipid to diffuse. This property was discovered using the &quot;fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,&quot; also known as FRAP. In this experiment, the cell surface is first labeled with a fluorescent chromophore. Afterwards, a specific region is then bleached with intense light, leaving a prominent mark. In the bleached area, the experimenters noticed that as time progressed, bleached molecules moved out from the bleached area and unbleached molecules moved towards the bleached area. This shows that the lipid bilayer allows for molecule movement within the membrane.

There are two kinds of diffusion: lateral and transverse (flip-flop). The lateral diffusion is exactly as it sounds like. In a lipid bilayer, one lipid molecule can move pass the adjacent one. The transverse molecule works a bit differently. It still displaces one over its adjacent counterpart, and crosses over to the other side of the lipid bilayer. It is important to note that the lateral diffusion is substantially faster than the transverse. Studies show that the transverse diffusion only happens once every few hours.
Diffusion is the movement of a particle from area of high concentration to low concentration, and it is not to be confused with osmosis, which is the movement of water through a semi-permeable membrane. Diffusion depends on CO2 and O2 concentrate inside and outside of alveolar sack.

==Plasma Membrane Function==
===Transportation Methods===

The membrane regulates molecule transport through a variety of means. There are two general categories that each transportation regulation falls into: passive transport and active transport. Passive transport is the movement of molecules down its concentration gradient: in other words, higher concentration to lower concentration. The diffusion of water, a special case, is called &quot;osmosis.&quot; Not all molecules can diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer. The ones that can are usually hydrophobic molecules (i.e. oxygen), nonpolar molecules (i.e. benzene), or small uncharged polar molecules (i.e. water). The hydrophobic and nonpolar molecules can dissolve through the bilayer because of the similar polarites of the bilayer and the molecule itself. The small uncharged polar molecules usually require a membrane channel to diffuse i.e. aquaporins for water. The molecules that do not pass through the layer with ease are large &amp; uncharged, polar, or ions. Examples of each are glucose, sucrose, and hydrogen ion, respectively. To sum up the defining characteristics of what passes or does not pass through the membrane, they are size, charge, and polarity.

Normally, hydrophilic molecules would not be able to cross the phospholipid bilayer due to the difference in polarities. However, it is observed that hydrophilic molecules do cross the membrane protein through a different mechanism than the hydrophobic molecules. While hydrophobic molecules diffuse through the membrane due to their similar polarities, hydrophilic molecules require a molecule called a membrane protein (integral or peripheral), which transfers the molecule in both active and passive transport. A few examples of passive transport are simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion is when a solute moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to establish equilibrium via a channel protein. Facilitated diffusion still moves from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration but instead of a channel protein, it is a carrier protein. This carrier protein, also called permeases, accelerates the rate of transport greatly. Active transport moves the molecules from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration (the opposite of passive transport). This transport moving molecules up its concentration gradient requires energy, usually from ATP (adenosine triphosphate). A common example used to explain this concept is the sodium-potassium pump. In the human cell, there is usually a high concentration of sodium on the outside the cell and a low concentration of sodium inside the cell. The opposite applies to the concentrations of potassium: high on the inside and low on the outside. The mechanism begins by sodium ion binding to the sodium-potassium pump protein with its gap close off from the cell's external environment. The binding of sodium ion signals to the cell to use convert ATP to ADP (adenosine triphosphate). This reaction will release energy and add a phosphate group to the protein, enabling the protein to change its conformation and release the bound sodium ions to the external cell environment. After the release of sodium ions, potassium ions from the same area will bind to the protein. The potassium ion binding will signal to the protein to convert the bound phosphate group to unbound inorganic phosphate and change the conformation of the protein to release the potassium ions into the cell. Afterwards, the sodium ions bind again and the cycle repeats.

A few other energy-driven processes are endocytosis and exocytosis. Endocytosis are when large molecules are transported into the cell. Exocytosis are when molecules are expelled from the cell. An example of receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs in eukaryotes. It is important for the different membranes in the cell to either join or separate in order to perform certain functions such as engulf, transport, or even release molecules essential for the body. This process is facilitated by LDL, a low-density lipoprotein. External cellular LDL float first binds to its corresponding receptor, called the LDL receptor. The cell membrane then engulfs the LDL and the LDL receptor into the cell, forming a vesicle to keep it unharmed from the cell hydrophilic environment. The complex then separates to protein and receptor counterparts. The LDL fuses with a lysosome, breaking down the LDL with the release of cholesterol as a by-product. A short example of exocytosis would be either the insulin secretion in the blood, or the transport of neurotransmitters at the gap junction during an action potential. A more specific example lies in Golgi's vesicular transport. In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sends transport vesicles to the Golgi apparatus created from proteins. Some of the vesicles fuse with the lysosomes resulting in digestion. Some of the other transport vesicles with essential proteins for the plasma membrane will diffuse in to the membrane due to their similar polarities, releasing the protein content out into the cell's environment.

Different concentrations with regards to internal and external cell environment have different effects on animal cells and plant cells. In a hypertonic solution (concentration of solute is greater on the outside than on the inside), the cell would attempt to create an equilibrium by releasing its water content to the external cell environment. By doing so, the concentrations may be equal if there is enough water in the cell. Also, the cell would end up being shriveled. In the plant cell, the same things occurs. However, because plant cells have cell walls, instead of being shriveled, it is plasmolyzed. On the other extreme, hypotonic solution, when the concentration is solute is lower on the outside than the inside, the cell will become lysed. The attempt to establish equilibrium lies in the water's entrance into the cell to lower the concentration in the cell. In the plant cell, this is called turgid instead of lysed. On a sidenote, this is the normal preference of the plant cell. In an isotonic solution (concentrations are equal on both sides of the cell), the net content of water in and out of the cell remains the cell. This is the eukaryote's preferred state. In the plant cell, it is termed flaccid.
Membrance proteins called transporters facilitate the passage of molecules across membrance, there is involved at least three step: dinding, conformational change fo the protein, and release. There are two types of transporter: passive transporters which use no energy, and active transporters that employ ATP to drive transport.

===Cell Communication===
cell-to- cell communication is essential for multicellular organisms such as human or an oak creatures in which they must communicate in order for them to develop from fertilized egg and then survive and reproduce in turn. Communication between cells is very important for many unicellular organisms that must find matters and food in order for them to develop and to sexually reproduce. 
An early example of cell communication is Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which the cells of that yeast use chemical signaling to identify cells of opposite mating and to start the mating process. 
The study of cell communication could help to answer some of the most important questions and medicine in areas ranging between embryological development to hormone action to the development of cancer and other related diseases.

On a side note, not only is cell-to-cell communication imperative, but also with other molecules. Different kinds of molecules communicate differently with the internal programming of the cell. For example, synaptic transmitters, such as acetylcholine, bind to a certain G-protein and activates intracellular 2nd messengers. Another way for synaptic transmitters to bind is via a protein complex (integral/membrane protein) including an ion channel. The net result of both pathways change the state of ion channel conformation in the membrane. Another example, steroid hormones, diffuse through the cell membrane and eventually changes the protein programming in certain cells. As for the peptide hormone, it binds to a G-protein, activates intracellular 2nd messengers, and changes the transcription paradigm. Due to the peptide hormone's hydrophobic character and the cell membrane nonpolarity, it requires secondary messenger interaction whereas the steroid hormone (also nonpolar) can directly communicate and diffuse into the cell.
Cell-cell communication is essential for multicellular organisms. Cells usually communicate by releasing chemical messenger targeted for cell. Some messengers travel short distances such as molecules are alled local regulators. Animal growth factors which are compounds that stimulate nearby target cells to grow and multiply. Numerous cells can simulaneously receive and respond to the molecules of growth factors produced by single cell in their vicinity.

=== Cell Adhesion===
Cell adhesion is any glandular cells in ctenophores, turbellarian used for adhesion to a substrate and for capture. Cell adhesion occurs when one cell binds to another surface such as another cell or some other inanimate surface. Cell adhesion molecules serve as intermediates that hold the cell to another surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Electromagnetic actuators consist of a hollow coil (solenoid) and a ferrometal rod. The rod is mounted loose in the coil and can move up and down. When current flows through the coil, the rod is pulled to the center of the coil. If the direction of the current is then reversed the solenoid will pull in the ferrometal rod. Due to Lenz's Law which states &quot;For a current induced in a conductor, the current is in such a direction that its own magnetic field opposes the change that produced it.&quot; This means that an EMF will flow through the solenoid of the actuator to oppose the ''change'' in magnetic flux thus an electromagnetic actuator can never fully extend the full length of the rod.  

''Note to further modifiers: Feel free to tidy my Lenz's Law explanation up - i'm sure it could be written in a more elegant manner! --[[User:SamEEE|SamEEE]] 03:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)'' 

===Applications===
This type of actuator is useful for momentary linear motion. e.g. closing a gripper.

===Design Considerations===
Solenoids use a large amount of power this requires more battery power which in turn requires more battery power to move the robot. A general rule of thumb is to use a electromagnetic actuators for small operations and for larger operations prehaps consider the use of Pneumatics the output power/weight ratio is usually more favorable. For more information on Pnuematics please consult the corresponding section of this book.

====Calculating Force====
Calculating how strong the actuator is, isn't very easy. However it is possible by using a Newtonmeter to the line of action and measuring how many Newtons are exerted by the solenoid on the measuring device.
There are also a way of measuring force though use of a formula however the forementioned method is usually the most practical.

Ah, the glamour of films!  It is such that many countries wish to encourage film production; both in local production, and in the use of their country as a filming location. So many nations exist that wish to encourage filming that an entire industry exists in making use of the various film tax breaks on offer.  Many European feature films are financed using pieces of tax breaks from various territories, along with a dollop of equity funding.

Tax breaks tend to change with new administrations and finance ministers.  Your best bet in getting up-to-date information regarding tax breaks is to directly contact the finance department (or visit the website) of the country in question and investigate how the tax break works.  Then - and only then - should you consult a tax-specialist for the country in question, as that way you will know what is actually available.

==Introduction==
Physics is the study of the laws which govern space, structure and time. In a sense we are more qualified to do physics than any other science. From the day we are born we study the things around us in an effort to understand how they work and relate to each other. For example, learning how to catch or throw a ball is a physics undertaking.

In the field of study we refer to as physics we just try to make the things everyone has been studying more clear. We attempt to describe them through simple rules and mathematics. Mathematics is merely the language we use. The best approach to physics is to relate everything you learn to things you have already noticed in your everyday life. Sometimes when you look at things closely, you discover things you had initially overlooked.

It is the continued scrutiny of everything we know about the world around us that leads people to the lifelong study of physics. You can start with asking a simple question like &quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;, which could lead you to [[FHSST Physics Waves:Practical Applications Electromagnetic|electromagnetic waves]], which in turn could lead you to wave particle duality and energy levels of atoms. Before long you are studying quantum mechanics or the structure of the universe.

In the sections that follow notice that we will try to describe how we will communicate the things we are dealing with. This is our language. Once this is done we can begin the adventure of looking more closely at the world we live in.

There are several reasons why it is a good idea to '''make a music video.'''

For the Band:
* To give your band exposure- a music video is one of the best ways to publicize a band, as it would no doubt be passed on by many people. The music video is not limited geographicaly, through the internet many people from around the world can view it. The music video does not cost in time, as once it is made the band does not have to perform again for every single audience.
* To convey your visual style, giving people an incentive to see you perform live.
* Experience- Performing in a music video gives the band/singer experience in performing elaberate and complex moves in exact sequence. While performing on a music video the band/singer doesn't have to perform live, and they/he can get feedback from the fans on how well they perform. The singer/band can then later repeat the moves they did on the music video on stage live, knowing exactly what moves the audience would love.

For the Crew:
* To get experience in moviemaking, that may be useful before you try making a feature film. Music videos are a way of exploring visuals and styles in an abstract or surreal way without being confined by narrative restrictions. True expression can be found in these visuals, instead of trying to get a message across through actors and dialogue in a scripted environment.

* As a Director, a music video can be the perfect outlet to freely express a creative style with some guided direction from the genre of the music. However it's important to note that freedom of expression for the Director can only be achieved if the performing artist approves of the content or Director buys the rights to the song.

It is short
*By being a short video it can also be highly inexpensive in comparison to a feature or any other short based on what you do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Case Study 1 - a Simple Interpreter ==
The purpose of this is to provide a gentle introduction to some compilation techniques, and to introduce a few more computer science concepts.

Interpreters are used rather than compilers since they don't have such a steep learning curve. Later chapters and case studies will delve more into compilers. 

The language being interpreted is a very small subset of Basic, even smaller than Tiny Basic.

The purpose of this case study is to use simple interpreters to provide a gentle introduction to some compilation. There are three chunks of code in this chapter:
* Simple line-mode IDE, which can be used with either interpreter.
* Interpreter for Very Very Tiny Basic.
* Interpreter for Very Tiny Basic. 

The VVTB interpreter only allows integer variables,
and only recognizes five different statements
(just enough to write simple programs with,
but not a serious programming tool).
The VTB interpreter allows both integer and string variables,
and recognizes ten different statements.
The two interpreters use different methods for
dealing with expressions, to provide you with some variety.

Note that the code presented here is intended to be
as clear and simple as possible;
high performance is not a target.
Those readers unfamiliar with C++ may like to consult Appendix A
which provides a brief summary on those C++ constructions
which used in the book.

=== Very Tiny Basic - Specification ===
A line-mode IDE is very simple:
if the line you type starts with a number
then that line is a statement to add to your program source code,
otherwise it is a command to the system (e.g. RUN or LIST).
The line-mode 'editor' is also very simple: 
* Just typing a line number without any code causes any existing line with that number to be deleted.
* If the line number you use is the same as that of some previously typed line then the earlier line is discarded.
* Program lines are sorted by line number order, so you can easily insert missing lines if needed, provided you originally used line numbers with gaps (every 10 was common).

'''IDE commands'''

''Line number''
: Line numbers must be non-zero.

''NEW''

''QUIT''
: Terminate the IDE.

''LIST''
: List the current source code.

''RUN''
: Obey the current source code.

=== Sample Programs ===
Programs in Very Very Tiny Basic are very simple.  Programs in Very Tiny Basic are still simple, but they can do more complex things.  Neither language allows any user input.

'''Sample VVTB program'''

 REM This is a sample VVTB program.
 
 10 LET a = 10
 
 20 PRINT &quot;The value of a is &quot;, a
 
 30 LET b = 20
 
 40 IF b &lt; 40 THEN 10
 
'''Sample VTB program'''

 REM This is a sample VTB program.
 
 10 FOR a$ = 1 TO 50 STEP 5
 
 20 FOR b = 1 TO a$
 
 30 GOSUB 200
 
 50 NEXT b
 
 60 NEXT a$
 
 70 FOR b = 1 TO 100
 
 80 GOSUB 200
 
 90 IF b &gt; 25 THEN 500
 
 100 NEXT b
 
 REM A sub-routine will return to where it is called from.
 
 200 PRINT &quot;The value of a$ is &quot;, a
 
 210 PRINT &quot;The value of b is &quot;, b
 
 220 RETURN
 
 500 PRINT &quot;Exiting the program.&quot;
 
 510 GOTO 1000
 
 1000 STOP

=== Line Mode IDE - Implementation ===
The code which follows may seem quite short,
but it is indeed a complete line-mode IDE.
The reason it is so short is the use of the C++ &lt;map&gt;,
which is exactly what is needed for storing source code,
sorting lines into line number order, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

'''Clay pot cooking''' is a technique of cooking food in an unglazed clay pot (or Dolbier which is a French Clay Pot) which has been soaked in water so as to release steam during the cooking process.  This technique has a long history, stretching back at least to ancient Roman times.

Typically, an unglazed clay pot is submerged for 15 to 30 minutes to absorb water before cooking, then filled with the food and placed into an oven.  The walls of the pot help to diffuse the heat, and as the pot warms it releases the water as steam.

The food inside the clay pot loses none of its moisture because it is surrounded by steam, creating a tender, flavorful dish.  The evaporation of the water prevents burning so long as the pot is not allowed to heat until it is completely dry.  Because no oil needs to be added with this cooking technique, food cooked in a clay pot may be lower in fat compared with food prepared by other methods such as [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéing]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]].  And unlike [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]], nutrients are not leached out into the water.

Because of the heat lost to the evaporation of water, clay pot cooking requires higher oven temperature and longer cooking times than traditional [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] with dry heat.  Clay pots may be cleaned by scrubbing them with salt; soaps or detergents should not be used, because the clay may absorb them.</text>

* This is one of the few completed books on this site. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:31, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC) ''from January''
* And as a &quot;guide&quot;, being as far along as it is makes it pretty useful - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] ''from January''
* I think this books has broken the back of the problem regarding raising sufficient content but its pretty sparse on explanations (not definitions) and could quickly be polished a lot with some publicity  - [[User:Marknewlyn|Mark]] ''from January''
*Excellent book - [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] ''from January''
* this guide is good for students preparing for exams. for full impact it really needs a complimentary textbook... perhaps [http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/] could provide that! &lt;!-- (i hope i voted correctly... i just edited the page by hand)--&gt; ''from January''
* One more vote, and this book is automatically nominated for next month's voting. (don't forget, you can vote for more than one book!) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 22:22, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

* Despite misgivings I have about the French, this book is pretty cool. And somewhat unique idea for a wikitext and a fun read - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] ''from January''
* A unique and informative guide, I can only hope more guides are made for teaching in other countries (China for instance, ya) -[[User:Tiberus|Tiberus]] ''from January''

* As much of the content is avaliable but not utilised for Australian schools, the principal author has a good awareness of their market. Having this as a Featured Wikibook would help the rest of the world, as well as all who are interested in an accessible introduction to the intricacies of higher mathematics and the sciences (including mature-aged students). I recommend High School Extensions warmly and highly, and would strongly encourage people to contribute to Discrete Probability and Further Modular Arithmetic, as well as thinking of HARD problems in otherwise complete sections. -[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 01:05, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC).
* Nothing against r3m0t, but I really think we should restrain from nominating the two books he's worked on for the first two months of Book of the Month, despite their content. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 05:30, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
** As reply to the above comment, I've two points to say:firstly, it doesn't quite matter who is the author, as long as we fairly choose the best book out of here, somehow we're not voting &quot;author of the month&quot;, hum? Second, the book, in the end, isn't written entirely by him. There are three major author, and a lots of contributer, I think this is an ideal way of writting a wikibook, too.As for my comment on this book, I could just say well done. They chose the fun and actually useful tools/topics in mathematics, and in a balanced level(not too hard, not too easy), they presented these topics in a good and attractive way. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 11:26, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
** I have actually not contributed much to that book. Typos corrected and a new part about number bases which is very simple and compared to the rest of the book insignificant. --[[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
** SamE, it is after all an open voting. If you don't like the selection of the books presented here, you are free to nominate high quality books by yourself and vote for them. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
* An important thing to note is that some of the stuff in there ''is'' actually taught in high schools (&quot;secondary schools&quot;) in the UK at the non-compulsory education stage (ages 16-18) if you choose Physics and/or Maths at A-Level. I'm not sure what exactly, because I am in my last year before my A-Levels, but I'm sure imaginary numbers are taught and I think it's likely number bases are too. (Further Maths is also available which almost certainly covers it. --[[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:43, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
* I'm not going to vote against this since it doesn't necessarily deserve an opposing vote - there is good content here, but some of it  is really quite messy. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:13, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
** Then which part(s) of it is/are messy? I would like to hear the feedback in order to clean up the book. Also as a side notes, the discreet probability chapter has been recently created, although just a stub, it is somehow the first step that every chapter in the book has to go through. Unluckily, I'm no good on that subject, so I hope that someone good with it could contribute. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 12:41, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)
*** Sure. Here's a little list, even though this isn't really the place, so I'll just bring up the points; we can discuss them elsewhere later. From the three chapters listed as 100%: [[HSE Primes]] - the square root notation is very much a strong abuse of notation. I've brought that up on the talk page but nothing has come of it, unfortunately. This will confuse the target audience. Listing Arnold Ross is a bit strange for a textbook. [[HSE Logic]] - the motivational section on Boolean algebra isn't quite intuitive enough. The way additive and multiplicative notation is introduced needs more background and explanation for ''why'' we use this notation. The proofs section looks okay. The way TeX notation is used though may probably need to be carefully examined, for readability and typography purposes. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:05, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)
* It is not possible at all to vote ''against'' something (see rules), but you can nominate and vote for as many of the other books as you like. (I wonder why nobody dares to vote for the other books...) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 14:27, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

* At university we use exclusively Linux, and knowing vi gives me advantage over my fellows in very quickly editing small scripts and files. The book starts from the beginning, but having used vi already for several years, I still found very useful tricks and tweaks in this nice Wikibook. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:55, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

* Discuss the startings of NetBSD and FreeBSD.
* Mention the starting of BSDi, but let the details be in the following chapter.
* Discuss where NetBSD and FreeBSD have gone since their founding
* Discuss the forking of NetBSD into OpenBSD and touch upon the conflict that caused it.
* Discuss the direction OpenBSD went in and why.  Theo's Sun work and his license stance.
* Discuss 4.3BSD-Quasijarus, which is lead by Michael Sokolov.  A strong supporter of VAX and the original BSD.
* Discuss the conflict that caused the forking of FreeBSD into DragonFlyBSD.  The reasons for Matt Dillion's departure from FreeBSD and his history in Amiga and Linux work.
* Discuss the various dead BSD varients; why they started and why they died.
* Talk a little about Wasabi and Windriver.


Michael Sokolov is a hardcore backer of the VAX computer system as well as of the original ideals and code of the Berkeley Software Distribution, so in on December 27th, 1998 he began Quasijarus. Taking the code from the 4.3-Tahoe release of BSD UNIX Michael began to maintain and improve the 1988 code base for personal usage.  As Michael believes in the ideal of a One True Unix, he completely avoids any and all GNU or GNU-like solutions within Quasijarus.  Though the codebase is based on the Tahoe release of BSD, no work is done on the Tahoe specific code, VAX is the only architecture supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==EuropracBHIT==
The last time [[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] could say she had 'never used a computer' was in 1990, when an IBM-compatible computer running MS-DOS version 3.1 came into her home. She studied Information Technology from 1996 to 2000, which is the sum of her theoretical knowledge, as well as a course in Desktop Publishing in 2003, where she crystallised high skills in PageMaker and Photoshop, versions of which she had been exploring for the previous ten years first on Macintosh and subsequently on Wintel platforms. Practically, she reads all the manuals before she opens a piece of software, and help files and PDF files. And she plays and has fun, ferreting out what a piece of hardware and its comicontant software can do and testing out its limits.
Her principal contributions will be in Internet and Multimedia, as she believes these are the most fun and challenging ways of using a computer in the consumer and education arenas for which this book is targeted.
She recommends tutorials because they are a form of 'doing as I do': imitating an experienced computer user as opposed to 'doing what I say' which is following the instructions and feeling very foolish. She thinks that people feeling foolish is the greatest reason why they do not learn to use their computers more efficiently and get out their maximum potential with this and other related technology.
In the fifteen years she has been using computers, she has had to tutor and help many people of all ages and skill levels. She thinks the best way to meet the computer's 'mind' is to be logical. However, computers, in her view, do stir passions and emotions, and it is important to deal with these positively, critically and constructively.

==Deviance99==
[[User:Deviance99|Deviance99]] has had a home PC running Microsoft Windows since he was 9 years old. He has been consulting friends, family, and neighbors since age 15. He started dabbling in Q-Basic computer programming at age 12, and started building his own computers at 14, and discovered Linux at age 17 (23 now). He's been designing webpages since his sophomore year in high school, and has had several jobs making websites. He studied Information Technology from 2001-2005 with a speciality in Multimedia Design, and is current the System Administrator of the Physics Department at the local univerity. 

Most of his knowledge of computers is self-taught and complimented with theory from the University. He is an expert using Windows, while an advanced user of Linux with experience setting up and maintaining webservers, mail servers, files servers, clusters, active directory, and a network environment. He just bought his first Apple computer and is virgerously learning it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Email routing is performed based entirely on the destination address of the email message.  An email address has the following format:

''username'' '''@''' ''domain''

(For example: user@wikipedia.org)

While it would be theoretically possible for mail clients to deliver their own messages directly to recipients, this is not desirable.  So, an end user's mail client will deliver outbound messages to their local mail server using SMTP or a similar protocol.  

The local mail server then performs a DNS lookup to find the 'MX' (mail exchanger) records for the recipient's domain name.  These MX devices are the designated mail servers for all email addresses within that domain.

The local server then attempts an SMTP connection to each of the MX servers in order of priority, until a connection is successful.  It forwards the message to the remote server and ends the connection.

The remote mail server then either repeats this process, forwarding the message closer to the intended recipient, or may deliver the message directly to the recipient.

'''History'''

Prior to the advent of the SMTP protocol, email was delivered using the UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol).

In the early days of SMTP, before Spam became a massive problem on the Internet, it was possible to manually define the route that an email message was to take.  This was done by appending multiple &quot;@domain&quot; entries to a recipient address.  For example:

user@domain1.com@domain2.com@domain3.com

A message with this recipient address would be routed first to the mail server for domain3.com, then to the mail server for domain2.com, then finally to the mail server for domain1.com where it would be delivered to the local user.  

Due to anti-relaying restrictions now in place on Internet-accessible mail servers, this is generally no longer possible.

=== Where is the Internet? ===

In the 21st century the Internet is a pervasive presence in our lives, shaping them both for good and evil. It should not be surprising that the Internet may have motivated you to buy and use a computer to its maximum potential.

So, people &quot;connect&quot; to the Internet. Where ''is'' the Internet? The short answer is nowhere and everywhere. The nature of the Internet is not centralized, there is no specific place where the Internet exists. What we call &quot;the Internet&quot; is the ever-changing collection of computers that are all connected together and configured so that they can &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Your computer becomes part of the Internet every time you connect to it, and you usually connect to it through your internet service provider (ISP), and ''they'' are permanently connected.

The Internet is what you and others make it by creating a web page and uploading it onto a server. Your web page has now become a part of the Internet.

To define the term, the internet is a collection of many, many computers, including servers and desktop PCs, linked together to send and receive information.

=== The Internet and the World Wide Web ===

Another point that may need clarification is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. People tend to use those terms interchangeably, but there is a difference. The Internet can provide a wide range of services, like web-pages, email, file transfers, instant messages &amp;mdash; the list never ends. The World Wide Web (or just &quot;Web&quot;), refers to the collection of inter-linked web-pages, and web-browsing refers to the exploration of those web-pages.

==Web Browsing==

Web browsing is probably the most accessible beginners' Internet activity. It is the act of viewing textual or image-based content using the World-Wide Web over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). You are doing this as you read this text.

All recent versions of Windows come with a version of Internet Explorer, and most of them are inextricably integrated with the operating system. The current version, bundled with Windows Vista , is Internet Explorer 8. Windows 98 ships with version 4, and Me or 2000 are integrated with 5.0 or 5.5 (the difference being that 5.5 has support for more advanced security measures).

Internet Explorer is not the only browser, and not necessarily the best. Although it's still by far the most common, many people point out that it's difficult to use and may expose your computer to security risks. If you plan to use the World Wide Web, it's highly recommended that you at least try out one of the alternatives:
* [http://www.getfirefox.com Mozilla Firefox] is simple and reliable, and one of the most popular alternative browsers.
* [http://chrome.google.com Google Chrome]
* [http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x Mozilla Suite] (includes e-mail support)
* [http://www.opera.com Opera]
* [http://www.netscape.com Netscape]

Linux users sometimes want to use command-line, or textual, browsers such as Lynx or Links2 where a graphical user interface is unavailable, for instance when installing, but most browsers are graphical.

When learning to use a browser (graphical or textual) most efficiently, it can be useful to learn keyboard commands, as well as the discrete uses of the Left and Right mouse button. If your mouse has a wheel in the middle, it can be useful to scroll, or for browsers with tabbed browsing support, opening a new tab. Check your settings so you can get the best use of this tool.

The vast majority of Web browsing is done among sites you might already know. The first one that you may have seen is your ''home page''. When the browser is out of the box, it may direct to the company (Microsoft for Internet Explorer, Netscape for Netscape and allied products), or it will direct to your Internet Service Provider (the people who manage your connection). You can also have a home page of your choosing. If you are surfing at school or work, your school or work will have a page, as will the library or the Internet cafe.

==Choosing a password==

Many web services, such as [[Wikipedia:email|email]], [[Wikipedia:internet shopping|internet shopping]] or [[Wikipedia:online banking| online banking]]
require the user to &quot;log in&quot; by entering a '''username''' and '''password'''.

It is important to choose a good password, that is, a password that
cannot be easily [[cracked]] by a third party who could potentially
gain access to your email account or finances.

===Bad passwords===

The following types of passwords should never be used. They can
easily be cracked by modern password breaking tools and offer little
or no protection in case of an attack.

* '''Dictionary words''', '''common phrases''' and '''names'''  in any language, even if combined with numbers. For example:
  webmail, merci, London, clare, beermonster, install, Sony, honey888, password3, fluffy,
  bahnhof, MichaelJackson, mount_everest, jesuschrist, linux7, venividivici, ...
* Passwords '''shorter''' than 7 characters. For example:
  fG4ir5, bmw, cat, foo, cng56, girl9, ...
* Passwords containing a modified version of the '''user name'''. (e.g. if the user name is &quot;martin88&quot;, a password such as &quot;martmart&quot; or &quot;nitram&quot;)

* Passwords containing '''personal''' information about the user or the user's family such as dates of birth, social security numbers, number plates, pet names and addresses. For example:
  12021967, 12_2_1967, 12Feb67, y67d12m2, abbeyRoad, ...
* Patterns or repetitive sequences
  qwerty, 9876789, g3g3g3g3, aeiou...
* Contains only digits or letters. For example:
  wiki, 9876543... ...

===Good passwords===

Good passwords should:

* be at least 8 characters long

* contain upper and lowercase characters, as well as numbers in a random sequence.

* be easy to remember
 
 FQr7erfn5, QWd3fTr6U, rgi82eJiFF0, GI$87d90%nj, kEirt4Pw, ...

A convenient way of creating a password is thinking of a &quot;pass phrase&quot; and then abbreviating it
into a password. This procedure usually results in a password that is both safe and easy to remember.
For example:

* &quot;Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a bad poet, so are you&quot; becomes &quot;RarVabIabp5ay&quot;, where the first word of each line is represented by a capital and &quot;S&quot; becomes a &quot;5&quot; because both characters look similar.

* &quot;I use this website to buy cheap flights from Stanstead airport&quot; becomes &quot;IutwtbcffSa&quot;  

Using special characters such as *&amp;^%$ also improves a password's safety. However,
some applications and websites don't allow passwords to contain special characters.
If in doubt, leave them out and make the password longer.

Another convenient way to creating a good password is to change the letters to numbers or symbols in a short phrase. For example, if I wanted to use the phrase &quot;Pepsi Man&quot;, I could simply change a few letters to numbers or symbols and get &quot;P3p$1_m4n&quot; an good and easy to use password that is accepted by most websites.

==Searching: getting here from there==

A very useful idea for a home page can be a search engine. In a search engine, you can type in words or phrases in regard to a site or topic you may know something or nothing about. There have been many search engines developed over time. Since 1998, the most popular search engine is Google.

The principles to use all search engines are the same. Search engines differ in how much, how widely and how deeply they cover the Internet. The Internet is not just the World Wide Web, it can be Telnet, Usenet, Tymnet, Gopher and File Transfer Protocol. So keep that in mind!

So when looking for a website that we already know, we type in '''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' into the box at the top below the menus. Or we would go to Open Location and press Control+L (all demonstrations from this point are conducted in Firefox 1.0.1).

When we want to go to Google, we type in http://www.google.com

Once you are in Google type in the box &quot;Windows XP For Beginners&quot;. Then press Enter/Return or click on Google Search. The button next to it, I'm Feeling Lucky, will take you to the first site that google finds such as &quot;BBC&quot; will take you to &quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk&quot;. When we 'felt lucky', we clicked on this site: http://northville.lib.mi.us/tech/tutor/welcome.htm, which will reinforce many of the concepts we have gone through and learnt.

Many sites have come up. We want to evaluate the ones which give us the most information about what we want to know.

Google gives us the name of the website (written out in full, so you can recall it later; if you can't put your mouse over the link's name), the first few words of the website we want to go to (usually 2 lines long), how big the file is (measured in kilobytes and useful for downloading, especially if you have limited time and resources), and two links called 'Cached' (which shows past versions of the website in the event the present version may not work) and 'Similar Pages' which will give similar pages. In the case of our 'Never Used a Computer Before' search, we found 30 sites similar to the 'I Feel Lucky' site, which incidentally is the first one. Many people, when they search and research, click on the first 10 files they see and gain information that way. This is not always the best thing to do, because most search engines have some form of ranking. Some of this ranking is sorted out by the user patterns of human beings, and others by the vagaries of servers. Some of this is sorted out by advertising. Google is a popular search engine for the reason it is not influenced by advertising.

How do we narrow down the search? On the right, there is a small link called Advanced Search. Advanced Search, as implied, is very powerful. It is something like a similar feature in your word processor or database programme and even in your operating system.

Advanced Search is here (if you are not located in the United States replace '.com' with '.com.au', '.co.uk', '.de', '.fr' or some other domain suffix.)

http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en

and then you can play around.

The first four text boxes are to do with restricting the terms of the search with words or phrases - adding, delimiting or deleting. You may well be familiar with this from your word processor's Find and Replace function.

Web pages are in many different languages, file formats, dates and domains. To protect yourself and other people, you may want to use SafeSearch. Most things searched on the Web are 'sex' and 'porn(ography)' in all their forms, so for work and study, SafeSearch would be recommended. Otherwise, no filtering will do the trick. Google is able to limit all these things.

If you need more help then you can look at Advanced Search Tips:
http://www.google.com/help/refinesearch.html

You might also like to find similar or linked pages to your page.

There are also technology-related searches for Macintosh, Microsoft and Linux (for example).

==Email==
E-mail (commonly referred to as email - either spelling is acceptable) is a method of sending messages with a computer. Sending email costs nothing extra over your Internet connection.

You send email either with an '''email client''' such as [[Wikipedia:Microsoft_Outlook|Microsoft Outlook]]
, [[Wikipedia:Mozilla_Thunderbird|Mozilla Thunderbird]] or with a web-based email system. The basic principle is the same for both:

*The email is written and sent to a server with an email address attached.
*The server looks at the domain name of the email (the section following the @) and sends the email on its way through the internet.
*The receiving server receives the email. It looks at the username of the email (the section preceding the @) and stores the email in an appropriate folder on its hard disc.
*The recipient connects to the Internet and logs into their mail client or webmail site.
*The receiving server then allows the message to be downloaded by the recipient.

All this often happens in a second or less. The speed depends on the speed of the two previously mentioned servers and all the ISP servers in between, the amount of internet traffic, and the distance between the two servers.

==Web-based email==

Web-based email is very convenient compared to email accessed via a client, but almost never has the featureset of clients.

Here is how to sign up for a Yahoo! Mail account. Yahoo! was one of the very first web-based email companies.

# Having got to the Yahoo site! (the American one), find 'Sign up'.
# The splash screen shows us three choices: Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Mail Plus and Personal Yahoo. The one that will be easiest for our purposes will be Yahoo Mail.
#It is always a good idea to read the Privacy Policy [[http://privacy.yahoo.com/]], and Terms of Service [[http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/]]. Look at everything marked with an asterisk and read the Terms of Service very very carefully. (Even print them out if you can't read them: there is a printable version).
# The most important thing is to have a user name and password:
#* For this demonstration we'll type in neverusedacomputer@yahoo.com where the pattern is username@provider.com.
#* You can make up your own password
#* Follow the tips and hints.
# Hopefully you won't forget your password, but 'If You Forget Your Password' is next.
# Now that you have remembered your password, you will have to look at Captcha to verify your registration or account. It will be different every time. If you can see it, type it.
# Now you have your Yahoo account and you can sign in.

Many of these principles and practices apply to any Internet Service Provider or free service. It is interesting to compare similarities and differences. The basis of getting 'free' e-mail can and will change over time, especially if you intend to keep your address for longer than a month and will use it for many different things. Most people do keep their e-mail addresses for life or as long as is practicable, and will try to maintain continuity over the services they most frequently use. However, there is a danger of forgetfulness or apathy in regard to less frequently used or one-time only services. Ideally, a portal such as Yahoo or Hotmail will provide a very functional and neat e-mail address and many safe explorations on the information superhighway, like message boards, chat and directory links.

==E-mail through a specialist program==

There are many programs designed for reading e-mail. A good one is Mozilla Thunderbird and it is meant to work alongside Mozilla Firefox. There are also Outlook and Outlook Express, Eudora and others. Those programs do not need a browser, they are capable of downloading and reading email on their own &amp;mdash; they are ''stand-alone''.

1. In your browser, go to Tools -&gt; Read Mail.

2. If you want to write a new message, then go to Tools -&gt; New Message or press Control+M.

=== E-mail hygiene: viruses ===

One of the main ways that computer viruses propagate is via e-mail. This is usually done by attachments &amp;mdash; files that are attached to the e-mail message sent to you. If you don't know the person sending you the email, it's advisable to be careful and not open the attachment that accompanies the e-mail (if any). The types of files that can be infected by viruses are files whose filenames end with '''.exe''' (executable programs), '''.bat''', '''.vbs''', '''.doc''' (Microsoft Word documents), '''.xls''' (Microsoft Excel files), '''.ppt''' (Microsoft PowerPoint presentations) and others. Even if you do know the person sending you the e-mail message, they might not know that ''their'' computer is infected with a virus and they may unknowingly be sending you infected files, so it's always a good idea to have virus-scanning software. Finally, watch out for files that have names like ''file.jpg.bat''. The '''.jpg''' part of the filename is there to fool you into believing this is a picture file, but it is almost certainly something nasty (due to the '''.bat''' ending).

One final point you should be careful about: many graphical e-mail programs have a &quot;preview mode&quot; as the default mode for reading email messages. In this mode, the contents of the email are presented to you immediately when you click on the message title in the list of messages. In the past years, we have seen viruses that infect your system immediately when you just ''view'' the email message that carries them. It's advisable to disable the preview mode so that you have more control on which messages you want to view: that would give you the chance of deleting the emails you think look suspicious before even viewing their contents (yes, you can often judge from their titles).

==Online Scams==

Common sense in the real world applies online. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
A good idea is to research an offer before you accept it. 

A typical scam letter expresses an urgent need for a person to do them a favor. This usually involves some type of inheritance. These scammers are very good, and their letters sound sincere and legitimate. They are not. They also will target anyone who they think has money. There are even reports of religious figures being scammed. One occurred with a Pastor who was scammed into thinking that a Nigerian man had an inheritance of a few million dollars. However, a stipulation was placed on the inheritance that he had to give half of it away to charity but he didn't have the initial money to get to the location of the money in order for it to be released. The Pastor trusted him and in exchange for fronting the $10,000 or so USD, the scammer was to give him a few million for his church for the trouble. Unfortunately, the Pastor was scammed, he never received the money and was out $10,000.

Phishing is another way that crackers will try to obtain your personal information. They send emails claiming to be from reputable companies like Amazon.com or PayPal. The emails claim that they need information from you, like your credit card information or password, for some reason or another. Common excuses are technical glitches and software upgrades. These emails look legitimate at first glance--complete with company logos and professional formatting. They may ask you give you information via phone, through a reply, or through a website, which is also masked as the website of the company that they are trying to imitate. If you ever get an email like this, always treat it like it is evil as most companies would ''never'' ask for personal information through email. If anything, call the company and verify that they sent you the email. Also, both Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer will detect many phishing sites and warn users that they are malicious.

# 初めまして should only be used when talking to someone you are meeting for the first time.
# どうぞ　よろしく means &quot;Please favor me with your friendship&quot; though it is usually loosely translated to &quot;Pleased to meet you&quot; or &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;
# No. The correct sentence should be &quot;私は田中です&quot;. さん is an honorific suffix applied to others. It cannot be applied to oneself.
# When meeting someone for the first time, it is common to say &quot;初めまして、___　です。　どうぞ　よろしく。&quot;
# To introduce someone to another person, &quot;こちら　は　___さん　です。&quot; can be said.

I'm currently working on &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Use the Source]]&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Canadian History]]&lt;/font&gt;, after completing these two books to my satisfaction I'll be making &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Using OpenBSD]]&lt;/font&gt; and maybe more.

Truth be told, I do more dicking around in the &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Cookbook]]&lt;/font&gt; than I want to, adding some stuff and doing some formatting, stuff like that, but also adding recipes from various old books written by dead relatives.  You want to try my &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Cookbook:Grannie Gilbert's Sugar Cookies | Grannie Gilbert's Sugar Cookies]]&lt;/font&gt;.  Which grannie was it?  Dunno, it's just the name of the recipe to me.

I also may meddle with &lt;font color=#88A9CA&gt;[[Caring for Guinea Pigs]]&lt;/font&gt; since it's not doing so well.

'''&lt;font color=&quot;#AEA3A1&quot;&gt;Todo:&lt;/font&gt;'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both International Liberal Theory and International Realism Theory take for granted the state of '''anarchy''': no world government exists, therefore each state acts on its own.  International Realism Theory focuses on predicting how a rational state would behave in its own interests.  It is hoped that, if every state can predict how other states will react to its actions, armed conflict can be avoided.

Liberal theory, on the other hand, focuses on ways to avoid interstate conflict be regulating state behaviour.  Therefore, Liberal Theory focuses on international '''institutions''' and '''systems'''.

Liberal International theory is comparable to the &quot;social contract&quot; of Rousseau.  States value their freedom to act in their self-interest, but they realize that they lose some of that freedom to act if they are in constant conflict with other states.  Therefore, they voluntarily give up some of that freedom and create international institutions.  These institutions create contacts for interstate co-operation and rules to resolve interstate conflicts.  Liberal theorists often study institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization of American States.

One of the most influential believers in International Liberal theory was U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.  He pushed for the creation of the Legaue of Nations after World War I as an institution that could provide a forum for resolving international disputes.  The failure of the League of Nations to prevent World War II is one of the often-cited examples used by critics of International Liberal Theory.  Nonetheless, International Liberal theory is strongly evident in the creation of the United Nations and the European Union, two of the more successful post-World War II international institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I changed the period where a book is not allowed to be nominated again from 2 months to 1 year. I think it would degrade the quality of the vote, if we would see the same book on the main page every 3 months. Part of the philosophy behind the &quot;book of the month&quot; is to present ''new'' or maybe ''yet unknown'' books to the community, and it would not be good to always have the same book in that place. What do you think?

== Minimum number of edits? ==

Last month, it looked like a user regestered multiple accounts, which did nothing more than vote for the London book. I suggest that you have to have at least 100 edits in order to vote. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 14:35, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)
: I think that if we have such condition at Collaboration of Month, we should introduce it here. BOTM is even more important, we shouldn't risk that sockpuppets will manipulate this vote. I suggest minimum of 20 edits - like at COTM. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:15, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
:: I'd go with 20 edits on the day the BOTM cycles, otherwise it would be fairly easy to create several accounts that correct 20 typos, then vote. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 16:53, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
::: There have been a number of books, notably the Japanese and Bulgarian Wikibooks, that seem to have abused this recently (noted by the redshirt users doing the voting for those Wikibooks).  At the same time, I don't want to discourage legitimate new users from voting as the BOTM is a good place to get your feet wet without having to deal with the greater political battles that happen on the VfD page or Staff Lounge, for example.  You can pad edits just as easily as you can do anything else, but that would also make sock puppets obvious and take more effort to create.  Too bad we don't have anybody with CheckUser privileges here at the moment.  Definitely add an extra line to the rules to prohibit sock puppets explicitly (the rationale for introducing this rule in the first place, I presume).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:48, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
:::: I support both the explicit ban of sockpuppets from polls, and the requirement to have 20 edits before polls open for that month. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:58, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

: The default policy should have the previous edit requirement to be the same (0, 20, 100, whatever) for BOTM and COTM.  Having different requirements should require specific reason, eg., there is more of a problem at one or the other.  I have been a bit curious about suspicious some of the redshirt voting in recent months&amp;mdash;it seems that the minimum should be more than zero.  Let's try 20 for both since that is what is at COTM.  Further problems may require higher minimums.  Some possibly suspicious redshirt voting this month at COTM may suggest that 20 isn't enough.  But the place to start is raising the BOTM requirement to 20.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 04:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

::I put in formal rules that reflect this general concensus.  I would agree that 20 votes is not enough, but it at least is a place to start.  I also put in a warning that the number may be raised if low-quality books seem to be getting a lot of votes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:43, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remote control is about controlling a robot (or any other electronic device) from a distance, either with or without a wire.
Remote control methods can be split into two categories: wireless and wired. 

===Wired Remote Control===
Wired remote control or tethered control can be the right way to interface a computer with a stationary robot. For mobile robots the cable can become a burden for the robot.

====Issues With Wired Remote Control====

=====Limited Range=====
*Electric signals transferred over a wire lose energy because of the wires resistance. The result is that the amplitude of the signal decreases as distance increases. 
*Reflections can be a problem when the data rate is high. This means a previous signal doesn't disappear before the next is transmitted. This is why transmission lines are &quot;terminated&quot; with a resistor to ground. 
*Interference is caused by the magnetic fields of other conductors or capacitive coupling of high speed signals in other conductors. Shielding cables reduces interference, as does using differential signals (instead of using amplitude relative to ground to transmit '1's and '0's, using amplitude between 2 signal wires) through a twisted pair of conductors.

=====Mechanical Issues With Cables=====
* Cables have fixed number of wires in them, if you need more, you'll have to replace the whole cable, which can be very time consuming.
* Cables have a certain stiffness. The thicker the cable the more force you need to apply to bend the cable.
* Cables have a weight. This can make it hard for smaller robots to drag it around.
* They can get in the way of the robot.

====Methods====
Many of the mechanical issues of cables can be reduced by using thin cables with as few conductors as possible. Ideally such a cable would have only 3 or 4 conductors: Ground, power and one or 2 signal wires. See [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Networks|Networks]] for sending multiple signals through as few wires as possible.

====Advantages====
By using a cable you get around the problem of heavy batteries. The robot can be powered by an AC-outlet. Another benefit of a tether is the ability to easily use a PC to control the robot.

===Wireless Remote Control===
{{merge | Robotics/Communication Sensors}}

====IR====
IR remote control is the best known form of wireless remote control. It's  cheap and reliable, but limited to line-of-sight communication.
Complete IR-receiver modules, like the TSOP1736, are available cheaply and can be interfaced with most controllers without much extra components. TV remote controls using RC5 (Phillips) can be used with such modules.
If you want a faster data link, IRDA components could boost it significantly. Bluetooth and Wifi have replaced it on modern laptops, but IRDA components are still available.

====RF====
RF is widely known in model race cars, Wifi, and various other applications. These days complete RF transmitter/receiver modules are available at reasonable low prices. These modules are very easy to use and have ranges of around 100m depending on their environment. RF remote controls for high end model race cars have larger range but are much more expensive and limited in their use.&lt;BR&gt;
While it is definitely possible to build RF transmitters from scratch, this is not advisable. Radio frequencies are strictly governed and building a transmitter that uses the wrong frequency quickly leads to a fine or worse. Know what you're allowed to do, before building one of these.
It is possible to use a wireless telephone to provide an RF connection to your robot. The major restriction being data rates limited to 9.6kbaud or so.

====Speech Recognition====
In essence speech recognition is a form of remote control. Probably one of the hardest forms of remote control, but also one of the most impressive ones. Although today there are modules that contain a full speech recognition system capable of learning a dozen commands, those systems are still very limited as they can't handle sentences (just commands), need to be trained before they are useful and usually can only be used by one person.

====Sound====
Sound can also be used as remote control, generating a tone of a particular frequency isn't hard, building a receiver to detect this tone isn't too difficult either. Sounds like whistling and clapping hands have been used for remote control before (e.g. the keyring which makes a sound when you whistle).

===Network control===

A further step would be to do the control over a network, from another device. This could be a wired network, like RS-232, RS-485  or Ethernet, or a wireless one, as WLAN, Bluetooth or ZigBee.

This Wikibook deals with climate change, in particular the recent climate change that is also referred to as &quot;global warming&quot;. If you care to share your knowledge of this topic, please contribute.

Although this book is still in a very preliminary state, we seem to be moving toward a cohesive structure. The book is really two parts: first, a primer on the science of climate change, and second, a study of societal implications of climate change. The first part deals with much more concrete, physically based principles. As such, it can be developed more easily. The second part is potentially more controversial, but not necessarily so; for the early stages of development, the second part should probably be limited to generalities and external links. 

{{NOTE|Climate Change refers to the changing of weather patterns relative to location, time and to an increase in previously fringe events, this is sometimes generally referred to as  &quot;Global Warming&quot;. Global Warming is the warming of the globe (world) in [[w:Median|median]] terms (it does not require that its always hot but that the median of hight temperatures is risings) and it is one of the causes of climate change.}}

'''Barbecuing''' is cooking food with dry heat and hardwood smoke. Spices, a marinade, or sauce may be applied to the food as part of the process. Any heat source can be used, but [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilling]] as a barbecue method is hotly debated in most of the US. In places like eastern N.C. and Texas, they believe grilling is not a barbecue method.  Using hardwood will infuse foods with a rich smoky flavor. Different woods will affect the flavor and cooking time. What woods to use is completely up to you as long as its hardwood. Charcoal can provide more predictable cooking times, the smoke flavor, but without the unique flavors that wood offers. Gas and electricity can allow more temperature control than charcoal and wood, but like charcoal doesn't provide the rich flavor that wood offers. What method and heat source you use is completely up to you. Many people also argue about what meat to use. In eastern N.C., they consider only the whole hog to be barbecue, while in Texas they only consider beef to be barbecue (Sorry about the repeated references to N.C. and Texas.). However, for the common American, barbecue means pork.

Many commercial BBQ sauces are actually sugar-based, not tomato based. Therefore, I don't advise coating your food in commercial based sauce right before you cook it unless you want food burnt on the outside, but raw on the inside.

__NOTOC__

== Introduction ==

[[w:MATLAB|MATLAB]] ([http://www.mathworks.com/ The MathWorks]) is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation. Its syntax is close to that of matrix algebra, making the code an effective pseudo-code for the algorithms, and leading to fast development times.

The [[SPM|SPM software]] is a collection of MATLAB functions and thus requires the MATLAB software to be installed on your computer in order to run. SPM requires only core MATLAB to run ('''no special toolboxes are required''' - unless stated otherwise).

See the [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/requirements.html System Requirements page] for a list of suitable platforms to run MATLAB and the [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html Platform Roadmap] for the correspondence between MATLAB versions and supported platforms. 

Each SPM version was written for a particular MATLAB version and will not work with earlier versions. MATLAB versions released after SPM can have some peculiarities but SPM developers try to provide compatibility fixes in the updates (at least for recent SPM versions).

== MEX files ==

Whilst the majority of the code is implemented as standard MATLAB M-files, SPM also uses external MEX files, written in C, to perform some of the more computationally intensive operations. Pre-compiled binaries of these external C-MEX routines are provided for several platforms and correspond to files with extensions ''.mexwin32'', ''.mexwin64'', ''.mexglx'', ''.mexa64'', ''.mexmac'', ''.mexmaci'', ''.mexmaci64'', ''.mexsol'', ''.mexs64''.

If the compiled MEX-files are provided for your platform, then SPM should work straight out of the box. If they are not provided or if they appear to be incompatible with your system, then you will need to create the MEX files using a [http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release/ suitable C compiler] and the Makefile provided with the SPM distribution. To do so, follow the indications given in these pages for the corresponding platform:

[[w:GNU_Octave|Octave]] and [[w:Scilab|Scilab]] are free open source numerical analysis software similar to MATLAB, but SPM does not currently run on them. Porting SPM to these environments should be feasible but would require an important investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Notices by every lightswitch encouraging people to turn lights off whenever they leave a room.
* Lights in communal areas (toilets, corridors, etc.) timed to switch off automatically outside office hours.  Perhaps install a movement sensor to switch the lights back on again for a few minutes.
* Radiators to be turned off in toilets.
* Powersave mode activated on all monitors so they are switched off automatically after a period of inactivity.
* Encouragement to turn off all monitors and computers overnight unless absolutely necessary. (leaving one computer on every night for a year produces an excess of about 400 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so an office of 100 people could save about 40 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year just by turning off their PCs every night (0.2 kW x 14 hours x 365 days x 0.43 kg CO_&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kWh = 440 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year)
* Greater recycling provision, e.g. paper recycling box in every office, plastic/glass recycling in kitchen/common room.  It's important to be able to recycle news papers and cardboard as well as just office paper.
* Signs in the communal kitchens saying: &quot;Only fill the kettle with as much water as you need.  Never boil more water than you need.  If the kettle is on for only 2 minutes per boil then you emit about 100 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; every year.  If it's on for 4 minutes per boil then you emit 200kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  (2 kW x 365 days per year x (2 min/60 h/min) x 10 times per day x 0.43 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kilowatt hour = 105 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year)&quot;
* Encourage people to buy LCD screens rather than CRT (17&quot; LCD uses ~40 watts; 17&quot; CRT uses ~250 watts; CRT uses 6 times more power)
* Bring own kitchenware. Avoid using paper/foam cups or plastic forks and spoons.
* Set-up box for collecting electronic waste. Those will increase the rate of recycling batteries, electric bulbs, and also reusing some of old electronics.

The book of the month for '''February''' is '''[[Lucid Dreaming]]'''.

[[Lucid Dreaming]] is dreaming while you are aware you are dreaming. This allows you to control your dreams and have fantastical experiences.

The lucid dreaming wikibook gives you all the information you need about improving your dream recall, inducing lucid dreams, and using them to do whatever you want. There are also external references from which you can learn more.

&quot;Very nice book: very complete and useful, and also well written!&quot; - [http://ld4all.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7 Johan]

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Only fill the kettle with the minimum amount of water.  Never boil more water than you need.  If the kettle is on for only 2 minutes per boil then you emit about 100kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; every year.  If it's on for 4 minutes per boil then you emit 200kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  (maths: 2kW x 365 days per year x (2minutes / 60) hours x 10 times per day x 0.43 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kiloWatt hour = 105 kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year)
* boil water in the microwave instead of the stove top.
* Turn the cooker down as low as you can.  For example, if you're boiling an egg then put the gas / hob on full until the water boils, and then reduce the heat.  The water will continue to boil but you'll be using less energy.
* Next time you need to replace a light bulb, use a fluorescent lamp instead of an incandescent lamp. A 20 watt fluorescent lamp gives as much light as a 60 watt incandescent lamp &amp;mdash; an incandescent lamp converts only 10% of its power into light; most of the rest gets converted into  heat. (But because of this, switching to a fluorescent lamp may make the room feel colder.)
* Reduce the number of lamps in a room. One 60 watt lamp may provide sufficient light instead of two 40 watt lamps.
* Consider solar power. But do the homework in terms of cost and benefit before making a decision.
* Use ''Energy Star''-compliant and similarly energy-efficient appliances.
* Use rechargeable batteries. This reduces the number of dead batteries to be trashed, and hence the amount of hazardous chemicals in landfills.
* If your home computer doesn't need to be 'always on' (e.g., it is not used for work), consider consolidating your computer usage to only a few hours every day. Turn the computer off the rest of the day.
* Use draft instead of air conditioning during hot days.
* Plant a tree(s) so shadow will reduce heat during hot days.
* In the winter, set your thermostat at 68 degrees in the daytime and  55 degrees at night. In the summer, keep it at 78.
* Showering uses up 40% less water than a bath.
* Install low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators.
* Wash full loads in your dishwasher and use short cycles for all but the dirtiest dishes.
* Set the appropriate water level for different size loads in your clothes washer, wash in cold water when practical, and always rinse in cold.
* Don't use dryer to dry you clothes after washing. Let them dry themselves on hangers or rope in natural way.
* Wrap your water heater in a water heater blanket, especially if it's located in an unheated part of the house. This prevents heat loss  through radiation.
* Opt-out from unwanted mailings: credit card offers, free newspapers, catalogs, advertisement, etc.
* Use Internet for latest news or library for newspaper/magazine articles.
* Bring reusable bags with you when you need to visit stores.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{EM}}
The Open-Content Textbook of Emergency Medicine (OCTEM) has been launched. Open-content means that anyone - doctor, nurse, PA, EMT or interested layperson - can write chapters, edit existing chapters, and even re-organize the text. I am writing to you today to invite you to take part: jump right in and write or edit a chapter today.

&lt;nowiki&gt; http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Emergency_Medicine &lt;/nowiki&gt;

You might be thinking, “this open-source formula might sound like chaos, like a disaster . . . “. Read on to find out why it won’t be.

The OCTEM is based upon the same system used to create the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page| Wikipedia]. From its inception in 2001 the Wikipedia has outgrown establishment encyclopedias such as Encarta, Brittanica and Merriam Webster. It has more entries, and also receives more traffic. Here’s why:

On the internet, for the most part, readers struggle with bad information crowding out good information. You might think this would be a real problem on Wikipedia, where anyone can create and edit entries. But in practice good information usually drives out bad on the Wikipedia. Inaccuracies, gross bias and other problems are picked up by a large and interested body of readers who are also editors. For every one person who might introduce an innaccuracy one some topic, there are many more people who are passionately interested in that topic, who are ready to find and remedy errors, inaccuracies and vandalism.
Note that the “Wiki” model takes some pressure off authors. Chapters don’t have to be completely finished when they’re first put online. Sections can be missing, citations incomplete. In other words, works-in-progress are placed on the site. While you’re working on a chapter, you may find someone else working alongside you, adding and revising as you go. It’s an unusual form of collaboration, and it bears unusual fruit.

Of course, it can be unsettling to work this way. You have to get used to the idea that someone else can revise your work, or add to it, at any time. No-one “owns” the content. However, if you’re the first to start writing on a topic, or you contribute the bulk of the writing, you certainly can claim authorial credit.

In order to write and edit chapters you have to be able to do some basic things: create headings, lists, footnotes. The Wiki system is designed so that computer numbskulls pick it up almost instantly. About fifteen minutes is enough to know how to do these basic things. I have summarized some of them below, and have provided a link for people who want to learn more.

Please [[User:Paris Lovett| contact me]] with any questions. And please email your friends in medicine and related fields who might have something to contribute to this textbook. Thank you,

Paris Lovett

== Here is a quick guide to contributing to the OCTEM: ==

== Getting Started, Editing and Creating Chapters: ==
#To get started, visit [[Emergency Medicine]]
#Look for your topic on the home page, in the appropriate subheading. If something has already been written, it will appear in blue or purple, if nothing has been written it will appear in red.
#To start a new chapter, click on a red link. That's all it takes. You can start writing your chapter right away.
#If a chapter has already been begun, clicking on the link will allow you to start editing it.
#If you want to write a chapter that doesn't yet appear as a link, create a link by editing the home page (please be careful when doing this!). Paste in a new link under the appropriate subheading. For instance, to create a new chapter on Chest Tube, paste a line under the subheading &quot;Treatment&quot; which looks like this:&lt;br&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Emergency Medicine/Chest Tube| Chest Tube]], &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; Submit the edit to the home page. Then follow the new link you created. Presto! you have a new chapter.
#A nice feature of the Wiki system is that you can view all previous versions of a page. And you can hold discussions attached to each page. For instance, when controversy exists, you can click on the “Discuss this page” link and type in your thoughts. Others will respond. It becomes a forum for creatively engaging differences of opinion and reaching consensus on how to present those differences in the actual chapter. Look for plenty of such discussion on such topics as NEXUS versus Canadian C-spine rule!
#This page offers more help on this topic: [[Help:Starting a new page or book]]
#I have created a template for chapters. You are free to use this or not use this. It has subheadings such as symptoms, signs, investigations, etc.
#Wherever possible, please include evidence (EBM) on the performance of symptoms, signs, labs, treatments. Likelihood ratios, where known, are particularly valuable, as are number-needed-to-treat and other information.

== The Wiki Format: ==
#Wikibooks have only a few special tips for formatting. It’s kept simple on purpose. You can basically enter normal text and add just a few characters here and there for formatting.
#Here’s how to create headings and subheadings:
##To create a heading, add = signs like this: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; == Management == &lt;/nowiki&gt;
##To create a sub-headings, and sub-sub headings, use more = signs like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Cardioversion === &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;==== Emergency Cardioversion ==== &lt;/nowiki&gt;
#To create lists:
##Bullet lists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*Lists are easy to do: &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;** start every line with a star &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*** more stars means deeper levels&lt;/nowiki&gt;
##Numbered lists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# Numbered lists are also good &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;## very organized &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;## easy to follow &lt;/nowiki&gt;
#To add footnotes/references/links to documents on the web (not in the OCTEM):
##To add a footnote to a document on the web (not in the OCTEM), just enclose the URL in square brackets like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15635313] &lt;/nowiki&gt; and it will be converted to a footnote [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15635313].
##Actually, in the above example, for PubMed references, it's even simpler. Just type in &lt;nowiki&gt; PMID 15635313 &lt;/nowiki&gt; and you'll get a link that looks like this: PMID 15635313 .
##To add a link to a document on the web, and have it appear as a link, not a footnote, do the same think as in (a) but after the URL put a space and then type in a name for the link. For instance &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15635313 The Vexatious Vital]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will appear as “[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15635313 The Vexatious Vital]” underlined, and linking to the PubMed URL.
##You are encouraged to use links to the NLM/PubMed whenever possible.
#To add a link to another chapter/page in the OCTEM
##Here is an example: &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Emergency Medicine/Cardioversion| chapter on cardioversion]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;
##In the example in above the link will be to a page called Cardioversion. It doesn’t even matter if the page has been created or not yet. If the page has been created, it will link there. If the page has not been created, anyone who follows the link will have the opportunity to create it.
##Basically, the words between the / and the | refer to the actual page/chapter name you’re linking to. And the words after the | determine how the link will look. So in the example in (a) you’ll get the words “[[Emergency Medicine/Cardioversion| chapter on cardioversion]]” underlined as a link to the chapter called “Cardioversion”. And it doesn’t even matter whether or not someone has created that chapter yet!
#Here’s how to make big text or small text
##&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt; Remember to order a CXR after placing the central line&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
##&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt; The material in this textbook has not been checked for accuracy or safety &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#You need an empty line between paragraphs. So hit the enter button twice.
#Indent: use a colon : at the beginning of the paragraph
#Images: 
##You have to choose a name for your image such as steakknifeinheart.jpg 
##Make sure that no-one has already uploaded an image with the same name, so you don’t erase it. You can search at this page: [[commons:Special:Imagelist|Special:Imagelist]]
##once you’ve picked a name for your image, you can upload images at the following link: [[commons:Commons:Upload | Upload an image to Wikimedia Commons]]
##you can then display those images by including the following line in your page/chapter: &lt;nowiki&gt; [[image:steakknifeinheart.jpg]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;
##For more details look at [[Help:Editing]]

----

You can usually learn what you need to do by looking at existing pages (in the OCTEM or in other wikibooks or on Wikipedia) and clicking the “edit” link. That will show you how people created lists, formatted text, placed images, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computers for Beginners==

I've moved this back to something closer to the original title 'Never used a Computer'. This book is about flat-out basics for absolute beginners. For a more specific tutorial on Windows XP, go to [[Windows XP for Beginners]]. -- Klafubra 23:34, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:If it is to bear the name &quot;Computers for Beginners&quot; then it should be about COMPUTERS in general&amp;#8212;hardware, basic graphical user interface concepts, and software concepts.  I am very irked by the use of terminology like &quot;double-clicking the c: drive&quot; to explain file systems or whatever other nonsense is herein written.  All of the Windows XP crap should be moved out of a book called &quot;Computers for Beginners&quot;. A subsection of this book could be &quot;Operating Systems&quot; which MIGHT introduce operating system basics.  If nothing else, it could point to &quot;Windows for Beginners&quot; (note the lack of self-dating references!), &quot;Macs for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Linux for Beginners&quot;, etc. etc.&amp;#8212;[[User:Kbolino|Kbolino]] 06:13, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Miscellaneous ==

As a passing comment, it may be worthwhile to have a section on how to explore in a computer. In the limited sample of my family members and friends, those that are computer illiterate are most afraid of breaking the computer, which makes them afraid to try out new things. I'd argue that the ability to explore a computer on your own is a key skill to get anywhere in using a computer. The section could have some info like what is safe to do, what you should avoid doing, ways to try out things if you don't know what they do, etc.

--[[User:Naerbnic|Naerbnic]] 21:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Help my bewk. We could be 1337 together. ^_^;;
--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 04:02, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Naerbnic - That's a great idea. I'll try to fit it in somewhere sometime.
Cyberman - I'm kind of busy with my book, but I'll check yours out and see if I can add anything. By the way, I know nothing about A+ cerfification. :-)
[[Special:Contributions/83.28.52.96|83.28.52.96]] ([[User talk:83.28.52.96|discuss]]) 23:45, 10 January 2012 (UTC)
--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 23:05, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I wrote a bit on web browsing, but there is a paradox here. If the poor computer-illiterate doesn't even know how to browse the web, how are they even reading this book anyway?! I think wikibooks really needs an easy way to export PDFs or something, books like this one can be printed and given out to under-developed countries etc.

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 18:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

First of all Sideris, you should move your bit on web browsing to the actual chapter instead of the TOC. Also, I copied the text from the website, put it in OOo Writer, and exported it as a pdf. This worked okay, but it would be better if there was a program that would take the source for the wikibook and make a pdf out of it.

--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 17:09, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes, sorry I put it in the TOC, it was a moment of confusion :-) I will move it when I find some free time. About printing: it is easy to print one-page articles from wikipedia in the way you described, but the structure that wikibooks follow would make printing one whole wikibook very tedious. You need a program for that (and again, if I find the time, I'll sit down and write it myself!)

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 11:54, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

We need something that can teach children how to use the computer.

== Paradox ==

I agree with kram that there is a paradox here - how can a person who doesn't &quot;know how to move a mouse&quot; browse through this?

==Windows XP for Beginners==

I moved this here because: almost all new computer users will have Windows XP, it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems, and it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Also, do you really think that anyone who is new to computers would use Linux, I mean, come on, get serious- new users dont go out and buy Linux, period.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::They don't go out and buy ''any'' OS, period. They do get Linux on the $199 Walmart computers though, and they get MacOS X on Macs.

::Okay, smartguy, yes, they do buy an OS sometimes, but no, not when getting a computer.  And no one who buys that $199 computer with linux will be happy they did-they are bad for new users, ''period''.  And there's a reason you never see ''REAL'' books about all kinds of different OS's, for instance, ''maybe'' you might see Mac OS X and Windows, but you can't describe how to use the trillion plus linux os's in one book (well, since they all are just Windows 98-GUI clones, maybe you can).--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't see why you think so. Maybe ''you'' would not like a Linux computer. Somebody expecting to run a particular Windows-only game will of course be unhappy. The modern Linux box can do all the basic grandma tasks though. If you're thinking about the command line (like a fancy DOS box, ugh), you haven't seen a modern end-user-oriented Linux distribution.

:::It may be news to you, but many people only use the web browser. Consider that this provides email access, online tax prep, all the forums one could want, flash-based games for the grandkids, wikipedia, and so on. Linux boxes even continue functioning long after they are purchased, while Windows boxes are often replaced because of spyware-related slowdowns and crashes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::After playing with ubuntu for awhile, I've honestly considered installing it on my grandmother's computer, as it is actually EASIER to use in many ways than Windows XP, at least for most tasks a basic (read;Non-professional/gaming) user will need. I'd like to know where you get the idea that all Linux OS are clones of Win98- Quite a few have more complex GUIs, or different GUIs altogether. Just because something uses windows doesn't mean it's a   Windows ripoff. Actually, if anything, MSWin ripped off Xwindows. X was released in 1984, and the first Windows OS to have actual windows was released in 1987. --[[User:69.247.164.232|69.247.164.232]] 06:53, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I'm okay with the name change, but there is some Linux information in the book already. Should it be removed? --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 21:01, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:If this book aims to about Windows XP, then anything not about windows xp should not be here. So I deleted a section on creating symbolic links in linux. Delete any more if you find 'em. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:48, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

At least until someone creates a [[Linux for Beginners]].  I'm sorry I changed it without saying anything, but to me it just seemed common sense.  If I offended someone, I'm sorry.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)


I don't think the change by [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] was a good idea.  I would like to change it back to ''Never Used a Computer''.
Here is why:

* Windows XP will be obsolete in a few years. It would be nice to make this book a bit more generic and future proof.

* This books includes info about hardware, as it should. Absolute beginners need to be informed about hardware just as much as software. They also find it hard to distinguish between hardware and software, so both should be included in the same book.

* There is a lot more to computers than just the operating system. The info on the internet is totally independent of the operating system.

*  Naryathegreat says it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems. As the original name implied, the book is meant for absolute square-one beginners. They don't need to be taught ''accurately'' about any operating system. They only need to  know the very basics, which are similar enough for XP, Linux and MacOS.  It is not hard to include supplementary info where there are differences. Why do we need to exclude non-Windows users categorically if they can be catered for with little effort?

* Naryathegreat says almost all new computer users will have Windows XP. What he has failed to ask is whether people reading ''this'' book will have Windows XP. People in developing nations will find this book more useful than people in the West who can afford tutorials. We should also aim this book at the vast population in developing nations purchasing the &quot;100 dollar PC&quot; over the next few years, most likely a Linux PC.

* Naryathegreat says it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway. Not it's not. There is a large section on hardware and the internet in general, and some users are already trying to delete the section because of the name. 

I have nothing against a book called ''Windows XP for Beginners and Intermediates'' but this does not seem to be the intention of this book.
-- [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 18:33, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==

Hi there, you have a nice book that grows well. I'd like to suggest two things: 
# On the main page, you don't have to put links to subpages into &lt;nowiki&gt;[[sections]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It just invites people to click on the &quot;edit&quot; button to the right and put their information to the wrong place, and you have to write this &quot;If you want to add stuff, click on the chapter please!&quot; line, which, frankly, I have not seen on other Wikibooks. Why? Because they don't use headings for links. Have a look at these simple examples: [[Hamster Care]], [[How To Build A Computer]], [[CPAM with TWW]], ...
# There are several ways to organize books (see the current discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]), but I would recommend you to change to a more standardized delimiter, using either &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. The latter (subpages via &quot;/&quot;) will give you the additional benefit of an autmatic link back to the main page of your book. Your subpages would then be organized as
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Introduction]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Buying A Computer]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Flat Out Basics]]
and so on. (You can move pages easily with the &quot;move&quot; command on top of the page, once you are logged in). If you need any help or advice, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:05, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Andreas, I think I'll fix the layout right now. --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 15:53, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:On the [[How To Build A Computer]] wikibook, we have a simplified TOC, then a link to the more complete TOC. I think that would be a good idea for this book too. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:43, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Removal of Computer Buying 101 Chapter ==

Since it's about XP, and not Computer Buying 101, I believe the &quot;Buying a Computer&quot; section isn't really appropriate for this book. --icez

This book was originally for people who never used a computer. [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] then insisted on calling it Windows XP for Beginners.
I do think it is appropriate to include hardware because a) beginners find it hard to distingush between hardware and software b) beginners will
find the information very useful. [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 17:56, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== The past and the future. ==

Windows is past, GNU/Linux is future... :-)

--[[User:Gengiskanhg|Gengiskanhg]] 23:32, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Right on, Gengiskanhg. I stopped working on this book shortly after it was renamed to Windows XP for Beginners, and I think I'll come back now. But let's not start a flame war on the talk page. --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 22:45, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Relevance ==

Many of the topics are only relevant to Windows. I have worked on it a little today and have found it difficult to expand some of the criteria to other operating systems. The theory is good to know, but specific examples are also nice. Perhaps a disclaimer to the user telling them that many examples in the book are using Windows XP?

== Possible Fork ==

Before I started my book [[Basic Computing Using Windows]] I was ''sure'' I checked for other similar existant books... but I only found this one today.  I'm not sure if my book really forks this one or if they are different enough to leave separate, but I have a hunch they have a lot of duplicate material -- [[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Singpolyma|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Singpolyma|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

== programming ==

I am in favor of more people learning at least a little about programming.
However, I suspect that subject is outside the scope of this book.
I think we should, instead, finish the book with
&quot;Congratulations! You're no longer a beginner!&quot;
and suggest the next books towards becoming an expert --
books such as [[Web Design]] and [[Computer programming]] and perhaps [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python]].

Are there any objections to ripping the &quot;[[Computers for Beginners/Programming]]&quot; module out of this book and putting it into some more relevant book?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:31, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

== Just an idea ==

Maybe it is half wrong... putting some OS-specific info here, in this book ?

My idea is that ''Computers for beginners'' does not necessarily imply ''&lt;OS here&gt; for beginners''
The most info we should include about OS's are a definition and maybe only general description, but also common OS pieces of advice, like a windowed graphical interface and interaction between the user and the machine.

Programming is just going too far. Considering this book targets beginners, it should be as simple and concise as it can.

Also, I disagree that Linux is not approachable to beginners. I admit, in the very short time I tried to use it, I didn't even manage to install or build applications on certain flavors, but if I'd have really been interested, I would have read some info on the Internet... however, for browsing the web and editing documents it does an almost perfect job. Many computer beginners would appreciate a tutorial on using a free (I don't know if they really care about the ''open'' part) OS, don't you?

Another point is that I, for example, prefer Windows 2000 over XP. I only use XP because it is a dependency of the latest Visual Studio, which I use to program. I'd rather not restrict to XP in this article since there are still many computers running older OS's.

That being said, I was thinking about writing something like this since I often come into people who buy a computer but look at the mouse as if it were a radio (I sold computers in the past) and some think that the screen is the one that does the processing part... and that has to change. I'd gladly help edit this book, but I've never done it before and I'm not going to start right now. Still, I'm interested and I will keep an eye on it for the future though. I really want to help.

So, are you with me or against me when I say that we should have a separate book about '''computers''' and different books for different '''OS's''' ?

This should also answer the question of whether to integrate this article in the ''Basic computing using windows'' book




:I agree with your first sentence. This book should be vendor and technology neutral. For specific operating systems its best to write separate books, and link them from this book. This also applies to computer hardware, it should not be specific to IBM compatible PC's but it should also descibe different kinds of computers, for example what server and mainframes are, what smartphone is, etc, it should explain what user interface is, and should not mention only GUI, or monitor+keyboard, but also teletype, touchscreen, etc...it should mention most popular technologies.
:This book should explain basic concepts about computers like: user interface, operating system, application, processor, central processing unit, peripherial processor or device, main memory, storage memory, hardware, software. etc...

:About programming - it should be mentioned and explained what does it mean.

:About &quot;open part&quot; - I think that it should be explained what open source means, and it should explain technical merits, and benefits of this aproach for users and programmers..</text>

This module contains information that is specific to OpenBSD.
==Background==
'''OpenBSD''' calls itself the &quot;multi-platform, ultra-secure operating system&quot;. The OpenBSD team believes in strong security and code correctness. The OpenBSD team has a between six and twelve developers working on finding bugs and security holes in the system. OpenBSD also strives to be secure by default, meaning that the user does not have to be a security expert to secure the system. The OpenBSD project normally makes a new version every six months.

OpenBSD is known for having strict rules regarding bugs. Such as an application, not having a manual is considered a bug and therefore the application will not be included in the port (or package) tree. These rules are also included in the operating system. Should an application pose a security risk OpenBSD will kill the process on the spot. If there is a bug, and it is announced on the mailing list, then the OpenBSD team will come out with a patch in a matter of days. OpenBSD has only had two remotly exploitable bugs (both were in ssh and soon there afterwards patched), after a default install (with no additional services turned on) in over 10 years.

===Notable Security Features===
*strlcpy() and strlcat()
*Memory protection purify
:*W^X
:*.rodata segment
:*Guard pages
:*Randomized malloc()
:*Randomized mmap()
:*atexit() and stdio protection 
*Privilege separation
*Privilege revocation
*Chroot jailing
*New uids
*ProPolice

==Installation==
{{main|Guide to Unix/BSD/OpenBSD/OpenBSD Installation}}
OpenBSD has a easy although non-graphical installer.
===Customization===
{{main|Guide to Unix/BSD/OpenBSD/Customize Installation}}
You can change the default configuration files and install additional packages, by creating your own custom iso file.

==As a firewall==
{{main|Guide to Unix/BSD/OpenBSD/As a Firewall}}
OpenBSD uses '''pf''' (&quot;packet filter&quot;) as a firewall. Though the authors originally contributed pf to OpenBSD, because it is free, other operating systems are including pf.

==As a webserver==
{{main|Guide to Unix/BSD/OpenBSD/As a Webserver}}
As of [http://www.openbsd.org/56.html OpenBSD 5.6], OpenBSD ships with [http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/usr.sbin/httpd/ its own webserver], [http://mdoc.su/o/httpd.8 httpd(8)].  A hardened [http://ports.su/www/apache-httpd-openbsd fork of Apache 1.3] (was in base prior to 5.6), upstream [http://ports.su/www/apache-httpd Apache 2.2], [http://ports.su/www/nginx nginx] (in base prior to upcoming 5.7) and other webservers are available from [http://ports.su/ ports].

==As a desktop==
{{main|Guide to Unix/BSD/OpenBSD/As a Desktop}}
Despite is reputation for being only for servers OpenBSD can also serve as a great workstation/desktop. OpenBSD uses pkg_add as their binary package management system. The pkg_add automatically resolves dependencies. If you get the packages from ftp, pkg_add is able to resolve all of the dependencies for you. Some of the desktop related packages in the binary package system include: KDE (3.5), Xfce, Gnome, fluxbox, blackbox, and e16. Many other packages are available through the port system which also resolves and compiles the dependencies for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Woops. Your right. Can't grease pan with apple sauce. =)

At any rate, shortening is terribly unsafe for human digestion and I am definitely making alternatives VERY clear in this article, not just because I've researched shortening, but because I've completed this recipe with using vegetable oil and butter, and apple sauce, and they tasted fabulous!

[[User:Yeago|Yeago]] 02:25, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Oh, come on. Maybe it is not good for you. Perhaps it is worse than oil, or even worse than beef fat. It is however quite easy to show that shortening is not terribly unsafe for human digestion. Look around you. People typically live way past 40, and often past 90. With shortening being such a big part of the normal modern diet, that is proof enough that it is not terribly unsafe for human digestion.

Please don't go vandalizing recipes. The shortening page, linked to from this recipe and others, mentions the issue appropriately and suggests alternatives. There is no need for every recipe involving the stuff to contain a rant about ''trans'' fatty acids and heart disease. Heck, even before the recent research, shortening wasn't exactly considered a health food. The same goes for cookies in general, with or without shortening.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Paris,

Welcome to WikiBooks!

I'm glad to see the work you've done so far on OCTEM.  It seems like quite an undertaking, and I'm excited to see how it progresses.  I'm also a doc and I'm working on a textbook of [[Radiation Oncology]].

Just to let you know, the Wiki markup language now makes linking to articles on PubMed easy.  You don't have to type out the long URL any more, but just need to type '''&lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 15635313&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' instead of the much more cumbersome URL http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15635313.  

This will create an automatic link that looks like: PMID 15635313

Also, on Wikipedia, there's a new template that allows the creation of old-school footnotes.  If you want to give actual references in your text instead of just providing a link, you might want to check out [[w:Wikipedia:Footnotes]].  

Best of luck on your textbook! &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 17:04, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</text>

To help you to get some actors for your movie, you're going to need some Casting Directors. Casting Directors are the people who help pick out people to act in your movie. The Casting Directors hold auditions to get actors to act out a snippet of the script and the person who does it best gets picked for the movie.

===Where do I get actors?===

One of the best places to announce auditions, is of course institutions like drama/theater schools. Also use online community forums like [http://pro.imdb.com IMDB Pro].

Drama students can often be convinced to do a movie very cheap or for free -- especially if it's their first and it's a low budget film.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[../Menus]]

The process for editing the applications menu in GNOME is unintuitive.  Open the Nautilus File Browser, and enter &lt;code&gt;applications-all-users:///&lt;/code&gt; into the location bar, loading up what is effectively a folder filled with Launchers, or shortcuts, which you can edit or add to, to change the layout and contents of your application menus.

In some versions of Gnome this does not work without using third-party software. To work around this you can edit menus manually, by going to &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications/&lt;/code&gt; in the file browser. This will be filled with launchers too which you can edit or add to. The downside is that, for them to appear in the Application menu at all, you must assign them to certain ''categories'' and this can only be done by editing the launcher files using a text editor.

The categories that Launchers can belong to in the menus are often easy enough to grasp, i.e. they might be the names of the sub-menus in the Application menu, and by assigning them to these categories, the Launcher will appear in respective sub-menus in the Application menu. However the category names are not always obvious, so you might have to have a look at the contents of existing Launchers to tell for certain.

Launchers, or ''.desktop'' files are essentially text files which contain data, i.e. for the location of the icon to use, the command to run or folder to open when the launcher is used, etc. You can open these Launchers in text editors like Gnome's. Here is an example of a Launcher, when opened in a text editor:

&lt;pre&gt;
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Mozilla Firefox
Comment=Mozilla Firefox Web Browser
Exec=/usr/bin/firefox %U
Icon=firefox-icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Application;Network;
GenericName=
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is a Launcher which starts Mozilla Firefox. As you can see, there are properties there, such as name, comment, etc. which determine the appearance and behaviour of the Launcher. When working with Launchers in Gnome, you can modify almost all of the important values just by right-clicking on the Launcher icon and selecting its properties. When you modify the Application menu from &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications/&lt;/code&gt;, this is what you should do. However, one important property, ''Categories'', you cannot modify using the Properties dialog, and so must modify in the text editor.

To assign a Launcher to a particular category, first find out exactly what the category is called, by opening up a Launcher that is already in the category. For instance if you were adding something to the ''Internet'' sub-menu in the Applications menu, you could open up the Firefox Launcher and observe that the category is called ''Network''. Also observe the entry under ''Categories'' called ''Application''. This is included as a convention also, as it might influence the behaviour of other versions of Gnome. Into your new Launcher then you would enter the line:

&lt;pre&gt;Categories=Applications;Network;&lt;/pre&gt;

This line can go at the end of the text in the Launcher, or if there is already a Category field, you should replace the existing one with the new one. To enter a Launcher into a different category, obviously you would use different values for the Category field. Also note that if you wanted an application Launcher to appear under multiple sub-menus or Categories at once, you can simply add the other category at the end of the values you have already, remembering to separate them with semi-colons. So if you want to add this particular application to ''Network'' and ''Graphics'', you would add to the end of the existing value, &lt;code&gt;Graphics;&lt;/code&gt; so that the line would appear as so:

&lt;pre&gt;Categories=Applications;Network;Graphics;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Brownies in picture ==

To the anonymous poster of the browny picture, thanks much.  I was wondering if the &quot;cake-like&quot; brownies on the right were completely cooked?  They look somewhat undercooked from the picture.  Anyway, I hope they tasted good. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 06:15, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:(not my picture, but...) I somewhat agree about the looks. I think they also have too much oil or fat. Note that lots of people will undercook brownies because '''they don't want brownies.'''

Shoudn't this be split a little since they are different brownies?  Just have them all listed in desserts and it's all good and people can find them each.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 23:33, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

: Yes, go for it. [[User:Geo]] has done the same for [[Cookbook:Hummus]]. His disambiguation-style page could use some work, but is functional. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:03, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

'''Baking soda''' is a chemical, sodium bicarbonate, also known as bicarbonate of soda or NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It reacts with acid to produce carbon dioxide gas; this reaction is the reason for its usefulness in [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] as a leavening agent. The reaction causes little bubbles of carbon dioxide gas to form throughout a food, expanding the mass. Baking soda is used as a leavening agent in many cakes, cookies, pancakes, some breads, and other foods.

==Acids Used with Baking Soda==

As mentioned, an acidic ingredient is required to obtain the desired rising effect of baking soda. Commonly used in this role are [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]], [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]] and [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]].

==Other Culinary Uses of Baking Soda==

White baking soda is most often used for its leavening ability, it is sometimes used in the following circumstances:
* It used to be used as a source of carbon dioxide for soda water.
* It can be used when preparing tomato sauce to neutralize the tomato's acidity.
* It is added to water used to soak beans; this is said to prevent flatulence.
* It is added to water and used to soak marrowfat peas to produce mushy peas.
* It is effective in extinguishing grease fires which may occur when deep frying.
* Freshly cut fruit can be soaked in sodium bicarbonate solution for a short while to prevent yellowing.
* A small amount can be added to meat as a tenderizer, a technique common in Chinese cuisine.

===As a Component in Baking Powder===

Baking soda is often an ingredient in [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]], along with an acidic ingredient like cream of tartar, and another gas-releasing chemical that activates only when subjected to heat. Baking powder loses its leavening power very slowly, unless exposed to moisture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==GENUL / The Gender==

Romanian nouns are divided into three genders (''genuri''). They are '''masculine''' (m.), '''feminine''' (f.), '''neuter''' (n.).

Romanian pronouns and articles are only ''masculine'' and ''feminine''. When needed for neuter nouns, they use the masculine singular form and feminine plural form.

==PRONUMELE / The Pronoun==

===Pronumele Personale / Personal Pronouns===
{| style=&quot;background:#F0F0F0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:7em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; |
! style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | singular
! style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | plural

|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | 1st person
! style=&quot;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | I
! style=&quot;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | we
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| eu &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/jew/&lt;/small&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot;| noi &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/noj/&lt;/small&gt;

|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;background:#e2e4bd&quot; | 2nd person
! style=&quot;background:#e2e4bd&quot; | you
! style=&quot;background:#e2e4bd&quot; | you
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| tu &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/tu/&lt;/small&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot;| voi &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/voj/&lt;/small&gt;

|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;background:#e2e3af&quot; | 3rd person
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | he / she
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | they

|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| el / ea &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/jel/  /je̯a/&lt;/small&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot;| ei / ele &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;/jej/  /jele/&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In Romanian there isn't a neuter pronoun for inanimate things. Either '''el''' or '''ea''' is used, depending on the gender of the noun.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ei''' is used when at least one of the beings referred is masculine. Use '''ele''' only when all beings referred to are feminine and/or neutre.

===Pronumele de politeţe / Polite pronouns===
{| style=&quot;background:#F0F0F0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:7em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; |
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | singular and plural

|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | 2nd person
! style=&quot;width:10em;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | full
! style=&quot;background:#e2e4cb&quot; | abbreviated
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| Dumneavoastră
| align=&quot;center&quot;| Dvs.
|}

Remember when writing to capitalise Dumneavoastră. This pronoun always demands its verb to be at the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; person &lt;b&gt;plural&lt;/b&gt; form. The singular form of the verb may be perceived as disrespectful, even rude.

{| style=&quot;background:#F0F0F0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:7em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; |
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width:16em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | singular
! style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | plural
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;background:#e2e3af&quot; | 3rd person
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | he
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | she
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | they
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| dumnealui
| align=&quot;center&quot;| dumneaei
| align=&quot;center&quot;| dumnealor
|}

====Colloquial====
* dumneata / mata / matale - you (sg.)&lt;br&gt;
These pronouns don't require the verb to be at the plural form, though this is considered more respectul. The pronouns themselves are more polite than '''tu''', but less polite than '''Dumneavoastră'''.

==ARTICOLUL / The Article==


===Articolul nehotărât / The Indefinite Article===
The indefinite article in Romanian precedes the noun.

{| style=&quot;background:#F0F0F0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | singular
! style=&quot;width:7em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | plural
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | nom/acc
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | masculine
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | feminine
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | all
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| un
| align=&quot;center&quot;| o
| align=&quot;center&quot;| nişte
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | gen/dat

| align=&quot;center&quot;|unui
| align=&quot;center&quot;| unei
| align=&quot;center&quot;| unor
|}

Because neuter nouns function as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, they take the indefinite article &quot;un/unui.&quot;

'''Male'''
* un copil (m., ''a child'')
* nişte copii (m., ''some children'')
* un bărbat (m., ''a man'')
* nişte bărbaţi (m., ''some men'')

'''Neuter'''
* un tablou (n., ''a painting'')
* nişte tablouri (n., ''some paintings'')
* un tatuaj (n., ''a tattoo'')
* nişte tatuaje (n., ''some tattoos'')

'''Feminine'''
* o casă (f., ''a house'')
* nişte case (f., ''some houses'')
* o femeie (f., ''a woman'')
* nişte femei (f,. ''some women'')

Feminine nouns take their plural forms in the singular genitive/dative case.

* casa unui bărbat (''a man's house'')
* casa unei femei (''a woman's house'')
* casa unor bărbaţi (''some men's houses'')
* casa unor femei (''some women's houses'')

===Articolul hotărât / The Definite Article===
The definite article in Romanian is enclitic (it is attached to the end of the noun).

For masculine and neuter nouns, the article is simply added to the end of the word. Note that in everyday speech, the 'l' is often left unpronounced. For instance, bărbatul (the man) would be pronounced bărbatu.
{| style=&quot;background:#F0F0F0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; |masculine and neuter
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;width:8em;background:#d1d3b0&quot; | ending
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | 
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | consonant
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | u
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | e
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | nom/acc
| align=&quot;center&quot;| -ul
| align=&quot;center&quot;| -l
| align=&quot;center&quot;| -le
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e2e3af&quot; | gen/dat

| align=&quot;center&quot;| -ului
| align=&quot;center&quot;| -lui
| align=&quot;center&quot;| -lui
|}

For feminine nouns, the last letter changes to '''a'''. In the genitive, &quot;i&quot; is added to the plural form of the noun.

* &lt;b&gt;Singular, m. &amp; n.&lt;/b&gt;: +l (''the''). The article has a ''u'' (called prosthetic) between it and the noun.
** bărbat (m., ''man'') - bărbatul
** savant (m. ''scholar'') - savantul
** tablou (n., ''painting'') - tabloul
* &lt;b&gt;Singular, m. &amp; n., ended in ''e''&lt;/b&gt;: +le (''the'').
** câine (m., ''dog'') - câinele
* &lt;b&gt;Singular, .f&lt;/b&gt;: -a (''the'').
** femeie (''woman'') - femeia
** portocală (''orange'', the fruit) - portocala


* &lt;b&gt;Plural, m.&lt;/b&gt;: +i to the indefinite plural form
** bărbaţi (''men'') - bărbaţii
* &lt;b&gt;Plural, f. &amp; n.&lt;/b&gt;: +le to the indefinite plural form
** femei (f., ''women'') - femeile
** portocale (f., ''oranges'') - portocalele
** tablouri (n., ''paintings'') - tablourile

__NOTOC__
These '''Fried Fish''' are battered and [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep-fat fried]]. You'll need thin fish filets that don't fall apart when cooked. Fried fish go well with soda (pop). They can be served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] (catsup), [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], or a mixture of the two. They could also be served with [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet-and-sour]] sauce or [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriaki]] sauce. Fried fish are a part of [[Cookbook:Fish and Chips|fish and chips]].

==Ingredients==

* ''thin'' [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] fillets (suggested: catfish, tilapia, or the less-durable flounder)
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] with a high smoke point
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] white
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]], or 1 cup cold water and 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* extra flour to dust the fish

==Procedure==
#Start heating the oil. This recipe is intended for fast cooking in very hot oil.
#Get the batter ingredients ready to mix.
#Microwave the fish, to ensure that the inside is hot. Flip the fish as you microwave it. When done, the fish should be hot and should look half-cooked.
#Mix the flour, egg white, and beer.
#Pat a fish dry with a paper towel, then lightly dust it with flour to ensure that it is really dry.
#Dip the fish, and your hand, into the batter. Coat them well. The batter will help protect your hand from splatter.
#Hold the fish right above the oil, then gently slide the fish into the oil.
#With tongs, nudge the fish as needed to keep it from sticking to the bottom. Turn the fish over as it cooks.
#Remove the fish when it looks good, then serve it immediately.

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. [[Cookbook:Soybean Oil|Soybean oil]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], and [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] withstand heat better than most cooking oils.

==Variation==
Whip the egg white, or leave it out entirely. Add [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] to the batter.

The '''Turkey Wrap''' works well as a meal for an ordinary day. Chicken may be used in place of turkey, but is not as nice and often costs more per pound.

==Ingredients==
* 8 large ([[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]-size, about 12-inch) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]].
* 6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] can of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 6 ounce (net drained weight) [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
* several [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of cooked [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]

==Procedure==
#Cut the olives in half.
#Cut the turkey into 3/4-inch chunks.
#Mix the olives and tomato paste.
#Mix in turkey, adding as much as will be covered by the paste.
#Optionally, warm the mixture.
#Place some of the mixture on a tortilla.
#Wrap the tortilla around the mixture.
#Place the finished wrap on an ungreased cookie sheet, with the exposed edge (flap) downward to prevent the wrap from coming undone before it is cooked.
#Keep making wraps as needed.
#Place the cookie sheet in an oven set to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
#Remove the wraps when they start to brown, which should be about 15 minutes.
#Let the wraps cool a bit on the outside while heat sinks into the inside.

Unicycling is a relatively safe sport but at the same time it can be as dangerous as you want it to be. If you want to learn the basics, and if you have some prior experience with exercise, it's very unlikely that you will sustain any serious injuries. 

A gym floor is probably the safest place to start practicing. In case you lose balance getting off a unicycle is easy, you just put a foot down on the ground.

Unicycle safety is a bit different from bicycle safety. People who are new to unicycling tend to use their hands as to cushion most of their falls, but this is not the ideal method to land as it's easy to sprain or even break your wrist using this method. If you don't know what you are doing, use wrist guards or at least gloves. Falling backwards is also a risk, so a helmet is recommended. 

Most beginner cycles have plastic pedals that will only cause slight pain and maybe some brusing when the inevitable happens and it smacks you in the shin, however if you have metal pedals, and in particular if you have pedals with bear claws, use leg armour. A slip from a bear claw pedal has a large possibility of tearing the skin and may require stitches. In general a bit of armour can be the difference between a painful bruise and another half hour of practice. More information about armour can be found in the [[The_Unicyclopedia:Armour_and_clothing|Armour and Clothing]] section.

Remember to '''tie your shoelaces up or tuck them away so that they don't get caught in the cranks'''. If you notice your laces are caught in the cranks, and you get off quickly you should be okay, but you shouldn't rely on noticing it in time. 

If your shoes come untied often, check out &quot;Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot&quot; for security. If your laces are too long, and the ends get caught, use one of the knots advertised as &quot;shortens laces.&quot; See those knots and more on [http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/knots.htm Ian's Shoelace Site]</text>

Rolling trials (or RT) is a yet another more recent form of unicycling. It works like normal trials in many ways, the unicyclist tries to navigate a course without stepping off the unicycle or touching the ground. The main difference between rolling trials and normal trials is that in rolling trials, you cannot hop. You are only allowed to roll along the course. This presents a new type of challange and also allows people who are not interested in learning how to hop with a chance to do trials, although hopping is, for most people, easier to learn than riding itself. It does, however, take a certain type of skill. See example courses for examples.

Unicycle racing consists of track racing, road racing, and off-road racing.

Track racing is done on a level closed-course circuit, and is governed
by IUF Rules, as well as applicable rules of national and local governing bodies.
The traditional racing class is for 24&quot; wheels with cranks no shorter than 5&quot;,
but 700c wheels and larger are allowed in some track events.
Records are kept by the IUF and Guinness World Records(TM).
Races include sprints, medium distances up to 1600m, and open time records
(e.g. 1, 12 and 24 hour records).  There are backwards as well as forward races,
slow as well as fast, and even obstacle courses.

Road racing is generally limited to the 10K (6.2 miles) for official races,
but longer races are also becoming popular.  Road racing can be done on
any open course, either out &amp; back, or point A to point B.  Road racing
can and often does include hill climbs.  There are no wheel size limits.

Off-road racing on MUnis is very popular, and many unicyclists have
participated in mountain bike races of all distances and degrees of
difficulty.  MUni racing can consist solely of a hill climb, to cross-country
style, to downhill.  Equipment is generally unlimited, and usually includes
wide knobby tires and well-padded saddles.

Riding a big wheel, generally regarded as 29&quot; and bigger, is generally fairly simple once you are up and riding. However, mounting can be significantly trickier, as you are sitting higher than on a smaller wheel.
Big wheels make touring and distance riding a joy, and are graceful to look at.&lt;br /&gt;
This picture shows the [http://www.unicyclist.org/pics/bigwheel.jpg custom-made Semcycle Big Wheel] of [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne]

== Mounting Techniques (Always wear protection!)==
The first thing to note is that the added mass of the wheel means that unless you have unusually strong legs, a rollback mount just isn't going to work at first. You probably won't be able to change the direction of the wheels rotation fast enough. That leaves two options, both of which are reasonably common - a static mount or a rolling mount. Bear in mind that in both cases, you will need to push off the ground somewhat harder than for a small wheel. For a static mount, some people find it helpful to bend forwards and hold the wheel, so they can pull themselves closer to the wheel after pushing off the ground. Some people find it easier to learn a rolling mount on a big wheel than on a small wheel.

== Irregularities in the riding surface ==
Is there a bump in front of you? Don't worry! The advantage of a big wheel, other than speed, is that you barely notice bumps that you have to pay some attention to on a smaller wheel.

== Stopping ==
For stopping, there are two issues. The first is that there's more unicycle to stop, because it weighs more, and the second is that you're likely to be going faster. Despite these, the stopping techniques are the same as for a small wheel, it just takes longer so you need to plan ahead more. Using a hand brake helps in reducing speed as you get ready to step off. A brake also comes in handy in moderating your speed on down-hills.

== Idling ==
Slowly, slowly. For idling, what matters is not how far you move the pedal but how far the wheel moves. When you idle a small wheel, moving the pedals between 45 degrees either side of vertical gets you about the right amount of wheel movement, but that kind of pedal movement will get you too much wheel movement on a larger wheel. Try to override your instinct to pedal back and forth automatically and instead react to the current state of the wheel. Again here, though, the weight of the wheel can be problematic, so don't expect to be able to idle a Coker easily (though Terry Peterson - the famed &quot;Unigeezer&quot; - has posted videos of himself idling a Coker).

== Turning ==
At first you will want to leave plenty of room for turns.  More lean may be required to get the big wheel banked over.  As you get used to the big wheel, turns will come easier and less room will be required.  180 degree and hop turns are well within reason.

== No Limits ==
Most open speed and distance records are done on big wheels.  36&quot; wheels have become popular due to the 36&quot; tire made by the Coker company.  Many different frames and configurations have used that tire.  Several manufacturers such as The Unicycle Factory and RBR offer even larger wheeled unicycles.  Sem Abraham has ridden the largest wheel at 73&quot;...he required blocks to reach the pedals!</text>

There's not really any trick to riding a giraffe. It's basically like riding a normal unicycle once you get up high enough to ride it.

== Assisted Mounts ==
The main problem in mounting is getting height. There are several ways of cheating to get height, some of which may involve breaking rules.

=== The Picnic Table (Garbage Can, Car Hood) ===
This is a way of applying the normal rollback or static mounts to a giraffe. A typical picnic table is probably sufficient height for a 5 foot giraffe; for a larger giraffe, you may want to find a larger object to serve as a picnic table substitute.

The procedure is simple - stand on the edge of a picnic table, with the giraffe in front of you with it's wheel on the ground. Mount as you would a smaller unicycle on the ground. Bear in mind that you have an uneven surface to fall on if you go backwards, so pushing off the table too hard is infinitely preferable to pushing off too softly.

=== The High Fence/Wall ===
This mount works for any giraffe height, depending on the availability of fences. Hang the giraffe by the seat on the fence.  Climb up the fence and sit on top.  Then rearrange yourself so you have a foot on a pedal and your bum on the seat.  Finally, transfer your weight from the fence to the unicycle. This mount is both the least scary and the least elegant.

=== The Tree Branch ===
This mount again works for any height of giraffe, provided that you have suitable branches available. Climb the tree to the required branch, then hang from that branch by your hands. Have a friend pass the giraffe; grab it with your legs and arrange things appropriately, then ride away.

=== The Pole ===
This is the most obvious method, but also the hardest of the assisted mounts. Hold the unicycle upright, with a pedal in the 6 O'Clock position. Put one foot on the pedal, and hold the seat with one hand and the pole with the other. Haul yourself up, using the pole for stability. Depending on the height of your unicycle, you might need to start by climbing onto the tire, and then bringing your foot up to the pedal. Sit on the seat and ride away.

=== The Friend ===
Climb up your friend and the giraffe at the same time. Then shift your weight from the friend to the unicycle and ride away.

A good friend or person without any ambitions is required.

== Free mounts ==
This is where it gets especially interesting, because you are basically climbing up a moving object.

=== Climb ===
This is the best method of free mounting a giraffe of 6' or more. Put the right pedal at 6 0'Clock, and put your left foot on top of the wheel and push your foot into the fork. This locks the wheel and pedals in place. Step up and put your right foot on the right pedal, then put your weight on the pedal - this stops the wheel from moving much. You should now be able to move the left foot from the wheel to its pedal and sit on the seat, at which point you should be in a position to ride away. The climb has to be just right so that you end up leaning forwards as much as is required to ride away.
Before working on this mount, you should be able to do the side mount on a regular unicycle, because once you get your left foot on the pedal and stand up on it, this mount works the same as the side mount. You should also practice mounting the giraffe this way while holding onto something, until you can get on fairly quickly, and without putting too much weight on your support.

Some sizes of giraffe can only use this mount if the giraffe has pegs on the frame that act as brakes when they are pushed down.

=== Jumping Climb ===
This works quite well for tall people and 5' giraffes, and has been known to work for 6' giraffes. Put one pedal at the 6 O'Clock position and one foot on the pedal. Hold the seat with both hands. Do one smaller hop, then one huge hop, with the foot on the ground. That should get you high enough that you can push yourself upwards with your hands on the seat and the foot on the pedal, which should in turn get enough height that you can put your bum on the seat and other foot on the pedal, and ride away.

A loose sprocket on your hub can cause serious problems with this jump.  When applying such intense forces on the crank, the sprocket on the hub can slip and cause the rider to fall down.  Once the sprocket gets loose, it must be tightened or else it may effect normal riding, especially when it slips while idling.  Use thread lock on the sprocket to prevent further slipping.  You can also weld the sprocket to the hub for a more permanent solution.

=== Jump ===
Also known as the frog mount, the Jump mount is one of most difficult ways to mount a giraffe.  Start by holding the giraffe in a vertical position, with the pedals horizontal.  Hold the back of the seat with both hands, thumbs on top.  In one motion, jump up as high as possible and land on the pedals.  If the wheel rolls at all during the jump it will be almost impossible to judge where the pedals will be. This mount is much easier to land seat out, where you can begin hopping or riding seat out.  Another way to make the mount easier is to hold the unicycle at approximately waist level, and then raise it to vertical during the motion of the jump.

===Rolling===
This a scarier, but probably also more impressive way to mount a giraffe. While it works best for shorter giraffes, it can be done on a 6' giraffe. Simply run along while holding the giraffe with the saddle a little above crotch level, then at exactly the right moment, launch youself onto one pedal, and then the seat and other pedal simultaniously. It is advisable to land with almost all of your weight on the back pedal. This will allow you to pedal backward a few cycles of the wheel in order to get the wheel under you. With practice you can jump higher and apply less pressure to the first pedal, eliminating the need to roll back. The main difficulty with this mount is getting your first foot on the pedal at exactly the right moment. You want to hit it while it's coming up, so that you will press downward on the pedal and make the unicycle roll under you. One other thing to remember is make sure you take a fairly fast, confident jump. Think of it like pole-vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;

In this clip [http://www.semcycle.com/ Sem Abrahams] shows a good example of a [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f3202407ft-runningmnt rolling mount]

== Giraffe Skills ==
A great number of unicycle skills can either be taken directly from their respective genres or translated into more reasonable skills to account for new factors that must be taken into account for a giraffe.

=== One Footed Idling ===
Idling with one foot one the giraffe, after being able to idle well, is fairly easy. It is easier to idle with one foot on the giraffe then on the standard unicycle, so if you can't idle to great one footed on your regular unicycle it is still worth a try. It is easiest with the bottom of one foot pushing against the front of the frame, but it looks better with one foot extended witch isn't much harder. It is also possible to one foot idle with the non pedaling foot on your opposite knee, putting your non pedaling foot on the opposing top of crank, and holding the foot, knee, or leg in your hand.

=== One Footed Riding ===
Riding with one foot is not much harder then on a normal unicycle. When first learning it is best to be able to one foot idle well in the technique you would like to ride which would most likely either be with your foot against front of frame, or with it extended. Be sure to fall off the unicycle forwards to avoid a landing on your back, while practicing one footed riding, because it is very likely your foot can get caught by the pedal or the sprocket.

=== Seat in Back Riding ===
For this trick it is best to lower the seat slightly to make it easier to put the seat from under you to behind you. Unlike seat in back riding on the normal unicycle it is much easier to ride with both hands firmly on the seat because of the difference in weight. You have to lean forward a ways, and hold the seat pretty close behind you.

=== Hopping ===
Hopping on a giraffe is the same as a standard unicycle: stand, firmly grasp the handle or front of the giraffe, and jump with the unicycle.  There are two important things to consider when hopping on a giraffe.  First, the giraffe weighs far more than the average unicycle.  Secondly, when the giraffe starts to tip one direction, your weight on the pedals is transferred to the frame in a way that accelerates your fall.  This is a non-issue for a standard unicycle, where you apply no weight to the frame when hopping.

Hopping seat out is the same as a normal unicycle, except the tipping effect described above is magnified by the intentional tilt of the frame.  This can be compensated for by bending at the waist and placing your center of gravity farther back than usual.

Rolling hops on a giraffe are more difficult because of the large weight of the frame.  Fortunately, the giraffe has an inherent benefit that helps compensate for this.  When approaching the point at which he plans on jumping a giraffe rider can allow himself to fall forward more than usual.  Because of the height of the frame the rider can be a foot or more in front of his intending take-off point before the wheel leaves the ground.  The rider now jumps, and if he jumps with the pedals approaching horizontal but not yet there he can use his waist and legs to push the giraffe out in front of him.  He now lands with the unicycle tilted backwards, and takes advantage of his momentum to reassume his original position above the cranks.  Using this technique it is not uncommon for a giraffe rider to clear gaps of 2 feet or more with their body at almost the same point in the air for the time period in which the wheel is in the air.

=== Wraps ===
A wrap can be performed on a giraffe in a similiar way to a standard unicycle.  This includes double wraps, triple wraps, super wraps, and so on.  It should be noted that it is harder to recover from a wrap for the tipping issue mentioned above.

=== Giraffe Spin ===
The giraffe spin is the same as a unispin on a standard unicycle.  Start by hopping seat out (see above) with both hands on one side of the seat.  For the 180 Giraffe Spin, jump off of the pedals and spin the giraffe so that you land on the pedals with the unicycle backwards.  Important differences are that your feet do not need to clear the tire, but landing on the sprocket becomes a problem.

=== Side Ride ===
There are a few riders who can do the &quot;side-ride&quot; on a tall unicycle.

Here is a video in which [http://www.unishow.org/ Dustin Kelm] performs [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=r1921447ft-side-ride&amp;hoi=0:00&amp;doei=0:32.6 side-ride on a 7ft tall unicycle] (RealPlayer)

=== Playing a Musical Instrument ===
An assortment of instruments work well in conjuction with a giraffe unicycle.  These include in part electric guitars and basses (with mini-amps), vocals, woodwind, and brass instruments (yes, unicycling with a tuba is quite possible).  It is advisable to first mount the unicycle before picking up any such instrument to avoid personal injury and/or injury to one's instrument.  For this reason, one should always use the oldest and most decrepid of musical instruments when attempting this stunt.  An assistant is usually necessary when performing such a stunt, preferrably one who has the physical capability of lifting a moderately large instrument and performing such tasks as opening doors.  Believe it or not, these can be hard to come by outside of the unicycling world.

== Safety ==
Remember that when you are on a 6 foot giraffe, you are almost 7 feet off the ground. A fall from this height could result in injury. Be sure to be fully equipped with safety gear. A spotter is highly recommended for learning how to ride a giraffe.

=== Tipping ===
The most important factor of giraffe riding is the fact that your weight rests on the frame instead of the hub.  If the unicycle is not exactly vertical your body weight accelerates the fall of the uni, and this can cause unfamiliar movements to a novice giraffe rider.  This can be referred to as the ''tipping effect''.When sitting on the giraffe this is usually negated by your body on the seat, but when performing seat out skills or mounting it plays a role in the movement of the giraffe.  It is important to think through all skills you plan on attempting and analyzing how the frame will be tilted at any given time.

=== Falling Off ===
An ideal way to fall off is forwards. It's easier than you think; basically, you start the unicycle toppling over and take your feet off the pedals; the wheel will move backwards a short way, and the seat (and you) will move forwards and down until you hit the ground. Bend your knees when you land and you'll be surprised at how little pain is involved.

This is by no means the definitive opinion on the matter of giraffe dismounts. There is a school of thought that holds it to be safer to dismount to the rear and have the giraffe move forwards as you drop to the ground and a safe landing on your feet.

Safety is the main reasoning behind this line of thought. 
If you dismount and allow the wheel to move backwards, there is a chance that it might stop short against a wall, pavement or (despite your best intentions and checking over your shoulder before comitting to the dismount) a pedestrian who walked into the path of the rearward travelling giraffe. Such a stop can cause severe injury as the force will be transmitted to your spinal column via your coccyx.

This is topic that bears some discussion and this discussion can be joined [http://www.unicyclist.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=41305&amp;perpage=15&amp;highlight=&amp;pagenumber=1 here].

The rider is encouraged to investigate this issue and make a personal decision.

=== Frame Strength ===
A major issue concerning giraffe safety is the strength of the frame.  Due in part to the generally cheap construction and the large size it is not uncommon for giraffe frames to bend or even snap.  Skills such as rolling mounts apply forces in three places (up on the handle, down on the cranks, and up on the tire) in such as way that the frame experiences extreme stress.  Until giraffe construction is rethought to allow for more intense riding it is advisable to check your frame every time you ride to assess the state of your frame.  It is up to you to make a judgement concerning the safety of your frame.

== Giraffe records ==

The Ultimate Wheel is a simpler form of the unicycle, consisting of a wheel with two pedals, but with no seat or frame, the lateral stability of the wheel is the most crucial skill involved in learning to ride. Large leg pads much like those worn by a hockey goalie can be worn in the learning stage.

== Mounting ==
;Freemount
:This is done pretty much the same as a normal unicycle. Place the UW with the pedal corresponding to your weaker foot at its lowest point. Put your weak foot on the pedal and lean the wheel toward your dominant foot. This stops the wheel from flipping when you lift up your dominant foot. As soon as both feet are on the pedals, apply pressure and head off.
;Roll Mount
:The hardest thing here is to get the wheel to roll in a straight line. As you experiment, this improves. After it is rolling, jog next to it until the pedal that corresponds to your weaker foot is at the lowest point. Now, put your weak foot on that pedal followed immediately by the dominant foot. When the wheel is rolling, it is oddly stable. Here's [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240ultimate-runningmnt a clip that shows it]. It is also possible to do this trick in reverse where the wheel is rolling towards you. You can see it at 1:04 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]
;Kickup Mount
:This skill is much easier on an UW than on a unicycle. Firstly, lay the wheel on the ground, placing your dominant foot on the upwards-facing pedal, and place the toes of your weaker foot under the rim of the wheel by the downwards facing pedal. Lift the wheel  with your weaker foot while at the same time easing your weight on the upwards facing pedal. Your dominant foot should now be at its lowest point while the weaker foot should be seated nicely on the pedal at its highest point. This position is similar to the normal freemount - just reversed.
;Jump Mount
:This is very similar to a jump mount on a unicycle, except more difficult to master. Firstly, hold the UW in a position where the pedals are aligned horizontally. From here, jump onto the UW without affecting the angle of the pedals. If you aim correctly, you will land on the pedals. You should now push down on the forward pedal using your dominant foot, and ride away.
;Spin Mount
:This skill is similar to the jump mount, except you spin the wheel before jumping. Start learning the trick by spinning the wheel 180 degrees and work your way up. The pedals should be aligned vertically before you spin. You can see it at 0:23 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]
;Air Mount
:With this skill you jump in the air while holding the Ultimate Wheel and mount it before you touch the ground. You can see it at 1:14 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]

== Riding ==
;Forward
:This is just regular riding which in itself is extremely hard. Here's [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240esther-ultimate a clip that shows it]
;Idling
:This is rocking back and forth (with your pedals in horizontal position) and staying at one place. You can see it at 4:00 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]
;Backward
:Here you do the same as forward except you pedal backwards. You can see it at 1:32 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]

== Tricks ==
;180 Spin
:While riding the UW twist your body 180 degrees and continue riding in reverse. You can see it at 1:53 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip]
;Freewheel Jump
:Start off by riding your Ultimate Wheel in a circle. Jump off the wheel so that it continues rolling in a circle on it's own. When it comes back around jump on it (basically a roll mount) and keep riding. Once you master this technique, you can add 180 or 360 spins as you jump on the wheel or even do everything in reverse. You can see it at 2:08 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].
;Double Freewheel Jumps
:This is the same trick but with two UW's. Start off by riding your wheel in a circle with a second wheel in your hand. As your riding, roll the wheel in your hand so it keeps going in a circle. Now wait till the other wheel rolls about half a circle and jump of your wheel. The wheel that was in your hand should now be coming back to you so you can jump back onto it. Practice and timing is everything. You can see it at 2:38 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].
;Twisty Jump
:Start off by riding your ultimate wheel in a straight line. Jump up off the wheel, do a 180 degree spin and land back on the wheel (make sure your pedals are horizontal). Now continue riding in reverse. Note: Be careful with this trick as you can badly sprain or break an ankle. You can see it at 3:38 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].
;Leap of Faith
:Start of by riding your ultimate wheel while holding another wheel in your hand. Now roll the wheel in your hand in a straight line and follow behind it. Jump from the wheel your riding onto the one you rolled. It's important to watch the pedals on the wheel as it rolls. You have to time it just right so that you land on the wheel right before the pedals line up horizontally. It may help to be slightly to the left or right of the wheel your jumping on instead of right behind it. You can see it at 3:18 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].
;Ultimate Spin
:This feels exactly the same as a unicycle spin except that your on an ultimate wheel. You can see it at 4:28 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].
;Jump Rope
:Start by idling with your pedals in the vertical position. Now hook your foot under the top pedal and start bouncing up and down. You can see it at 5:05 of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8I8Lx7cXew this clip].

=== Introduction ===
The BC wheel (or Impossible Wheel) is a single wheel with pegs or small platforms connected to the axle. To ride you must balance on the pegs as the wheel is rolling.  The name comes from the popular comic, B.C. by Johnny Hart, in which the characters travel by rolling on large stone wheels.

Riding the BC requires some different skills to the unicycle or Ultimate Wheel since fine control of the wheel's rotation is not possible.  Since it requires very good balance it is not recommended for beginners.  Advanced riders are able to do many tricks, including a variety of mounts, backwards riding, jumps and grinds.

In this video [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] shows how to [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bc_ride ride a BC wheel]


''	The reason I love to BC so much is this: the most fun I've ever had on a uni was when I first got one, and just learning to ride those first few days. I fell so much but I was progressing I never had a balance point it was always hit or miss, and I get that everyday with the BC wheel. There is never a balance point you can get down to minimal movement but your still focused solid on what you're doing.

	~Evan Byrne''

=== Protective Gear ===

A very thick, strong, flexible, and heat resistant wrap or strap-on guard is important for braking and control. Gloves are recommended since, in some falls, you will hit the ground hands first. A skate-type helmet that protects the back of your neck is also recommended in case you fall backwards.

=== Mounting ===

'''Freemount''':
This is similar to the freemount for an ultimate wheel.  Whilst standing still, place one foot on a plate and angle the wheel away from that leg.  Angling the wheel prevents it from touching the leg when pressure is applied to the footplate.  Roll the wheel forward and kick off from the ground with the other foot; this supplies the initial momentum for riding the wheel.  The second foot must then be placed quickly onto the other plate to maintain the balance of the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
In this video [http://www.unicycle.net/ Leo Vandewoestijne] shows the [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bc_directmnt Freemount]

'''Roll mount''':
The wheel must be rolled along the ground in a straight line, which requires some skill in itself.  The rider jogs up behind the wheel until they are close enough to jump onto the footplates.  At the point of jumping, the rider should be careful to be running at the same speed as the wheel or it will be very hard to land correctly.  On landing, both feet should contact the plates at (as near as possible) the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
In this video Max shows the [http://www.unicyclist.org/cont/play.cfm?pi=f320240bc_hor Roll Mount]

'''Skate Mount'''
This is a relatively easy skill. The rider puts one foot on a peg or plate and pushes like one would push a skateboard, then puts the other foot on the other plate and rides away. This mount requires some dexterity and skill with the wheel to keep the wheel from rubbing your leg and slowing down when you have your one foot on the plate/peg.&lt;br /&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mirv. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mirv~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, Dcordero,

It is nice that you update the development stages in the US history book, but take care of the following two things:
1) Change the date as well (update it to today when you change the stage),
and 
2) If there are red links (because the text was copied from Wikipedia without modification) either the links should be changed to link to Wikipedia (prefix w:) or remove the linking. Otherwise the chapter should not get 100% yet. (also the current links pointing to Wikibooks do not make any sense, because they are not in the US history book chapter structure). Thanks, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:44, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I've only been to one Exploding Cinema event but it was excellent.  Apparently they show EVERY film they're sent, which I find amazing because the films were some of the best I've seen for a long while.  A thrilling mix of all sorts of films: from obscure and arty to comic and mainstream.  They EC crew did a great job with the venue - they had loads of old 8mm projects setup all round the place playing loops of 70s porn and stuff!  Brilliant night out - highly recommended. - [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 03-02-2005

== Introduction ==
Probability theory is one of the most widely applicable mathematical theories. It deals with uncertainty and teaches you how to manage it.

Please do not misunderstand: We are not learning to predict things; rather, we learn to utilise predicted ''chances'' and make them useful. Therefore, we don't care about questions like &lt;i&gt;what is the probability it will rain tomorrow?&lt;/i&gt;, but given that the probability is 60% we can make deductions, the easiest of which is ''the probability it will not rain tomorrow is 40%''.

As suggested above, a ''probability'' is a percentage, and it's between 0% and 100% (inclusive). Mathematicians like to express a ''probability'' as a ''proportion'', i.e. as a number between 0 and 1. So the probability that it will not rain tomorrow is 0.4.

===Application===
You might ask why we are even studying probability. Let's see a very quick example of probability in action.

Consider the following gambling game: Toss a coin; if it's heads, I give you $1; if it's tails, you give me $2. You will easily notice that it is not a fair game - the chances are the same (50%-50%) but the rewards are different. Even though we are playing with probability, there are useful, and sometimes not so obvious, conclusions we can make: one of them is that ''in the long run'' I will become richer and you will become poorer.

Another real-life example: I observed one day that there are dark clouds outside. So I asked myself, should I bring an umbrella? I use my observation of dark clouds as per my usual daily deciding routine. Since in past experiences, dark clouds are early warning signs of rain, I am more likely to bring an umbrella.

In real life, probability theory is heavily used in risk analysis by economists, businesses, insurance companies, governments, etc. An even wider usage is its application as the basis of statistics, which is the main basis of all scientific research. Two branches of physics have their bases tied in probability. One is clearly identified by its name: statistical mechanics. The other is quantum physics.

===Why discrete probability?===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
There are two kinds of probability: discrete and continuous. The continuous case is considered to be more difficult to understand, and much less intuitive, than discrete probability, and it requires knowledge of calculus. But we will touch on a little bit of the continuous case later on in the chapter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Event and Probability ==

Roughly, an ''event'' is something we can assign a ''probability'' to. For example ''the probability it will rain tomorrow is 0.6''; here, the event is ''it will rain tomorrow'', and the assigned probability is 0.6. We can write
:P(it will rain tomorrow) = 0.6
Mathematicians typically use abstract letters to represent events. In this case we choose ''A'' to represent the event ''it will rain tomorrow'', so the above expression can be written as:
:P(A) = 0.6
Another example is ''a (six-sided) fair die will turn up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 with equal probability each time it is tossed''. Let ''B'' be the event that it turns up 1 in the next toss.  We write:
:P(B) = 1/6

'''Misconception'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted red;&quot;&gt;
Please note that the probability 1/6 does '''not''' mean that it will turn up 1 in at most six tries. Its precise meaning will be discussed later on in the chapter. Roughly, it means that on the long run (i.e. the die being tossed a large number of times), the proportion of 1s will be very close to 1/6.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Impossible and certain events ===
Two types of events are special. One type are the impossible events (e.g., a roll of a die will turn up 7); the other type are certain to happen (e.g., a roll of a die will turn up as one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). The probability of an impossible event is 0, while that of a certain event is 1. We write
:P(Impossible event) = 0
:P(Certain event) = 1

The above reinforces a very important principle concerning probability. Namely, the range of probability is between 0 and 1. You can '''never''' have a probability of 2.5! So remember the following
:&lt;math&gt;0 \leq P(E) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
for all events E.

=== Complement of an event ===
A most useful concept is the '''complement''' of an event. Here we use &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;
to represent the ''event'' that ''the die will NOT turn up 1 in the next toss''. Generally, putting a bar over a variable (that represents an event) means the opposite of that event. In the above case of a die:
:&lt;math&gt;P(\overline{E}) = 5/6&lt;/math&gt;
it means ''The probability that the die will turn up 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 &lt;u&gt;in the next toss&lt;/u&gt; (notwithstanding the aforementioned misconception that a probability of X/Y does not mean that it will turn up X in at most Y tries) is 5/6''. Please note that
:&lt;math&gt;P(\overline{E}) = 1 - P(E)&lt;/math&gt;
for any event E.

There are some other notations for (ways to write) '''complement''' rather than putting a bar (line) on top: prime (A') and star (A*). Both A' and A* mean: &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Combining independent probabilities ===
''Independent'' probabilities can be combined to yield probabilities for more complex events. I stress the word ''independent'' here, because the following demonstrations will not work without that requirement. The exact meaning of the word will be discussed a little later on in the chapter, and we will show why ''independence'' is important in Exercise 10 of this section.

==== Adding probabilities ====
Probabilities are added together whenever a single event can occur in multiple &quot;ways&quot;.  As this is a rather loose concept, the following example may be helpful.  Consider rolling a single dice; if we want to calculate the probability for, say, rolling an odd number, we must add up the probabilities for all the &quot;ways&quot; in which this can happen -- rolling a 1, 3, or 5.  Consequently, we come to the following calculation:
:P(rolling an odd number) = P(rolling a 1) + P(rolling a 3) + P(rolling a 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5
Note that the addition of probabilities is often associated with the use of the word &quot;or&quot; -- whenever we say that some event E consist of  the events X, Y, '''or''' Z (being satisfied if '''any''' of the events occur) we use addition to combine their probabilities (if they are disjoint, see below).

A general rule of thumb is that the probability of an event and the probability of its complement must add up to 1.  This makes sense, since we intuitively believe that events, when well-defined, must either happen or not happen.

==== Multiplying probabilities ====
Probabilities are multiplied together whenever an event occurs in multiple &quot;stages&quot; or &quot;steps.&quot;  For example, consider rolling a single die twice; the probability of rolling a 6 in two consecutive rolls (two times back to back) is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for the individual steps involved since the two events are independent.  Intuitively, the first step is the first roll, and the second step is the second roll.  Therefore, the final probability for rolling a 6 twice is as follows:
:P(rolling a 6 twice) = P(rolling a 6 the first time)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(rolling a 6 the second time) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/36 &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.028 (or 2.8%)
Similarly, note that the multiplication of probabilities is often associated with the use of the word &quot;and&quot; -- whenever we say that some event E is equivalent to '''all''' of the events X, Y, '''and''' Z occurring, we use multiplication to combine their probabilities (if they are independent).

Also, it is important to recognize that the product of multiple probabilities must be less than or equal to each of the individual probabilities, since probabilities are restricted to the range 0 through 1.  This agrees with our intuitive notion that relatively complex events are usually less likely to occur.

==== Combining addition and multiplication ====
It is often necessary to use both of these operations simultaneously.  Once again, consider a die being rolled twice in succession.  In contrast with the previous case, we will now consider the event of rolling two numbers that add up to 3.  In this case, there are clearly two steps involved, and therefore multiplication will be used, but there are also multiple ways in which the event under consideration can occur, meaning addition must be involved as well.  The die could turn up 1 on the first roll and 2 on the second roll, or 2 on the first and 1 on the second.  This leads to the following calculation:
:P(rolling a sum of 3) = P(1 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(2 on 2nd roll) + P(2 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(1 on 2nd roll) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/18 &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.056 (or 5.6%)
This is only a simple example, and the addition and multiplication of probabilities can be used to calculate much more complex probabilities.

==== Exercises ====
Let ''A'' represent the number that turns up in a (fair) die roll, let ''C'' represent the number that turns up in a separate (fair) die roll,  and let ''B'' represent a card randomly picked out of a deck:

1. A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 3 i.e. calculate P(A = 3)?

2. A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 2, 3, '''or''' 5, i.e. calculate P(A = 2, 3 or 5)?

3. What is the probability of choosing a card of the suit Diamonds (in a 52-card deck)? . There are 4 suits, diamonds, spades, clubs, and hearts

4. A die is rolled and a card is randomly picked from a deck of cards. What is the probability of rolling a 4 '''and''' picking the Ace of Spades, i.e. calculate P(A = 4)&amp;times;P(B = Ace of spades).

5. Two dice are rolled together. What is the probability of getting a 1 and a 3?

6. Two dice are rolled separately. What is the probability of getting a 1 and a 3, regardless of order?

7. Calculate the probability of rolling two dice that add up to 7.

8. (Optional) Let ''C'' be the number rolled on the first die and ''A'' be the number rolled on the second die. Show that the probability of ''C'' being equal to ''A'' is 1/6.

9. Let ''C'' and ''A'' be as in exercise 8. What is the probability that ''C'' is greater than ''A''?

10. Gareth was told that in his class 50% of the pupils play football, 30% play video games and 30% study mathematics. So if he was to choose a student from the class randomly, he calculated the probability that the student plays football, plays video games, and studies mathematics is 50% + 30% + 30% = 1/2 + 3/10 + 3/10 = 11/10. But all probabilities should be between 0 and 1. What mistake did Gareth make?

''' Solutions '''

1. P(A = 3) = 1/6

2. P(A = 2) + P(A = 3) + P(A = 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2

3. P(B = Ace of Diamonds) +  ... + P(B = King of Diamonds) = 13 × 1/52 = 1/4

4. P(A = 4) × P(B = Ace of Spades) = 1/6 × 1/52 = 1/312

5. P(A = 1) × P(C = 3) + P(A = 3) × P(C = 1) = 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/18

6. P(A = 1) × P(C = 3) + P(A = 3) × P(C = 1) = 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/18
This is the same answer as the problem above because in both cases  the outcome for each individual die remains independent of the other regardless of whether or not they are thrown simultaneously. Another way of calculating the same answer is to consider that the first die can be a one or a three but the second can only be one number - the opposite of the first die, i.e. a 3 if the first die was 1, or a 1 if the first die was 3. That gives:
P(A=1 or A=3) x P(opposite) = 2/6 x 1/6 = 2/36 = 1/18.

7. Here are the possible combinations: 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7. Probability of getting each of the combinations are 1/18 as in exercise 6. There are 3 such combinations, so the probability is 3 &amp;times; 1/18 = 1/6.

8. As C is the first die rolled and can be any value, P(C) = 1. Given some value of the first role, P(A) = 1/6. The probability C and A have the same value is 1 * 1/6 = 1/6.

9. Since both die are fair, C &gt; A is just as likely as C &lt; A. So
:P(C &gt; A) = P(C &lt; A) = X
and 
:P(C &gt; A) +  P(C &lt; A) + P(A = C) = 1
But
:P(A = C) = 1/6
so 
P(C &gt; A) + P(C &lt; A) = 5/6
:2 X = 5/6
:P(C &gt; A) = X = 5/12.
or
:P(A=1)x P(C=2,3,4,5,6) + P(A=2)x P(C=3,4,5,6) + P(A=3)x P(C=4,5,6) + P(A=4)x P(C=5,6) +P(A=5)x P(C=6)
:1/6 × 5/6 + 1/6 × 4/6 + 1/6 × 3/6 + 1/6 × 2/6 + 1/6 × 1/6
:1/6 × (5+4+3+2+1)/6
:5/12
 
10. These three sets overlap so, for example, to get the probability of someone belonging to all three sets, you need to multiply (assuming they are independent), not add. P(F and V and M) = .5 x .3 x .3 = 0.045.  It is necessary to remember that the events of playing football, playing video games, studying mathematics, or being human, a male, living in Armenia, etc are all possible.  Although the likelihood and independence of these events/states may be debatable, the fact that the probability of any strange combination must be less than one must hold.

== Random Variables ==
A ''random experiment'', such as ''throwing a die'' or ''tossing a coin'', is a process that produces some uncertain outcome. We also require that a random experiment can be repeated easily. In this section we shall start using a capital letter to represent the outcome of a random experiment. For example, let ''D'' be the outcome of a die roll. ''D'' could take the value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, but it is uncertain. We say ''D'' is a ''discrete random variable''. Suppose now that I throw a die, and it turns up 5. We say the ''observed value'' of ''D'' is 5. 

A random variable is the outcome of a certain random experiment. It is usually denoted by a CAPITAL letter, but its observed value is not. For example let
:&lt;math&gt;D_1, D_2, ..., D_n&lt;/math&gt;
denote the outcome of ''n'' die throws, then we usually use
:&lt;math&gt;d_1, d_2, ..., d_n&lt;/math&gt;
to denote the observed values of each D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

From here on, random variable may be abbreviated as &quot;rv&quot; (a common abbreviation in other probability texts).

=== The Bernoulli experiment===
''(This section is optional and it assumes knowledge of [[w:en:binomial expansion|binomial expansion]].)''

A coin-toss is a simpler, specific form of the Bernoulli experiment. If we toss a coin, we will expect to get a head or a tail equally probably. A Bernoulli experiment is slightly more versatile than that, in that the two possible outcomes need not have the same probability.

In a Bernoulli experiment you will either get a 
:''success'', denoted by 1, with probability ''p'' (where ''p'' is a number between 0 and 1)
or a 
:''failure'', denoted by 0, with probability 1 - ''p''.

If the random variable ''B'' is the outcome of a Bernoulli experiment, and the probability of a successful outcome of B is ''p'', we say ''B'' comes from a ''Bernoulli distribution'' with success probability ''p'' (where [[w:en:List of mathematical symbols|&lt;math&gt;X \sim D&lt;/math&gt;]] means that the random variable ''X'' has the [[w:en:Probability distribution|probability distribution]] ''D''):

:&lt;math&gt;B \sim Ber(p) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, if
:&lt;math&gt;C \sim Ber(0.65) &lt;/math&gt;
then 
:P(C = 1) = 0.65
and
:P(C = 0) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35

=== Binomial Distribution ===
If we repeat a Bernoulli experiment ''n'' times and count the number of successes, we get a binomial distribution. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;C_i \sim Ber(p)&lt;/math&gt;
for i = 1, 2, ... , n. That is, there are ''n'' variables C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and they all come from the same Bernoulli distribution. We consider:
:&lt;math&gt;B  =  C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n&lt;/math&gt;
, then ''B'' is the random variable that counts the number of successes in ''n'' trials (experiments). Such a variable is called a binomial variable, and we write
:&lt;math&gt;B \sim Bin(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;

''' Example 1 '''

Aditya, Sarah, and John are equally able. Their probability of scoring 100 in an exam follows a Bernoulli distribution with success probability 0.9. What is the probability of 
:i) Only one of them getting 100?
:ii) Two of them getting 100?
:iii) All 3 getting 100?
:iv) None getting 100?

''' Solution '''

We are dealing with a binomial variable, which we will call ''B''. And
:&lt;math&gt;B \sim Bin(3,0.9)&lt;/math&gt;

i) Aditya's (as well as Sarah and John's) probability of scoring 100 is 0.9 or 90%.  We can write this as
:&lt;math&gt;P(S = 100) = 0.9&lt;/math&gt;
... where S represents the score of any of them.
The probability of any of them getting 100 (success) and the other two getting below 100 (failure) is
:&lt;math&gt;0.9 \times 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.009&lt;/math&gt;
but there are 3 possible candidates for getting 100, so
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = 1) = 3\times 0.009 = 0.027&lt;/math&gt;

ii) We want to calculate
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = 2)&lt;/math&gt;
The probability is
:&lt;math&gt;0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.081&lt;/math&gt;
but there are &lt;math&gt;{3\choose 2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination Combination Notation]&lt;/ref&gt; combinations of candidates for getting 100, so
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = 2) = {3\choose 2} \times 0.081 = 0.243&lt;/math&gt;

iii) To calculate
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = 3) = 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.729&lt;/math&gt;

iv) The probability of &quot;None getting 100&quot; is getting 0 success, so
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = 0) = 0.1 \times 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.001&lt;/math&gt;

The above example strongly hints at the fact the binomial distribution is connected with the binomial expansion. The following result regarding the binomial distribution is provided without proof; the reader is encouraged to check its correctness.

If
:&lt;math&gt;B \sim Bin(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;P(B = k) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;
This is the ''k''th term of the binomial expansion of (''p'' + ''q'')&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''q'' = 1 - ''p''.

=== Events ===
In the previous sections, we have slightly abused the word &quot;event&quot;. An event should be thought of as a collection ([[w:en:Set (mathematics)|set]]) of outcomes of a certain random variable and hence we may assign a probability to it.

Let us introduce some notation first. Let ''A'' and ''B'' be two events, we define
:&lt;math&gt;\, A \cap B &lt;/math&gt;
to be the event of ''A and B''. The probability of the event ''A and B'' is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;\, P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) &lt;/math&gt;
We also define
:&lt;math&gt; A \cup B &lt;/math&gt;
to be the event of ''A or B''. As seen in exercise 10 above,
:&lt;math&gt;\, P(A \cup B) \ne P(A) + P(B) &lt;/math&gt;
in general. In fact,
:&lt;math&gt;\, 1 \geq P(A \cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B) &lt;/math&gt;
always holds.

Let's see some examples. Let ''A'' be the event of getting a number less than or equal to 4 when rolling a die, and let ''B'' be the event of getting an odd number. Now
:P(''A'') = 2/3
and
:P(''B'') = 1/2
but the probability of ''A or B'' does not equal to the sum of the probabilities:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) \ne P(A) + P(B) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
as 7/6 is greater than 1.

It is not difficult to see that the event of throwing a 1 or 3 is included in both ''A'' and ''B''. So if we simply add P(''A'') and P(''B''), some events' probabilities are being added twice.

The [[w:en:Venn diagram|Venn diagram]] below should clarify the situation a little more,
::[[image:HSE_Venn1.png|A or B]]
Think of the blue square as the probability of ''B'' and the yellow square as the probability of ''A''. These two probabilities overlap, and the space where they overlap is the probability of ''A and B''. So the probability of ''A or B'' should be:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;
The above formula is the simplistic approach of the [[w:en:Inclusion–exclusion principle|Inclusion-exclusion principle]].

If for events ''A'' and ''B'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
we say ''A'' and ''B'' are [[w:en:Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. This means both [[w:en:Set (mathematics)|sets]] have no outcomes ([[w:en:Element (mathematics)|elements]]) in common. If two events are disjoint, the following [[w:en:Venn diagram|Venn diagram]] represents them:
::[[image:HSE_Venn_2.png|A and B are disjoint]]

==== Venn diagram ====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
Traditionally, [[w:en:Venn diagram|Venn diagrams]] are used to illustrate sets graphically. A set is simply a collection of things -- for instance, {1, 2, 3} is a set consisting of 1, 2 and 3. Venn diagrams are usually drawn round. It is generally very difficult to draw Venn diagrams for more than 3 intersecting sets. As an example, here is a Venn diagram showing four intersecting sets:
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Edwards-Venn-four.svg|4 intersecting sets]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Expectation ===
The expectation of a random variable can be roughly thought of as the long-term average of the outcome of a certain repeatable random experiment, where by ''long-term average'' we mean that we perform the underlying experiment many times and average the outcomes. For example, let ''D'' be as above; the observed values of ''D'' (1,2 ... or 6) are equally likely to occur. So if you were to roll the die a large number of times, you would expect each of the numbers to turn up roughly an equal number of times. So the expectation is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = 3.5&lt;/math&gt;
We denote the expectation of ''D'' by E(''D''), so
:&lt;math&gt; E(D) = 3.5 &lt;/math&gt;
We should now properly define the expectation.

Consider a random variable ''R'', and suppose the possible values it can take are r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. We define the expectation to be
:&lt;math&gt;E(R) = r_1P(R = r_1) +  r_2P(R = r_2) + ... + r_nP(R = r_n)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Think about it:''' Taking into account that the expectation is the long term average of the outcomes, can you explain why E(''R'') is defined the way it is? 

''' Example 1 '''
In a fair coin toss, let 1 represent tossing a head and 0 a tail. The same coin is tossed 8 times. Let ''C'' be a random variable representing the number of heads in 8 tosses. What is the expectation of ''C'', i.e. calculate E(''C'')?

Ans. E(C)=∑[r x P(C=r)]   where    0&lt;=r&lt;=8


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(r) &amp;= \binom{8}{r} \cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )^r \cdot \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right )^{8 - r} \\
&amp;=  \binom{8}{r} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right )^8 \\
E(C) &amp;= 0 \cdot \binom{8}{0} \cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )^8 + 
1 \cdot \binom{8}{1} \cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )^8 + \dots + 
8 \cdot \binom{8}{8} \cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )^8 \\
&amp;= (0 + 8 + 56 + 168 + 280 + 280 + 168 + 56 + 8) \cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )^8 \\
&amp;= 1024 \cdot \frac{1}{256} \\
&amp;= 4 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


'''So the expectation value is 4

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ok, to tell you the truth: I do not know much about discrete probabilities. I'm very interested to see how it will develop.
I've just seen a A.Level maths exam paper, and the first question is about probability.

P(A)=0.8,P(B)=0.75,P(A&quot;intersection&quot;B)=k.

a)Express P(A&quot;Union&quot;B) in terms of k.

(My)Answer:We sum up P(A) and P(B), but then the probabilities that both A and B are true are counted twice, therefore we subtract k. So it is 0.8+0.75-k=1.55-k

b)Hence show that 0.55&amp;le;k&amp;le;1

(My)Answer:Since all probabilities are smaller than or equal to 1, k must be at least 0.55. Since k itself is also a probability, it must be smaller than or equal to 1. Putting these together, we get 0.55&amp;le;k&amp;le;1

:All correct, and explained very well. To bring your maths to uni level (which you are more than capable of) you need to quote the De Morgan's laws for part a) and actually solve 0 &lt;= 1.55 - k &lt;= 1 algebraicly and use the fact that 0 &lt;= k &lt;=1, for part b). 10/10.

I've added some information on adding and multiplying probabilities -- I hope it's all okay.  Comments and revisions, of course, are welcome.  On another note, I wanted to ask if anyone knows what the final section on options pricing has to do with discrete probability.  I personally can't find anything relevant in it.
:--[[User:Buggi22|Buggi22]] 07:08, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:That's okay, and it's an essential part of the topic. However, may I point out that the multiplacation law of probability does not always apply: It is true only when they are independent events. But then, how will we introduce the concept of dependent and independent events, conditional probability etc? Should we put them before or after your section. I'm at a lost at this moment and are looking forward for your work. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 09:42, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:Option pricing is an important part of finance mathematics. Although it doesn't really use probability in the true sense, it does contain some material on &quot;arbitrage free&quot; probabilities which i think is interesting. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 11:08, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

==Misconception==

I believe there is bias here. I am not expert on the field so I don't dare to edit the page directly. I am talking about this part:

Please note that the probability 1/6 does not mean that it will turn up 1 in at most six tries. Its precise meaning will be discussed later on in the chapter. Roughly, it just means that on the long run (i.e. the die being tossed a large number of times), the proportion of 1's will be very close to 1/6.

There are two school of thought that interpret what does probability means:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#Interpretations

That misconception just reflect the 1st school of thought, the frequentist while Bayesian school of thought is not properly represented here.

== probability space section feels clunky ==

I have pasted the following thing here so we can re-use the material later if need be:

We have now all the machinery required to define a ''Probability Space''. Before we do that, let's consider the example of throwing a die again. If we throw a die, the numbers that will turn up are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and nothing else. Notice the events are disjoint and their probabilities add up to 1, i.e. all the possible events have been accounted for.

==== Definition -- Probability Space ====
A finite ''probability space'' of a random experiment consists of events:
:&lt;math&gt;E_1, E_2,....E_n&lt;/math&gt; 
such that:
# &lt;math&gt;P(E_1) + P(E_2) + ... + P(E_n) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
# all events are disjoint

In the above definition a ''random experiment'' is simply an action like tossing a coin or picking a card, where the outcome is uncertain. For example, let the random experiment be tossing a die, and let the events be the die turning up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So there are 6 events, and they are all disjoint, and the probabilities of each of the events add up to 1, i.e. all the possible events are included. Therefore it's a probability space.

'''Example 1'''

Let the random experiment be choosing a card randomly from a complete deck. And let the events be the card is of the suit Spades, Hearts, Clubs or Diamonds. Is this a probability space?

'''Solution'''
To check whether it is a probability space, we need to check two conditions.
# There are 4 events, and their probabilities add up to 1.
# Each of the events are disjoint 
so it's a probability space.

'''Example 2'''

Let the random experiment be tossing a coin twice. Let the events be
:the first toss results in a head, or
:the second toss results in a tail
Is this a probability space?

'''Solution'''
We proceed to check the two conditions:
# There are 2 events. Each event has probability of 1/2 (check) and so they add up to 1.
# The events are not disjoint! So it is NOT a probability space.

==== Exercises ====
1. Let the random experiment be tossing a coin once. Let the 2 events be tossing H or T. Is this a probability space

2. Let the random experiment be tossing a die three time. Let the 3 events be the maximum of the 3 die throws are
# 1 or 2,
# 3 or 4, or
# 5 or 6
. Is this a probability space

3. Give an exmaple of an experiment that satisfies the first condition but not the second.

4. Give an exmaple of an experiment that satisfies the second condition but not the first.

5. Let S be a probability space. It has ''n'' events
:&lt;math&gt; E_1, E_2, ... E_n&lt;/math&gt;

Use the Simple Inclusion Exclusion Principle, show that
:&lt;math&gt; P(E_i \cup E_j) = P(E_i) + P(E_j)&lt;/math&gt;
for i &amp;ne; j.

6. 
Is it true that the complement of any event E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the union of all the other events i.e. is the following true:
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{E_i} = E_1 \cup E_2 \cup ... \cup E_i \cup E_{i+1} \cup ... \cup E_n&lt;/math&gt;
(Hint: use &lt;math&gt; P(\overline{E_1}) = 1 - P(E_1)&lt;/math&gt;)--[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 05:57, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

== how to pronounce... ==

Could someone please add some verbiage (in parentheses in the article) that explains how to say/pronounce/express-in-words  things like X ~ B.   Is that pronounced &quot;x has a distribution of b&quot;? What about B ~ Bin(n,p)?
This would be helpful when trying to converse in person with other mathematicians.  Thanks

== Impossible and Certain Events equation seems off ==

Since an answer can only be 0-1, then 
0 &lt;= P(E) &lt;= 1
seems wrong, since it would be 0 =&gt;. Greater Than Or Equal To 0, rather than Less Than Or Equal To. As it is, the equation simply says that the event is either 1 or less than 1. Looks like it anyway, am I wrong or is the image?

== one addition to help completeness ==

It's been a while since I studied statistics. I found your presentation easy to follow and purposeful. You used the term (3 over 2) and (n over k). I can't recall what the calculation is for that terminology. And since it is referenced, I don't have an easy way to look it up. Adding a line defining that function would be useful.

== Review answer 5 ==

I guess that the question 5 has a mistake on its answer.

As the order doen't matter the P(A=1 and B=3) + P(A=3 and B=1) = 1/6 x 1/6 + 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/18
---------
'''Is this now question 6?'''

''6. Two dice are rolled seperately (sic). What is the probability of getting a 1 and a 3, regardless of order?''

I agree that this seems incorrect, or at least the explanation of the result is inaccurate: the first roll can be either a 1 or a 3. The answer is not as simple as repeating the first half twice: once a result is recorded for the first roll, that result can not be repeated in the second roll; otherwise the result could be two 1s or two 3s.  Instead, the probability for the second roll must be 1/6, as it must be either a 1 or a 3, but only whichever of those two was not rolled first.  So, if I'm not mistaken, the final probability must be: (1/6 + 1/6) x (1/6) = '''2/36''' or '''1/18'''

== Review answer 10 ==

It looks like answer 10 has mistake. Gareth calculates probability of choosing the student that either plays football or plays video games or studies mathematics. This probability cannot be 11/10 but it cannot be .045 either.

== Review Answer 7 ==

I'm a little confused about example number 7:

''Here are the possible combinations: 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4 = 7&quot;

I think that assumption is correct, but the next one:

&quot;Probability of getting each of the combinations are 1/18 as in exercise 6''

I think it's not:

&lt;math&gt;P(A=1) x P(A=6) + P(A=2) x P(A=5) + P(A=3) x P(A=4) = 1/36 + 1/36 + 1/36 = 1/12&lt;/math&gt;

And the final resolution:

&quot;There are 3 such combinations, so the probability is 3 × 1/18 = 1/6.&quot;

Should be:

&lt;math&gt;3 x 1/12 = 3 / 12 = 1/4&lt;/math&gt;

Am I correct?

Thank you all!

:No. Review the section &quot;Combining addition and multiplication&quot;. 
:Instead of 

:&lt;math&gt;P(A=1) \times P(A=6)&lt;/math&gt; (and similarly for other terms)

:use

:&lt;math&gt;(P(A=1) \times P(A=6) + P(A=6) \times P(A=1))&lt;/math&gt; (and similarly for other terms)

:so we get

:&lt;math&gt;(1/36 + 1/36) + (1/36 + 1/36) + (1/36 + 1/36) = 2/36 + 2/36 + 2/36 = 3 \times 1/18 = 1/6&lt;/math&gt;

:or, alternatively (review Solution 6)

:&lt;math&gt;(P(A=1) + P(A=6)) \times P(opposite)&lt;/math&gt;

:so we get

:&lt;math&gt;(2/6 \times 1/6) + (2/6 \times 1/6) + (2/6 \times 1/6) = 2/36 + 2/36 + 2/36 = 3 \times 1/18 = 1/6&lt;/math&gt;

== Combining addition and multiplication ==

There is often confusion about the order of multiplying and adding and the resultant meaning. This adds some additional clarification to this section of the main text. 

From the main text, we have 
:P(rolling a sum of 3) = P(1 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(2 on 2nd roll) + P(2 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(1 on 2nd roll) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/18 &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.056 (or 5.6%)

In what way is this different from 
:P(?) = (P(1 on 1st roll) + P(2 on 2nd roll)) &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (P(2 on 1st roll) + P(1 on 2nd roll)) = (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{6}\times\frac{2}{6}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/9 &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.111 (or 11.1%) ?

The short answer is because it's answering a different question: not P(rolling a sum of 3) but P(only 1 or 2 in both rolls).

Sample spaces can be useful to see what's going on (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space). 

For simplicity, consider a 4 sided dice (pyramid). The sample space of two rolls (or 2 dice rolled together), represented by single digit decimals, is (16 possibilities):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| 11 || 12 || 13 || 14
|-
| 21 || 22 || 23 || 24
|-
| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34
|-
| 41 || 42 || 43 || 44
|}

(Hopefully it is obvious that, for example, 23 is not twenty three, but represents 2 on one roll and 3 on the other roll ;).

P(rolling a sum of 3) contains 12 and 21&lt;br /&gt;
= P(1 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(2 on 2nd roll) + P(2 on 1st roll)&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;P(1 on 2nd roll) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt; = 2/16 = 1/8

P(only 1 or 2 in both rolls) contains 11 and 12 and 21 and 22&lt;br /&gt;
= (P(1 on 1st roll) + P(2 on 2nd roll)) &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (P(2 on 1st roll) + P(1 on 2nd roll)) = (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}\times\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; = 4/16 = 1/4

== No Coverage of Conditional Probability ==

I think this page is a useful starting point.  Some points for improvement (and apologies if I have mistakes of notation or process - I'm new to this form of communication):

* There are vague references at the end to distinctly non-discrete topics like the uniform distribution.  Placeholders I could understand, but not to areas that are off topic for the this page.
* Some coverage of conditional probablility would be useful. There are some simple concepts and notations that can be explained with the kind of venn diagram samples that are nicely used in parts of the existing material, e.g. Bayes Theorem.
* I echo someone else's comment that (3 over 2) is a notation that needs to be introduced if it is going to be used. Better perhaps not to use it at that point in the text.

== Please explain the notation ==

In the section [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Discrete Probability#The Bernoulli experiment|The Bernoulli experiment]] we have the notation:

:&lt;math&gt;B \sim Ber(p) &lt;/math&gt;

what does the function &lt;math&gt; Ber(p) &lt;/math&gt; mean? I am not sure what this section is saying, but I guess it is the probability of result p?  -- [[User:Q Chris|Q Chris]] ([[User talk:Q Chris|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Q Chris|contribs]]) 13:52, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

== Venn diagram claim ==

I am confused by this claim in the Venn diagram section:  &quot;It is generally very difficult to draw Venn diagrams for more than 3 intersecting sets. To demonstrate why, here is a Venn diagram showing four intersecting sets.&quot;  Essentially, this says &quot;here is a diagram of something very difficult to draw&quot;, and yet there it is -- a fairly simple diagram.  Am I misinterpreting this?  --[[User:Ds13|Ds13]] ([[User talk:Ds13|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ds13|contribs]]) 23:10, 18 November 2012 (UTC)


It's rather hard to find intersection of all 4 sets. Try yourself. --[[User:ViolentOr|ViolentOr]] ([[User talk:ViolentOr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ViolentOr|contribs]]) 13:42, 20 January 2013 (UTC)

== Exercise 9 ==

I think all is well explained and there is no too much content, but perhaps the proposed solution for the exercise 9 is a little tricky for some students. A more consistent solution with the exposed explanations could be:

P(C&gt;A) = P([(C=1)⋂(A&gt;1)] ⋃ [(C=2)⋂(A&gt;2)] ⋃ [(C=3)⋂(A&gt;3)] ⋃ [(C=4)⋂(A&gt;4)] ⋃ [(C=5)⋂(A&gt;5)]) ; Note: P(A&gt;6) = 0;

P(C&gt;A) =  P(C=1).P(A&gt;1)+P(C=2).P(A&gt;2)+P(C=3).P(A&gt;3)+P(C=4).P(A&gt;4)+P(C=5).P(A&gt;5);

Since P(C=1) = P(C=2) = P(C=3) = P(C=4) = P(C=5) = 1/6 = P(C=any) for 1 ≤ any ≤ 6 : 

P(C&gt;A) =  P(C=any).(P(A&gt;1)+P(A&gt;2)+P(A&gt;3)+P(A&gt;4)+P(A&gt;5));

And since P(A&gt;i) = (6-i)/6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 :

P(C&gt;A) =  1/6.(5/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6) = 15/36 = 5/12

== A discussion of the Monte Hall &quot;paradox&quot; (from the gameshow) is always a good practical example. ==

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

== Optional exercise - ex. 7 ==

Is this the only optional one? If it is the only optional exercise, wouldn't it make sense to move it to the end of the exercises. Otherwise it seems weird to have one exercise that is unecessary then more to do.

If ex.8 - ex.10 are also optional, they need marking as such.</text>

== About Brazilian Portuguese on this Wikibook ==

Hello! I'm a newcomer to the wikibooks and a native Portuguese.

When I looked at the Portuguese Language Wikibook I understood it was written in Brazilian Portuguese.

I was wondering if Portuguese from Portugal could be used as it's the one I truly master and the only in which I could help the wikibook.

A synopsis is the kind of brief summary you might read on the back of a video box, and generally doesn’t run for more than one page. Without going into any great detail, it describes the main character and what they are up against, as well as the major turning points in the screenplay. A synopsis is a useful pitching tool, but it’s also a very useful way for screenwriters themselves to articulate what the story is basically about.

An Example

&quot;To envisage The Art of Flirting, imagine Buster Keaton playing Don Juan directed by the Farelly Brothers. It is very funny, yet at the same time covers the full gamut of flirting techniques. If you can't pick up any useful flirting skills from this film - you are probably too busy getting laid to make time to see it.

Shot as a black and white silent comedy, TAoF is an instructional guide showing us how to flirt. TAoF is contemporary but uses the silent movie style to emphasise flirting as primarily non-verbal and to demonstrate flirting is a classic and somewhat neglected art. TAoF is also a homage to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton.&quot;

A logline is a very short, catchy summary of the story, usually not longer than one sentence. It serves as a way to communicate with great efficiency what a story or script is about. Typically a logline is used to help industy people quickly determine whether the story in question is one which a producer, director, or studio wishes to make. The logline first came into being in the script vaults of the old studios. Loglines were often written on the cover or even the spine of a screenplay, allowing a producer or director of a certain genre to quickly scan hundreds of scripts and narrow their search to just scripts which were in the genre they wished to produce. A good logline contains the following three parts:
* Who the Main Character is (MC, also known as the Protagonist).
* What the Main Conflict is (i.e. what the MC wants and who or what is stopping them).
* What is at Risk, if the MC fails.
Writing a good logline is very difficult for most people because of a failure to understand the three basic tenants of a good logline as outlined here.

A '''fluid ounce''' is a unit of volume measure equal to 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]], 6 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]], or 1/8 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]. It is approximately equal to 30 mL.

The '''fluid ounce''' may be abbreviated as '''oz''' or, more specifically, as '''fl oz'''.

Note that the '''fluid ounce''' is distinct from the [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]].</text>

      <comment>clarify US vs Imperial pints</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{unit}}

A US '''pint''' (that is, the fluid pint) is a unit of volume measure equal to 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]], ½ [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]], or 16 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]]. It is approximately equal to 473 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]. When converting a recipe to metric, it is usually sound to round the pint to 500 mL, along a pound of 500 g.

The '''dry pint''', approximately 551 mL, is not commonly used in cooking.  It is used in the sale of some items such as blueberries in the United States.

The '''Imperial pint''' is about 20% larger, 568 mL, and divided into 20 imperial fluid ounces rather than 16 US fluid ounces.</text>

A '''quart''' (that is, the liquid quart) is a unit of volume measure equal to ¼ [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]], 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]], 2 [[Cookbook:Pint|pints]], or 32 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]]. A quart is approximately equal to 946 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], or more roughly to 960 mL or 1 [[Cookbook:L|L]].

The dry quart is somewhat larger, at about 1.1 L. It is not generally used in cooking.

The now unused British quart is also somewhat larger, containing 40 ounces of a slightly different size. The British quart is about 3% larger than the dry quart and 20% larger than a U.S. liquid quart.</text>

A '''gallon''' (the Queen Anne gallon, as used in the USA) is a unit of volume measure equal to 4 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]]. A gallon is approximately equal to 3.8 [[Cookbook:L|L]].

The post-1824 British gallon is about 20% larger.
The Queen Anne (USA) gallon is thus 16.7% smaller, or 5/6 the size of a British gallon.</text>

[[Image:Messbecher.png|thumb|1 liter measuring cup]]

The '''liter''' (AE) or '''litre''' (BE), abbreviated '''l''' (or sometimes 'L' in the US, Canada and Australia), is a metric unit of volume. It is equal to 1000 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]], also known as 1000 [[Cookbook:Milliliter|cm³]] (informally ''cc''). The litre is a bit larger than a [[Cookbook:Quart|US liquid quart]]. One liter of pure water weighs 1 [[Cookbook:kg|kilogram]] at 4°Celsius.

As many recipes have been roughly converted from one system to another, a similarly approximate conversion back may yield the original recipe. When converting recipes from one system to another, quantities should always be rounded to the nearest reasonable unit to avoid awkward measurements, e.g. 11½ ounces and 347 grams should be rounded off to 12 ounces and 350 grams respectively, and so on.</text>

The '''milliliter''' (AE) or '''millilitre''' (BE), abbreviated '''mL''' or '''ml''', is a metric unit of volume measurement. It is equal to the '''cubic centimeter''' ('''cm³''' or colloqually '''cc''') and to 0.001 [[Cookbook:L|L]].

As many recipes have been crudely converted from one system to another, a similarly crude conversion back may yield the original recipe. Crude conversions are as follows:

The '''gram''' or '''gramme''' (old BE), abbreviated '''g''', is a unit of weight. It is equal to one thousandth (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;¹⁄&lt;big&gt;₁&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;₀₀₀&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [0.001]) of a [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]. There are 454&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁵⁄&lt;big&gt;₁₁&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (454.&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;) '''g''' per '''pound'''. Since there are sixteen (16) [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]]s  in a pound, there are 28&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁹⁄&lt;big&gt;₂₂&lt;/big&gt; (28.4&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;) g&lt;/span&gt; in one ounce. As many recipes have been crudely converted from one system to another, a similarly crude conversion back may yield the original recipe. (Cooking is not rocket science.)

The '''pound''', abbreviated '''lb''' (or '''#''', exclusively in the US), is a unit of weight. It is divided into 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]]. One pound is equivalent to approximately 10/22 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] or 454 [[Cookbook:g|g]] in the metric system. When converting a recipe to metric, it is usually sound to round the pound to 450 g and the ounce to 30 g. A metric pound is equal to half a kilogram or 500 g and is sometimes seen in recipes originating on the continent.</text>

The '''ounce''' (avoirdupois) is a unit of mass (&quot;weight&quot;). The [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] ('''lb''' or '''#''') is divided into 16 ounces. One pound is ''approximately'' equal to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁵⁄&lt;big&gt;₁₁&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (0.&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;) [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] or 454&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁵⁄&lt;big&gt;₁₁&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (454.&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;) [[Cookbook:g|g]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Pound_(mass)#In_Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one ounce is ''approximately'' equal to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁵⁄&lt;big&gt;₁₇₆&lt;/big&gt; (0.0284&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;) kg&lt;/span&gt; or 28&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;⁹⁄&lt;big&gt;₂₂&lt;/big&gt; (28.4&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;) g&lt;/span&gt;.  However, the international avoirdupois ounce ''is'' equal to &lt;small&gt;{{frac|0.45359237|16}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg or 28.349523125&amp;nbsp;g per ounce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Ounce#International_avoirdupois_ounce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ounce is herein abbreviated as '''oz'''.

Note that the ounce is distinct from the [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]].
The '''troy ounce''' and '''apothecaries ounce''' are not used in cooking.

==Introduction==
The Portuguese language has two grammatical categories shared by a large number of other languages, especially the Indo-European ones. These two categories are Number and Gender. As a speaker of English, you certainly know that the Number of a word expresses the amount of this word. Thus we have nouns like ''door'' and ''doors''.

Speakers of Romance languages, German, Greek and a lot of others also understand what Gender is. In Portuguese, each noun has one specific gender, and unless this noun is related to people or animals, it is highly random. In English there are some examples of nouns with gender, like ''man'' and ''woman'', ''actor'' and ''actress''.

Unlike some languages, there is no case system in Portuguese, not even some vestiges of the case systems in Latin or other ancestor of the Language.

==Number==
There are two Numbers:
*'''Singular''' - expresses the idea of a ''single'' object;
*'''Plural''' - expresses the idea of several objects.

==Gender==
There are also two Genders:
*'''Masculine''' - used on nouns related to men or male animals;
*'''Feminine''' - used on nouns related to woman or female animals.
Nouns that are not related to any of those genders are distributed randomly across the two possibilities. Thus, the noun &quot;casa&quot;, ''house'' is feminine, while &quot;pão&quot;, ''bread'' is maculine.

===Tips for Identifying Word Gender===
As said above, gender is mainly random. However, there are some ways to find out if a certain word is masculine or feminine, by looking at its ending:
*Words ending with -o, -im, -om, -um, -or are usually '''masculine''':
*#&quot;carro&quot; ''car'';
*#&quot;rim&quot; ''kidney'';
*#&quot;som&quot; ''sound'';
*#&quot;atum&quot; ''tuna fish''
*#&quot;cantor&quot; ''male singer''.
*Words ending with -a, -ice, -ção, -são, -gem, -ez, -iz are usually '''feminine'''
*#&quot;casa&quot; ''house'';
*#&quot;patetice&quot; ''foolishness'';
*#&quot;Conceição&quot; (Proper Name);
*#&quot;coragem&quot; ''corage'';
*#&quot;acidez&quot; ''acidity''
*#&quot;actriz&quot; ''actress''.

Bear in mind that these rules are not flawless. For instance, the words &quot;coração&quot; ''heart'' and &quot;panda&quot; ''panda'' are masculine, despide their endings.

Words ending in -l and -e are very difficult to guess, so when learning these words, always remember their gender as well.
Consider these, for instance:
#&quot;sal&quot; ''salt'' is masculine;
#&quot;final&quot; ''final'' can be either masculine or feminine, depending on the use:
#*When speaking of the ''ending'' of something, &quot;final&quot; is '''masculine'''; when this word refers to the ''last game'' on some championship or tournment, it is '''feminine'''.
#&quot;cone&quot; ''cone'' is masculine;
#&quot;estudante&quot; ''student'' can be either masculine or feminine.

'''Pickling''' is the preservation of food in acid.  It is used to preserve [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], and even hard-boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]].

Pickling brine is a moderately strong acid which inhibits the growth of microbes; a high content of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and/or [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] often enhances this effect.  Some foods have a high water content, in which case methods must be used to ensure that the brine is strong enough to function properly.

Some of the more popular pickled foods include [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]] ([[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]]), [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] ([[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]), and [[Cookbook:Green Olive|green olives]] ([[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]).

These three examples cover the range of methods used to produce acidic pickling brine.  In the case of cucumbers, [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] (acetic acid) is usually added to provide all or most of the necessary acidity.  Sauerkraut relies on a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]] process to produce lactic acid, so careful control of temperature and salt content are crucial to the recipe.  Fresh olives are naturally quite acidic, and so acid must be removed before they become palatable; depending upon the process used, several batches of brine might draw acid from the fruit and be thrown away before the final batch is added for storage.

It is widely believed that [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] has its origins in a method of pickling.  Its defining ingredient is rice flavored with a brine of vinegar, sugar, and salt.

'''Vinegar''' is a liquid consisting mainly of acetic acid (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and water. The acetic acid is produced by a process of [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]] of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/9/1217.extract vinegar Studies on acetic acid-bacteria Retrieved Oct. 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally vinegar is made from a carbohydrate (fruit, grain, etc.) which can yield complex flavors, aromas, and colors. Commercial white vinegar, however, is basically a pure chemical.

[[Cookbook:Alcoholic drinks|Alcoholic drinks]] come in many basic forms, each defined by its ingredients and methods of manufacture; the same processes can be adjusted to produce acetic acid rather than ethanol, yielding a variety of vinegars.  Some of these are named for their analogous alcohol. 

===pH Value===

Vinegar has a pH value of about 3.

===Density===

Vinegar has a density of approximately 0.96 g/mL. The density level depends on the acidity of the vinegar.

==Varieties==
 
===Traditional balsamic vinegar===

[[Image:Barrels vinegar.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Casks of balsamic vinegar]]
Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces of Italy. The original product—Traditional Balsamic Vinegar—is made from the concentrated juice, or must of white Trebbiano grapes. It is very dark brown in color and its flavor is rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being the product of years of aging in a successive number of casks made of various types of wood (including oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper, ash, and acacia). Originally an artisanal product available only to the Italian upper classes, balsamic vinegar became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century. True balsamic is aged at least 12 years, and is protected under the European Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) system.&lt;ref&gt;EC Council Regulation No. 813/2000&lt;/ref&gt; One can sometimes even find balsamic vinegars that have been aged for up to 100 years, though they are usually very expensive. Balsamic has a high acid level, but the sweetness covers the tart flavor, making it very mellow.

===Balsamic wine vinegar===

The commercial balsamic sold in supermarkets is typically made with red wine vinegar or concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar which is laced with caramel and sugar. However produced, balsamic needs to be made from a grape product. it is also black

===Cider vinegar===
* [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|Cider vinegar]] (apples)

===Malt vinegar===

Malt vinegar is made by malting barley, causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. An ale is then brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged. It is typically light brown in color. 

A cheaper alternative, called &quot;non-brewed condiment,&quot; is a solution of 4-8% acetic acid colored with caramel (usually E150). There is also around 1-3% citric acid present.

===Rice vinegar===
* [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|Rice vinegar]]

Rice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia. It is available in white (actually light yellow), red, and black variants. In Japanese cuisine, a light and more delicate rice vinegar is preferred for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings. Red rice vinegar is traditionally colored with red yeast rice, although some Chinese brands use artificial food coloring instead. Black rice vinegar (made with black glutinous rice) is most popular in China, although it is also produced in Japan (see East Asian black, below). It may be used as a substitute for balsamic vinegar, although its dark color and the fact that it is aged may be the only similarity between the two products. Some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings.

===White vinegar===

White vinegar can be made by oxidizing a distilled alcohol. Alternatively, it may be nothing more than a solution of acetic acid and salt in water. Most commercial white vinegars are 5% acetic acid solutions, although some US states such as Virginia have laws prohibiting the sale as vinegar of any product not made from acetous fermentation of alcohol. These are made from alcoholic solutions  fermented from cereals (often maize) and water. 

===Wine vinegar===
Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar in Mediterranean countries and Central Europe. As with wine, there is a considerable range in quality. Better quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two years and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends to have a lower acidity than that of white or cider vinegars. There are more expensive wine vinegars made from individual varieties of wine, such as Champagne, Shrry, or Pinot Grigio.

AROS should run on almost any i386 PC hardware so long as the CPU is newer than an i486, and has a &quot;Floating Point Unit (FPU)&quot;. Ideally around 700Mhz and above with at least 256MB of memory is recommended for desktops and around 1GHz and at least 256MB for laptops/notebooks/netbooks. With more RAM memory, ie above 1GB, the option arrives to run web browsers, media players and other hard disk heavy usage from RAM: disk.

Motherboards supported 
* Most NVIDIA nForce2 (2002/3) motherboards are well supported 
* Most Intel mobos are supported (recommended Skt 775) but may need additional pci / pci-e cards for networking, etc 
* AMD based socket 939 am2 am2+ am3+ and fusion based systems work but additional pci cards may be needed 




Supported graphics cards (gfx) 
* Nvidia 2D and 3D. Nouveau supports '''2D''' from TNT through to latest gtxxx - '''3D''' acceleration for geforce5, gf6, gf7, gf8 and gf9 
* Intel 2D and 3D. '''2D''' for many netbooks and motherboards. '''3D''' for a few early netbooks and motherboards 
* AMD/ATI Radeon 2D only. External monitor support only (ie some laptop support) for 7000 through to x600. Experimental 2D version for up to HD3xxx 
* VESA 2D fallback modes for all graphic cards (GPUs) and with [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKCHZFYj9Kk screen dragging]

You could always go the [http://www.vesalia.de/ AresOne] route, but should you decide they are not for you it's not too difficult to put together a fully supported dedicated AROS machine these days. Read more about peoples experience here at [http://www.amiga.org/forums/showpost.php?p=644066&amp;postcount=13 amiga.org] and here at [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=42093#forumpost42093 Aros-Exec]. 




It is very hard to recommend a completely supported motherboard because as soon as newer motherboards arrive so their features change subtly, often introducing non supported parts like ethernet and audio. It is a moving target. A mini-itx motherboard will only get you 1 pci or pci-e slot. mATX or uATX will have more, typically 2 pci-e or pci slots which helps if any onboard features are not supported. 

'''N.B''' It is frustrating when a piece of hardware is not supported. Hardware documentation can run to over 100 pages and a lot of hardware do not have any public documentation anyway. Chips from different manufacturers for sound, graphics, SATA, etc. vary just as much, unless they follow a standard such as HDAudio, AHCI etc. 

Coding drivers is a far cry from Hello World programs or even a port of existing software. If you do actually want to try then get a hold of documentation on the relevant hardware and start there. Alternatively you could try to find some '''BSD''', MIT or MPL licence drivers as a point of reference. Please , do not think you can just adapt strings in a driver for different strings, it does not work that way. You will '''need''' to start from scratch for each new bit of hardware. Device driver programming require '''embedded''' skills, like manipulation of bits within registers, good debugging skills, dealing with interrupts, lots of patience, etc. 



The following specific chipsets and drivers are also available - use Tools/PCITool to confirm Vendor and Product IDs - Please let us know any mistakes or any information to be added, to this General Chat list [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/ AROS-Exec] or here [http://arosworld.org/news.php AROS World]

===Audio Chipsets===

'''If sound beeps in AHI prefs after Music set then some support is there. Select more than one channel for multiple audio streams, set frequency up to 44khz or higher and set the volume if not already set. Ensure you set the music unit 0 to 3 which allows the extra features of the audio card like microphone, line-out, etc).''' 


What is going wrong or Debugging... 

&lt;pre&gt;
add debug=memory to grub boot line - continue booting with F10 
Open a shell 
Tools/Debug/Bifteck &gt; RAM:audio.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

or 

&lt;pre&gt;
Open a shell 
Tools/Debug/Sashimi &gt; RAM:audio.txt
Run ahi prefs
Click test tone button 
Stop sashimi with Ctrl-C 
&lt;/pre&gt;




====1996-2000 sb128.audio aka SB16 PCI====

as per CREATIVE's website, the model number is the first two digits on the front and first two digits on the back. my card says CT4810 and 161TK110B 995; this translates to CT4816 as the model. 

The original AudioPCI 3000 card with the ES1370 had a master clock crystal for 44.1 kHz (22.5792 MHz), used an AKM codec (AK4531, non-AC97) and had 4 channel output; Creative later modified the design with a crystal for 48 kHz (24.576 MHz) and Sigmatel AC97 codec (apparently there also was a CT4700 SB128 with a CT5507 chip, AK4531, 22.5792 MHz crystal and TDA7360 speaker power amp). The issue with these cards involved never quite eliminate the effects of resampling on the 64V, it also shows signs of undersized coupling caps. What I liked about these Ensoniq cards is the automatically engaged headphone amplifier (with a 4565 opamp).

====1998-2003 emu10kx.audio - Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live! and Audigy====

;Look for emu10k1 or emu10k2 chipset on the audio card and '''NOT''' emu10kx 

the green jack is for the main speaker pair AND headphones, so manual switching will be required 
If your card is wired for the &quot;AC97&quot; standard, then it's up to your headphone jack to switch the green speaker output in and out 
the headphone jack has Normally-closed contacts that will open on insertion, which breaks the signal path back to the sound card (FP_RETURN)

*6.4 27-12-2008 


The AC97 chips were designed to be pinout interchangeable so that the sound support could change easily and quickly. 

the green jack is for the main speaker pair AND headphones, so manual switching will be required 
If your card is wired for the &quot;AC97&quot; standard, then it's up to your headphone jack to switch the green speaker output in and out 
the headphone jack has Normally-closed contacts that will open on insertion, which breaks the signal path back to the sound card (FP_RETURN)

====2005-20xx HDAUDIO.audio (formerly known as “Azalia”)====

The HD Audio standard was designed to be pinout interchangeable so that the sound support could change easily and quickly. 

Using Prefs/AHI ensure you set the music unit and at least Units 0 (where most audio comes from) in top left drop down menu to HDaudio - HIFI in the section below. Set Units 1 or 2 to microphone or other outputs. Plus allow more than one channel for multiple audio streams and set frequency up to 44khz or higher on the right hand side of the ahi prefs. If sound beeps when you press the test button then all should be OK. 

This driver is made up of two parts a [http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio.txt Controller + a Codec]. The ProductID and VendorID are for the audio controller only - the important additional codec is '''NOT''' so easily identified. Some codecs missing at the moment. Use QUERYD below to find out the codec used. 

HDAudio standard has headphones on a separate DAC, and it's up to the driver.. it can even send different audio to the headphones without interrupting the main (green) outputs

Things to try if sound not working 

* try to connect something to the audio jack, maybe it is not playing on internal speakers or vice versa 
* make sure you try and select all music units e.g. unit0, unit1.... 
* even if PCI ID's are in HDaudio.config, this doesn't mean it is working, it is the codec that matters 
* it might be internally muted 
* try an [http://www.clusteruk.com/SitePortalPage.aspx?siteid=1&amp;did=109 earlier version], just rename existing one first 


If the boot sound is enabled, you have to use Bifteck to capture AHI debug output. In the GRUB menu, press E on your selected entry, then add &quot;debug=memory&quot; to the options (alongside ATA=, vesa= etc.). Then Ctrl-X to boot. Once booted, run Tools/Debug/Bifteck. 

or 

* try adding QUERYD to the start of ENVARC:hdaudio.config file (also known as Prefs/Env-Archive/) ie. on the first line 
* '''OR''' try removing QUERY and QUERYD from the start of the hdaudio.config file 
* Reboot
* open a shell
* type: sys:tools/debug/sashimi &gt; ram:debug.txt
* open ahi prefs
* select one of the audio modes - HIFI or otherwise 
* press the 'test sound' button
* press ctrl-c in the shell
* post the results to Aros-Exec 


If you are a developer, maybe take a look at the [http://developer.opensound.com/ OSS audio driver sources], [http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Download alsa] for ideas for fixes for our drivers. 

To get version of the driver check with he AHI pref or type into shell '''version HDAudio.audio''' or the version button in DOpus with driver highlighted.

====Envy24 series ====

A little history. VIA bought the ICE created Envy chipsets [http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/audio/controllers/comparison_controller.jsp VT1712] first. A few years later, they created several cheaper variants VT1724 (mixer missing), VT1721 (low end cut down), VT1720 (embedded on motherboard) and lastly the VT1723 (no support apart from Windows Envy24DT like SYBA SD-PEX63034). 

There are PCI Express versions appearing. 

The Envy24 is the base product that was originally designed by ICEnsemble, and it supports multi-channel hardware mixing, which is great for professional use. The HT version removes the hardware mixer (unimportant for non-professional uses). The [http://www.avsforum.com/t/364771/envy24ht-s-the-definitive-source HT-S] version is almost exactly the same as the HT, it just uses cheaper DACs. The PT version is exactly the same as the HT-S version, it is just the edition used for on-board audio on motherboards.

N.B. [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec04/articles/pcnotes.htm PCI slot identification] and [http://hsi.web.cern.ch/HSI/s-link/devices/s32pci64/slottypes.html 3.3v PCI].

===GFX Chipsets===

DVI [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2238&amp;forum=7&amp;post_id=18056#forumpost18056 HDMI] displays that have a native resolution of 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.

* HDMI 1.2 720p res. 
* HDMI 1.3 1080 resolution 
* HDMI 1.4 above 1080 res. 


Use vesa for 8xx series Intel graphics of early 2000 like 830GM (0x8086, 0x3577). 


AGP works but faster transfers through the AGP slot are only available on a few supported motherboard chipsets 
* Faster AGP Working = [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=53634#forumpost53634 SIS 650 board], Intel 865pe AGP slot on MSI 6788-050, 
* Faster AGP Not = NForce2 chipsets, [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=37351#forumpost37351 some Intel 815/820 chipsets], VIA chipsets, ALi chipsets, 

'''N.B.''' Please do not put [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pN0FegvNk pre 2000 agp graphic cards in post 2000 motherboards] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWW67dstwsA vice versa]. 


PCI Express (PCI-e) appears to have no transfer speed issues with graphic cards.

====[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA Intel GMA]====

DVI output is not supported at the moment. 

If having problems:

* Ensure the latest version is being used. 
* Set GMA_MEM to 128 or 256 to test 
* Try the FORCEGMA ToolType for 2D, and try the FORCEGALLIUM ToolType for 3D acceleration after 2D is verified to work. ToolTypes should be applied to the Devs/Monitors/IntelGMA monitor icon.

If still having problems:

* At GRUB boot screen edit boot line and add option: debug=memory
* Boot.
* Use shell command: tools/debug/bifteck &gt; RAM:debug.txt
* And post [GMA MONITOR DETECTION] and other related debug lines [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=20&amp;topic_id=5833&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0 here]

The best graphics card a person can buy for AROS is a 9800gtx, followed by other 9800 variations, followed by 9600GT, followed by 8800GTS. Its (9800gtx) the highest clocked gpu based on that architecture with most stream processors that is well supported by AROS' gallium + mesa combo. Higher clock/memory speed seems more important to AROS than stream processors. 


Nouveau [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_315_3graphics&amp;num=1 development and actual benchmark speed tests are a lot slower] than the rival radeon support in 2D and 3D 

2013 limited Nvidia support appears 

2014 re-clocking additions provides performance improvements,

====radeon.hidd====

Michel Shultz 2D driver (standard on most distributions) and [http://www.syntaxsociety.se/~bearsoft/ updated driver] can be tested and discussed [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2533&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=54785#forumpost54785 here] 


Gallium Radeon HD not ported yet 

r300g - 9600 to X1900 - llvm not needed - r300 software driver deprecated  

r600g Evergreen - HD 2xxx to 6xxx - llvm not necessarily needed and can use swrast - r600 software driver deprecated 

SI - HD 7xxx and up - faster llvmpipe required (extra bounty) and early days (2014) for this driver 



2013 was a big year for the r600g gallium3d radeon driver with uvd (hardware h.264 video decoding) support via VDPAU in April and Dynamic Power Management added in July for 4000 to 7000 

2014 bug fixing for r600g

2015 radeonSI support improved

Unless your computer uses a Firewire chipset manufactured by Texas Instruments, FireWire interfaces are likely to act buggy. 
AROS is unlikely to ever support FireWire. 



Bluetooth is similarly unlikely to be ever supported due to huge cost to be certified. 




No x86 PCMCIA card.resource at the moment. Writing card.resource would be a similar amount of work to writing a typical driver. However, it might be complicated by having to support a variety of PCMCIA-controller chipsets like TI PCI1225, PCI1410, PCI1420, 1450, PCIxx12 and O2, etc. m68k card.resource does not really have many higher level functions, most functions are really simple or poke Gayle registers directly. only exception is CopyTuple(). Amiga card.resource has one significant flaw: it's single-unit. would need card.resource and pccard.library. There was talk in the past of designing a new API for PCMCIA because card.resource only supports one slot, but since most modern laptops only have one slot anyway, I think it might be worthwhile to implement card.resource as-is (at least as a first step). pccard.library would be trivial to port. So, new API is needed.

The more I work with AHCI, the more I realize that it's going to take a pile of test hardware just to figure out all the different bugs in all the motherboard chipsets and add-on PCI cards that 'kinda' implement AHCI. 
Not to mention Silicon Image, which took a very different approach from Intel's AHCI in their SATA controllers.

== Selecting ==
When you choose a computer, it is suggested to think about what you want to do with it.  If all you plan to do is surf the web, send a few e-mails and write someone a letter, any new computer you find for sale will work well.  Currently available computers have more than enough processing power for the tasks most people use.  The more expensive models provide extra performance or software that you may or may not use.  In fact, even computers as old as five years may be more than adequate for your needs.  You can save a bundle by buying a refurbished or used computer from a big company (like Dell or HP) or from a small, local reseller (like Computer Renaissance -- a franchise/chain).  Most people spend more than they need.

What you need to get is determined by what you plan to do with your computer.  If you don't plan to play high end games, you don't need a $500 video card, a $1000 top of the line processor, and a $400 hard drive.  If you are typing letters to your grandkids there is no way you can type faster than even the slowest new computers.  Consider what you plan to do, how much you want to spend and choose your computer from there. Don't be the guy who bought a performance computer and 24&quot; LCD screen when he just wanted to play games!

There are a few choices you have to make, as described below:

===Desktop v. Laptop===
It comes down to a choice between size and price.  Desktop computers (those with a tower case and a separate monitor) offer better value for money.  They are usually cheaper and faster than laptops.  Laptops, on the other hand, are easy to carry from place to place and can be set-up on any table or your lap (although lap use tends to be discouraged by manufacturers due to heat issues, and most have gone so far as to discourage the use of the term &quot;laptop&quot;, preferring &quot;notebook&quot; instead).

If mobility is a must, or in other words you would like to be able to take your computer with you anywhere you go, spend the extra to get a laptop. An important factor to consider with laptops is that, due to their compact design, they are also more prone to hardware failure, making an extended warranty a must. If you just plan to use your computer at your desk at home, save a few bucks and get a desktop. For computer gaming, desktops are generally considered greatly superior, as laptops manufacturers are forced to cram lots of hardware into a small chassis. Most laptops are oriented for business use.

The term &quot;Netbook&quot; refers to an increasingly common subgroup of laptops,  small-sized devices which are approximately the size of a small book and so highly portable and easy to carry, able to connect to a network and make use of the Internet. In general, they are significantly less powerful than most computers, CPU wise even the average normal size laptop.  

For an idea of how big the difference typically is, a laptop will generally cost 20-30% more than a comparable desktop.

===Optical Drives===
Almost all computers come with some sort of Compact Disc drive.  With a standard CD drive you can play music CDs and install software stored on CDs.
  
For a little extra you can get a drive that will play both CDs and DVDs.  That means you can watch movies on your computer.   
The next step after that is what is called a recordable CD (CD-R).  This allows you to be able to record your own Compact Discs.  You can create music CDs or save data to a disc for safe keeping.  Some CD-R can also play DVDs and are called combo drives.
 
The top of the line are DVD recorders (DVD-R, DVD+R or DVD-/+R).  They can create both read and write CDs and DVDs.  Most home DVD players will play DVDs that you create on your computer.  There are two types of DVD recorders: the +R and the -R.  Try to get a recorder that works with both formats. If one will fit into your budget, get a DVD recorder.

Currently, a new type of optical disk, the Blu-ray disk, has been released as the successor to double-layered/doubled sided DVD's. At 50GB storage, it is approximately 3 times as large as the largest DVD. However, Blu-ray disks are expensive, but the price of them has fallen down recently. They are generally used to watch High-Definition Movies (or HD movies) and to store large files.

===Hard Drives===
Hard drives are like big filing cabinets for your computer.  Although they are all the same physical size (except in desktop v. laptop comparison), hard drives come in different capacities.  When it comes to hard drives, bigger is better, within reason.  As of early 2010 the bottom end is about a 160GB (gigabytes*).  This would allow you to install quite a few programs and still have room left for your data.  An upgrade to a 500GB or 1TB (TB = Terabyte) is a good idea, to give yourself that little bit extra room.  If you plan to do lots of video editing, or playing lots of games, you might want to consider drives larger than 1 TB.  If you start to run out of room for your stuff you can always add a second hard drive later.  Remember, there's no sense in buying a 1TB hard drive if you only surf the Net. 

As of 2010, a new category of Hard Drives has appeared. They make use of flash memory, a non-moving component, to store information. It's like a filing cabinet, but it doesn't open or close. Since there are no moving parts, reading from and writing to the disk is now much faster. So far capacity and availability is limited, however as it gets cheaper, it is likely drives like these will be found everywhere.

When sorting through HD controllers, SATA150 is better than IDE, SATA 300 is twice as good as SATA150. IDE are moving towards legacy and SCSI controllers are rarely found on consumer grade hardware.

===CPU (Processor) ===
The processor is the brains of the computer; it does all the calculating.  Simply put, faster is better.  However, faster is generally more expensive, produces more heat and uses more energy.  Unless you plan on playing the latest games, or doing a lot of video editing, buy a middle of the pack processor.  You can save some money by going with a slower processor, or spend a few extra for a little more speed.  This book recommends that you stay away from the very high end as you spend a lot more money for only a small increase in performance.  For instance, the highest-end processor in the Core i7 line, labeled the &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; (EE), will add approximatively $1,000 to the price of the chip for only about a 10% speed increase.  

There are two main CPU manufacturers, Intel and AMD.  Competition keeps them fairly evenly matched.  Intel offers the high-end Core i7's and the low-end Core i3's processors while AMD has the high-end Phenon II lines, and the mid-range and low-range 64-bit Athlon 64, respectively.  The low-end processors (i3 and Athlon 64) tend to offer 75% of the performance of their big brothers, at about 50% of the price - although this varies between applications.

===RAM (Memory)===
RAM (Random Access Memory), is memory that is not on your hard drive that your computer uses to store things you have not saved, such as a web page, a document that you are typing, or as data from a application.  RAM is much faster than a hard drive - every letter you type would take about a second if you used just the hard drive.  As with most things computer-related, more is better.  This book suggests getting a minimum of 1GB (gigabyte) - 2GB (gigabyte) of RAM.  If you have a little extra money, you may want to go with 4GB or 6GB. Unless you are going to be doing lots of video editing, anything over that is a little excessive.

In any case, the amount of memory you will need will be dictated by the applications you will be using. For example, games or graphics-heavy applications such as Adobe Photoshop will demand considerably more RAM than text-based software such as email programs and word processors.

===Operating System===
An Operating System is a software that interacts with the applications and peripherals. It is the choice of the user which operating system they wish to install. Operating systems fall under various categories-- i.e., some are designed to act as server and some as client, or server operating system, which serves many individual computers (client), and Client operating system, which serves the client itself, i.e., your individual computer. An operating system, in layman's terms, can be defined as a software designed to enable interaction between the hardware and the user. With the help of the operating system, you can install various need-specific applications and control the peripherals, such as printers, modem, speakers and removable drives. In short, a new computer is a bare hardware device, incapable of any operation; it needs an operating system that interacts between the user and the hardware to bring desired results to perform various tasks.

The operating system is likely the most essential part of a computer. An operating system is what connects the computer to the applications, or programs the user wishes to use, software speaking. 

Although Windows is the most popular operating system, this does not necessarily make it the best. One may also consider an Apple Macintosh system, which places focus on a better user interface, or Linux, which intends to be more compact and reliable.  As always, one is advised to take a look at all available options, and choose the most useful interface.

===Virus Protection===
If you are using Windows, virus protection is recommended.  Most of them are paid products that require a subscription such as Norton or McAfee, but there are free products or with free personal licenses (non-commercial uses) like AVG, Malwarebytes or Avast!.  Linux and Mac have not received too many recent viruses being small segments of the market (a smaller target) and due to those operative system offering a higher degree of protection against virus.
You, Yourself must be very careful on what you download. Try to find history or proof on anything you download to assure yourself that it isn't a virus. Sometimes they will pop up as cool looking games that have to be downloaded. These viruses are very dangerous. Some watch your every move and others can burn out your entire computer.

===Video card===
Computers aren't very useful if you can't see anything, unless you build a server or other form of distributed workstation.
A video card allows the computer to 'talk to' the monitor.

*  If you plan to do '''any 3D''' gaming whatsoever, you need a graphics card. There are two main companies who produce graphics card chipsets: ATI and Nvidia.  Both make good graphics cards in all price and performance ranges and you should do more research before choosing a specific card. Basically, the more expensive cards allow you to play fancier games.  Video cards have their own onboard RAM and have their own processor known as a Graphics Processing Unit (or GPU). Sometimes, you will find PCs with dual graphics. This gives the user 2x the power of one card. It will cost more, as having a 2 card configuration requires a dedicated motherboard. 

* If you only want to surf the web, write documents, send and receive email, then ''&quot;integrated graphics&quot;'' are fine and costs much less. Most low-end computers come with what is known as integrated graphics--very basic graphics built right into the motherboard, suitable for business applications.

Also keep in mind that graphics processing requires memory. Memory can be available from any single source on your PC.
* a video card as described here, that has its own on-board memory
* video chip(s) embedded on the motherboard that have memory
* video chip(s) that need to share the RAM described above

Most desktop and notebook computers have only one memory source for processing graphics.

Building a computer is not as difficult as it sounds. It is not recommended for absolute beginners, but if you have toyed with computers for some time, it might be a good idea, especially if you plan on playing games. It can save you a bundle on hardware. There is a separate WikiBook on this, as well as some other resources online.

=Copying your files from the scanner=

==FTP==

You will probably need an FTP program like SmartFTP (for Windows) or AxyFTP (for Linux) to connect to your scanner and download all the images that have been acquired. 

==Building your own DICOM archive==

Instead of copying your files via FTP or CD/DVD, you may set up a DICOM server or connect to a PACS/RIS using free DICOM tools.

There are some free DICOM toolkits around from which you can build your own DICOM archive. An ancient, but very robust DICOM server can be found at ftp://ftp.erl.wustl.edu/pub/dicom/software/ctn/. The software is known to compile and run under both 32bit and 64bit Linux. Once you have set it up, you can configure your scanner console to send the images to this server using the scanner GUI.


=Reconstruction of functional images=

See with your physics team.

'''Ume juice''' is extracted by preserving the fruits in sugar.  It tastes sweet and acidic, and is a refreshing drink, often enjoyed in the summer.  '''Ume-shu''' is sweet and smooth.  The taste and aroma of ume-shu can appeal to even those people who normally dislike the taste of [[Cookbook:Alcohol|alcohol]]. 
==Ingredients==
*Raw ume: 1kg
*Hard rock sugar: 1kg
*[[Cookbook:Honey|Honey]]: to taste
*White liquor: a bit to taste
*A container: preferably a sealable glassware container.

==Procedure==
#Wash raw ume and wipe clean of moisture.
#Cram tightly into container with rock sugar. White liquor can be poured in at this time.
#Pour honey into container on top of ume.
#Leave in a cool, dark place until fruit are shriveled and leathery.
#Remove fruit from container.

Dilute this liquid with two times as much water to drink.
Should be kept in a cool place during summer.

'''Umeboshi''' (&amp;#26757;&amp;#24178;, pickled Japanese plum) is a kind of [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] food. It's one of the Japanese traditional foods and it has been popular in Japan. It is red, round, and its taste ranges from sour to sweet.
Texture ranges from dry and crunchy to saturated and &quot;globby&quot;, depending on the method it was preserved.

==Ingredients==
*Japanese plums
*Red shiso
*Salts

==Procedure==
#Sterilize jar and utensils with potable alcohol or boiling water, remove damaged fruit.
#Wash Japanese plums and wipe them dry. 
#Remove their stems.
#Cover with water and let stand overnight.
#Drain water and place plums in larger non-reactive container
#Put salt and newly destemmed plums in the container.
#Turn them repeatedly and vigorously.
#Place a plate on top of plums.
#Place big, heavy rock or bottle filled with water on top of plate to increase the pressuring done to the plums.
#Wait until the water increases in the jar-will take two weeks or more.
#Weather the Japanese plums for 3 days and 3 nights of sunny day in high summer on flat baskets or any other flat instrument. 
#Strain the liquid and boil to remove any impurities and save in a jar.
#During step #8, rub salt into red chiso to remove scum.Squeeze the chiso to remove liquid.
#Put the Japanese plums and red chiso into the jar with the saved liquid. If chiso is not ready, can be added to the plums later.

      <comment>/* Acoustic or Electric */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A new guitar can be purchased for a moderate price. Modern manufacturing techniques coupled with mass production keeps costs low while intonation and playability are preserved by precise machining. Most manufacturers offer a full range of guitars from budget to custom-shop.  

== Acoustic or Electric ==

The first decision a buyer has to make is which type of guitar to purchase. After deciding this the buyer should research the models available within their price-range. Research avoids impulse buying and allows an informed decision to be made. It is recommended that a first guitar be bought from a guitar shop. Pawn-brokers and charity shops may offer second-hand guitars but all decisions fall upon the buyer who may not be experienced in spotting flaws or damage. Guitar shops will offer a range of new guitars from established manufacturers and a selection of second-hand guitars without faults. It is important that the buyer not be swayed from their informed choice on the day of purchase. If you know that you want to play electric guitar in a band than this is the correct type of guitar to purchase. It is not uncommon that when faced with a bewildering range of guitars in a shop a buyer may choose to purchase a different type of guitar other than their original choice. If at anytime a doubt arises whilst purchasing it is better to walk away and review your aims and buying options.  

Singer-songwriters favour the steel-string acoustic guitar as the standard accompaniment for solo performance. The buyer should be aware that acoustic guitars have no internal pickups for amplification so a microphone must be placed in front of the sound-hole for recording. An electro-acoustic guitar is an acoustic guitar with pickups and a quarter inch jack output which allows the electro-acoustic guitar to be plugged into an amplifier. Note that thin-line guitars are not true acoustics and it is a common error that beginners raise the action in the belief that there is something wrong with their thin-line guitar which despite its obvious acoustic build has buzzing strings and produces a weak volume when played unplugged. Thin-line guitars are electric guitars with a body that imparts an acoustic resonance when amplified.  

=== Testing A Guitar ===
[[File:Martin D28 Acoustic Guitar.jpg|thumb|130px|Martin D28 acoustic guitar]]

* The height of the strings above the fretboard is called the action. If the action is too low the strings will buzz and if the action is too high more effort is required to push the strings down. Acoustic guitars have their action set by the factory and should not need further adjustment and therefore acoustics with a high action should be avoided since this may be a sign of faulty construction or a warped neck. You can test the action by playing barre chords at different positions. If the barre chords are difficult to play then the action may be set too high. 

* Intonation is a term used to describe accurate tuning over the range of the guitar which is three octaves. A guitar with its intonation set correctly ensures that an open C chord played on the first three frets sounds the same as a C barre chord played at the eighth fret. Guitarists use octaves to check intonation by striking an open string then fretting its twelfth fret octave equivalent. The open string and its octave should be in tune together with neither being sharp or flat in relation to the other. On all electric guitars the intonation can be adjusted at home by the player using an electronic guitar tuner but for acoustic guitars any adjustments must be made by a luthier since the nut and bridge need to be adjusted by filing and shaving. Guitar manufacturers ensure that the intonation is set at the factory and a further check is normally made by guitar dealers before a guitar is put on display. A second-hand guitar must be tested for intonation problems as sometimes a warped neck will render accurate intonation impossible though the guitar may sound in tune in the first position. Intonation depends on the straightness of the neck, whether the nut allows correct spacing and seating of the strings, the height of the bridge, and the scale of the frets. Intonation and tuning are two related but different concepts. Setting the intonation is about preparing the guitar so that it can be accurately tuned across its complete range. 

* The guitar should be played from its first to last fret on all strings to check for fret buzz and wolf notes. Fret buzz may be present when the truss rod is not properly adjusted or the action has been set too low. Worn fretboards or incorrectly shaped fret-wire can also cause fret buzz. Wolf notes sound dull and lack sustain and in some cases they can affect the tuning stability of a guitar. It is common to find a wolf note on the G string in the first position though they can occur anywhere on the neck where string contact to the fret is impeded or incorrect. The problematic wolf note can be corrected by sending the guitar to a luthier for setting-up and adjustment. The luthier will ask you which make of guitar strings you use and will adjust the guitar for that gauge. The guitar must be restrung every time with that particular string brand and gauge to preserve the set-up. Re-grooving nuts, adjusting necks and permanent bridge alterations are best left to a luthier whose traditional skills coupled with modern tools like the oscilloscope and precision calipers ensures a stable match between the strings and the guitar.   

* Look for misaligned screws on electric guitars as these may be a sign of wear or previous adjustments. On acoustic guitars glue spots may point to flaws though in most cases they are just residue that wasn't wiped off the guitar and generally don't affect the tone or playability. Loose switches on electric guitars are common and if dirt has accumulated then the familiar crackling of reduced contact will be heard when a pot or switch is moved. Pots, switches and wiring can be replaced so a good electric guitar with these problems should not be dismissed though the price should reflect the cost of replacing the damaged parts. Look down the sight of the neck to check for a warped neck and to ensure that the guitar strings are all at the same height. The thickness (gauge) of the low E string may not allow it to sit in the nut groove correctly and it may be slightly higher than the other strings. This may be a sign that you need thinner gauge strings or that the guitar needs to be set-up. Run your finger along the neck edges where the fret-wire ends. Fret-wire is tapped into a fretboard and then cut flush with the neck edge. As you run your finger along you should not feel any fret-wire protruding and this is an indication that the manufacturer has ensured a degree of quality control.

* The intonation tuners located on the bridge of most electric guitars should be in a neat staggered row with the high E string intonation tuner nearest to the neck and the low E string intonation tuner furthest away from the neck. If testing a guitar you notice that the intonation tuners are not in a diagonal line from the high E to low E than this is a sign that someone has attempted to adjust the bridge and intonation tuners to set the action and has probably rendered the guitar unplayable. This is not a construction fault and the intonation tuners can be adjusted so that the guitar can be tuned correctly. It is common when you see misaligned intonation tuners that the bridge has also been raised to its highest position. The only time a bridge should be deliberately raised to its highest position is when a guitarist chooses to set-up a guitar permanently for use with a slide.

=== Buying a guitar that suits your playing style ===
* Try as many different necks as you can until you find a guitar neck that you feel comfortable with. Gibson favours a flat wide neck and Fender a thinner neck. Some guitarists find that bending strings on a Gibson neck is more stable and precise due to the extra surface while others prefer the thinner neck of a Fender and the ease with which you can bend strings an octave or more. Try different necks until you find one that responds to your playing style.

* The guitar should be comfortable to hold. Some guitarists like the heavier weight of Gibsons while others prefer the thinner and lighter bodies of Stratocasters. More important is the sound characteristics of a guitar. Telecasters are not as comfortable to hold as Stratocasters but many guitarists are drawn to their distinctive sound.
  
* The majority of new guitars have a medium action either set at the factory or adjusted by the dealer. Lead guitarists sometimes prefer a very low action which sacrifices a small amount of tone for speed and ease. Slide guitarists will raise the action up to a height that renders normal fretting very difficult though this does ensure clarity of tone when using a metal or glass slide with alternative tunings. A medium action is ideal for a beginner as it maintains tuning stability while providing a clear tone. 

* Test as many models and price-ranges as you can. You should test guitars in the price range above your budget to familiarise yourself with the differences. Dealers are quite happy to give potential customers a long time to test different guitars without any sales pressure. Note that not all sales assistants are guitarists since a shop that sells both keyboards and guitars may prefer to hire a pianist to demonstrate their keyboard range. In this situation the buyer must rely on their own knowledge.

* Do not be distracted. Testing guitars involves all the mental faculties. It is during these moments that a buyer may make a wrong decision. If at any time during testing you feel as though distractions are affecting your concentration then walk away and refocus.

=== Where to buy a guitar ===

* Buying a guitar from a friend or relative who plays is an ideal way to avoid some of the common pitfalls of a first purchase. Relatives and friends may also help you search for a good guitar if they do not have one that they want to sell. It is recommended that the final choice should be made by the purchaser since guidance is never fool-proof.

* A local guitar or music store that has an established reputation. Many guitarists return to the same local shop to buy strings and other extras though a larger dealer should be sought if the range of guitars offered by your local dealer is too small. Second-hand guitars need to tested thoroughly before purchasing. If the buyer is unsure of what faults to look for then a new guitar might be the better option.

See below for more unusual ideas.

==Procedure==

===Beans===
#If using dried beans, wash them and examine them for any rocks, then soak overnight in plenty of water. Discard the soak water before cooking - your pot plants will love it!
#Cook the beans until soft:
#*If using a stove-top method, [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] them in lots of water until they are very soft. You'll need to cook the beans a very long time on very low heat. You may add salt or black pepper to the water. You may add onion halves or a [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] bone, which you can remove at the end. Changing the water from time to time will reduce the risk of [[w:Flatulence|gas]]. Expect the cooking to take at least 3 hours, if not 6 or more.
#*If using a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], place the beans and some flavoring (typically [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]) in enough water to cover all the beans fully, and bring to pressure.  Keep the pressure for about 20 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the pressure fall naturally (about 15 minutes).

===Rice===
#If using rice, cook as steamed rice (usually 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of rice)
#Rinse rice well, until the water runs clear
#Add 2 cups of water per cup of rice, and bring to a boil, then reduce to the lowest heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. 
#Set aside with the lid secured, for at least 5 minutes before use.

===All fillings===
#Get a large wide pot or tall-sided [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] any onion or garlic in a little oil.
#Add uncooked meats to the pan and fry, stirring to ensure it browns all over. If using a ground (minced) meat, break it up as it cooks. Drain any excess grease. 
#Add any other well-cooked meat or beans. You might want to smash the beans, perhaps with a potato masher. When using beans alone, you might want to add up to 20% home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] (lard substitutions are obvious, but will lack flavor).
#Add spices and other flavorings as necessary.
#Add tomatoes, and cooked rice if using it. Reduce the heat. Simmer in open pan for about 40 minutes or until the liquid from the tomatoes is gone.
#Soften the tortillas by heating them up. Use a small amount of oil to prevent sticking, if heating in a pan that isn't non-stick. Cover with [[Cookbook:Aluminium Foil|aluminium foil]] if heating them in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], to protect the tortillas from moisture loss.
#Place the filling mixture onto a tortilla. Add non-cooked fillings like cheese, olives, avocados, shredded lettuce, salsa.

===Rolling===
# Position your tortilla flat on a suitable surface such as a kitchen counter top. (12-inch tortillas are suggested. If you can find bigger tortillas, use them!)
# Place your fillings on the flat tortilla in any order.
# Fold the bottom flap up. Ensure that there is a sufficient amount of tortilla used for the flap. A small flap will allow the fillings to escape, possibly falling in your lap and burning you.
# Bring the side up and over your filling. Tucking the edge of the tortilla under your filling is an excellent extra step. 
# Create a small fold with the remaining side of the tortilla. This is the ''key'' to maintaining burrito integrity. Failure is a given if you do not follow this step!  (The small, diagonal flap is an extra &quot;lock&quot; for the bottom flap of the tortilla… without it, the weight of the filling has the power to force the bottom flap right out of itself.) 
# Bring the remaining tortilla flap over the filling. Eat with confidence, though the fillings may be very hot.

==Variation==
The filling might be changed to involve any of the following:

* [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|Jalapeño pepper]] (spicier chiles)
* dried mild red chili peppers

* The [[Wikipedia:Mission burrito|Mission burrito]] generally combines whole beans (sometimes refried beans), Mexican rice, traditional Mexican meats (sometimes ground beef), with optional grated cheese, sour cream, guacamole, sliced jalapenos, salsa fresca/salsa cruda, and sometimes shredded lettuce. 
* A [[Wikipedia:Burrito#Smothered burrito|smothered (&quot;wet&quot;) burrito]] is generally a Mission burrito with enchilada sauce, either &quot;red&quot; or &quot;green&quot;, poured over it, with grated cheese topping it. it is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork, not held in the hand as other burritos can be.

Burritos, [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]], [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]], [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]], and vegetable wraps have similar construction. The fillings and shells can be interchanged as desired.

[[Image:Brun ris.jpg|250 px|right|thumb|Uncooked brown basmati rice.]]
This is a fragrant, long-grain variety of [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] often used in Indian recipes. Basmati can be cooked in the same way as other rice, in the ratio of two cups water to one cup rice. The recipe below helps to bring out the flavour of basmati.

==Ingredients==
Serves four.
* 400[[Cookbook:gram|g]] basmati rice (white)
* 600[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] [[cookbook:water|water]]
* 1-3 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsps]] of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 tbsp [[cookbook:butter|butter]] (optional)
* 2 tsps [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* [[Cookbook:saffron|saffron]] (optional)

==Procedure==
# If adding saffron, soak it in water for 10 minutes, and add the water and strands in at the lemon juice stage.
#Rinse Rice in a sieve for 5-7 minutes under cold running water
#Add the water, rice, butter and salt to a pan
#Bring to a rapid boil
#Add lemon juice
#Cover tightly, reduce heat to minimum, simmer for 8½ minutes
#Taste, is it soft yet tender, underdone? Cook for 1-5 minutes longer depending on how underdone it is.
#Fluff with a fork.
#Serve hot with your favorite recipe

;Best with:
*Indian Curries

==Windows==



===Introduction===

 Best option is to use one of the virtual machines - see more [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Platforms/x86_installing#ISO_Image here] 


Download latest mingw32-i386-system from [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds here] 


Confirmed working with Windows XP SP2 (2010), ? 


x86 32bit discussion thread [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=3017&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC here]. 

Experimental x86_64 bit build discussed [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=5008&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC here].


At the moment there is no network under windows hosted, I suggest virtual machine to test AROS network under Windows until work on hostio.hidd is done. It's a platform-independent remake of unixio.hidd which can work also on Windows (using overlapped I/O). As soon as it's done the task of porting Windows TAP becomes trivial. P.S. It will be even possible to port X11 display driver to Windows :) 




===Reference===

how do you build a Win7 hosted AROS (not inclined to screw up my laptop's factory installment of partitions etc. to get AROS running from SVN). Mingw32 - how to? Or if possible, VS 2010, how to?

There is a readme in arch/mingw32 directory of aros sources that might be of some help.

Got into compiling, but then came across couple other problems (a.k.a. Netpbm and such, which is required, and which in turn requires zlib, libjpeg, libpng, and something else... of which none (aside zlib) I've managed to get to compile without a ton of errors - seems Mingw's gcc 4.5.x is rather broken in a way).

You don't need to compile netpbm. MinGW really lacks it, but you can download it from another project, GNUWin32. They cooperate perfectly. I use it. Windows version of Python is also needed, get it from python.org. 



It is easily try to build WinCE-hosted version. MinGW-hosted port is designed to be CPU-independent. All we need is:

* WinCE-targeted gcc. I guess this would do the job: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cegcc/
* Write arch/all-mingw32/kernel/cpu-arm.h

And after this the thing should go! BTW Win64-hosted port should be that simple as well. 


Did you use --with-kernel-tool-prefix=... for the kernel tools?

And note that --disable-crosstools will not work for Windows. You will
need to let AROS build its own crosstools for now.



Howto access raw hard drives from within Windows-hosted AROS 

* Open HDToolBox, press &quot;Add&quot; in the devices list and add hostdisk.device.
* Browse the device in the same way as you browse hard drives on native AROS.
* Select partition you want to access, and in the menu select 'Partition-&gt;Create mountlist...'
* Save the mountlist. By default it has the name of physical device (e. g. DH0) and will be placed into SYS:Storage/DOSDrivers.
* Edit the saved mountlist. You'll need to add filesystem name (e. g. devs:sfs.handler or devs:afs.handler)
* Execute 'Mount DH0:' in the command line.


Hanging One  idea  i  have is some deadlock between GDI window service thread and  main  AROS  thread, when they simultaneously hit GDI context with certain conditions. It's  very  hard  to  track  down.  If  i add any debug output to GDI thread, the problem goes away. I  tried  to interrupt frozen AROS with MSVC. Seen all 3 threads
waiting in a syscall. But backtrace from that point is quite not trivial task. MSVC won't understand AROS code. Can you examine global variables with debugger after freeze? If so instead of debug output you could have some variables which you set in various places to values which later allow you to identify the place the threads were last executing
before freeze. 

&lt;pre&gt;
  my_debug_var = 1;
  dothis();
  my_debug_var = 2;
  dothat();
  my_debug_var = 3;
  donothing();
  my_debug_var = 4;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If a freeze happens somewhere inside this code, my_debug_var gives hint where it happened. 

Thought  about  writing  some special extension module which creates  one  more  window with separate service thread and dumps some things  there,  with possibility to run SAD in that thread. So i would be  able  to enter SAD after AROS is frozen and examine task scheduler state. This could shed some light on the phenomena. 

One  thing  -  deadlock  doesn't happen for window service thread. It works  fine.  It started locking up only after i added confirmation of keyboard  events  reception,  so  that  keypresses  aren't  lost  or duplicated.  When  service thread posts a keypress to main AROS thread it  waits back for a signal (event in Windows terms). AROS is expected to  trigger  this  event  when it picks up a keypress in an interrupt. Since  AROS  doesn't  respond  to interrupts, it never posts back this event. So, likely some flaw in interrupts, causing &quot;All tasks waiting&quot; state
with  disabled  interrupts.  The  described module is needed to verify this hypothesis. 

Windows-hosted  and  native  use  the same NewStackSwap(), written in asm. Linux  (except  ARM)  uses  generic  implementation  in  C, utilizing swapcontext(). On ARM this function is not implemented in libc, so all ARM ports use the same NewStackSwap() written in asm. StackSwap() is always the same. It's written in asm for every CPU. 
BTW,  in  fact, Linux-hosted port can use asm implementation. Just it doesn't  for  historical reasons. 

Can't you use some buffer for this:

&lt;pre&gt;
servicethread:
    on keypress/keyrelease:
    lock input buffer
    add event to buffer
    unlock input buffer

main thread: every once in a while
  lock input buffer
  remove event from buffer
  if event != null call kbd hidd callback()
  unlock input buffer
&lt;/pre&gt;

AFAIK you can theoretically even get rid of lock/unlock of inputbuffer, with some atomic instruction tricks. 




====Exec====

See  arch/all-mingw32/host_scheduler.c,  task  exception  handling. I have  to  pass  argument  to  exception handler via register because i can't  modify  stack  inside Windows exception since Windows exception handler is running on the same stack as main code. Also  note  that  i moved some code back to exec.library/Switch() and exec.library/Dispatch().   Now   kernel.resource   does  not  have  to #include exec's private stuff (etask.h). 

There are issues...

* It spreads the scheduler among several modules. Part of scheduling is done by kernel.resoruce, part by exec.library. The only win is getting rid of etask.h include. 
But  it's  not scheduling itself, It's some internal exec state maintenance, which is always the same.
This  idea  came to be after examining UNIX-hosted code. I know it is old,  but it uses Dispatch() for state change, and i liked the idea. I am working on fully functional kernel.resource for UNIX. 
I  believe this follows AmigaOS philosophy to have these entry points patchable  in  order  to  be  able  to  install some kind of CPU usage monitor. Switch() is called when some task loses CPU and Dispatch() is called when another task gets CPU. The  moved  code is always the same, it resets exec state. It's up to kernel.resource  when  to  call  them  (and  it's  a  matter  of  task scheduling). 

* Currently we support only RR scheduler. What, if we will need to add some more? Having Switch() and Dispatch() back in exec means, we need to implement different schedulers in exec, too. 

* Some schedulers (ppc efika, sam440, soon also the x86) access the etask.h  in order to store some statistics there. Currently, the task re-dispatch  timestamp and total CPU time spend in the task are stored there. What would 
you do in that case? Doesn't different schedulers mean only core_Schedule() replacement? 
It  can  also  be  moved  to  exec.  This  will automatically  make  it  working on all architectures. Of course if we provide  some  kind of access to CPU time. BTW, may be it can be based on timer.device's EClock?
kernel.resource  then will just call Switch() and Dispatch() in order to  notify  exec about task switching (note that kernel.resource still does the actual switching itself, so there is no arch-specific code in exec). Exec would do status update and accounting then. 

If this file is mingw32 specific I think the path should be aros/mingw32/irq.h (or aros/windows/irq.h). This will allow to still cross-compile from anywhere and have in the end one SDK for all CPUs and archs. 

Well, i can do it. But here is my last argument for this location... In  fact  the location is $prefix/i386-mingw32/include/aros/irq.h. If you are working on AROS and you are installing a mingw cross-compiler, the    crosscompiler's   default   paths   will   also   end   up   in $prefix/i386-mingw32/include  and  $prefix/i386-mingw32/lib.  This way the file appears right where it is expected to be. 

And yes, there is libaroskernel.a which goes to i386-mingw32/lib, but it  needs  mingw32  compiler  to  be build, so it is built only during windows-hosted   build.  It  just  can't  be  built  when  doing  e.g. Linux-hosted build.

So  far, the thing is really half-done. If you still don't like it, i can  make  this  include installed only for Windows-hosted build. This way we'll get this only in &quot;mingw32-sdk&quot; target, but together with its linklib. May be its even better (anyway you need libaroskernel.lib to use it) 

All hosted ports. On non-Linux OSes it's impossible to acquire address 4 at all.  After hitting problem with entry point i introduced a new macro, AROS_ENTRY, to mitigate this. 





===Debugging===

Previously  we always had a serial port. Currently we don't. And this is a pain. 
Theoretically  we  could  substitute it with some other device (Ethernet,  USB,  etc.). These things are much more complex and require drivers  to  function.  I  leave  out  necessary  protocols since with for example Ethernet we could use some simple raw protocol, just to be able to read messages. 

So  comes the first idea: we should have something that can be called &quot;debug   channels&quot;.   Every   debug   channel   can  be identified for example by name, supplied by the device driver. 

This device driver needs:
1. Early initialization (while booting up the system)
2. Some way to supply its output channel to the system.

(1)  is  solved  by  modular  kernels. Now about (2). We already have KrnPutChar()  and  KrnMayGetChar() in kernel.resource. For simplicity, let's  talk  only about KrnPutChar() at the moment. We could have some additional function, like: 

 KrnRegisterDebugChannel(STRPTR name, APTR function)

Where  name  is  channel  name and function is callback function like MyCallback(char c).

What happens when it is called? Let's remember that we have debug=XXX kernel  argument  which  actually specifies where to direct the output (we  may run several device drivers providing debug output but we need only one of them). XXX could be some sting in the form: 

 &lt;channel&gt;:&lt;parameters&gt;

For  example, for serial port No2 on 19200 bps the argument could be:

 debug=serial:2@19200

The  argument  is  processed at early init, kernel remembers it. When something (driver) calls KrnRegisterDebugChannel(&quot;serial&quot;, SerOutput), the channel name is compared with what is given by debug= argument. If 
there's  a  match, the kernel starts using supplied function for debug output from now on.
What's  with  parameters?  Only the driver itself knows how to decode them.  Obviously,  before  starting  using the channel, it needs to be initialized.  For  this  purpose  the  driver  should provide one more callback,   like  MyInit(char  *params).  So  registration  takes  the following form: 

 KrnRegisterDebugChannel(STRPTR name, APTR InitCallback, APTR OutputCallback)

But  what  before  the driver plugs in? Well, we have our screen. The only  bad  thing:  we  don't know how to drive it. But, if we are more intelligent... 

Generally there is either text or graphical mode framebuffer. At boot time  is  known  to  us,  it's  either  text  mode  or  graphical VESA framebuffer. The only problem is warm reboot, where the screen is left by driver in some state, unknown to us. There are options: 

a)  Driver  should install a reset callback where it should reset the card back into text mode.

b)  Driver  could  have  some  another  callback  which  would return VESA-alike  description of current state, so that existing display can be picked up during reboot. 

By  the  way,  the  same  thing  would let us to display friendly guru screens   instead   of  simple  rebooting.  Just  this  routine in the display driver should be crash-proof (it may not rely on interrupts, other libraries, etc., even on exec itself). And again we need some way to register this routine. 

Can  anyone  suggest  some framework for this? I'm exhausted on ideas here, especially taking into account that:

a) Display drivers can be unloaded in some situations.

b) There can be several displays, how to select the correct one (some displays may be not physically connected, for example unused connector on dual-headed card). 

Now  let's  remember  about  KrnMayGetChar(). Currently AROS features built-in  SAD  debugger.  I  picked it up from i386-native version and adapted  a little bit to the new environment. Now it perfectly runs on Windows-hosted,  i  can run it using C:Debug command. In fact on other ports  you  also  may  run it, you'll see a prompt in debug output but 
won't  be  able to talk to it - KrnMayGetChar() is implemented only in Windows version. 

The current  SAD  doesn't do much, but it just needs some attention  from developers. It can become a useful tool. Especially if we invent some way to run it when guru happens (like it was on classic Amiga(tm)). 

So,  back  to the topic. First, not all devices can be bidirectional. Second,  why  not  for  example use own machine's keyboard? The driver then  needs  the  following  functions:  InitCallback,  InputCallback, ReleaseCallback. Release function could be called when for example you leave the SAD, to give the device back to normal OS usage. 

So far, we already have five functions (assuming that debug output is never released). If it somehow is, then we have six functions. May  be  we should not have two registration functions, and have just one, taglist-based? 

How  to pair input and output channels? Assuming that devices are not bidirectional? Or may be we should not pair them at all, just allowing the user to specify the second argument, like &quot;debuginput=ps2kbd&quot;? 








==MacOSX==


===Introduction===

Download from [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds here]

or

Would recommend installing [http://git-scm.com/download/mac git] on your MacOS X machine and cloning the AROS sources via git: 

 $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS.git

Then, you can use ./configure to set up your cross complication environment.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir AROS.darwin-x86_64
$ cd AROS.darwin-x86_64
$ ../AROS/configure --target=darwin-x86_64
$ make -s    # This is a lot less verbose
[get a coffee. Or five.]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then, to run AROS:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd bin/darwin-x86_64/AROS
$ boot/AROSBootstrap
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some thing you might like to do:

1) Modify bin/darwin-x86_64/AROS/S/Startup-Sequence to run 'NewCLI' instead of 'WANDERER:WANDERER' - that will at least get you a full-screen text console. 

2) Use the attached patch to create a 'C:RawEcho' command (build this with 'make -s workbench-c-quick') that you can use to emit debugging messages to the Mac OS text console that ran boot/AROSBootstrap 



*** | Your X Server seems to have backing store disabled! 
You can safely ignore this warning. Been running in this mode for the last 2 years. 
Confirmed it works with x86 10.5.8 Leopard 10.6.2 and 10.6.4 Snow Leopard. Don't forget to install x11 XQuartz), it's on the installation dvd. There should be an X11.app in /Applications/Utilities. If not, there's your problem. 

When the bounty was created the mac was still PPC only, from recent svn logs it looks like it should also run hosted on Darwin PPC. 

You don't need SDL, but you do need a X-Server for graphics. Newer versions of OSX usually have one installed already. Dunno if SDL would also be possible, on iOS it won't. Cocoa SDL needs special preparations in program's main() to work. 

Please check arch/all-darwin/README.txt for build instructions. Don't try to build contrib, some packages will fail, SDL_mixer and gmake IRC. Perhaps you forgot to add --target=darwin-i386  to configure?  But, really strange, it doesn't need it on my machine. 

Yep, the darwin 32 bit set. I had to move the binaries by hand into the path with names like i386-aros-gcc to make configure happy. 

Isn't  /usr/local/bin  in  your path already? The toolchain was built with --prefix=/usr/local. 
It  should  work  fine  if  you  extract these two archives into your /usr/local. 

There has been no time to complete GPT partition table  handling  (it's  currently read-only, you can install AROS on a GPT  partition  but  you  have to use 3rd party tools to partition the drive). Writing GPT is currently enabled, but DO NOT TRY THIS. It WILL destroy   your  partition  table!!!  CRC  and  backup  table  are  not updated!!! 

1. If you get hangups, perhaps AROS crashes behind the scenes. If you use  VESA mode, you can see the debug log if you add 'vesahack' to the command  line.  This  will set up split-screen mode. In the upper half you'll see AROS screen, in the bottom - debug log. 

2.  If  you  get  crashes  at  early boot, try adding 'NOACPI' to the command line. ACPI stuff is very poorly tested because discovery fails on Mac (different ROM). 




====Self-build====

Need to download XCode or install MacPorts. Warning: macports doesn't work with xcode 4.3. Use older version... 

Run &quot;./configure --target=darwin-ppc --disable-crosstools&quot; and send the results if it fails (config.log and the terminal output) 

If it succeeds... then any build errors 'make -s' generates. 

If *that* succeeds... then any fatal errors 'cd bin/darwin-ppc/AROS; boot/AROSBootstrap' generates. 

If *that* succeeds... it works!

If 'gcc -v' and 'make -v' work, you are 90% of the way there.

If you get a build error for missing libpng and netpnm, you can resolve that with [http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php Fink]. Even better, go with Homebrew, there's a PPC fork which works fine on my old PowerBook :). 

Once installed, it will allow you to get additional development packages that don't come with X-Code, ie: 

 $ sudo apt-get install libpng3






Building darwin hosted port try to follow the guide in arch/all-darwin/README.txt. There's no need to build cross-tools with --enable-crosstools switch (which may not work at all), because you should install Sonics prebuilt cross compilers.

The crosstools  build process it wrong in fact. It relies on already existing  link  libraries  and  startup  code, which can be built only using wrapper scripts. Of course on non-ELF hosts wrappers won't work. It should be done in quite another way, involving more steps: 

* Build binutils, they don't have any prerequisites.
* Build  collect-aros.  Its  env.h.cross file contains instructions how.
* Unpack  gcc,  configure  it  and execute 'make all-gcc' and 'make target-libgcc'. This will produce barebone C compiler. 
* Using this compiler, build AROS linklibs. 
*  After this complete building gcc using 'make'. It will build also g++ with its libraries.

Of  course  AROS includes should be made too before building gcc, but gcc itself isn't needed for this. 



On  Darwin  AROS is built using a preinstalled crosstools. Jason, your new  configure  stopped supporting it and seems to use host's compiler with wrapper. This is impossible on Darwin. Then the darwin build needs to set --with-toolchain=... and --with-kernel-tool-prefix=ppc-aros- 

The  same  with Windows. I guess similar issue affects Android (there it uses Android crosscompiler as $KERNEL_CC and wrapper as $TARGET_CC. It's  impossible  to  compile  Android binaries using Linux gcc, their
ABIs are a bit different! 

specify --with-kernel-toolchain-prefix=i386-aros- make query still prints /usr/bin/gcc for the kernel cc.

If you're compiling for darwin-hosted on darwin, you *don't* use --with-kernel-toolchain-prefix at all. 

Or just use '--with-kernel-toolchain-prefix='.

Remember that 'kernel' is used to compile the darwin side of the AROS Bootstrap.

And everything that has compiler=kernel specified in the build macros like arch/all-unix/kernel.

There's  no  more  compiler=kernel for AROS modules. It's impossible to  link  together  different  objects on non-ELF systems (Windows and Darwin). compiler=kernel is used for: 
# Bootstraps
# Host-side DLLs (intensively used in Windows-hosted).
# Support linklibs like libarosbootstrap.a

AROS modules directly interfacing with host OS now use another trick. It's  still  $TARGET_CC,  but with -nostdinc -isystem $GENINGDIR. This allows  to  produce  AROS  ELF  objects  which still adhere to correct
host-side ABIs. If  we  want  to know what will be our underlying host, we explicitly add  -DAROS_HOST_$(AROS_HOST_OS)  flags.  This  is  because there's no __linux__  (__darwin__,  __win32,  whatever) in AROS code, it's always __AROS__. 

This  can't  be  elf-wrapper  for hosted. In order to build something that  runs  under  an  OS,  you  need  an  SDK  for  that  OS. In fact elf-wrapper  is  the  same  aros-gcc,  but  produces statically linked (ET_EXEC)  binaries.  This  is  suitable  only  for  building  native bootstraps (which are running on naked hardware and self-contained). 

Building  Darwin-hosted under Darwin? configure's bug. Actually these architectures are Darwin, Windows  and  Android. Their KERNEL_CC can't be used for building AROS code  even  with  wrapper.  So  these  three  arches must enforce AROS crosstools, either built or preinstalled. 




===Support===

How to substitute rmb with keyboard on laptop? CTRL doesn't do the trick. 
Go to System Preferences -&gt; Trackpad. Check the &quot;Secondary Click&quot; box and select &quot;Bottom right corner&quot; from the drop down. Then you can press in the bottom right corner of track pad for right click.

BTW to access the AROS file-structure from OS X, just right-click and 'Show Package Contents' 



For hosted systems we have driver that wraps AHI to the open sound system, see arch/all-unix/libs/oss. Probably it is possible to write a similar thing for darwin hosted. 

In order to resolve the async I/O issue wonder why AROS can't handle this by means of AROS internal threading. This is exactly how asyncio.library does it as well. Threading could be inside 68k AROS or outside, i.e. Linux host threads. 

From host's point of view AROS is just one thread. So if some of AROS processes  calls  blocking  I/O,  it  blocks  the  whole AROS. No task switching will be done since no signals will be delivered. So this is related. AROS would have to be sub-threaded, with those threads being mapped to native threads (this is by the way something that is sometimes done in JVMs, also under Linux). 

As  to host threads, there's another large problem. Tried this with Android-hosted  port  and  it  failed. When SIGARLM arrives, you can't tell which thread is interrupted. This completely screws up AROS' task switcher. Maybe it's worth checking how this is solved in common JVM implementations. 

There  is  already  a solution in the form of unixio.hidd. However it operates   only   on  file  descriptor.  AFAIK  eSounD  provides  only library-based  API  with blocking functions. There's no some form of a UNIX socket/pipe/whatever. You might want to try [http://esound.darwinports.com/ eSound]: There's   one   problem   with  esound.  It  lacks  asynchronous  I/O capabilities, providing only blocking calls. You  can  not  use  blocking  I/O  from  within AROS. This will cause blocking  of  the  whole  AROS, including interrupts, and will provide very negative user experience. 

Of  course it's possible to implement oss.library which would work on top Core Audio. But i think it would be much cleaner solution to write self-contained  AHI  driver  without  any extra API wrappers. It would better use CoreAudio possibilities and would not be restricted only to what oss.library has. Not saying that oss.library is a quickly hacked crappy thing. 

to favour PortAudio over eSound - I don't know if the mentioned I/O issues reflect on that one as well or not. 
In general however direct OSS access does not seem to be the best solution, as eSound - and probably also PortAudio - as additional abstraction layer does ensure that in turn AROS is not blocking the host audio but proper mixing is done. In order to resolve the async I/O issue wonder why AROS can't handle this by means of AROS internal threading. This is exactly how asyncio.library does it as well. Threading could be inside 68k AROS or outside, i.e. Linux host threads. 

Talking about sockets... maybe a native Linux audio client which is instructed by AROS over localhost IP connection would be a workaround. Mean, asyncio and SIGURG could work then... 

Here's an example how some guys did develop a babyphone client/server
(i.e. sender/receiver) using [http://www.andreadrian.de/babyphone/#mozTocId952710
 OSS] and [http://www.andreadrian.de/babyphone/#mozTocId703243
 UDP] sockets:

Of course it gets more complex if you want it connection based, with more reliability and upfront negotiation of audio settings - possibly could be done using TCP instead, with an appropriate header. 




===Debugging===

Sashimi 

Several  days  before  i  ran  it on Linux PPC (where i wrote initial version of emul_dir.c), worked fine too.
Is it a new build? It was a complete rebuild. The problem only happened with --enable-debug because the ASSERT_VALID_PTR was called during AllocateExt which was called during PrepareExecBase. 

PrepareExecBase()  is really tricky. If you want to debug it, you can temporarily  add  statically  linked  calls to KrnBug() (copy the stub from kernel_debug.h and use it). Exec debugging is really not up there yet.
However  this  routine  should  be  simple  enough to not require any debug. 

Reverted this and now link against libgcc.a. The problem with the missing symbol did not happen on Rosetta but was able to test it works now on a 10.3 G4 ppc ibook. 

Now some debug output from Rosetta with my latest commits, without them you'll get only garbage. As you can see the value of klo is trashed after HostLib_Open. Trashing may differ depending on were you place debug output. 




===Reference===

All hosted ports. On non-Linux OSes it's impossible to acquire address 4 at all.  After hitting problem with entry point introduced a new macro, AROS_ENTRY, to mitigate this. 


Don't know if GNU binutils support i386-darwin target for cross compiling and how difficult it is to set it up. When compiling Mac OS X hosted AROS, I had to make the following patch, otherwise the compiler couldn't find some includes (e.g. sys/_types). Is this a problem with my build environment or something more general? 
Have  you  installed my crosstoolchain from aros-archives, or you use some hacks, or --with-crosstools? 
I did install your cross-tool-chain, and followed your build instructions, but I also have generic i386 cross-compilers from MacPorts (used for building native).

BTW, should it not be possible to use --with-crosstools? (And isn't that the default for most other archs now?). 
AFAIK --with-crosstools works incorrectly. Most archs currently use wrapper script around host's gcc. Crosstools
are  built  only  for MESA and only g++ is used then. Yes, it's really incorrect. 

In  fact  thinking  about  changing  this.  I  think that real crosscompiler  should  be  enforced  on  a host basis, not on a target basis.  I. e. if we compile on non-ELF host (for example on Windows or Darwin), $cpu-aros-gcc is used. Otherwise wrapper script it used. This will make cross-compiling any port on any build machine quite an easy task. 

Looks like you  installed  the crosscompiler but didn't install AROS SDK into its directory (/usr/local/i386-aros/include and /usr/local/i386-aros/lib). 
c++  compiler  is  not wrapped up by AROS build system, so it doesn't supply Development/include to it. 
Perhaps adding this to mmakefile.src can be an option 

Known flaws:

1.  Stackswap  tests  crashes  in NewStackSwap(), the reason is under investigation.  However  executables are ran flawlessly. I suggest the problem happens because of swapcontext() nesting. 

2. X11 driver has somewhat bad performance. Also there are some small problems   with   it.   I  suggest  they  happen  because  of  missing backingstore. It's possible to enable it, but it's somewhat tricky. 

In fact X11 driver needs to be seriously rewritten, so that it will support screen composition and will work without  backingstore. Also there are several obvious coding faults in it. Unfortunately i don't know X11 programming well, so i won't take this task for now. 

Future:
* x86-64 Darwin build.
* ppc-Darwin build (with someone's help to test).
* iPhone hosted port.

During  testing  of  parts  of  Darwin-hosted build i came up to this again. Currently  we  have AROS.boot file where we put name of architecture. Is it really needed to have the full name there? 

This  actually  prevents to have one boot disk for different machines using the same CPU. For example ppc-chrp-efika partition will not boot on  ppc-sam440, despite they are the same! Personally i hit this issue when  i  build  aros-base  and aros-strap kernel modules on Darwin and then  tried to boot them up on my existing Windows-hosted installation (since there's no aros-bsp-darwin yet). 

I would consider two options:

1.  Revert to checking C:Shell file. LoadSeg() will not load binaries for  alien  CPUs.  So  we  will be able to detect which partitions are bootable on which CPU (i remember this file was provided as a solution for problem of coexisting x86-64 and i386 installations) 

2.  Check only CPU with this file (e.g. 'i386' or 'x86-64'). This way we  solve  both problems. Additionally in future we can be able to add more data to this file (like boot priority). This is the reason why we should keep the file. 




A possibility  to run AROS hosted on x86-64 MacOS. There's a problem. 

Current  AROS  executables  use  small code model, so they need to be loaded  into  lower 2GB on address space. This is no problem on native AROS  and  on Linux we can use MAP_32BIT flag. However there's no such flag in BSD, and, consequently, on Darwin. Additionally  Darwin  reserves  the  whole  low address space for own needs.  Userspace begins at 0x1000000000. This means there's no way to get into lower 2 GB. The problem can be solved only by changing code model. This is so for the small code model for x86_64 right? Does there also exists a 'big' code model ?
I also would like to get an idea of the implications on code size, stack usage, speed etc. of the different code models. Yes, of course. It imposes no limitations, but has negative impact on the binary size (all references are 64-bit). Small  code  model  uses  special form of CPU instructions where all references are still 32-bit. [http://www.halobates.de/x86-64-pres.pdf Reference for models]. 

Darwin  itself uses small PIC model for its executables (-fpic option is forced to always on). This allows to override this problem there. I can suggest to use the same on 64-bit AROS. However  this means that -fpic option needs to become working on AROS in  general.  In order to do this, we need to change linking process a bit.  Instead of -r, -q needs to be supplied to ld. This will instruct it  to  link a final executable (ET_EXEC) file, but keep relocs in it. Linking  final  executable  involves  additional  magic  like  creating global offset table.  I think it does not hurt to support different code models in the executables. And I also think that the default one to use for code should be able to run on all ports of AROS. I also think the default code model could be different on different CPUs, e.g. absolute on m68k, i386, PPC; relative in x86_64, PPC64, etc. Of  course.  On  i386  the  default  is  small,  it  still  has  some differences,  i  don't  know which ones. I suggest to make small PIC a default code model on x86-64 AROS. However,  for  this, PIC should be made working in general. Currently it  doesn't  (try  to compile hello world with -fpic and see what happens). 

The question is if it should be implemented now in main trunk or if it would be best to delay it to after the ABI_V1 fork where the current ABI would be branched in a separate branch. You could for example implement your feature now in branches/ABI_V1/trunk-piccodemodel64 

I think we should look at how many people have a current x86_64 installation they want to run newer programs. Also how involved would it be to upgrade an existing installation. It's  not  a  real  problem  as  the  first  set  of changes is fully backwards compatible. AROS will still load existing executables. I  even can add one #ifdef to collect-aros and the change will affect only  64-bit AROS. 32-bit executables will still have old format. Just i  don't  like  code  pollution  with  #ifdef's, and additionally if i implement  the change for all CPUs, all of them will get working  -fpic option. This  will  not  change  default  code  model for anything other than x86-64.  Just  ELFs will become real executables (it's quite simple to modify our InternalLoadSeg() to support them. I thought we had broken x86_64 binary compatibility several times in the past without a second thought (e.g. changing ULONGs to IPTRs in system structures). IMO it doesn't matter if we do the same with this change. 

Anyway I am now quite advanced in the implementation of the split of clib the split is fully done and contrib-gnu compiles and runs mostly. BTW,  are you aware of the fact that current arosc.library stores its thread-local  data  in private field of exec's ETask structure? I hope you  changed  this  to something that uses only public API (like using AVL trees to associate thread data with process)? I just have a bug left in setenv/getenv and then mostly. So I don't think the waiting for ABI_V1 implementation to start this work would delay it for several months. We also need to align with the m68k people. This was one of the big things I have done in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/ABIv1 ABI_V1] branch. The data is stored in an AVL tree. Is this soft of &quot;handled in shared module per caller task storage&quot;. If so, could you point me to the codes in SVN? 

It can be implemented right now. There will be only one problem: new executables will not run on older AROS. Old executables will still run on new AROS, i'll take care about it. Implementing  this  will  allow to move further and implement special support  for  -fPIC  which would enable nice things like moving global variables into library base. Is it okay to go for this change? This implementation should not be the final implementation but keep the possibility to adapt the code model for AROS during the ABI_V1 implementation phase. Code model can be specified using -mcmodel gcc switch. Without  any  changes  we can use all code models in non-PIC mode. My change's goal is to make it possible to build PIC binaries. PIC  changes  x86-64 small model in such a way that it will work with any address range, limiting only size but not position of the code. 

Work on x86-64-Darwin hosted AROS continues. It already boots  up  into  Wanderer,  but lots of components crash. This happens because  there  are  still many places where pointers are truncated by conversion  to  ULONG.  On  Linux-x86-64 you won't notice this because AROS memory is allocated in low region (below 2GB limit). 

On  Darwin  (like  any  other BSD) you don't have such a possibility. Darwin  reserves  the  whole  low memory for OS use, and application's memory starts from 0x001000000000. 
This  puts  some restrictions on what you can do in AROS. For example AROS  can't  load  bitmap  fonts  and  diskfont.library  crashes. This happens because diskfont.library hits wrong addresses when it tries to 
process AmigaDOS hunk file loaded a high addresses.
In  order  to  prevent  loading  these  files  at  high  addresses  i introduced  MEMF_31BIT flag. This flag is set for memory regions whose end address is not larger than 0x7FFFFFFF. 
This flag is effective only on 64-bit machines. On 32-bit architectures exec.library ignores it, so there's no need to set it there. If someone is working on x86-64-pc port (Alain ?), he should take this into
account. Memory initialization routine should make use of this flag and mark the approproate region with it. 
On  x86-64-Linux  hosted port this flag is set, so this port can load AmigaDOS  hunk files (and use bitmap fonts). This is because bootstrap supplies MAP_32BIT flag to mmap() calls. Currently  only  InternalLoadSeg_AOS()  routine supplies this flag to AllocMem().  However  i  would say that there are more places where it should be used (for example, drivers for devices with 32-bit PCI DMA). 
I  have  problems  with  implementing PIC support, so currently i use large  code  model to compile Darwin-hosted AROS. I will implement PIC later, this ends up in implementing own BFD backend in binutils. I don't know yet what code model should be used by default for gcc,  but  it's definitely not small one. ELFs with small model create problem,  because code  model  is not recorded anywhere in ELF, and i don't  know  yet  if it's possible to use some heuristics to guess it (for  example  detect specific  relocation  types). Currently program using  small  code  model will  simply  crash  on Darwin-hosted AROS. Programs compiled with large code model (and PIC in future) will run on any x86-64 port. 
Even  if  i  succeed in auto detection, this will not make small code magically run on all ports. Attempting to load it will end up in &quot;File is not executable&quot;, nothing more. 


An additional feature I would like is that you could decide which variables would go in libbase and which would be global to all libbases; implemented maybe with some AROS_xxx() macro around the variable definition.

Additionally  i  can  make  use  of ELFOSABI_AROS definition (ELF ABI number reserved for AROS). However this will  impose  a requirement to use AROS version of binutils for linking, Linux ld will not do any more. 
I always would have liked to make AROS programs real ELF programs (with relocation info still present though) but I also think this should be something for ABI V1. Ok, i go for #ifdef in collect-aros then. 

Currently  AROS  build system does not support having different .conf files  for  different  arch/cpu.  If  this  is  implemented,  this  is possible. Anyway  binary  compatibility  with  PPC  is  a  proposal for future. Perhaps  it  will even be a separate AROS version. This is open to the discussion. Some of our leaders dislike MorphOS ABI and would not like to make it a default ABI for PPC AROS. 

Anyway  i  think  that LVOs should be as similar as possible. In fact this  place  should  be the only place where LVO swapping takes place. There  seem  to  be no other conflicting extensions between AmigaOS3.9 and MorphOS. 

Will the ABI V1 C library allow to malloc memory in one task and free it in another? Not at the moment; I did not reimplement this feature yet as I did not find any code that seemed to use it. 
This is required at least by MPlayer - I had to add an ugly sharecontextwithchild function to current arosc.library to have this behaviour. So if I would be able to get the source code I can think of the best way to implement it. It does seem to be thread related. 

:http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/ABIv1

If you talk about PIC and GOT, will this also mean we can have shared objects?
We may be able to, but please please don't. Don't copy bad design decisions from OS4. OS4 programs using shared objects have the same startup slowness as on other OSes (Linux, Windows, ...). 
In  fact  we can have them right now. Shared objects in AROS does not have to be PIC because every binary is relocatable by definition. However, yes, i agree that load-time linking is not good. 

Find [http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/100-32-bit_PowerPC_Function_Calling_Conventions/32bitPowerPC.html
 PPC Darwin ABI] documentation, and compare with [http://refspecs.freestandards.org/elf/elfspec_ppc.pdf Linux ABI]. If you carefully check the layout of stack frames you'll notice the differences and what causes the trashing. On ppc darwin called functions are allowed to write into a parameter area of the callers stack frame. I think this can be worked around by some C or Asm stubs around each host os call.






==PS3 Port==

So i should be in search of graphic drivers and sound and keyboard etc.Am i right to assume that i should search them in the linux version of ps3 ports? There is another problem,linux used to have the otheros option,and now that is no longer present in the PlayStation 3 firmwares upper than 3.21.So i can't use a custom otheros.bld file to do the boot. 

Have setup the *psl1ght sdk from *http://psl1ght.com/ that makes it possible to create pkg or elf files that run on ps3 with custom firmwares. Now i am interested to do a new port of AROS to ps3 gameos with the help of that sdk as start .I know that there has been a port of sdl for ps3 [http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?p=26116&amp;sid=7ccb74c364352ee4a95b12bb3c1f3716 gameos]. You can use that as a reference on how to do certain things but also: 

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git;a=summary

http://repo.or.cz/w/freebsd-src.git/tree/HEAD:/sys/powerpc/ps3

http://www.ki.nu/hardware/ps3/

Remember the first one is GPL and even Sony copyrighted, do not copy and paste code from there. I seem to remember that even the last one did use GPL code for display at some point.
Not sure if drivers of the projects I've linked might be of help, some of them maybe. 

I am not certain how this could be done on the present firmwares.Although we have the advantage of running homebrew code on the gameos. So i guess i need a pkg application file to act as a boot loader for aros.Maybe i should try to find out more about petitboot ?that was a boot loader for ps3 try to make a pkg file out of it?
I know that linux boot loaders on ps3 needed the other os function,but since this is for jailbroken machines that have the lv2 peek hack of geohot we have access to anypart of the memory region of ps3 so in theory the lack of otheros option would not prohibit the execution of other os (asbestos comes to mind).

I am trying to see what is needed to port aros to ps3 gameos.What would i need?I know of the ppc linux port,i am trying to make a new configure file to use. 

As far as I understand the sdk uses cross compilers so it might be possible to add sections to configure similar to those of the MacOS X hosted ported which also uses prebuilt tool chains or check other native port which are usually cross compiled like sam440 or ppc-efika port.

I would suppose the sdk should provide a lot of the things needed, maybe not yet but over time.
To sum it up.We need a boot application that initializes gfx,sound,usb,keyboard,blue ray and opens screen?Is that how aros works on linux? 

Not exactly, a hosted port like on linux starts as a normal host program (arch/all-hosted/main.c) which acts as the boot loader then it jumps to the starting address (arch/all-unix/kernel/kernel_startup.c).
A native port is similar, but it has to do a lot more work to take control over the whole machine. One part of this are device drivers but there is more. For example the sam440 port has to init some registers, the interrupt controller and mmu very early in startup. You can learn about all this by studying AROS source, after all device drivers have to be done the AROS way, the sdk examples and other gameos hackers code and maybe it's also a good idea to search for some Cell chip documentations at places in the net.

Then you need to set up things in the arch directory so it contains the parts specific to the ps3. Then make the sdk produce a binary that is loaded and started on the ps3. This usually is the boot loader that loads all the needed modules from boot media and then jumps into a starting address of one of those. Probably the boot loader will already have to set up some of the hardware so it can do its job, the rest can be done at a later stage. Additionally, you will need hardware drivers for the display, usb at least for keybord and mouse, harddisk and blue ray drive.

It is possible? What problems will present? 
I think it is possible, but it's not an easy task, the biggest problem might be not to give up at some point.

Btw. AROS does not need SDL, but we have an SDL display driver for hosted ports.

So i should be in search of graphic drivers and sound and keyboard etc.Am i right to assume that i should search them in the linux version of ps3 ports?

There is another problem,linux used to have the otheros option,and now that is no longer present in the PlayStation 3 firmwares upper than 3.21.So i can't use a custom otheros.bld file to do the boot.

&lt;!---[[Image:Tomato.jpg|right|thumb|tomato]]---&gt;

'''Tomatoes''' (''Solanum lycopersicum''), although biologically fruits, are considered vegetables among chefs because of their low sugar content. Most tomato cultivars (of which there are many) have a tangy, acidic taste with a gelatinous center. Nearly all unripened tomatoes are green and turn red as they ripen.

Wild tomates evolved in South America and turned yellow when ripe, thus inspiring the Italian name ''pomodoro'' (golden apple). Their descendants are now consumed and grown throughout the world, especially in western Europe and the western hemisphere.

Chefs and cooks use tomatoes in sauces, salads, sandwiches and as garnishes. Also, bartenders use tomato juice in the '''bloody Mary''', a widely popular, alcoholic cocktail.

Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. They also contain [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]. The seeds are high in [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]] and bitter-tasting tannins. The green parts are mildly poisonous because they're closely related to both nightshade and tobacco.

==Cooking and eating tomatoes==
High cooking temperatures quickly destroy fresh tomato flavor, but can be useful to disable enzymes that tend to liquefy a tomato that has been injured (sliced, mashed, or shredded, for example).

As its fruit was originally believed to be poisonous when introduced into Europe, the tomato was used solely as an ornamental plant during the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. The first traces of its use as a food there date back to the first half of the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Only in the second half of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century did widespread cultivation of the tomato as food begin (mainly in southern Italy and in France).

==Varieties of tomato==
===Spherical juice tomatoes, known as rounds===
These tomatoes are used for juice production. When sliced into quarters, they go well in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]]. When sliced thin, they go well in [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]]. It is often easy to remove the gelatinous inner flesh and seeds from this type of tomato.

===Pear-shaped or oval tomatoes, known as consistency tomatoes or plum tomatoes===
These tomatoes are less juicy and flavorful than others. They are primarily used to make [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]].

===Small cherry or grape tomatoes===
These tomatoes are usually eaten whole in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]] or as a snack. Grape tomatoes have firmer, thicker flesh, and may be cooked on kabobs or grilled.

===Wide steak, beefsteak, or sandwich tomatoes===
These tomatoes are commonly 5 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] in diameter. One slice is enough to cover a large [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]]. It is usually very difficult to remove the gelatinous inner flesh and seedsfrom this type of tomato.

==Tinned or canned tomatoes==
In the summer, tomato growers produce many more tomatoes than they can possibly sell fresh. Many of these (usually plum tomatoes) are canned. Canned tomatoes often taste better than imported varieties in mid-winter or those grown in green houses.

==Sun-dried tomatoes==
Tomatoes can also be preserved by being dried in the sun. This technique is popular in Italy. They are then either stored dry in packs (they need to be soaked before use) or in [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] in jars (these can be used straight from the jar). The taste of sun-dried tomatoes is intense and concentrated. You can use them in [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] topping, where they go well with strong flavors like [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]], [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]] and [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]].

==Peeling tomatoes==
It's almost always a good idea to skin tomatoes before using them in cooking. Here's how.

Using a sharp knife, cut a little cross at the base of each tomato. Plunge the tomatoes into boiling water for no more than 30 seconds, then plunge them into ice cold water, to stop any cooking that might have started. You should then be able to pull off the skin from each tomato. Throw the skins away &amp;mdash; they aren't much good for preparing any foods, although if you like to eat them, they do contain many nutrients.

==Intense tomato sauce==
This way of cooking tomatoes is described by Heston Blumenthal. It recognizes that much of what we consider to be tomato flavor comes from the scent of the green stem, or vine. The vine is not edible and its fragrance is destroyed by heat, but this method goes some way to capture it.

Peel the tomatoes as described above. Cut them into small pieces and remove the seeds. Put the cut tomatoes in a sieve above a bowl, and salt liberally. Leave in a cool place for an hour or more. The salt will draw liquid out of the tomatoes, which will collect in the bowl. Use the liquid as a basis for cooking the tomatoes quickly (Blumenthal suggests using a [[Cookbook:Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]]). This avoids adding any water, and so concentrates the flavor. When the tomatoes are cooked to a puree, boil in an uncovered saucepan until the liquid is reduced. Then cool the puree, and put in an airtight container with the vine of a tomato plant. Store for an hour or more, while the tomatoes take on some of the fragrance of the vine. Discard the vine and use the sauce as the basis for a pizza topping or a sauce to accompany fish, meat, or vegetables.

AROS is a choice/option of an open source, portable AmigaOS that is &quot;source compatible&quot; with OS3.1. Aros x86 apps would need to be recompiled for Aros 68k. However, system friendly 68K AmigaOS (AOS) binaries will run out of the box on Aros 68k. AROS could be the life line for Amiga68K as future kickstart/wb upgrades, i.e. potential for CD-Rom boot, usb boot, potential replacements for all outdated OS parts, standards for drivers, standards for RTG, standards for PCI access. 

The AROS kernel rom can be used with the existing OS1.3, OS2.0, OS2.05, OS3.0 or OS3.1 to varying degrees of success - certain hardware will be supported but others will still be a work in progress. AROS rom can be used together with the rest of AROS to replace any commercial rom + workbench combination like high end Amigas and, in the future, possibly for [http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=44211&amp;page=3 Replay] or Natami. You use as much of AROS as you need/require. 

Most AROS programs are written in C using the Amiga API, some of them in C++. Every night these programs are compiled for a lot of CPUs: i386, AMD64, PPC, ARM and M68k. 

AROS sources have always been more or less M68K binary compatible (even all library sources have complete 68k register parameters defined and most public structures are 1:1 identical). It is actually designed for 68k from the beginning. A working, binary compatible version of AROS on real Amiga's is pretty much the holy grail for determining how compatible AROS is with AmigaOS (TM). Getting it running should help us fix a lot of bugs and incompatibilities that will benefit AROS as a whole. 

Initially the port, which will not depend on a MMU being present, will target UAE first [http://www.power2people.org/projects/profile/5 Phase 1]. Certain dedicated amiga hardware support (goal of being able to boot most KS1-3 disks including games and demos and cover processors 68000, 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060) is to follow in [http://www.power2people.org/projects/profile/6 Phase 2]. Then follows alpha testing with a low level debugger with a full bug report. Optimizations and then finally general testing. 

* to make it actually compile correctly (that was very big task - Jason in Phase 1)
* add low level kernel code (task switching, interrupt handling etc.. Jason in Phase 1)
* add hardware drivers (mouse, keyboard, graphics P96 RTG, disk etc..) Toni has done these for Phase 2 
* some further hardware support (Gary IDE, afs handler, etc.) Toni has done these for Phase 2 

Phase II is to provide a *baseline* kickstart replacement. Please do not expect drivers for non-official Amiga hardware (e.g. [http://www.natami.net/ Natami] or [http://www.fpgaarcade.com/ Replay FPGA Arcade]), only real Amigas or UAE. All timings and display settings currently assume PAL configuration at the moment. Recommended using RTG modes, custom chipset driver is just a proof of concept (It is not going to be optimized or improved until more important features work). 

The point of AROS being open source is that it means people can take it in whatever direction they want - those that want just original hardware can stick with that and still get enhancements; those that want to use all kinds of expansions can get them better integrated with the core. And those who want different hardware altogether can still enjoy an AmigaOS like OS. 


Make sure to get the ISO from the [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds AROS site] or the alternate [http://aros.sourceforge.net/downloads/ Sourceforge site] - it's in AmigaOS HUNK format. The tarball ([http://amifind.platon42.de/cgi-bin/amifind?query=bzip2&amp;dir=-1&amp;mode=and bzip2(bz2)] archive is for debugging AROS itself, and is in ELF format.

==Usage==


===Actual Hardware===

# download the [http://aros.sourceforge.net/de/download.php nightly amiga-m68k-bootiso] to your pc or amiga if internet connection 
# decompress the archive which contains an iso to a directory on your pc. you may use programs like winrar or isobuster to do that.
# prepare an amiga formatted drive with an empty bootable aros partition (preferably highest priority) on your amiga. youz may use ffs with its flaws but also pfs3 as file system.
# connect the amiga drive (assuming it is an ide drive) to your pc using an ide-usb adapter.
# fire up winuae. mount your decompressed iso-directory as drive under winuae: 
 hardware&gt;harddrives&gt;add directory or archive.
alternatively i think you can just mount your iso archive under
 hardware&gt;harddrives&gt;add hardfile.
# mount your usb-connected amiga hard drive hardware&gt;harddrives&gt;add hard drive and boot up winuae from a your usual bootable partition.
# copy aros installation from iso or iso-directory to your aros partition on your real amiga hard drive using file manager of your choice. diropus? make sure the aros partition on your amiga drive is bootable and has the highest priority. 
# you can now attach your amiga aros harddrive to your amiga controller. be it internal ide, fastata, or scsi controller via acard scsi-ide adapter. note that csppc or csmk3 controllers are not yet supported and cause problems during bootup.
# your amiga will now likely need some time due to kickstart3.1 waiting 30secs for the drives to spinup and then softkick aros. which you will be able to observe as it gives screen output. the aros68k boot from had is not immediate as aos, but it does not take long.
 alternatively you could establish a serial debug connection between amiga and whatever else machine you use (likely with an serial sub-d adapter 25&gt;9 pin, null modem cable and serial-usb adapter) and observe the debug output on terminal window on the alternate machine. using tera term on pc. you have to choose your usb port. and debug baudrate: 115200 

alternatively if you have your amiga connected to internet, you can of course format your partition directly on amiga, download the iso and mount it with one of numerous utilities, preferably with [http://aminet.net/disk/misc/diskimage.m68k-aos.tar.bz2 diskimage device] available from aminet and copy the files over directly on your amiga without this any disk swapping 

thats all, folks.




===WinUAE===

Get the latest [http://www.winuae.net/frames/download.html WinUAE] which has the AROS rom images built-in. 

Optionally, you can get the whole nightly [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds build] which contains both the ROMs and AROS system but for most people it will not be necessary.  Set WinUAE &quot;Main ROM file&quot; = aros-amiga-m68k-rom.bin and &quot;Extended ROM file&quot; = aros-amiga-m68k-ext.bin. arosbootstrap method is meant for easy real Amiga testing, no need to burn EEPROMs etc. 

Configure WinUAE to simulate a standard A1200 but with full 68020 CPU (24 bit mode unmarked). Select 2MB CHIP, 64 MB Z3 FAST. On Expansions tab give some RAM to RTG card (I have 16 MB). Then attach the AROS directory as a hard disk and boot from it. It will take some time, but eventually you should have WinUAE  booted to Wanderer 640x480x8.

IMPORTANT: be sure to use JIT. Without JIT, loading will be 3-4 times slower as well as AROS crashes very easily (most of the time memory allocation problem in input.device). With JIT, it's &quot;rock stable&quot; (at least for moving windows ;) 

Use latest winuae beta with -log -serlog parameters to see serial logging debugging (make sure rom is built with serial logging enabled) 

Either use both -serlog -log to open log window (also writes to a file automatically) or tick logging checkbox in misc panel if you don't want to see the log window. 




===UAE E-UAE===

AROS 68k has two ROM files, a Kickstart and a Kickstart ext, you will need both. The emulator should be set up exactly as an A1200 but with full 020 and above CPU with 4meg fast ram and if possible RTG. It should work then, If AROS doesn't show a disk prompt or gives insert DEVS: errors) then you should ensure a bootable disk (hard hdf or floppy adf) is available. 

uae.rc or euae.rc or uae.config (they are text files) - check to see if these options are set inside 

kickstart_rom_file=&lt;path&gt;

kickstart_ext_rom_file=&lt;path&gt;

This option specifies the file path of an extended ROM image to load.

gfxcard_size=&lt;n&gt; (default=0)

Emulate an RTG graphics card with &lt;n&gt; MB of graphics memory. Selecting &lt;n&gt; greater than 0, enables the graphics card or so-called 'Picasso96' emulation. A maximum of 32 MB of graphics card memory may be emulated.

E-UAE must emulate a 32-bit CPU (a 68020 or better, not an 68ec020) to support the graphics card emulation. 

Make sure serial port emulation is enabled, it is required in all non-WinUAE versions (WinUAE always emulates serial interrupts internally).





===m68k Hosted Environment Binaries===

There is no hosted version so far but if anyone is interested...

What are the system requirements for hosted operation? i.e. memory model (does each process need a separate virtual memory space originating from 0?) All processes are in the same memory context. Can this also be the same memory context as the host OS? While FreeMiNT has memory protection, it has no virtual memory model (i.e. all free mint processes have the same memory context too). Yes, it can. The  whole AROS runs in a single host OS process. 

Do I need thread support in the host OS? (this is a very funny chapter in the FreeMiNT kernel…) 

&quot;ready/write capability to low memory (in particular, trap vectors and 0x00000000-0x00000007) m68k assumes that it can read a specific constant value (the location of the SysBase data structure) at address 4. All other low memory below 0x1000 should never be accessed.&quot; 

No, you just need the host OS to be able to cause a timer exception (signal) to the AROS context, and the AROS scheduler will do all the process/task management for itself. I guess a timer interrupt would save me quite some processing time compared to the whole signal shebang, and I also get supervisor mode for free (which I suppose is good in this case, since the scheduler most likely needs it?). m68k  software  really  reads SysBase from 4. You can either map this
memory in order to make it readable, or catch host OS exception (trap, signal,  whatever),  and  simulate  this  access.  Look  at PPC native kernels for an example, they also support it. 

m68k assumes that it can read a specific constant value (the location of the SysBase data structure) at address 4. All other low memory below 0x1000 should never be accessed. Can it be sufficient to virtualize accesses to this area in user mode? Yes, sufficient and recommended! (denying writes to 0 catches lots of bugs!) The OS will do this for me already, since it's already protected. 

What about writes to 0x4? I guess the kernel sets up this once - but I need to catch that too. Ideally it shouldn't even attempt to write to 0x4, but rather to the variable I plan to return on reads from 0x4.

Does AROS and the general AROS binary use something like supervisor mode? AROS kernel yes, AROS drivers sometimes, and AROS applications almost never. Maybe this is a stupid question, but… why do the switch to supervisor? On an Amiga, hardware registers aren't supervisor-protected, and all memory can be accessed in user mode. Is it for stuff like cache control etc? (on 030 this is achieved by accessing the CCR, which is privileged)

Does the kernel access 0x4 in Supervisor? The reason I ask is because that means I have to virtualize most of supervisor mode. Ideally I'd like to just virtualize accesses to 0x4 in user mode (Because that's an easy thing to do. Virtualizing supervisor is definitely possible too though, there's some useful code for that in Basilisk 2 (MacOS needs supervisor mode, but is executed in user mode on the Amiga)).

Yes, AROS m68k device drivers use interrupts. Hosted probably won't need to, since it should be providing its own device drivers. What kind of tools do I need? VBCC/VASM and GCC 2-4 is available. I would suggest using the gcc 4 as compiled by the arch/m68k-amiga/doc/build-toolchain.sh script. Is there any particular port that can serve as a starting point for this stuff? arch/all-hosted, arch/all-linux, arch/m68k-all, and arch/all-unix should be useful. Copy arch/all-linux to arch/all-mint, s/linux/mint/ in all the mmakefile.src under there, and start work from there. 
Real  CPU interrupts, are, in fact, needed only for native ports. For hosted  port  you will probably need some equivalent, implementable in host  OS.  For  example,  in Windows-hosted port interrupts are WinAPI event objects (somewhat reminiscent to AROS signals). They are used to communicate  with  I/O threads. In UNIX-hosted interrupts are actually signals.  SIGALRM  is  used  as timer and SIGIO as host I/O interrupt. SIGUSR1  and  SIGUSR2  are used for calling scheduler, because signals are the only way to get CPU context in UNIX. 

In  fact,  currently  i  can  form up only one mandatory requirement. There must be a possibility to interrupt a running host OS thread, get and modify its CPU context. That's all. Will there be context switches in Supervisor mode too (i.e. will I need to take care of the SSP too)? 
No.  Scheduler  (core_Schedule()) needs to be called only when you're exiting into user mode (i. e. leaving the last nesting level). It's a very bad idea on AROS too to have nested context switching. 

The macros SC_ENABLE() and SC_DISABLE() (cpu_xxx.h). I'm not 100% how this is used; but I suspect it's to avoid different signal handlers from clashing with each other somehow?
No.  These  macros  are  used  to set signals (i. e. AROS interrupts) state  on  a  task  context  to  be dispatched. It's an equivalent for restoring &quot;interrupt enable&quot; flag on the CPU in native ports. There's no field in AROSCPUContext to save interrupts state, they are assumed to be in sync with task-&gt;IDNestCnt, for simplicity. 
Anyway, these macros use some variable in the signal context which I don't have right now. 
It's a signal mask of the interrupted process. 

i.e. to prevent or delay other signals while handling the current one?).
No.  There's  no  such  problem  in  UNIX.  When a signal arrives, it automatically  gets  blocked  until i leave its handler. It's a pretty good  equivalent of native CPU interrupts. However, any signal (except traps)  really disables all other interrupts. This is done in order to prevent  nested  context switching (and messed up scheduler state), in
case  if  the  second  (nested)  signal happens between entering first signal's handler and incrementing of  PlatformData-&gt;kb_Supervisor. 

Currently there are two different flavors of hosted AROS: Windows and UNIX.  Linux,  Darwin,  etc,  are all UNIXes, and differences are very minimal there. 

UNIX-hosted  kernel  is  built  around  signals. They are very good equivalents  for CPU interrupts. There's SIGALRM used as system timer, and  there are SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 used as syscalls (in points where a running  task  needs  to  give up CPU time). SIGIO is an equivalent of external  hardware  interrupt,  it  is  signalled  when a host OS file descriptor  is  ready  for  I/O.  A special component, unixio.hidd, is responsible  for de-multiplexing a single SIGIO on per-fd basis. Some signals (SIGILL, SIGSEGV, etc) are CPU traps. 

Windows-hosted  kernel  is  quite  different.  This port makes use of Windows  threads.  AROS consists of minimum of two threads. One thread runs user-mode code (tasks), another thread is a supervisor. A special measures are taken in order to sync them up, so that actually only one of    them    is    running.  Supervisor  thread  is  looping  in WaitForMultipleObjects()    call,    where    waitable  objects  are AROS interrupts. The first of them is a periodic timer, others are I/O interrupts from more Windows threads, contained in drivers. 
When  an  interrupt  happens (object is signalled), supervisor thread halts  user thread, gets its CPU context, executes interrupt handlers, then  resumes it. There is no mechanism similar to SIGALRM in UNIX, so a separate thread is needed to simulate it. I/O  is  also  done  via  separate  Windows threads. WinAPI is mostly synchronous  by nature, especially GUI handling, where you have to sit in  message  loop.  Every  driver  contains  an associated .dll, which starts  up  own  thread.  Every  thread  can create own waitable event object,  thus  creating  new interrupts. AROS code communicates to I/O threads  in  a  way  similar  to  a  real  hardware,  it fills in some structure  then  triggers  &quot;go&quot;  event.  I/O  thread  does its job and triggers its IRQ event, causing interrupt back to AROS side. For  windows-hosted  port, started  with  interrupts  and  task scheduling.  After this task was solved, we already had a good model of how AROS can run inside Windows process. 

The GUI on FreeMiNT is also synchronous and needs a message loop. My intention is to run away from this and make it a fullscreen application instead, because the alternative would be very very messy on this OS (since there are no non-expensive and useful threads. Is there any function to poll the event loop without blocking? X11 and SDL drivers use this  approach.  They  just  poll  the  loop 50 times per second using VBlank interrupt.
Windows  doesn't  allow  to  poll the loop, this is why i had to deal with  threads.  In  fact  this  appears  to  be slower and have larger latency than with polling. 




==Debugging==




===68k based Monitor Debugging===

Some monitors work 




===Serial Debugging===

Serial debugging requires software on each machine that needs communicating between as well as a physical lead of some kind (usually early prolific or FTDI usb based).

Just download some of them to find the one which make you happy :-D 

[http://www.ianstedman.co.uk/Amiga/amiga_h_w/serial_port/serial_port.html Serial console speeds] can be 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bits per second 

* A500/A600 is limited to around 19.2 kbit/sec for no more than 2KB/sec (e.g. 19200 baud rate, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity) 
* A1200 unexpanded can expect 57.6 kbit/sec for transfer rates no more than 7KB/sec. 

AROS m68k needs to be recompiled for these slower speeds for diagnosing boot issues with serial debugging. 

Faster serial speeds need a faster CPU (best option 030 and above) or an additional dedicated fast serial port (which might not be supported under AROS). 

Also, it's critical that you get the Amiga serial port hooked up so that you have a debug log.  The default base rate is 115200 8n1, but you can change that in arch/m68k-amiga/ boot/start.c line 47.

==== Serial 9pin -&gt; 25pin ====

What you need is a Serial Null-modem cable. It is just a Serial cable, but with RX and TX lines crossed. 

9pin DB9F female end for PC and 25 pin DB25F female end for Amiga. 

If you have a standard RS232 serial cable you can buy a null modem adapter, attach it to the standard serial cable and connect the 2 computers.

Second option is to just buy an RS232 null modem cable and connect the 2 computers.

Just do a quick search for &quot;Amiga serial null modem cable&quot;. However, a lot of cables come with one or two male ends instead and so an additional female to female adapter(s) is needed. 

Use add44k or whatever to drop your screen depth, you'll be able to get a little bit more speed that way. More planes = more dma load = less time available for your beloved serial port. RTG will help, but you must configure it to not display a custom chip screen at all when you have an RTG screen visible. 



Here are some tips:

1. Ensure you have a null-modem adapter in your cable setup. Somewhere in your cable chain. A null-modem adapter will say &quot;NULL MODEM&quot; somewhere on the device.

2. Right-click the amiga explorer icon &amp; make sure the correct serial port for your PC (COM1:, COM2:) is chosen... I believe it defaults to COM1. Make sure that the serial port is listed in Device Manager under &quot;Ports (COM &amp; LPT)&quot;. Make sure there is no (!) or (x) mark on the device's icon in Device manager.

3. Test the cable setup: Load up hyperterminal on the PC, and a terminal program on the Amiga. Set both to 9600baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking. Typing characters on one system should show up on the other. If not, you have a cable or configuration issue.

4. Test handshaking: enable hardware handshaking on both ends and check connectivity by typing on each machine. If you passed #3 and fail here, then you have a miswired serial cable (or, less likely, miswired nullmodem adapter).

Some people use baud bandit on 68000 machines (A500/600) and new8n1 on 020+ ones but AROS has its own serial driver which is untested with the following serial hardware expansions 
* VarIO
* HyperCOM +3
* SilverSurfer 
* Twister 1200 





====USB Serial====

Using a serial to usb adapter and '''RealTerm''' 115200baud, port70 parity:none, data bits:8, stop bits:1. 

Using TeraTerm on the PC (adjusting the port and baud rate to 115200) you can catch the boot log and supply it to aros-dev list or Aros-Exec. Feedback always welcome. 

I have been told usb adapter for serial are problematic, or do not always work, but was denied detailed explanation? Some of them are problematic for use in EEPROM programmers, because they need 12V on the serial cable, but USB adapters do not provide such voltage. For use in data transfers and basic communications the cheapest USB adapter is still good. 




=====Subway USB Controller for the Amiga 1200 Clockport=====





=====Deneb USB for Amiga 3000/4000=====

Since it is not possible to use larger than 512 kb rom images in deneb, I don't think I can start AROS kickstart from flash. if i try to initialize the first half with algor kick the computer hangs in endless boot loop. Therefore I am using blizkick to load the first part of the kickstart at the very beginning in my aros startup-sequence. All i have been able to capture this way follows. blizkick is supposed to manage 1MB roms, but elf files are apparently not accepted. Otherwise, it would be ideal to have an 512KB kickstart file as accepted by algorkick. 




==== Logs needed ====

*'''ALWAYS''' include full logs. (You may have multiple hardware configurations, it is very important to know exact hardware).  
* '''ALWAYS''' describe how harddrive(s) are connected.. Sometimes a log will hint that there is no IDE drives connected and possibly something on 3rd party SCSI board. Note that debugging non-AROS-builtin HD driver (=3rd party expansion + boot ROM) compatibility is practically impossible without having the same hardware. (Nothing is logged because everything is handled by boot rom, including drive detection, RDB parsing etc..) 



Here is for example log from my real A1200/68060 (using USB serial adapter).

===GDB===

The C:GDBStub for amiga-m68k is ready for general consumption. Configuration file only: 
 win32.serial_port=tcp://localhost:1234

Add /wait if you want emulator to delay startup until someone connects first. 

To enable the GDBStub, do:

 AROS&gt; Run C:GDBStub

The next time AROS crashes with a trap (or you run 'C:GDBStop'), the GDB stub will wait on the (real or virtual) serial port for a GDB connection

Use the following .gdbinit with m68k-elf-gdb to connect to the GDB stub under AROS:

&lt;pre&gt;
---- .gdbinit ---
file  ../AROS.amiga-m68k/distfiles/aros-amiga-m68k-rom.elf
cd ../AROS.amiga-m68k/bin/amiga-m68k/AROS
source .gdbinit
## Uncomment for WinUAE connection
# target remote localhost:1234
## Uncomment for serial connection
# target remote /dev/ttyS0
## Fix up Debug_ModList
set variable Debug_ModList = &amp;KernelBase-&gt;kb_Modules
--------------
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then all the regular AROS GDB debugging macros work, like 'loadseg', 'modlist', 'showtask', etc.

I've been able to get nice full backtraces through kernel and user code with full GDB support with this. It's making m68k debugging a lot easier.

You can get the [http://www.codesourcery.com/ m68k-elf-gdb]. 


The upshot of this, is that PARANOIA_CFLAGS is now gone. If you want to enable a '-Wall -Werror' build, just add '--with-paranoia=yes' to your configure, and the while tree will be built such that any compiler warning stops the build. 




===Errors===

You need to watch out for certain issues 

* log is eating some lines and line feeds. (or expecting linefeed+formfeed instead of single linefeed). 
&lt;pre&gt;
[ColdCapture] Ignoring AOS-&gt;AROS trampoline [start]
InitCode(RTF_SINGLETASK, 0)
&lt;/pre&gt;
For example above line should have linefeed after trampoline and few other lines seem to be completely missing (truncated because of too long line?) and early configchain lines. 


* Most confusing are missing expansion/autoconfig related lines. (&quot;configchain&quot;). Missing ATA lines are normal in some logs because A4000 IDE no-drive detection is simpler than A1200. 



* Does early startup menu work? (Keep pressing both mouse buttons even if it appears to be hung, for example Blizzard SCSI init takes ~10s). Yes, it works. I remember blizzard scsi to be a little troublesome. Reboot with holding lmb+rmb to early boot screen



Another try with drive attached directly to ide port has succeed to boot me from the hd into a screen with only red cursor but nothing else. anyway it seems to boot the current nightly. 
On following try, I have been able to boot into aros with no startup-sequence. commands working.

Since every expansion been physically removed from this machine and still getting the same log missing &quot;configchain&quot; and friends?

Perhaps possible cyberstorm 0x00f00000 mapped ROM does something strange.. 

* Download http://aminet.net/dev/moni/mon165.lha
* AOS coldstart (power off, power on), boot without startup-sequence. (coldstart is important, it is possible strange residents are active after warm start) 
* Run &quot;mon&quot; 
* type &quot;] f00000 10000 dump.rom&quot; to save rom data. (now you can reboot normally) 

Zip and email the file.


Screen mode prefs crashing after selecting mode has been happening since the beginning. Tried to debug this long time ago but never found anything interesting. Now I just ignore the crash and reboot when need to change modes :) 




==m68k Native Environment Sources==

If you want to set up a m68k build environment, just run the 'arch/m68k-amiga/doc/build-toolchain.sh' script. It'll download and compile all the m68k crosstools, and install them to /opt/m68k-elf (or wherever else you want them to go) 

Jason's typical m68k ./configure is: 

$ configure  --target=amiga-m68k \
             --with-optimization=&quot;-Os&quot; \
             --with-paranoia=&quot;-Wall -Werror&quot; \
             --with-serial-debug \
             --enable-debug=all

None of the AROS regcall macros have been extensively tested with -O2. Some don't have a m68060 to test with.
The default optimization is '-Os', which on systems with no or small instruction caches usually gets you better performance than -O2 anyway. 

Older method for compiling your own version....

 arch/m68k-amiga/doc/README.txt - add GCC/Binutils fetch/compile/install script 

The regcall config (target amiga-m68k). '''Note''' The stackcall configuration (target amiga-m68k-eabi) is obsolete. 

NOTE: To use the regcall config, you *must* apply the patch, at the bottom of this page, to GCC 4.5.1 to get GCC to *not* trample on A6. Actually, I checked in a fix for my macros that got A5 working. I have another fix that should allow an unpatched GCC (one that wants to use A6 as the Frame Pointer) to work. 

Since the nightly AROS m68k build is designed to run, unmodified, on *all* Amiga architectures (m68000 - m68060), I always compile with -m68000. Feel free to compile your own custom build with different ./configure --with-optimization=... options. 

Compiled m68k-elf binutils 

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/m68k-elf --target=m68k-elf

Compile gcc-4.5.1 as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd gcc-4.5.1
$ ./configure  \
        --without-headers \
        --disable-threads \
        --disable-libssp \
        --disable-nls \
        --disable-shared \
        --without-pic \
        --prefix=/opt/m68k-elf \
        --target=m68k-elf \
        --program-prefix=m68k-elf- \
        --enable-languages=c
&lt;/pre&gt;

 --program-prefix=m68k-elf - is not needed, it seems prefix is added automatically.

Build and install gcc-4.5.1 (to /opt/m68k-elf, or whatever you set --prefix to)

lib directory needs to be created manually 

 mkdir bin/amiga-m68k/AROS/Development/lib

&lt;pre&gt;
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/m68k-elf/bin
$ cd AROS
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --target=amiga-m68k \
              --with-optimization=&quot;-Os&quot; \
              --with-serial-debug
$ make
&lt;/pre&gt;

(wait for zune/betterstring to kill the build)
 $ make kernel-link-amiga-m68k

(wait a bit) You'll end up with the following files: 
Finally finished successfully! (total time something like 4 hours..)

* bin/amiga-m68k/AROS/aros-amiga-m68k.elf
* bin/amiga-m68k/AROS/aros-amiga-m68k.rom

The .elf is useful for feeding to GDB to attach to a UAE serial port when debugging...

The .rom, which you can feed to UAE like so:

 uae -s kickstart_rom_file=bin/amiga-m68k/AROS/aros-amiga-m68k.rom

Tested with UAE running as a 'stock' A1200 AGA 




Clean AROS build, using this configure line: 

 ../AROS/configure --target=amiga-m68k --with-optimization=&quot;-Os&quot; --with-serial-debug 

Try also building from scratch, sometimes all files won't get automatically rebuilt. 



https://gitorious.org/aros/aros

Things to note for m68k 'ROM'able code:

* No global variables - There is no .data nor .bss section in the ROM! 
* Global -constants- are ok - We do have .rodata 

If you need to open a library, you have to do it explicitly - you can't use the AROS autoopen feature. 



==Linux Hosted Builds==

debian7 build, acquiring the sources please refer to the &quot;building aros68k&quot; 

as for the dependencies for x86 hosted build you will additionally need

-x11-dev headers and link libs

for compiling contributions (you will first need to cop the contribs folder into the aros folder and then &quot;make contrib&quot;
you will need cmake and gperf package for aros-owb.

first of all configuring: building from the parallel folder you need to specify

../AROS-source/AROS/configure --enable-x11-shm --enable-x11-hidd --enable-debug --with-serial-debug=yes

first both options are supposed to give you integration with x11 system to get just any graphical output. the lest two options are due to debugging, they can be omitted in plain user builds.

whoever encounters following error:

    Making     country files...
    /home/wawa/x86-build/bin/linux-i386/gen/workbench/locale/countries/makecountry: System locale is invalid

temporarily solved it with &quot;dpkg-reconfigure locales&quot; setting en_GB.UTF-8 as default. otherwise compiling as root has worked around it 

first of all aros dependency packages that need to be installed on your (cross)compiler host:

&lt;pre&gt;
    binutils-source
    libcloog-ppl-dev (adds lots of other dependencies)
    g++ (may be neccessary too look for gnu-c++ compiler package)
    libelf-dev
    bison
    flex
    gcc-4.5-source (doesnt seem to be neccessary anymore since the compiler version has been upgraded)
    libmpfr-dev
    libmpc-dev
    libecm-dev
    netpbm
    automake
    libpng-dev (libpng12-dev)
    libc6-dev-i386
&lt;/pre&gt;

acquiring the V1 sources:

the sources can either be downloaded under below link:
http://aros.sourceforge.net/de/download2.php
or via git (assuming you have this package installed):

&lt;pre&gt;
    mkdir AROS-source
    git clone git://gitorious.org/aros/aros.git AROS-source
    cd AROS-source
    git checkout ABI_V1
&lt;/pre&gt;

now actually building aros in a separate build directory created at the same level as AROS-source dir:

&lt;pre&gt;
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../AROS-source/AROS/configure --target=amiga-m68k --with-serial-debug=yes
    make
&lt;/pre&gt;

here is another method: building aros 68k crosstools in a separate directory:

we are starting over. directory structure (note this differs from previous example) 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;some dir&gt;
- aros (clean aros sources here, no binaries!)
- build-m68k-tools (cross compiler will be built here)
- yet another directory where aros-m68k will be build (I just use &quot;build&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;some dir&gt;
    cd build-m68k-tools
    ../aros/configure --target=amiga-m68k --with-aros-toolchain-install=/opt/aros-m68k
    sudo make -s crosstools
&lt;/pre&gt;

(sudo is necessary because toolchain will be installed in /opt/aros-m68k. otherwise the build will fail)

the crosstools should now be built successfully.

now we go back to our main dir:

cd ..



building aros in yet another separate directory:

change to the build directory, configure and build aros there.

&lt;pre&gt;
    ../aros/configure --target=amiga-m68k --with-aros-toolchain-install=/opt/aros-m68k --with-aros-toolchain=yes --with-serial-debug=yes
    make -s (-s to keep it less verbose)
&lt;/pre&gt;

aros is now to be found under /build/bin/amiga-m68k/AROS
the executables are all in elf format, so if we want aros to softboot from an amiga kiskstart we need to convert boot/amiga/AROSBootstrap
to a hunk executable which can be done with a tool compiled for the host arhitecture, in this case ubuntu which is to be found under /build/bin/linux-i386/tools/elf2hunk

the  boot/amiga/AROSBootstrap needs to be replaced with the resulting file. and the s:startup-sequence needs to be modified to load the aros.elf:

 boot/amiga/AROSBootstrap ROM  boot/amiga/aros.elf

now copy the contents of /build/bin/amiga-m68k/AROS directory to an amiga bootable partition. you should be able to boot aros with it either on uae or on an actual amiga computer. :)


some additional make options:

make distfiles - should automatically convert elf executables to hunk (to be confirmed)

make kernel-link-amiga-m68k - builds the kickstart rom file aros.elf

make (module name to find in the mmakefile.src in the source dir of particular module)-quick - builds the desired module with a quick option to spare some tome.


Note that in order to rebuild module after editing the source, the compiled binaries have to be deleted first in the build target dir. in order to work on and build some modules it might be necessary to compile the complete build first.




==ELF to HUNK and back==

It does use Amiga hunk files, and you can mix and match to some degree (AROS components are ELF files), But AROS can load both :) Works both ways, not just Amiga files in an AROS environment, but AROS executables in an Amiga environment. The tool to use is [http://www.evillabs.net/wiki/index.php/AROS_m68k-amiga#Feb_8.2C_2011:_ELF2HUNK_utility ELF2HUNK] by Jason McMullan. There are some limitations. Most notably, AROS apps using arosc.library (sort of ixemul) won't work (at least not yet), and arosc.library itself won't work so moving that over won't do you any good. But apps that stick with purely the AmigaOS API will work. This restrictions makes it quite limited at the moment. To get AROS components working on AmigaOS you're better off looking [http://amidevcpp.amiga-world.de/afa_binarie_upload.php AfA]. 

Remember that still, Amiga68k is much more optimised/faster than AROS on the same hardware, but we are working on that. 

The fact that we plan to switch to ELF executables in the future and not relocatable objects. 
We still need relocation info in the file. If you call strip on an ELF executable with relocation data you keep the relocation data but loose the SysBase symbol. But a wrong &quot;strip&quot; would make any current executable unusable anyway: we need a symbol table and reloc info in order to load up executables.

This blog is here primarily for me to collect my thoughts, and to keep all the AROS folks updated with my progress on the Kickstart ROM replacement bounty. Cheers, Gaz.


;January 12, 2010: After chatting to a number of people on the AROS dev list and #aros, I’ve decided to change tact on the bounty and try a different approach. The idea is to forget about the stuff in .unmaintained, and try to get AROS compiling for m68k-hosted. For work to begin, I’ll need to get debian m68k installed and running on Aranym (yes, an Atari ST virtual machine). 


;January 23, 2010: Progress - OK, so I decided to scrap the Aranym route and face my fear of the AROS build process! Basically I’ve started the m68k-amiga build files from scratch, and based them on the ppc-sam440 build files, which are nice and new and clean. I’ve removed pretty much everything that was in unmaintained, and am just trying to get the kernel compiled.

Using the trivial patch to GCC 4.5.1 that moves the default FP register from A6 to A5, and the new 'gencall.c' I checked in to generate the libcalls, I can now do proper Amiga-style register libcalls! because of AROS stub design you can run into problem, when you call an amiga function that use the same register that you have put into register variable e.g. when you tell GCC to use register a2 as foo. This is solved by macros. I take care of all of these issues. The toolchain I am using will only generate ELF binaries. The *ROM* will be able to load and run both ELF and HUNK (eventually), but I do not plan to add HUNK support to the toolchain.

;Wednesday, 3 November, 2010: Toni Wilen assigned KS Bounty Phase 2. Main missing driver appears to be gfx hidd, my first attempt will be UAE-only Picasso96 HIDD, remaining updates should be quite simple when display is working. (mainly hunk loader, expansion.library autoconfig?). I am not against custom chipset HIDD but UAE Picasso96 HIDD (using native UAE Picasso96 helper routines that AmigaOS(TM) side Picasso96 uses) would be much easier and faster to implement and also would make non-HIDD parts much faster and simpler to debug. (no shared VRAM, less code, 1:1 framebuffer mapping etc..). I also don't really see the point in custom chipset gfx HIDD if it is only a dummy framebuffer, losing all custom chipset features (hardware sprites, user copper lists etc..), it would be worst of both worlds :). Some kind of simple custom chipset gfx HIDD that shows possible CLI messages when booting games would is of course needed in future but that should come later when everything else is working and provide a 'base level' of functionality for someone who would be interested in providing OCS/ECS/AGA support.

* paletted 8-bit mode only tested and chunky 640x480x8. 16-bit and 32-bit PC-style modes included but not tested. 
* most native blitter functions used = fast. But it will be really slow if your UAE port does not support any P96 blitter functions, current driver simply falls back to megaslow get/putpixel mode. Report this and I'll add &quot;software accelerated&quot; CopyBox() and friends. 
* afaik only WinUAE have hardware sprite emulation and only in D3D mode (for some reason aoHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor = FALSE does nothing?) 
* Z3 32bit fast RAM boards work now properly. 
* UAE directory filesystem hanging issue is solved (volume label/name is still weird... can't be used) 
* most stuff in startup-sequence work (biggest exception being workbench). We decided to improve WB/OS usage first, it also makes debugging much faster and easier.

;Tues 07 Dec: Toni wrote dos.library compatibility has improved greatly (and it is also much faster). For example original WB2/3 disks boot now without warnings, errors or crashes. Note that Workbench won't work because there isn't one included in ROM yet, Wanderer which is AROS WB replacement is too big. BCPL support is coming soon (Jason is doing this). Jason wrote With Toni's DOS Packets patches, and my recent checkins tonight, I currently have C:Echo from WB 1.3 (BCPL!) working. Now that the BCPL and Packet support infrastructure is here, full AmigaOS 1.3 support for BCPL CLI applications is just a Small Matter of Programming. I expect to have 95% of the Workbench 1.3/3.0/3.1 BCPL apps working by mid-January 2011. Does anyone know of any 'major' BCPL applications out there that I should test with other than those on the Workbench/Install disks for 1.x/2.x/3.x? 

;Sun 19th Dec: Toni added most common parts of the dos packet mode AFS handler... Toni added more missing dos packet AFS handler commands... 

;Monday 27 December, 2010: Toni wrote m68k-amiga AROS port now boots AROS original startup-sequence without any weird side-effects (no insert disk requesters or boot shell not closing etc.). Most utilities run and most preferences programs at least open. 

* prefs/screenmode shows random (uninitialized variable?) values in width, height and depth string gadgets. (and system crashes when selecting any mode, I will debug this later) GUI issue is too high level stuff for my debugging tastes. (I also have personal issues with MUI) 
* WB &quot;Information&quot; menu does not open,  TextEditor.mcc does not init. (MUI again, argh)
* WB doubleclick detection is very unreliable.
* compiler/alib/timedelay.c and compiler/include/clib/alib_protos.h does not match. I tried adding AROS_UFP3 () macro to alib_protos.h but then intuition/menutask_aros.c refuses to compile. (nothing too serious, currently it only makes all TimeDelay calls to  fail due to UnitNum being some large number) 
* finally, WB1.3 startup-sequence runs quite nicely now. Remaining problems: FastFonts (ff) corrupts all fonts and system/setmap expects LONG return type from OpenDevice(). Is it ok to change OpenDevice()/WaitIO()/DoIO() return type to LONG? it should have no effect to existing programs. 

;Friday, 31 December, 2010: Toni wrote SYS:Extras/Zune/ MCC_NList/s/Package-Startup can't work (is it even needed? SYS:Classes has already been assigned at this point). Assign opens boot console window and prints &quot;can't find Classes&quot; because startup-sequence SYS:Packages part CD:s to package directory before executing the script. Either Package-Startup (and Shutdown) should be removed or command should be &quot;Assign LIBS: SYS:Classes ADD&quot;. Also C:Assign is broken, it calls NameFromLock() inside doslist lock which can be bad idea (probably not a problem in non-dos-packets mode). And finally, the final year 2010 status report:

* Wanderer PNG icons now render correctly (needs truecolor UAE RTG mode, note that screenmode change crashes, you must select save + cold reboot), WinUAE-only truecolor hardware sprite colors fixed. 
* Shell CTRL+D and CLI faillevel checks implemented (at least works in dos packets mode, something still wrong because &gt;NIL: swallows some error output that should not be  swallowed)
* UAE mousewheel keycodes don't repeat forever anymore. 
* Titanics cruncher pseudo-overlay executables supported :) (real/full overlay executables not yet supported) 
* WB1.3 C:FF does not corrupt fonts anymore. WB1.3 startup-sequence now works perfectly. (minus workbench) 
* and more.

;Friday, 7 January, 2011: Jason wrote Just got my ACA 1230/56, which will allow me to start testing AROS on my Amiga 1200 (need to pick up a gender-bender tomorrow for serial!), and am well on my way to see if I can get AROS m68k working on real hardware. Wish me luck! First boot log on my A1200 - hung during initialization, will add some debugging tomorrow.   Toni wrote Probably something to do with autoconfig. Could you run Scout and attach autoconfig details from each autoconfig device in your system. Expansion autosize z3 ram board support committed. Also exec relocation works now and is enabled. 

;Thursday, 13 January, 2011: Jason wrote AROS on the A1200 is mighty slow, but I think that is mostly due to the unoptimized AGA interlace mode that I'm getting by default. I reset all the '#define DEBUG 1's that have been left on in the amiga-m68k (and a few other places) to '#define DEBUG 0', and we can now disable --enable-serial-debug (and yet still get SAD on the serial port). Reducing the serial debugging (and putting the OOP MID .bss in Chip RAM, which turned out to by only 512 bytes or so) did little to improve the graphical performance, so I'll let Toni worry on that for now. The mouse works fine on AROS on the A1200, but I'm getting no keystrokes. I'll debug that tomorrow night, unless Toni beats me to it. It has to be something else If it is slow even when display is idle.  Toni wrote Perhaps it is related to non-working keyboard, badly working keyboard handshake can steal too much interrupt time. Compare to WinUAE quickstart A1200 cycle-exact most compatible mode, if it is as slow or even slower: it has to be hardware compatibility problem. Gayle compatible ata.device status: drive detection partially working, should be &quot;fully&quot; working today or tomorrow. (It is currently huge mess of ifdefs, will be cleaned up after it is confirmed working). 

;Saturday, 15 January, 2011: Toni wrote m68k-amiga ata.device is now done. (should it be called &quot;scsi.device&quot;?). I separated pc hardware specific code and amiga specific code (ata_pc and ata_amiga), ata.device maintainer can merge this back to rom/devs/ata.device if interested (I don't mind if Amiga version breaks, I just don't want to break &quot;PC&quot; version or cause accidental data corruption.. IDE is too weird, too easy to break). A600 and A1200 Gayle interface and A4000 Gayle-like interface supported. (A1200 real Amiga tested only). 
* hardware specific parts separated
* some CF cards (maybe others?) seem to return 1 as multiple transfer size. Only set values listed in ATA spec (2,4,8,16,32,64,128)
* added ATAF_DRDY wait after execute diagnostics ATAF_BUSY wait, above CF card seem to hang if new command is sent after execute diagnostics but before DRDY is set. 
* #ifdef DMA support and other stuff that Amiga port does not need. 
* do not initialize device driver if no drives detected. (quick'n'ugly test only) 
* do not start ATAPI media check task if no ATAPI devices detected. 
* and something I forgot.. 
WinUAE note: that you need 2.3.1 beta 11 (release later today) or newer because execute diagnostics was not emulated. (I don't emulate commands that appear to be unused, not even m68k linux or netbsd used it) 

;Sunday, 16 January, 2011: Toni wrote AROS ROM loader is finally working on my A1200 (Blizzard 1260 + SCSI kit + SCSI-IDE + 8G CF card). Blizzard 1260 Fast RAM and 1230scsi.device also seem to work properly, even boot partition mounts (PFS3ds) and autoboots (but second partition does not mount, which is SFS formatted. Don't ask.). Display is painfully slow and flickers, I guess native chipset driver optimization is needed sooner or later.. Loader and instructions how to build relocatable rom image will be released later. I am also going to do A3000 tests first. (It must work before public release). Only requirement is 1M or more MEMF_LOCAL fast RAM (RAM that does not disappear during reset) or 2M chip RAM (in this case upper 1M will be used by ROM). MMU is not used or needed (I don't want to touch anything MMU related). Everything is handled by loaded AROS &quot;ROM&quot;, including autoconfig. Debugging this thing took ages when you only have serial output.. I think I'll have to include HRTMon debugger with ROM loader :) 

;Thu 27 January: Jason wrote does anyone have any interest in Alpha-testing AROS m68k? Right now we (Toni and I) would need testers to: 

* Attempt to run AROS on A1200 and other Amiga hardware
* Have at least 2M of chip ram and 4M of fast ram
* Be able to debug by themselves any issues they find
* Submit patches that fix those issues, or at least a small C or m68k assembly test case that demonstrates the defect.

We are not ready for general testing. If you don't know m68k assembly and your way around low level debuggers, please wait until the next phase in AROS m68k development. These early releases of AROS are guaranteed only to crash, destroy your data, and/or release all the magic smoke in your Amiga. You have been warned. 

;Thursday, 3 February 2011: Toni wrote time to check Kickstart ROM Replacement (Phase II) status. 
* Only missing part is creating AmigaOS binary compatible executables (ELF vs HUNK). Do we really need some kind of (really boring to code) ELF to HUNK converter? It is probably guaranteed that gcc will never directly create hunk binaries. (Jason, did you already do some work with conversion?) 
* And then there is part 4: where is this Michal's so called tool and who is going to use it? :) start Sys:Tools/Screengrabber, do screenshot and save the resulting file. 
* IMO this needs to be closed before starting ABI v1 (and dos packet?) merge because it probably breaks many things for (too) long time.. 

;Tuesday, 15 February, 2011: Jason wrote I think that ELF2HUNK is sufficient for letting people compile non arosc.library apps under AROS and get them to run under AOS, but getting AROS to run under AOS is a much larger task. I'll leave SetPatchAROS in for now - it's sufficient to run non arosc.library ELF apps under AOS 3.1. arosc.library is a pain, but what is worse are the extended functions in Intuition and Exec, which are difficult to cleanly add to the running libraries. 

;Wednesday, 16 February, 2011: jason wrote that's why we're near the end of Phase II of the m68k Amiga KickStart *Replacement* bounty. My todo list after I get AROS-Contrib building again, is 'Wanderer Lite' as Toni's deadline for KS Bounty II is coming up, and I've promised him an in-ROM version of Wanderer that will fit on a A1200 with 2M of RAM, gdb with the GUI in a windows task and to give the math libs some attention. 

;Saturday, 26 February, 2011: Jason wrote I've been working on cleaning up BGUI to work on m68k and hosted x86_64, with some good progress. The major BGUI demos now work on both m68k and x86_64, with the following issues and I should have these last issues cleaned up by the end of the weekend. $(PARANOIA_CFLAGS) has been enabled for those of you who ./configure with --with-paranoia. 
* LayoutGroup fails (m68k &amp; x86_64)
* Nested views  (alignment issues) (m68k &amp; x86_64)
* Drag&amp;Drop crash (m68k &amp; x86_64)
* PrefMX checkboxes (works on m68k, fails on x86_64)
* bgui_calculator (works on m68k, fails on x86_64)

;Tuesday, 8 March, 2011: Toni wrote try it with latest winuae, it has built-in AROS rom image. Note that WB programs that use undocumented features or other weird things won't work (mainly 2.0+ c:setpatch and c:iprefs). 1.3 stuff works nicely. Native Display ModeIDs are not correct, they are using some generated IDs at the moment. (AROS graphics subsystems has some native graphics related limitations that need to be fixed before this can be 100% working, this is not my problem). Audio.device does nothing. (I haven't bothered with it yet, rarely needed for anything else than allocating channels). 

;Wednesday, 9 March, 2011: Jason wrote Workbook Super lightweight Workbench/Wanderer replacement 
* Workbook is a BOOPSI based Workbench replacement, designed for very light weight systems, namely Amiga m68k. 
* This is the initial prototype checkin, which can (before it crashes due to some memory corruption I haven't fully diagnosed yet) open the disk volumes, drawers, and launch applications
* TODO: Stop crashing, snapshots, copy, paste, rename, info, etc etc. 
Total compiled size is 20k on m68k. This is *not* meant as a replacement for Wanderer on full systems. It is for low memory/slow cpu systems, and as an exerciser for workbench.library. I plan to use as many of the workbench.library hooks as possible. Once I get Workbook stable, and able to do some simple file management (delete, rename, copy, format), I plan to make it the ROM resident version of 'LoadWB', so that KS 1.3-3.x can use it as their 'Workbench'. Workbook, again, is completely optional for all other architectures, and will reside in SYS:System/Workbook/. 

;Wednesday, 9 March, 2011: Toni wrote It is few weeks left before deadline. Anything else still needed before it is considered done?  Things I am planning to do (not sure when):
* Paula audio.device
* Optimize native chipset gfx driver (it is currently painfully slow)
* HIDD wrapper  that supports Picasso96 *.card driver files. (already partially done but that was only the easy part..)

This is getting annoying, &quot;not working&quot; &quot;bug reports&quot;, expecting everything to be done by me or Jason quickly, even if it is something that has nothing to do with the bounty, mainly changes in core code that
can't be done without discussion and planning.  Most of this stuff is something that only m68k-amiga port needs, you can't just add it and break all ports (I'd like to but that's not how it works). 
WinUAE stuff is much more relaxing because I can freely choose what I do and when I do without asking anyone. That's why I want this bounty done asap because only then I can do AROS stuff just for fun again without being held hostage. (&quot;You still need to do this and that OR  ...&quot;). Debugging and enhancement will be ongoing. 


'''PHASE 2 CONSIDERED COMPLETED.'''


;25 March 2011: Toni wrote 
* 2.x-3.1 WB disks should boot without problems, now also includes correct palette and mouse cursor settings.
* fully compatible with WB2+ C:IPrefs now.
* 1.x works except C:Run (which only outputs errors) and AROS resident Run requires T: -&gt; WB disk must be write-enabled.. Will be fixed later.
* devs:system-configuration is loaded and used (1.x boot disk correct colors etc..)
* reset proof programs supported (kicktags, coldcapture etc)
* ArosBootStrap comes with source tree, Aros softkick loader that works on any Amiga that has either 2M of chip or 1M or more local fast RAM. (*)

Known problems:

* do not use OS3.5+ setpatch, it is never going to work without specific setpatch detection.
* system patches like FBlit etc can't be compatible. Do not use.
* Scalos does not work, reason unknown. 


;03 April 2011: Toni wrote Most games that only use boot block to load hardware loader should work fine unless they assume KS1.x like memory allocation and overwrite OS structures or do something stupid that only works on 1.x accidentally. (which is not rare, unfortunately). 100% compatibility is impossible. There is no way to make ROM that is both 1.3 and 3.0/3.1 compatible at the same time. Even 3.1 compatibility can't be 100% because it would require implementing all known and unknown bugs 100% exactly! (it is guaranteed there is at least one program that only works because of some OS bug..)

some update notes:
* real audio.device implemented but only minimal testing done (audio.device is rarely used for sound, usually only for channel allocation)
* first part of aros graphics modeid updates done, modeid and depth separated. Next part is to replace generated modeids with real AOS modeids.

;15 April 2011: Toni Wilen wrote Random status report. 
UAEGFX RTG/custom chipset screen switching is finally working properly. Even whdload works perfectly now.

;Thu, 26 May 2011: Toni wrote PutTemplate() blitter accelerated, should greatly improve native chipset speed, no more slow planar getpixel/putpixel &quot;blits&quot;.

;Sunday, 19 June, 2011: Toni wrote ArosBootStrap now accepts more parameter(s), one or more extra resident files (similar to BlizKick). For example &quot;arosbootstrap aros.elf.gz scsi.device_40.12(A3000)&quot; allows AROS to boot from SCSI on my real A3000. (scsi.device is extracted from A3000 ROM using romsplit that comes with remus package). 

Next phase is to support RTG boards using AOS Picasso96 .card and .chip files. (I think I already mentioned this few months ago). 

&quot;arosbootstrap aros.elf.gz libs:picasso96/CirrusGD542X.chip libs:picasso96/PicassoII.card scsi.device_40.12(A3000)&quot; already loads on my PicassoII expanded A3000, PicassoII.card FindCard() 
and InitCard() functions already succeeded and works. Boot menu, boot animation and boot shell quickly tested. (It is time for break now, moving aros.elf.gz from PC to A3000 SCSI-IDE using Amiga formatted bootable CF will get quite annoying after 30 or so swaps..) 

* 320x240, 640x480, 800x600 only supported, using hardcoded more or less standard timing variables.
* All card supported color depths available, at least in theory. 
* Does not check most card capabilities like supported width/height/depth/pixelclock combinations.
* Puts all bitmaps in VRAM, VRAM probably runs out very quickly or gets fragmented if program(s) allocate and free lots of bitmaps. 
* Uses driver's blitting functions if available. 
* Card's passthrough switching supported (if available). 

Will be improved later, when/if I feel like it, debugging using real hardware wastes lots of time compared to emulation which is nearly instant. Also btw, other RTG cards and an A4000 would be nice to have, hint, hint :D

Find P96 driver(s) that your RTG board requires, note that some come in pairs (.card and .chip files), order of files is not important. Use arosbootstrap to load rom image and driver file(s), check serial log. Note that currently there is no supported method to directly merge driver files to ROM image. No serial log = no help. 

Advanced chipset, A3000 SCSI. (&quot;WD33C93 in use&quot; appears in winuae's log when SCSI chip is used)
But you don't need SCSI emulation to test it, it will work if you see InitResident('scsi.device') in AROS serial log :) 

Link/merge utility also needs some extra functions: 
* set RTF_COLDSTART or RTF_AFTERDOS (needed to use RTG drivers or non-ROM modules, for example normal libs or devs*) 
* change resident priority (for example RTG drivers need to have higher priority than uaegfx.hidd)
* RTG drivers need patching (they have OpenLibrary() paths like &quot;libs:picasso96/something.chip&quot; that won't work if physical file does not exit) 
* most normal libs/devs probably won't work after second reboot because they generally aren't &quot;pure&quot;. 

This is feature that I probably do some day, link it as a relocatable (or even compressed) file and relocate it to RAM during InitResident() time. Current plan is to have separate resource that includes all support routines and relocatable resident only has small routine that does OpenResource(&quot;relocstuff.resource&quot;) and if found, calls it to unpack/relocate it. Very little space wasted. Too many plans, not enough time..

Motorola 68040/68060 missing instruction emulation library is also working now, but it isn't yet  rom built-in. It is quite big  (~60k) so I guess it should be only included in arosbootstrap file at this point?  (official 68040/68060 libraries may not be used because for example they need  to update FPU stack frame handling = touch exec internals that shouldn't be touched). 

Autoconfig support has been partially rewritten, most boards should now configure properly. 


;Tues, 05th July: Toni wrote - Lots of changes since last time..

* AROS is now fully dos packets converted (all platforms)
* Motorola 68040/060 support library ROM built-in
* CDFS rom built-in (does not automount yet but probably in future)
* Boot menu is now more useful (shows boot devices and expansions)
* ArosBootStrap (softkick) mode AOS driver support. Allows use of any AOS ROM resident modules. For example A3000 ROM scsi.device can be used to enable real A3000 built-in SCSI in AROS. Also added support for Picasso96 driver files (.card and .chip files) to enable RTG support in AROS. Even boot menu and boot image uses RTG mode automatically.


;Sat, 6 Aug 2011: Jason wrote Now actually comes up to Workbook, and used HUNK instead of ELF for the executables. This system disk boots under both AROS and AOS 3.x. Ideally, it should be extended with the AROS Install routine and CDROM drivers, to allow installation of AROS from an AOS kickstart. 


;Tues, 23rd August: Jason wrote Things I've found out about the CLI/Shell from KS 1.3 and 3.x

* Under KS 3.x and later, the &quot;CLI&quot; resident can't be replaced via C:Resident with other segments.

* L:Shell-Seg is not by any means a 'normal' program:

- Like DOS BCPL fs handlers, you have to set up the Shell's pr_GlobVec yourself, including installing its segments. Fun.

- Unlike CLI applications, A0 MUST be NULL. A5/A6 are BCPL_jsr and BCPL_rts.

- It expects me-&gt;pr_CLI to be BNULL, and sets up its own CLI structure

Like DOS Handlers, it expects its startup packet in D1, and uses that to determine what CliInit* routine to call.

* If D1 == 0, it uses the BCPL_cliInit at GlobVec offset 0x214 (which should probably map to DOS/CliInitNewshell or something)

* If D1 != 0, it uses dp_Type (HAH!) as the BCPL function to call to call to set up the pr_CLI structure, and D1 is passed to it.

;Wed, 15th August: Jason wrote I was surprised. As of today, AmigaOS 3.9 mostly works out-of-the-box so long as you remove/rename SYS:Libs/workbench.library - there seems to be some incompatibility with AROS's build-in icon.library. Some math libraries were missing from the AROS ROM, they should be in tomorrow's build (fixes the 'missing resource.library' popup). 

;Fri, 14th October: Jason wrote that Special aros m68k AmiWest package produced and sent. 

===2012===

;Wed, 14 March: Jason added rescale icons to match the display resolution, it the icon supports it. If an icon's MutalExclude bit 31 is set, treat the lower 16 bits as X and Y Amiga Tick resolutions, and rescale the icon to the display's resolution. Fixes the 'icons are too large' on small screens issue. 

;Fri, 16 March: Toni added support for non-MEMF_KICK fast ram boards (Mainly Blizzard A1200 accelerators). Most of the rom image loads to fast RAM now. Replaced with ForceCHIP that forces all modules to chip RAM. Mainly for debugging. Only kernel.resource, exec.library, expansion.library and diag init modules require MEMF_LOCAL RAM (RAM that never disappears during reset), in worst case it means Chip RAM. (Requires only about 80k, will become smaller in future). ForceFAST option forces complete ROM image to fast RAM, even if RAM type is not MEMF_LOCAL. (A3000/A4000 mainboard fast is most common MEMF_LOCAL Fast RAM). This only works with some non-autoconfig RAM expansions, one example is Blizzard 1260 Fast RAM.

;Tues 21 August. Jason wrote was working on the rellib support for 'normal' libraries that is ROMable.
For my next major m68k change, all normal libraries (except exec.library, of course) will have a rellib SysBase. 
In theory, the only time 0x00000004 will need to be read will be when a new m68k task starts (since, for AOS compatibility, new m68k tasks can't assume that SysBase is passed in A6 on CallEntry()) 

I'm working on a 512K AROS ROM image, that autoloads the 'missing' portions from the boot media. 
One feature I'd like to have is autoloading of the *.hidd drivers, in a similar fashion to how BindDrivers works. 
Any ideas? Or should I just extend BindDrivers to cover Amiga chip functions and PCI devices, and load them that way? 
BindDrivers already supports a probe mechanism. You'd only need to supply enough tooltype information to cause the load to occur, and if InitResident() fails (which would have the probe function in it), then the device is unloaded. 
For example, I would propose the following tooltype API extensions: (the existing 'PRODUCT' tooltype stays as it is) 
&lt;pre&gt;
PROBE=zorro:2206/31     &lt;= Zorro, vendor 2206, product 31
PROBE=zorro:2206        &lt;= Zorro, vendor 2206, any product

PROBE=usb:$1234/$abcd     &lt;= USB, vendor 0x1234, product 0xabcd
PROBE=usbclass:3/1/1    &lt;= Any USB endpoint, class 1, subclass 1,
protocol 1  (USB keyboard)

PROBE=pci:$10de/$040c     &lt;= Nvidia G84M
PROBE=pci:$10de          &lt;= Any NVidia device
PROBE=pciclass:3/20/3   &lt;= Any EHCI device

PROBE=platform:ide/$170/15    &lt;= secondary IDE device
PROBE=platform:ocs/0xdff000   &lt;= OCS chipset at 0xdff000
&lt;/pre&gt;

The InitResident could probe via the Expansion/GetCurrentBinding() mechanism, or just blindly add the module (as is current practice with *.hidd devices). 
The ConfigDev-&gt;ExpansionRom field could be extended by adding 'OOP_Object *HiddPCI' and other fields to the 'er_' union, indicated by a Manufacturer code of 0xFFFF, and the subtype (PCI, USB, etc) by AROS-defined Product codes.

| Works. Emergency floppy boots. Can't move icons in Workbook. AGA is extremelly slow: Can see screen clearing line by line when resizing or opening windows or using menus (CPU does it all?). Boot menu is very fucked: Couldn't select what I wanted from the + options, as some A-J range keys didn't work and after a while all keys switched 50/60Hz. Wanderer is completelly unusable on AGA. Octamed IV crashed after clicking on its banner screen in startup. Booted some games just fine.

Most Macs with a 68030, 68040 or better processor would be a viable target. A 68020 CPU with 68851 PMMU should work also. Older 68000-based Macs might be more problematical. 

The best place to start would be to define a specific Mac 68k emulator to target, and use that as the development environment.

Then, write a Macintosh m68k bootloader that uses the Mac Toolbox A-Line instructions to load the AROS kernel into RAM, and pass control to that.

We may wish to retain the Mac Toolbox vectors and globals (from 0x100 to 0x1000) to use for screen drawing and device access - each Mac model has its own bizarre peculiarities, and the Toolbox would be a good way to eliminate the need for coding all that ourselves.

Would imagine that we could use a 'MacFloppy.device' and 'MacHd.device' that would simply be a shim over the Toolbox ROM calls.

==PPC Native Environment==

AROS runs on Sam440EP thanks to the efforts of [http://msaros.blogspot.com/2008/05/try-it-yourself.html Michal Schulz]. 
Boots on the SAM460ex thanks to Jason McMullan. 


There is no native PowerPC-Mac Version of aros yet. You may try the darwin-hosted version under MacOSX or the linux ppc hosted under ppc-linux 

*[http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds linux-ppc-system] for PowerPC hosted linux. 
*[http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds sam440-ppc-boot-iso] for SAM 440ep 
*[http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php#nightly-builds efika-chrp-ppc-boot-iso] for Efika 5200B. 
*[http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php darwin-ppc-system] - shouldn't say the PPC version runs on all MacOSX versions.  10.6.x (Snow Leopard) and newer have the Rosetta utility removed from them and run only [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php  darwin-i386-system Intel hosted versions] of AROS. 

*[http://www.ps3hax.net/archive/index.php/t-23221.html Some discussion on hosted AROS on Linux on the Playstation PS3 using Petitboot Dual boot] 



Bootloaders (there is no grub but there is...) 
*parthenope 0.91
*[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ub2lb ub2lb UBoot Second Level Bootloader open firmware] 0.93
*slbv2 1.19 

Uboot =&gt; Bootloader =&gt; Bootable partitions =&gt; Configuration file =&gt; Operating system

Both bootloaders can read the AmigaOS configuration file, SYS:Kickstart/Kicklayout, and a configuration file on the Linux side, /boot/a1boot.conf (for SLB) or /menu.lst for Parthenope. So they both allow to boot either AmigaOS or [http://elwoodb.free.fr/articles/Sam440/debian.html Linux]. 

Hyperion's slbv2 cannot boot AROS and neither AROS nor AROS' slb supports SFS2. Use SFS instead. Keep in mind you will need to have your OS4 kernel files (kicklayout and modules) on SFS partition. AROS' Parthenope SLB (the same you probably use to boot linux) does not support JXFS yet. This ISO does require UBoot firmware (with implementation of the boota command!) to work. 

You can either use AmigaOS 4.1 and Linux (SLBv2), or AROS and Linux (Parthenope or ub2lb). It's not possible to use AmigaOS 4.1 and AROS, unless you replace the SLB each time before booting the other OS. 

Parthenope does not support booting AmigaOS 4.x. FFS can't be used as AmigaOS boot parition with it because it AFAIK it only supports short name FFS partitions (DOS\0-DOS\5), not the long name FFS ones (DOS\6 and DOS\7) which are required for an AmigaOS 4.x boot partition. SFS can't be used either because it only supports the AROS SFS (which is basically the same as the ancient AmigaOS SFS version 1.84), not the current AmigaOS versions of SFS. 

*parthenope supports FFS (all 8 formats of it, even if only DOS\6 and DOS\7 can be used for the AmigaOS boot partition), SFS\0, SFS\2, ISO9660, Linux (ext2fs/ext3fs) and network booting. 
*slbv2 support for JXFS filesystem, SFS2 filesystem and FFS2 filesystem 

UB2lB listens to uboot and uses its list of boot devices. It tries to boot of media selected through the environment variables boot1, boot2 and boot3. As soon as it supports booting from desired media and as soon as the media contains boot/menu.lst file (the file defining the layout of kernel modules and other boot options) it will start booting from it. 

&lt;pre&gt;
setenv boot1 usb
boota
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
setenv boot1 ide
setenv boot2 cdrom
setenv boot3 none
saveenv
boota
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://www.evillabs.net/wiki/index.php/AROS_ABIv1 Still to be done]. 






==Tested Hardware==


Various PPC platforms use different firmwares, filesystems, etc which makes an all-in-one compatibility very difficult.

==Reference==

AMCC440 CPU conforms the PowerPC E-Book specification and this version of AROS will not work any other type of PPC core. 
Since the AMCC440EP CPU does not maintain cache coherency and more AROS code uses CachePreDMA and CachePostDMA pair of functions. 




===Native===


The ELF header for AROS executable was a 'Type' field of REL, while the ELF header for Linux executable is EXEC:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ readelf -h /bin/ls | grep Type
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
$ readelf -h $AROS/C/Dir  | grep Type
  Type:                              REL (Relocatable file)
&lt;/pre&gt;



using a prebuild PPC toolchain, made with:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir toolchain-ppc
$ cd toolchain-ppc
$ ../configure --target=sam440-ppc --with-aros-toolchain-install=/opt/aros
$ make -s crosstools
&lt;/pre&gt;







===Hosted===

After attempts to use configure and various config files to generate makefiles in a graceful build approach, and having the config break on missing tools or failure to navigate the source code tree, found possible solution by copying .h include directory tree from ./Development/include/&lt;many directories&gt; down to &quot;each&quot; functional file directory.

And, yes, &quot;gcc -I/&lt;include path&gt; -c...&quot; or &quot;gcc -I../../..&lt;etc&gt;&quot; was also attempted but failed (not sure why nested .h's can not seem to navigate/reuse the -I&lt;include&gt; passed to cc1).

That said, there is issue of which stdio.h structure to use, and when to use native OS stdio or hosted AROS stdio, because:

&lt;pre&gt;
AROS FILE struct def:

#ifndef __typedef_FILE
#   define __typedef_FILE
    /* I need a named struct for FILE, so that I can use it in wchar.h&gt; */
    typedef struct __sFILE
    {
    int fd;
    int flags;
    } FILE;

#   define _STDIO_EOF    0x0001L
#   define _STDIO_ERROR  0x0002L
#   define _STDIO_WRITE  0x0004L
#   define _STDIO_READ   0x0008L
#   define _STDIO_RDWR   _STDIO_WRITE | _STDIO_READ
#   define _STDIO_APPEND 0x0010L
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;



while Darwin (using Mac OS X 10.5.8 for host) has following structure:

&lt;pre&gt;
typedef    struct __sFILE {
    unsigned char *_p;    /* current position in (some) buffer */
    int    _r;        /* read space left for getc() */
    int    _w;        /* write space left for putc() */
    short    _flags;        /* flags, below; this FILE is free if 0 */
    short    _file;        /* fileno, if Unix descriptor, else -1 */
    struct    __sbuf _bf;    /* the buffer (at least 1 byte, if !NULL) */
    int    _lbfsize;    /* 0 or -_bf._size, for inline putc */

    /* operations */
    void    *_cookie;    /* cookie passed to io functions */
    int    (*_close)(void *);
    int    (*_read) (void *, char *, int);
    fpos_t    (*_seek) (void *, fpos_t, int);
    int    (*_write)(void *, const char *, int);

    /* separate buffer for long sequences of ungetc() */
    struct    __sbuf _ub;    /* ungetc buffer */
    struct __sFILEX *_extra; /* additions to FILE to not break ABI */
    int    _ur;        /* saved _r when _r is counting ungetc data */

    /* tricks to meet minimum requirements even when malloc() fails */
    unsigned char _ubuf[3];    /* guarantee an ungetc() buffer */
    unsigned char _nbuf[1];    /* guarantee a getc() buffer */

    /* separate buffer for fgetln() when line crosses buffer boundary */
    struct    __sbuf _lb;    /* buffer for fgetln() */

    /* Unix stdio files get aligned to block boundaries on fseek() */
    int    _blksize;    /* stat.st_blksize (may be != _bf._size) */
    fpos_t    _offset;    /* current lseek offset (see WARNING) */
} FILE;
&lt;/pre&gt;



Possibly explains the segment violation error on executing existing ppc binaries (from April 2011 build) which never successfully opens files, loads kernel modules and beyond &quot;bus error&quot;:

**Note: required full filename path.


Q. absolute address 4 is put there by the AROS linker and Partenope just leaves it alone?
No. On AROS SysBase is an ABS symbol in ELF file with special value. Parthenope (or AROSBootstrap, x86/x86_64 bootstrap, dos.library/LoadSeg or anything else that boots AROS) sees this special symbol during relocating the loaded ELF file and replaces it with address 0x00000004. This way the modules try to read the SysBase from that address. 

Since at the stage where this symbol is resolved, there is no other AROS component working. THerefore we can neither put there address of some other SysBase pointer (there is none) nor do anything else than using just some arbitrary position in memory.

AROS and OS4 ELFs are different, don't see a reason why Partenope should not be able to handle 
each in a proper way. Not only the loaders for OS4 and AROS are quite independent on each other, but also OS4 does not use such ABS symbol in their ELF files. Not to mention they do not use REL elf files, but rather real ELF executables. 

So can't we use another absolute address other than 4 on PPC, one that does not fall in the first memory page ? Let boot code then setup this (virtual) address to contain SysBase 
pointer? That would require modifying Parthenope in such a way as to either (a) break loading AmigaOS or (b) identifying and special casing AROS ELF as different from AmigaOS loads, or (c) use ld scripts to force SysBase to a specific memory address (resolving the symbol to a constant). 


goSuper/goUser and krnAllocIntrNode &amp; friends the only port that uses this is the Efika - most &gt; everything else has these defines: 

&gt; #define goSuper() 0
&gt; #define goUser()
&gt; #define goBack(mode)

Is this some dead code that should be removed?

I invented them in order to generalize existing code. Howewer,   after   that   i   introduced  krnAllocXXX  primitives.  I
intentionally  introduced  them,  because  in future (Michal suggested this)  slab  allocator would be used for these thing instead of exec's chunk allocator. 
AFAIR  these  things are inserted around actual Allocate() operation. This  was  done  because  PPC kernels have own memory area, accessible only in supervisor mode, for these things. This is why we do this. In  fact  i  believe  the thing could be refactored a bit. First, our KrnCreateContext() could accept extra argument, holding initialization taglist.  Currently  exec.library  holds this fragment. After this, we could   have   a   single   function,   which   can   be  replaced  on 
per-implementation   basis.   A   generic  implementation  would  call AllocMem(),   then   set  up fields. However i would leave krnAllocXXX macros as they are, in order to simplify SLAB introduction. Another implementation could do own things.  Additionally  we  could  get  rid of one more supervisor more call  (exec's  context  initializer  also has to become supervisor in order to access that memory). 



IMHO on PPC .bss section should be allowed in ROM module and hard linked to absolute address maybe involving MMU to map it to that location. We *do* have .bss on modules on PPC, and we *do* use it. It's _unresolved_ symbols that Parthenope has funny ideas about. 

On Sam440PPC, Parthenope loads each library/device itself from disk/network, and resolves the symbols *before* passing control to kernel/exec. So when Parthenope loads, say 'intuition.library', and sees an unresolved SysBase symbol, it assigns it 0x00000004 (just like AmigaOS would expect). 

Right now (before I finish cleaning this up for PPC), the sam440 port (follow along in arch/ppc-sam440/kernel/intr.c:mmu_handler) has this horrid hack to try to fix up the instructions that access SysBase: 
&lt;pre&gt;
    /* SysBase access at 4UL? Occurs only with lwz instruction and DEAR=4
     * It is unfortunate that the Parthenope bootloader forces SysBase
     * to 4UL in loaded modules.
     */
    if ((insn &amp; 0xfc000000) == 0x80000000 &amp;&amp; rdspr(DEAR) == 4)
    {
        int reg = (insn &amp; 0x03e00000) &gt;&gt; 21;

        DB2(bug(&quot;Parthnope patchup to R%d, SRR0=%p\n&quot;, reg, ctx-&gt;cpu.srr0));
        /* patch from lwz %rN =&gt; mr %rN, %r2 */
        insn = 0x7c401378 | (reg &lt;&lt; 16);
        *(uint32_t *)ctx-&gt;cpu.srr0 = insn;
        /* Flush this new instuction out of the cache */
        asm volatile(
                &quot;dcbst 0,%0; sync;&quot;
                &quot;icbi 0,%0; isync;&quot;
                ::&quot;r&quot;(ctx-&gt;cpu.srr0));
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Gross, right? This is not needed anymore with the local SysBase method. In the end, here are the fact as I see it with local SysBase: 

* No application code needed to be changed
  - Only 'compiler' code in autoinit, libinit, and arosc
  - Some rom/ library code (very little, in fact)
* Fixed issues I had on two platforms that I support
* Does not affect performance on other platforms
* Reduced special cases in *three* programs that handled ELF loading
  - elf2hunk
  - dos/LoadSeg
  - bootstrap's ELF loader

Then SysBase should be in .bss and not unresolved. Correct. The .bss of *every* *single* *module*. A local SysBase for
very modules. Which means n modules * 4 bytes data loss. If that is the price to pay to avoid pushing/popping SysBase on/from the stack for every INIT/EXIT function call, so be it. Passing SysBase in INIT/EXIT is needed so that setting up that local
SysBase in the library's LibInit doesn't require a compile-time change, only a link time change. 

&lt;pre&gt;
#ifdef I_AM_COMPILING_SEPARATELY
struct ExecBase *SysBase;
#endif

... LibInit ... (struct ExecBase *,sysBase, A6)

#ifdef I_AM_COMPILING_SEPARATELY
  SysBase = sysBase;
#else
  /* No need! I'm going to be linked into one big ELF! */
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

Parthenope doesn't load 'one big ELF' - it loads each module separately. 
Any reason why modules can't be joined into bigger ones with single SysBase if huge memory loss as computed above is really a problem ? 'huge memory loss'???!? 4 * 52 is *not* a huge memory loss. And being able have a user simply replace one module instead of having to rebuild an ELF is a significant advantage, in my opinion. 



Make it conditional on AROS_STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARDS ? (although on all archs it currently seems to grow downwards) Is SP_OFFSET actually used, otherwise maybe best to remove it? AFAIR SP_OFFSET is needed e.g. on PowerPC architectures.

1.- USB booting is supported by all Mac OS X bootloaders, but Mac OS X &lt;= 10.3 do not load the USB MSC drivers at boot and the kernel is then unable to find the root volume.
2.- USB booting is unsupported at all by Mac OS 9, because it requires Toolbox drivers and they only exist for ATA, ATAPI and SCSI. 
3.- USB booting is supported by all Linux distributions, expect to load Yaboot configuration file from &quot;cd:&quot; device alias, and you must point that to your exact USB device in OpenFirmware for Yaboot to work.
4.- If your last boot disk is an USB one, it DOES appear on the boot menu. If it's not the case, it will never do, and you must boot manually from OpenFirmware.

==Introduction==


==i386-linux and i386-freebsd==

The latest Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS seem to be the most popular supported distributions (distros) for AROS development and able to compile hosted AROS on them. 

Does aros linux hosted compile on a 64 bit linux? Yes, but 64-bit Linux-hosted does not work - mmap() allocates memory beyond 2GB space. And there's no MAP_32BIT. The 64bit x86 version of hosted AROS is normally built and run on a 64 bit linux. It won't run the &quot;regular&quot; i386 32bit AROS program binaries. You can even compile and run 32bit hosted aros on a 64bit linux. Though, it might depend on the distro, on ubuntu it was easy to get all needed libs in 32bit versions. 

FreeBSD doesn't support such a construct either. In fact it looks like mmap() by default maps well past the end of the 4GB range. What do *BSD guys do with this? Or the only thing we can do is changing AROS 64-bit code model? At least for some flavors. I know, this is not good, however perhaps there's no way round. Something will happen anyway as AROS is a single address space OS. Perhaps the best option is to have everything implemented using the small or medium PIC models (at least for user code). 




===Requirements===

*Ubuntu 11.10 - 
*Ubuntu 12.04 - 

*OpenSUSE 11.2 - The default compiler which you get installed does not work well with aros native (it's gcc-4.4.1), but there is possibility to install gcc-4.1. Intel GMA development and test builds of the whole AROS were done with Suse. 
*Debian 6 [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=showfile&amp;file=development/cross/gimmearos.zip GimmeAROS] works perfectly once you have the installed dependencies. 
*Debian 7 
*CentOS/RedHat Enterprise may not have a current enough gnu autoconf available from their package installer, so you'd have to manually install it, so the AROS/configure script works. 

*FreeBSD 7 was ever completed as a host platform, not openbsd nor netbsd. 
*FreeBSD 8 does not currently build, it can work with a little hack here and there with the source tree. 

Under *BSD often the system includes conflict with AROS includes, sometimes there were varargs differences in the gcc configurations that broke the build as well. Search for netbsd on aros-exec for the notes [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3647&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=31255#forumpost31255] [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1182&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=9695#forumpost9695] [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=143&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=1212#forumpost1212]. 

The current source tree under linux wants any GCC 4.x version. It been a while since the AROS source tree could build correctly under linux with the very old 3.x versions of GCC. 


many devs use the linux-hosted version to do their development.work 

Please do the following:
# download the ISO
# extract the ISO to get the files
# download http://download.aros3d.org/software/linux.tar.gz
# extract the contents to /Arch, you should end up with Arch/linux directory
# $ ./Arch/linux/AROSBoostrap

and now you turned your pc-i386 ISO into linux-i386 installation



==Build System(s)==


===Make native AROS which builds hosted===

The manual instructions I gave were to build a native AROS which builds partly the hosted environment.  I haven't tried building under OSX, so I'm not sure of how well that works. Linux is the most used environment.  Just running the configure script without target instructions, should detect the underlying OS and setup for building a hosted-aros. 

Recommend new developers download the gimmearos.sh script (on aros-archives?) to setup the developer environment by downloading necessary packages and running the config script and make for you, and then download bootaros.sh script for help setting up the linux tap device networking for running linux hosted AROS with functional networking. 

For Anonymous downloads, The git server repo.or.cz has
AROS.git, AROS-Contrib.git, and AROS-Ports.git. You can manually download these as...

 git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS.git
 git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS-Contrib.git
 git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS-Ports.git

If you don't mind waiting forever for metamake to try to build everything that is configured (and its not all configured to build, like make aros-tcpip-apps-owb must be manually invoked to build owb) you can just mv the contrib and ports directories into AROS, then 

&lt;pre&gt;
mkdir pc-i386
cd pc-i386
../AROS/configure --target=pc-i386
make
&lt;/pre&gt;

then manually make anything else you want to include on your bootimage that wasn't preconfigured to build and finally make a bootable iso image by. 

 make bootiso-pc-i386



my script for building different GCC versions instead of using hosted one 

&lt;pre&gt;
build_dir=&quot;/home/ubuntu/aros_tools&quot;
mkdir -p $build_dir
cd $build_dir

wget -nc ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/gcc/releases/gcc-$1/gcc-$1.tar.bz2
tar xvjf gcc-$1.tar.bz2

if [ -d &quot;$build_dir&quot; ]; then
    rm -rf $build_dir/build
fi

mkdir -p $build_dir/build
cd build
../gcc-$1/configure 
    --prefix=/usr/bin/gcc-$1 
    --program-suffix=-$1 
    --enable-languages=c,c++ 
    --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --disable-checking 
    --with-system-zlib --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-libunwind-exceptions

make
sudo make install

cd /usr/bin/gcc-$1/bin
sudo ln -s gcc-$1 gcc
sudo ln -s g++-$1 g++
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's the script for actually building Aros (i386 ABI_V0) 

&lt;pre&gt;
build_dir=&quot;/home/ubuntu/aros_svn/branches/ABI_V0/aros_builds&quot;

if [ -d &quot;$build_dir&quot; ]; then
    rm -rf $build_dir
fi

mkdir $build_dir
cd $build_dir

export PATH=/usr/bin/gcc-4.1.2/bin:$PATH

/home/ubuntu/aros_svn/branches/ABI_V0/AROS/configure --target=pc-i386 --with-serial-debug=1 --enable-usb30-code --with-portssources=/home/ubuntu/aros_cache

make 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===build Aros pc-i386 on 64bit Linux===

 ABIv0 x86_64 is essentially unmaintained. Use ABIv1 or i386. 
 
compiling with --target=linux-i386. Did you delete your build tree after your attempt to build with no specific target (e.g. --target=linux-x86_64 )? 

install on Ubuntu 11.10 x86_64: g++, libpng12-dev, gcc-multilib, libx11-dev, ia32-libs, libgl1-mesa-dev

Latest Lubuntu's dependencies to be satisfied before getting to the end: 
g++ libpng12-dev gcc-multilib libx11-dev ia32-libs libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib libX11-dev:i386 
These are the packages names for Ubuntu flavours. The last one was especially tricky but google was my friend. 
Now the compilation completes successfully and now can crosscompile for x86 from my x86_64 distro. 

New installed (maybe missing?) packages:  libpng12-dev, ia32-libs, g++-multilib
compiling takes about 5 minutes 50 seconds,
&lt;pre&gt;
make clean
./configure --target=pc-i386
time make -j 12 bootiso-pc-i386
&lt;/pre&gt;



Errors 

Perhaps there is some 64-bit code left over in the tree that causes your last error. 







==Building==


===Extracting===

Since AROS/i386-linux and AROS/i386-freebsd are hosted flavors of AROS available from aros.org, installation is simple. Simply get the appropriate archives for your platform (Linux / BSD) from the download page and extract them where you want them:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
    &gt; tar -vxjf AROS-&lt;version&gt;-i386-&lt;platform&gt;-system.tar.bz2
&lt;/source&gt;

If you downloaded the contrib archive, you may want to extract it too:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
    &gt; tar -vxjf AROS-&lt;version&gt;-i386-all-contrib.tar.bz2
&lt;/source&gt;




===Build===

Ubuntu building 


The generic Debian part is pretty much 

* Call debootstrap
* Feed this or similar to debian-set-selection (debootstrap gives you just POSIX locale by default):
    locales locales/locales_to_be_generated multiselect     en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8                                                                                                                                  
    locales locales/default_environment_locale      select  en_GB.UTF-8                                                                                                                                        
* apt-get install locales build-essential subversion automake autoconf bison flex netpbm python

There are probably additional packages that'd be useful, but the above is sufficient to build AROS, including contrib if necessary. Planning on wrapping up my script so to keep my current dev environment in one VM and have it prep a new VM every night for additional testing. 

The upshot of this, is that PARANOIA_CFLAGS is now gone. If you want to enable a '-Wall -Werror' build, just add '--with-paranoia=yes' to your configure, and the while tree will be built such that any compiler warning stops the build. 





===Make===

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./configure
make
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./configure --enable-debug=all --enable-crosstools 
make
&lt;/source&gt;



Our build relies on packages downloaded from Internet - it always worked this way. The minimal requirement (when just building core AROS) is binutils and gcc. If you build contrib as well, you need many more packages to be downloaded. That doesn't take  away from the fact that it's still a rather curious step in the build. 

We don't host the whole binutils and other packages like that in our repository, we only host patches to the mainline (no patches, in case of binutils). You see the build fetching binutils from the gnu repository. If the build fails, it must be sometimes later, unless you are not connected to the internet. :-) There is a configure switch which might help a bit. If you specify --with-portssources=/somedir/someotherdir/aros_sources on the configure command line fetched packages will be put to the directory given. Later builds (even from scratch ones) will look at this location first before downloading anything. You also copy needed stuff before starting make. 

 CC=&quot;gcc-4.3 -m32&quot; ./configure --target=linux-i386 --enable-debug=all --with-portssources=/home/mazze/projects/ports-src/ --enable-crosstools

&lt;pre&gt;
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc46
export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7
/mnt/NAS/PC/AROS/trunk/configure --target=pc-i386 --with-serial-debug
--enable-ccache --with-bootloader=grub2 --with-theme=Xstream
--with-portssources=/mnt/NAS/PC/portssources
&lt;/pre&gt;

We require build tools to be pre-installed. Only software that runs on AROS is fetched and built, with the exception of the AROS-targeted GCC and binutils (because they aren't commonly available as binaries). 


 There is a script called GimmeAROS somewhere that downloads the necessary host packages for certain Linux flavours. 

--with-crosstools used to be both the source and target of AROS crosstools - now it is only the source of the kernel tools, and implied --disable-crosstools

--with-kernel-tool-prefix=... is required for some architectures if --disable-crosstools is selected. ./configure should tell you. 

Hosted archs, if being cross-compiled (ie linux-arm on x86), will require --with-kernel-tool-prefix= even if building crosstools, since it needs to know where to find the Linux ARM toolchain for building AROSBootstrap. The error in ./configure for this is pretty bad right now (failure to find dlopen). 

Will be adding back something like '--with-target-tool-path=' for specifying where to build the target crosstools to, ie for SDK builds, but I want to make sure non-SDK builds work first. 




* Linux 32bit (best if going to use Icaros or AspireOS setups) [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php linux-i386-system] or 64bit linux-x86_64-system 
* VM is another option but slower 

Treat as any archive and unarchive in your user area or /usr/local depending on Linux GNU distro used.

===Binaries===
 
 Recent Distros (2011+) have dispensed with the backingstore option and we are looking at alternatives at the moment. 

A configured and working X server (for example XFree86 or X.org) with '''backingstore'''. If you are running XFree86 4.0 or later, you might notice that the windows containing AROS screens do not refresh properly (for example when a different window passes over them). This is due to the fact that AROS uses the &quot;backingstore&quot; functionality of X, which is turned off by default in XFree86 4.0 and later. If you are starting X with the startx command, you can enable it again by passing the +bs option 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
    &gt; startx -- +bs
&lt;/source&gt;

If you start X by some other means (e.g. with XDM), you can instead add the following line to the device section of your graphics card in the X configuration file (commonly named /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4):

    Option &quot;backingstore&quot;

A complete device section might then look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xorg_conf&quot;&gt;
    Section &quot;Device&quot;
        Identifier      &quot;Matrox G450&quot;
        Driver          &quot;mga&quot;
        BusID           &quot;PCI:1:0:0&quot;
        Option          &quot;backingstore&quot;
    EndSection
&lt;/source&gt;



Some newer distros allow Xorg's backingstore to be enabled for AROS hosted, by creating a small config file in the directory /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d named 05-backingstore with the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xorg_conf&quot;&gt;
   Section &quot;Device&quot;
           Identifier &quot;Default device&quot;
           Option &quot;Backingstore&quot;
   EndSection
&lt;/source&gt;



Raspbian (ARMv6 armhf build of Debian Wheezy and others?) 
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo leafpad /etc/x11/xinit/xserverrc 
&lt;/pre&gt;
add +bs after usr/bin/X and save 
&lt;pre&gt;
exit
&lt;/pre&gt;




To start AROS 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
    &gt; cd AROS
    &gt; boot/AROSBootstrap --fullscreen -m 256
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
-h
-m &lt;size&gt;
-M
-t &lt;value&gt;
--help
--memsize &lt;size&gt;
--mapsysbase
&lt;/pre&gt;



There are also the following files: 

* aros-base - base kickstart module (architecture-independent libraries). 
* aros-strap-hosted - boot code (bootloader.resource and dosboot.resource) 
* aros-bsp-linux - board support package (architecture-dependent parts). 

The first and the second parts are interchangeable between Windows-hosted port. In future the base kickstart will be interchangeable between all ports. 


--hostmem argument is gone. In future this is going to be implemented in other way. Michal Schulz is working on a new memory manager. If someone really misses it, i can bring it back, however. 

--tickrate argument is also gone. Instead you have two new arguments:

vblank=xx - set VBlank frequency to xx Hz. Default is 50. 

eclock=xx - set master timer frequency to xx Hz. If you specify eclock=100 you'll get the same as what you had before. 

In near future, ability to specify arguments in AROSBootstrap.conf file, so there will be no wrapper scripts needed. Hosted serial and parallel ports are missing. They will be back after some time. 




If it does not go well 

# make sure the logs end up in the emails sent to the AROS mailling list 
# Send to the mailing list your ./configure line, the ./configure output, and the config.log file if it fails 
# '''make -s''' query if you can get past configure 





===Building ISO===

If you have network access, the anonymous git repo is much better to use. It eliminates all the date coded directories and any future updates are just a &quot;git pull&quot; command away. You can locally branch off whatever way you want and create diffs to submit for others to look at.

Figure out where you want to build locally (maybe a directory named src), cd there and
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS.git
cd AROS
git clone git://repo.or.cz/AROS-Contrib.git

./configure
make
&lt;/pre&gt;




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ DISCLAIMER: This is just **how I made it**  it's not meant to be a perfect or bullet-proof guide, so: no warranties ;) ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install subversion

in a terminal window write:

 &gt; sudo apt-get install subversion

2. Get the AROS and Contrib sources:  (here I use SVN, but you might just download sources from www.aros.org)

in a terminal, from your home path write:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/AROS

&gt; cd AROS

&gt; svn checkout https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/contrib
&lt;/pre&gt;

3. Install GCC 4.xx (examples use 4.2) 

In a terminal window write: 

 &gt; sudo apt-get install gcc-4.2

4. Install Automake1.9, Bison, Flex, netpbm, patch:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; sudo apt-get install automake1.9

&gt; sudo apt-get install bison

&gt; sudo apt-get install flex

&gt; sudo apt-get install netpbm

&gt; sudo apt-get install patch
&lt;/pre&gt;

5. Set your compiler with GCC-4.2:

 &gt; export CC=&quot;gcc-4.2&quot;

6. Launch configure with --target=pc-i386 parameter:

 &gt; ./configure --target=pc-i386

or you can compile with some optimizations:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; ./configure --target=pc-i686

&gt; AROS_TARGET_ARCH=pc
&gt; AROS_TARGET_CPU=i686
&lt;/pre&gt;

7. Compile launching make

 &gt; make

8. Create an .ISO file with

 &gt; make bootiso-pc-i386

the .iso will be created in &quot;~/AROS/distfiles/&quot; directory




if you still needed to make kernel-kernel because the compile fails, at this bucomm.c 

&lt;pre&gt;
Clean the build
Go to workbench/libs/mesa/src/mesa
Edit mmakefile.src
Find the line #MM- workbench-libs : workbench-libs-mesa 
Put # before the whole line (it disables the dependency) 

configure
make
... you will get fail
make kernel-kernel
... you will get fail
make
... now it should compile till the end
&lt;/pre&gt;

NOTE:
You should have the following sources: From main aros source package - all sources in directory AROS From contrib aros source package - only contrib/necessary in directory AROS/contrib/necessary (copy not link!)

What you might be interested is a compiler. You can find it in bin/linux-i386/tool/i386-linux-aros-gcc





==Configuring==


===Sound on Hosted===

At the moment OSS is only supported, while we wait for [http://power2people.org/projects/alsa/ an ALSA driver] 

No luck with Ubuntu 11.04 either. OSS was supported in 10.4 (and older releases). 

# apt-get install alsa-oss
# modprobe snd_pcm_oss
# modprobe snd_mixer_oss

works for [http://wiki.debian.org/SoundFAQ debian wheezy and squeeze 6] 



Another alternative is to use alternative kernel - Liqourix, Debian testing/unstable, AVLinux, Aptosid (not sure if Aptosid supports oss) 

Liquorix on Debian and Ubuntu, its repository offers also wine 1.5, some libs and firmware/drivers (wifi,ethernet)

&lt;pre&gt;
# LIQUORIX HOW-TO:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

# ADD LINE:

deb http://liquorix.net/debian sid main

# CTRL+O, ENTER, CTRL+X (save,exit)

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install '^liquorix-([^-]+-)?keyring.?'

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install linux-image-3.7.0-8.dmz.1-liquorix-686

# REBOOT

# I have intel 2200 wireless card so:

sudo apt-get install firmware-ipw2x00
&lt;/pre&gt;



The Liquorix kernel can be installed by way of meta-packages. This will guarantee that the latest kernel is installed on every upgrade.

All packages in the liquorix repository are signed. Run the command below to install the keyring package for liquorix.net.

apt-get install liquorix-keyring

32-bit without PAE (HIGHMEM4G):

apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-686 linux-headers-liquorix-686

32-bit with PAE (HIGHMEM64G):

apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-686-pae linux-headers-liquorix-686-pae

64-bit:

apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-amd64 linux-headers-liquorix-amd64






===Configuring host network for AROS hosted===


&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NETON=`ifconfig | grep aros0`

if [ &quot;$NETON&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]; then
    echo &quot;Installing bridge network... (sudo access required)&quot;
    sudo tunctl -b -u &quot;$USER&quot; -t aros0
    sudo ifconfig aros0 192.168.166.1
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 192.168.166.0/2 -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -s 192.168.166.0/2 -j MASQUERADE
    sudo sh -c &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&quot;
fi
echo &quot;Set your AROS config to:&quot;
echo &quot;  device        : tap.device&quot;
echo &quot;  IP            : 192.168.166.2&quot;
echo &quot;  Mask          : 255.255.255.0&quot;
echo &quot;  Gateway       : 192.168.166.1&quot;
echo &quot;  Primary DNS   : 8.8.4.4&quot;
echo &quot;  Secondary DNS : 208.67.222.222&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;




===How to mount some device or directory (for example a dvd-drive) as a drive under aros hosted?===

Add this to Devs/Mountlist

&lt;pre&gt;
WORK:
    FileSystem     = emul.handler
    Device         = WORK:/home/mazze/arosdev
    LowCyl         = 0
    HighCyl        = 0
    Surfaces       = 1
    BlocksPerTrack = 1
    DOSType        = 0x454D5500
    Activate       = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

and add e.g.
mount work:
to s:user-startup




===Copying and Configuring Icaros 1.xx===

an [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=53456#forumpost53456 updated] guide for Icaros 1.26 (on Debian / Ubuntu):

Put keycode2rawkey.table in Devs/Keymaps/X11

* Install the tunctl command on your host:

sudo apt-get install uml-utilities

* Copy the Icaros CD to a folder named &quot;AROS&quot; in your home directory

* Copy over the following files from a Linux hosted nightly archive:

AROS.boot
boot/*
Devs/AHI/aros.audio
Devs/AudioModes/AROS
Devs/Drivers/unixio.hidd
Devs/keymaps/X11
Devs/Monitors/X11
Devs/Networks/tap.device
Libs/oss.library
Devs/timer.device

* Delete Devs/Monitors/Nvidia

* Edit boot/AROSBootstrap.conf to suit your needs (e.g. add &quot;memory 256&quot; to assign 256 MB RAM to AROS)

* In S/icaros-sequence, remove the line &quot;assign system: sys:&quot;

* Create the script bootaros.sh in the AROS folder, make sure you read the comments. Adjust where necessary:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
# tap unit number. This should match the UNIT= parameter in
# AROSTCP/db/interfaces
tap_unit=0
# IP address for the tap interface. Inside AROS, this will be your default gateway.
# NOTE: Make sure it is in a different network than your Linux host.
tap_ip=192.168.254.254
# create the interface
iface=$(sudo tunctl -b -u `whoami` -t aros$tap_unit)
# bring it up
sudo ifconfig $iface $tap_ip up    
sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun
# turn on NAT
# (NOTE: make sure that the network interface you are using is named &quot;eth0&quot;.
# Otherwise adjust the following line to your needs.)
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
# Turn on IP forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# start AROS
cd ~/AROS
./boot/AROSBootstrap
# aros has finished, so kill the interface
sudo tunctl -d $iface &amp;&gt; /dev/null
# maybe turning off routing is a good idea aswell
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Make the script executable:

 chmod u+x bootaros.sh


* Start the script from a shell:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd ~/AROS
./bootaros.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Inside AROS, the network settings will have to be configured like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Device: tap.device
IP address: 192.168.254.1
Gateway: 192.168.254.254
DNS1: The IP of the name server that is also used by your Linux host
DNS2: The IP of the name server that is also used by your Linux host
&lt;/pre&gt;






==Android and others rPi==

===ARM===





===PowerPPC===

In  fact  my  usage  of  variant was a continuation as Michal Schulz' usage  for Efika port. There variant is a &quot;sub-architecture&quot;. Stuff in arch-cpu  can  be  overriden  by arch-cpu-variant. This way there is generic ppc-chrp code and ppc-chrp-efika code. This is how i used it for Android and iOS ports. 
Was even sure that Michal introduced variant for this purpose. Some  time  ago i came to a need of versioning some components, to be able  to  verify  that  they match. For example, disk-based tap.device needs to know that it really runs on system it was built for. This  need  originates  from  the  fact  that  many  things  are source-compatible but not binary-compatible across various UNIXes. For example,  the  same  tap.device code can be built for Linux and Darwin. They  will  use  the same host OS calls, but parameters passed to them are  not  binary-compatible.  Darwin  version of tap.device won't run on Linux-hosted AROS and vice versa. In order to prevent crashes that are hard  to explain, i introduced runtime versioning of these components. 

The following modules are taking part in it:

* kernel.resource,  being  the primary architecture-dependent part, carries  architecture  name  in  the  form  of  arch-cpu.  For example &quot;linux-i386&quot;.  It  can  be  queried using KrnGetSystemAttr() function. 
* Bootstrap. It supplies the same string in its HostInterface. These strings  must match, otherwise the kernel will refuse to start up. You can't errorneously launch Linux kernel on Darwin system. 
* unixio.hidd carries the same string inside it. When it starts up, it verifies itself with kernel.resource, ensuring match. When  some external  module  opens  unixio.hidd,  it  can supply Architecture attribute.  unixio.hidd  will  compare the given string with its own such  string. In case of mismatch Intuition requester will pop up, and HIDD will refuse to instantiate its object. 


Now,  after  introduction  of  Android build, it became apparent that Android  is  not  Linux.  Android's libc is not really binary-compatible with glibc.  In  order  to  distinguish  between them, introduced a rule: 
variant-ed  system is different from variant-less one. If a variant is specified,  arch-cpu  is  replaced  with variant-cpu. One exception is 'pc' architecture for legacy reasons. Introduced  AROS_TARGET_PLATFORM  make variable which carries this designation.  It  is  also  included  into  version  string  of  all architecture-specific  modules,  so that the user can easily determine which version he has using Version FULL command. 
This  is  what  actually  made  variant  bad for specifying just some descriptive  build name. If you for example build Linux-hosted distro, and  use  variant as distro name, your modules will be compatible only with  other  your  modules.  A  user  of  your distro won't be able to upgrade,  for  example,  oss.library, from trunk. It will not work and will say &quot;Incompatible architecture&quot;. 

For  now  this  does not affect native systems, but... Who knows what happens  in  future.  Using  variant  as  distro  name  this way would introduce  ambiguity.  Distro's  modules  will  be  versioned  as &quot;arosmax-i386&quot;  (for  example)  while  trunk ones will be versioned as &quot;pc-i386&quot;. 

Didn't know that variant was not originally meant for the purposes for  which  i  use it. Described the usage well here. Can reimplement definition of AROS_TARGET_PLATFORM in such  a  way  that  variant  name  won't  be  always used for platform designation, instead platform name will be explicitly set by configure script.  But --enable-target-variant will still be used for selecting Android,  iOS  and  Efika targets. And you won't be able to use it, will want to build Android-hosted distro. 

introduced  ELF  wrapper last year. It is used when AROS-targetted gcc is used for AROS. This is the default case for building on Windows and MacOS (since native host's compiler can't produce ELF files). This  wrapper does a similar thing which AROS wrapper does with Linux gcc,  just  in  reverse  way.  AROS wrapper makes Linux gcc  generating relocatable binaries, and ELF wrapper makes AROS gcc generating static binaries.  The  purpose  is  to  get  rid  of  one  more ELF-targetted toolchain to be used as $KERNEL_CC. 




==Reference==

The ELF Header starts off grand, with the x7f magic and 16-bytes including null terminated &quot;ELF&quot; marker.  From there, it seems to deteriorate as the ELF header lacks a program header which indicates the modules are 'relocatable' and in need of link-edit then &quot;loading&quot;.  Ignoring this to look for section headers we use the shoffset entry and it points to 0x36bd4 (offset line 0x0020), but after a (OS X) &quot;hexdump -C&quot; of the aros-bsp-darwin module, this seek-offset into the file doesn't seem to follow the expected ELF Section Header format. 

* AROS kickstart modules are relocatable. There's no boot.img.
* MorphOS kickstart is loaded at some specific address. You can't do this on hosted, and there's no need to do this on native.
* Relocation is performed by the bootstrap. See its ELF loader code. It's the same as InternalLoadSeg_ELF(). The ELF has ET_REL type, this is enough to see it's relocatable.




====Linux hosted exec====

SC_ENABLE/SC_DISABLE is there to make sure the new task continues running in either Disable() or Enabled() state, depending on which state it was when it was last switched away. For example internally Wait() causes task switch while in disabled state and when task is run again it must be in Disabled() state. 

SC_DISABLE and SC_ENABLE poke the &quot;old signal mask&quot; of Unix signal handler (context) used by kernel. So when the Unix signal handler &quot;returns&quot; the blocked Unix signals are set to that value. 

The old code in arch/all-unix/exec/switch.c manually makes sure that SIGUSR1 is not blocked:

&lt;pre&gt;
    sigset_t temp_sig_int_mask;
   
    sigemptyset(&amp;temp_sig_int_mask);   
    sigaddset( &amp;temp_sig_int_mask, SIGUSR1);
    sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;temp_sig_int_mask, NULL);
    SysBase-&gt;AttnResched |= 0x8000;
    kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;temp_sig_int_mask, NULL);
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are probably ways to avoid this, if one really wanted.

A a small test which plays with enabling/disabling signals and prints out oldmask contents. One of discoveries was is that it's not used on PPC. I studied Linux includes and notices that there's another sigset_t in ucontext structure. In fact it was similar to x86-64 (i found that in sigcore.h.x86_64.src). And it should be used instead of oldmask.

So, actually PPC Linux port was broken. And i fixed it. After the fix i got similar freezes! I changed SC_DISABLE() macro from: 

&lt;pre&gt;
 sigfillset(&amp;uc-&gt;uc_sigmask)
 to:
 uc-&gt;uc_sigmask = PD(KernelBase).sig_int.mask
&lt;/pre&gt;

And everything worked fine!

PD(KernelBase).sig_int_mask contains signals set which actually should be disabled by KrnCli(). They do not include SIGUSRs, SIGINT and traps. So i disable only what really should be disabled. Everything is okay now.

Another nice testcase is cold reboot function. execvp()'ed program inherits current signal mask, so if some of SIGUSRs appears disabled, another copy of AROS will freeze. This works especially well if combined with stackcheck test. stackcheck testcase causes stack check failure, which ends up in supervisor-mode Alert(), which ends up in ShutdownA(SD_ACTION_COLDREBOOT). If something is wrong, AROS will freeze on restart.

We have -quick targets if we want to omit these large sets of dependencies. For example you can rebuild just dos
by using &quot;make kernel-dos-kobj-quick&quot;. Then &quot;make kernel-link-base-quick&quot; just relinks the kernel package (this is
implemented by me for newstyle packaging, currently only Windows-hosted uses it).

If the hosted kernel now uses SIGUSR2, too, tell gdb to ignore it like SIGUSR1. In the .gdbinit file or manually at the gdb prompt.

  handle SIGUSR2 pass noprint nostop

Hostlib_init is empty on UNIX because currently UNIX-hosted is modular and there's no HostInterface.

If it does not use libstdc++, then .cpp file scan be compiled by the standard gcc as it recognize C++ files extensions. ... Errrm, it surely need the new &amp; delete functions... I did a small lib to compile TeXlive without using separate g++ compiler.

Restructure sams kernel code according to rom/kernel, i.e. there will be files like createcontext.c etc. If possible
&gt; code from rom/kernel will be used. The  code  in rom/kernel was designed to be reusable as far as possible.
Please also throw away arch/ppc-sam440/dos directory. Custom versions of   InternalLoadSeg_ELF()  and  InternalUnloadSeg()  are  there  only because   KrnRegisterModule()   and   KrnUnregisterModule()  have  old
definitions  and differ from their final versions. Custom runprocess.c is very old and needs to be removed, the job should be done by generic runprocess.c  which relies on exec.library/NewStackSwap(). I just didn't do it because   i  could  not  test  NewStackSwap on PPC (it's based on runprocess.c code so should work fine). 
Generic   runprocess.c  is  known  to  work  because  it works on all i386 ports and other UNIX-hosted ports. 

Added  some  more debug output to pci.hidd. Now it will report the result of CreatePool(). Also changed some things in the implementation. Perhaps new build will even work. In fact it behaves very close to the original. Can  you  tell  me  what  GURU  happens?  Would be nice if you enable debugging in createpool.c and memory.c and send me crash log. Just to be sure. Can you enter bootmenu? Can you boot without startup sequence?  Can  you  boot  in  VGA/VESA mode? I committed video driver automatic  selection  (worked  on  my  netbook). Answer, forgot that native ports use own exec_init.c, and PageSize was uninitialized there. 

All hosted ports. On non-Linux OSes it's impossible to acquire address 4 at all.  After hitting problem with entry point i introduced a new macro, AROS_ENTRY, to mitigate this. 


There  is  40KB minimum of stack space!!! This   is   defined   in   aros/&lt;cpu&gt;/cpu.h   (AROS_STACKSIZE). And task creation routines  make sure that task's stack size is not less than this value. Such  a  big  digit  comes from hosted AROS. UNIX signal handlers and X11 are stack-hungry. However this parameters appears to be hardcoded. May  be  this should be adjusted on per-system basis? I would suggest to  add  a kernel attribute (for KrnGetSystemAttr() which would return this value). So it would not be that big for native OS. In some ways it could be tuned specifically for m68k needs. 40KB stack is actually way to small considering majority of our software comes from unix world. AFAIK native g++ requires *at least* 256 KB stack and any 3D game requires *at least* 512KB stack.




====*nix 'Hosted' Environments====

AROS Shares common hardware and driver support for Linux and BSD.

There  is  no  more  boot/aros-unix file. There is boot/AROSBootstrap instead which you should run.




''Keyboard / Mouse:''

Currently the driver instantiation is done during x11gfx.hidd initialization,  which  happens  before  dosboot makes its assigns, so DEVS: simply does not exist (even SYS: does not exist).
Disk-based part was created for DEVS:Monitors, similar to GDI driver.
It is responsible for loading X11 keymap now. Improvement: now you may  specify any keymap file name in icon tooltypes. Of course it will look up DEVS:Keymaps/X11/keycode2rawkey.table by default if you don't specify anything.
The basic idea was to move keymap buffer and presence flag into librarybase.  Disk-resident  part  simply  opens the driver library and loads keymap file right into its base.
Also  disk-based part contains code for creating additional displays, but  it's  expected not to work because of bad driver design. The call is commented out with notes.




''GFX Chipsets:''
  
;x11.hidd: x11 accelerated graphics driver.



  
''Audio Chipsets:''
  
;oss.audio:  plays audio through the hosts OSS drivers.

In theory oss.library's funcs.c would need to be compiled in such a way that the O_WRONLY, O_NONBLOCK, etc. are taken from the host (Unix) includes, not from AROS includes. Otherwise it depends on luck (O_ defines having similar value on AROS and the Unix OS in question, or not) if it works or not. IMHO this should only be done via configure/mmakefile's passing the necessary info in. 

At what rate does VERTB interrupt happen now? 

50  or 60 Hz. User-specified (by vblank=NN command line argument). In fact you can specify any value. 

How it used to be: 

VERTB: always 50 Hz TIMERTICK: 100 Hz (default, could be changed with &quot;-t&quot; argument when starting AROS) 

Some things like that AHI driver do not work well if it only happens at a rate of 50Hz. 
Also a general timer precision of 50 Hz is bad. That's what the TIMERTICK hack fixed. 

* Instead  of  TIMERTICK  hack there's kernel.resource API now. And timer  still  can  be  set to 100 Hz. Just run AROS with 'eclock=100' command line argument. 
* This  solution is not future-proof. In fact timer.device needs to be  rewritten  to measure actual intervals, similar to native drivers. In this case timer interrupt will not have stable frequency at all. In order to be future-proof i'll further rewrite the driver. It needs own timerequest,  set  to  1/1000 sec for example. This will cause current timer.device  to  reply  in  a  minimum  interval (specified by eclock argument), and future timer.device will really reply in 1/1000 sec. 

It  makes sense to implement 'arguments' keyword in bootstrap's config  file. For now you can write small script which runs AROS with eclock=100 argument if you need to. I would  suggest  more clean solution. Modify configure.in to supply -nostdinc  with  $(KERNEL_INCLUDES) (where compiler's include path is detected).  Anyway  $(KERNEL_INCLUDES) is used together with -nostdinc everywhere,  this  way  you  would  kill  two  rabbits in one shot. If$(KERNEL_INCLUDES) is empty, -nostdinc will also not be supplied. 





''Network Chipsets:''

;tap.device: networks through tap.




It seem pci.hidd is no longer present in linux-i386. The following code used to work about 4 month ago:
&lt;pre&gt;
    if (!OOPBase_DRM)
    {
        if ((OOPBase_DRM = OpenLibrary(&quot;oop.library&quot;, 0)) == NULL)
        {
            /* Failure */
            return -1;
        }
    }

    HiddPCIDeviceAttrBase = OOP_ObtainAttrBase(IID_Hidd_PCIDevice);

    if (!pciBus)
    {
        pciBus = OOP_NewObject(NULL, CLID_Hidd_PCI, NULL);
        if (!pciBus)
            return -1;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, the call to OOP_NewObject(NULL, CLID_Hidd_PCI, NULL) returns NULL. The liblist command also does not list pci.hidd anymore. Now  they  are  disk-based modules. You can either load them manually using   LoadResource   command   or   add   to   kickstart   list   in AROSBootstrap.conf. 

Remember    that    you   need  not  only  base  pci.hidd,  but  also pcilinux.hidd which is the driver itself. I  do  not include them by default because Linux PCI driver is a hack by nature and it's easy to screw up the system using it (by attempt to use the hardware which is already in use by Linux). 

All hosted ports. On non-Linux OSes it's impossible to acquire address 4 at all.  After hitting problem with entry point i introduced a new macro, AROS_ENTRY, to mitigate this. 





====Segmentation fault====

This is the log I have: 

&lt;pre&gt;
[Bootstrap] entering kernel@0x7f6.... 
Segmentation fault 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The debugger doesn't tell much, but addresses like 0x00007ffff76c509f are strange because I have only 4GB RAM. 

&lt;pre&gt;
gdb) run
[Bootstrap] entering kernel@0x7ffff76c5000...

&lt;/pre&gt;

Virtual addresses have nothing to do with real amount of physical memory!

The problem is, AROS x86_64 kernel is compiled without -mcmodel flag set, therefore it defaults to -mcmodel=small. It means, all code and data has to reside within first 2GB of address space. This is not the case here, so it crashes/segfaults or does any other strange things. 

There are two solutions - either, compile whole x86_64 aros with - mcmodel=large and suffer from small speed penalty. Large model allows both code and data to reside *anywhere* within the address space, some PC-relative addressing cannot be used in that case. Gcc will make all branches 64-bit large and, therefore, a bit slower. 

 Tried (gcc-4.3 -m64 -mcmodel=large). No change.

mcmodel=large generates more traffic on CPU's bus lines and consumes much more cache. 

Every loading of data (mov %reg,addr) is replaced by movabs %reg,addr, increasing the instruction size by four bytes. PC-relative access to sections other than current one is not existing anymore and replaced by absolute movabs 
instruction. Every single call to any subroutine (call function) is replaced by a pair movabsq %reg,function; call *%reg. But, as you have mentioned, the cpu fetches most things from its cache(s) - so the implication that we will
&quot;suffer&quot; because of using it is at best missleading imho, and also a bit scare-mongering (speed wise of course - obviously binary size will increase). 

In general I have nothing against compiling whole AROS with mcmodel=large, which is anyway the only sane way for 64-bit system with single address space for all processes. I just warn about the consequences :) 

Another solution is to allocate the memory for AROS within first 2GB of address space. It can be done with anonymous mmap and flag MAP_32BIT. Please  check, i added the flag. Sorry for dropping it, i didn't know why it was there.
P.S. Fix for gdb support is on the way. Infrastructure is ready, need only to update _gdbinit script. 



since the new genmodule inlines don't know how to handle the RA/RB idiom for 64-bit parameters.
Actually I implemented this patch a long time ago (before your m68k QUAD fixes) after discussion on the maillist to solve two things: 
* In compile warnings/errors during a library call no clear function name was present so it was difficult for programmers to find out what is wrong.
* On i386 libbase is passed as first argument causing a argument number in compile warnings and errors was of by one, confusing programmers even more. 



I had fixed them by modifying Exec/Init to strap to an AllocMem()ed area for its stack, but sonic removed that common code.  UNIX-hosted kernel should add its stack area to memory lists now. 

I did a clean build of linux-i386 from rev 35739 and I still get the same asserts:

&lt;pre&gt;
/data/deadwood/tAROS/AROS/rom/oop/./setattrs.c, 71: bad pointer: attrList = $bface5fc
/data/deadwood/tAROS/AROS/compiler/alib/./coercemethod.c, 59: bad pointer: message = $bface6a8
/data/deadwood/tAROS/AROS/rom/oop/./setattrs.c, 71: bad pointer: attrList = $bface600
/data/deadwood/tAROS/AROS/compiler/alib/./domethod.c, 60: bad pointer: message = $bface6a8

/data/deadwood/tAROS/AROS/rom/exec/./getmsg.c:65: bad pointer: msg = $bface64c
&lt;/pre&gt;

You configured AROS with --enable-debug=messages. This is why you get these additional assertions.
Can  you  run  ShowConfig  and tell me its output (together with some assertions  from  the same run)? Perhaps 3K is simply not enough. I'll enlarge this area. 






====Other====

AMD [http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/knowledge/index.php/Super-secret_debug_capabilities_of_AMD_processors_! debugging] and [http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1865066&amp;cid=34207758 here].

This  means  i  need  to get rid of static linking with UNIX libraries in all AROS modules.

Currently  i've  almost  done  it  in  all  AROS  core modules except exec.ibrary  and  kernel.resource (they will be the last ones, because doing  this  actually  means  switching  to  modular  kickstart). I've rewritten  emul.handler and oss.library, and i'm also going to do this with tap.device. 

However  i don't have much time and i plan to leave out the following (at least temporarily):

1. uxser.hidd (unix-hosted serial port HIDD)
2. uxpar.hidd (unix-hosted parallel port HIDD)
3. lxpci.hidd (PCI bus driver)
4. linuxfb.hidd - Linux framebuffer driver.
5. unixio.hidd - the component for handling async I/O.

First, I think unixio.hidd should be deprecated. Kernel.resource has IRQ  API which allows to process SIGIO in a  very clean way. This makes unixio.hidd  redundant.  emul.handler  SIGIO  code  may  serve  as  an
example.  I  dislike  unixio.hidd  because  it  drops  performance  by gathering all requests in a single place, and introduces a timer-based polling  loop  on  Linux  (i  believe  not  all devices actually issue SIGIO).

I  thought  for  a  while,  but  i  didn't  find  any reason to leave unixio.hidd.  First  i  thought  that  it  could be a nice abstraction layer,   but  it  was  a  wrong  suggestion.  After  comparing  several UNIX-alike  OSes  i  came  to a conslucion that this will not give any abstraction.  This  happens  because  all structures values  which  needed to be supplied  to  operations  like  ioctl,  and even host error codes, are strictly  dependant  on  current host. Different UNIXes are not binary compatible,  so  we  still need to have a personal version of a driver 
(for  example  oss.library) for all hosts we run on. It's not possible to interchange them.

So i suggest just to remove unixio.hidd. Is there anyone against?

Other  mentioned  components  require at least reengineering. linuxfb hidd  does  not work on my system (just crashes), and looks like noone tested  it,  so i consider it abandonware. Of course i will not delete it from the tree, just someone needs to pick it up and take care about it.  PCI  driver will be fixed very soon, it's very easy to do. Just i believe noone is actively using it at the moment and it can wait. Serial  and  parallel  drivers also will not be dropped. I'll rewrite them,  just  i  consider this a low priority task. So this is why i am asking  -  is  there  anyone actively using these drivers? Will anyone suffer if for some time they will stop working?

The 'bad pointer' addresses are due to TypeOfMem(ptr) in the ASSERT_VALID_PTR() macro returning 0.
TypeOfMem() is return 0 because the memory was never AllocMem()ed from a known memory region. 
The memory was never AllocMem()ed because it is on the stack of the AROS Bootstrap's main(). 
Solution is have whoever is maintaining AROS Bootstrap add a MemHeader for the strap's stack to the kernel
as an unallocable memory segment. 

Just running ./boot/AROSBootstrap of linux-i386. These assertions appear before the: 
 [DOS] DosInit: InitCode(RTF_AFTERDOS)
Perhaps  you  have some debugging options enabled. Well, doesn't matter,  the  problem  should  go  away now. I backported adding boot stack region to memory list. 

I think there are still some problems with gdb support in the new linux-i386. In some applications (for example ScreenMode preferences) if I put asm(&quot;int3&quot;) in the code and the try to loadseg the symbols, gdb does not complain in any way but the symbols are not resolved (I just see function name with no line number). On the other hand, other things like muimaster or intuition have their symbols loaded correctly. Check kernel modules with objdump, perhaps dwarf2 information gets stripped away during relinking. Are modules listed correctly (with paths) in modlist output?

Keyboard mapping changing on Linux hosted when switching desktops, running Linux hosted on Ubuntu, and my laptop doesn't work well with the default keymap (cursor keys don't work for starters), so I've made a custom keycode2rawkey.table file, and that works great. 
Until I change desktops and change back to AROS. When I change back, the default keymap is used instead of the one I've copied to Devs/Keymaps/X11/keycode2rawkey.table

loadseg however fails to load information. &quot;modlist&quot; lists the DISK based modules which were loaded so far. AFAIK the ROM modules were always available &quot;out of the box&quot; with debug information. Has something changed?
Now  they  are  also  loaded  from  disk by the bootstrap. They are not linked statically any more. But there are two lists now instead of one. 

As far as I remember for emulation to work, your driver needs to be a frambuffer one (aHidd_Gfx_NoFrameBuffer = FALSE) and you need to implement Show method to call super method. 

This information is  obsolete. The limitation was  removed  since  that  time, now emulation works with NoFrameBuffer drivers too (was needed by VESA). 

I'm wondering because I'm compiling for AROS using the Linux cross-compiler from the AROS SDK and my app is heavily using multi-threading and calls functions like malloc() and free() from lots of different threads. However, everything is working fine.... shouldn't it crash pretty soon if the C runtime is not thread-safe!? In Linux, if you compile with -pthread then a thread-safe version of malloc() will be put instead of the standard one (which is not thread-safe). I don't know if this applies to AROS also... There is no PThread library for AROS.  However, parts of the C runtime library are in shared libraries which, by nature, are reentrant code.  Only the parts of the C runtimes that are statically linked only can be thread-unsafe, if I'm not mistaken. 

Every time i check out  AROS svn asks me for my login and password. Additionally it warns me that credentials will be stored unencrypted. How  do  AROS  nightly  build machines work automatically? Do we have some predefined read-only account in our SVN? Some svn client remembers user and password. I think older svn clients store unencrypted. SVN on Mac OS X will make use of Keychain which works automagically from the graphical UI. If you want to make use of the Keychain from ssh then you first need to unlock Keychain, with the following command: security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain 

And  how  will  my machine upload binaries? I believe i need some ssh certificate for it? You have to create a ssh key pair on your machine and enter your public key inside your sourceforge user account. You probably need to search a bit on sf.net to find more details about how all this works. You also need to provide your sourceforge user name to the nightly build configuration file. IRC you also need to create a link inside your home directory on sourceforge server like this:

 aros -&gt; /home/groups/a/ar/aros

UNIX-hosted kernel should add its stack area to memory lists now.

Does  anyone  know  what's  wrong?  I just added i386-darwin build to download-descriptions.  I see that binaries are uploaded ok. Even more strange  is  that for example German page failed too, however i didn't change it.
Can anyone help? I'm not familiar with how our web site works.
The page is repaired. Each time you add a new package, the page needs to be rebuild. I'm doing the rebuilds, since automatic rebuilds are long dead. If you add a new package, just mail me to be sure I rebuild the webpage. 

I hit the same problem as 64-bit  Linux-hosted - mmap() allocates memory beyoun 2GB space. And - there's no MAP_32BIT.
Does  anyone know what to do? Is there any workaround/replacement for MAP_32BIT on Darwin and BSD ? 
I  studied  Darwin  documentation,  they use small PIC code model for x86-64  binaries. Looks like this saves them from this problem, and they don't need explicit low memory? 
What  *BSD guys do with this? Or the only thing we can do is changing AROS 64-bit code model? At least for some flavors. I know, this is not good, however perhaps there's no way round. 






====Memory Pooling====

For  such  architectures you could specify small fictional page size. Perhaps   they  could  also  use  another  implementation  of  kernel allocator   (similar   to   current   AllocMem()/FreeMem()).   Current implementation  will  have increased memory usage with small pages (it uses  one UBYTE per page for memory map). Alternate  implementation can store  administrative  information  in  the  managed  memory itself. I didn't  do  this  in my implementation because it allows to completely disable access to all unallocated pages.

If the kernel returns page size of 0, MMU is assumed  to be missing. exec then falls back to MEMCHUNK_TOTAL chunks.
I  hope this is acceptable. With this setting new pools implementation behaves  EXACTLY  in  the  same  way  as  old  one  with threshSize == puddleSize.  I  hope  it's  not  a big loss. I can tweak it further to handle  threshSize,  just  i think it's not really needed. 

Also  i  expect  performance boost in FreePooled(). Can you benchmark this? 

The  rest  will be done in kernel.resource. It will have two versions of  memory  manager:  MMU-aware and MMU-less. MMU-less version will be old  AllocMem()/FreeMem()  implementations from exec. Don't bother for now,  i  already  have an idea and i'll do it myself. 

I  suggest  you to have both versions in m68k port (unless you really want  to save ROM space). Amiga can have 68030 or better, in this case AROS will be able to detect it and make use of it. 

This  is still open to the discussion. I intentionally committed only pools.  If  you  look  carefully, you'll see they still work on top of AllocMem()/FreeMem().  Kernel's  allocator  is  ready  and even works, however i wanted to emerge it all step-by-step. I agree that on such a low level it's rather simple to break something. 

The  idea  behind  the  new  system:  puddle  size  is always integer multiple  of page size. The rest of changes are explained in the code, i  commented it carefully. I hope you'll like some of ideas. It should be faster than the old implementation. 

This  is  done because after this we can assign protection attributes to   pools.   There   can   be   for  example  executable  pools  and non-executable pools. 

Puddle   size   is   integer   multiple   of  page  size.  New kernel.resource allocator is page-based. 

As to  badly  behaved software, perhaps there can be some way to handle  this  in  early  startup  control. Yes, it can be difficult. Still  open  to  experiments. MMU is good, it's not a good idea just to throw it away. 

Missing Zune class Application.mui but it's inside our muimaster.library. Check workbench/libs/muimaster/classes/application.c. its a built-in class. 





====BSD sockets====

/master-linux-i386/bin/linux-i386/AROS/Development/include/sys/socket.h:288:
error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘u_short’

I fear that the same thing will happen for all network software. Can we reconsider this change? 
I would prefer it that default is only POSIX and other legacy UNIX has to be enable by defines. 
I agree that network code should be able to compile without defining __BSD_VISIBLE if no legacy features are used. But it should be done by making our net includes POSIX compliant. 

The software code I worked with actually uses u_char/u_short types. If we remove them completely the code will stop compiling at all. Code using u_char/u_short should need __BSD_VISIBLE define to make it
work to indicate it needs to be made modern. But it should be properly documented in some porting HOWTO. 

I think it would be beneficial for 3rd party devs to have their software compiled without modifications instead of having to search through our headers to learn how to make networking work. 

During my split of I did more separation so it would help if you could wait until that is ported. I did not do much on the net includes yet though. This is put on the TODO as I think it does not have an ABI impact; only compilation impact. BTW: half of the remaining compiling errors with test/cplusplus/headertest.cpp (can be build with make test-cxx) are coming from the net headers or sys/types. 

Can we re-enable defining __BSD_VISIBLE for now until your work is brought to trunk? I would vote at least for V0 branch as it will never be &quot;fixed&quot; by your ABI work. I can live with enabling again only on V0. 

I think it should normally be provided by the 'compile' environment and not in some kind of header file. That's one of the reasons I would like to stick to -D__BSD_VISIBLE. You could try sys/types.h 




====Debugging====

I tested only modList command, seems to work correctly. Please  check  and fix (if needed) the rest. I hope the code is clear enough. Testing with ROM and DISK modules work . modlist lists them, codes lines are resolved, global and local variables are resolved. 


If you talk about PIC and GOT, will this also mean we can have shared objects? 

We may be able to, but please please don't. Don't copy bad design decisions from OS4. OS4 programs using shared objects have the same startup slowness as on other OSes (Linux, Windows, ...). 

+1 , I would really prefer not to mix .so concept with native AROS .library concept. 




Yes, small model assumes both code and data are in the lowest 2GB area. In such case, memory loads and jumps are done as PC-relative, with +-2GB offset from current instruction pointer.

Yes, the other models are:

* medium - code and data resides in lowest memory region, large data may be *anywhere* in the address space 
* large - code and data may reside anywhere in the address space 
* kernel - code and data reside in topmost 2GB of address space 

Please note the code and data location refers to the sections of ELF file. All allocations made by the code itself, as well as stack pointer, may be anywhere in address space for all models. 

I also would like to get an idea of the implications on code size, stack usage, speed etc. of the different code models. 

Additionally  i  can  make  use  of ELFOSABI_AROS definition (ELF ABI number reserved    for    AROS).   However   this   will  impose  a requirement to use AROS version of binutils for linking, Linux ld will not do any more. 

I always would have liked to make AROS programs real ELF programs (with relocation info still present though) but I also think this should be something for ABI V1. 

Ah, come on! We could extend the internalloadseg_elf with ease :-D

+1 for real executables :)

Sure I do ! This was one of the big things I have done in the ABI_V1 branch. The data is stored in an AVL tree. Is this soft of &quot;handled in shared module per caller task storage&quot;. If so, could you point me to the codes in SVN? 

It's done in genmodule. You can have different options for a library. If you don't specify only one libbase is generate and it is returned for each OpenLibrary call. 
If you specify peropenerbase you get a base for each OpenLibrary call. If you specify peridbase a separate base for each task. It takes the Task pointer together with the return addr as id to decide if it needs to generate a new libbase (Like how arosc.library did it before).  It is called peridbase because you could overload the macro that returns an id. I may removed this feature and just name the option pertaskbase when I merge it in the main branch. 


when I click on &quot;Residents&quot; in Scout it crashes. Unfortunately, add-symbol-file doesn't work, so I can't provide a back-trace. (Tested on linux-i386). Scout is build using build_program macro which as I mentioned earlier has problem with providing debugging symbols. 

What you can do is:

* place TARGET_STRIP := $(STRIP)  before the build_program macro line
* once in gdb, first do a loadseg on an address at bottom of stack which will load debuggin symbols for kernel then do bt and again try loading debuggin symbols for top of stack. I noticed that this procedure is sometimes needed with executables (while I never had to do it like this with libraries for example)


try changing line 95-:

    extraoptions=&quot;--bindir=$(CROSSTOOLSDIR)&quot;
to
    extraoptions=&quot;--bindir=$(CROSSTOOLSDIR) --with-gmp=$(CROSSTOOLSDIR)&quot;




====Trac====

After some fighting with Plesk suexec and apache I have now a first setup for trac. You can find it here: http trac stafverhaegen be/trac. You can have a look around. Actually I want to provide it as http trac aros org/trac and you can already to that if you put the IP in your /etc/hosts file (Windows users have find out to do it themselves): 

83.169.4.30    trac aros org

Did install a recent version of trac as the default 0.10.something did not like. 
Currently no login is possible but you can already have a look at the subversion source code browser. This is a static mirror of the main trunk which is not kept in sync ATM. (make a new mirror and sync trac in the future) 

Next things I want to tackle: 

* Login manager setup so that people can register using the login manager trac plugin. As both trac and svn seem to use normal Apache password files other managers could be used. Anybody any good proposal ? 
* Set up svn server so people can access it.

'''MSG''', or monosodium glutamate, is a controversial salt of sodium and the naturally-occurring amino acid [[glutamate]], refined from naturally occurring glutamate. The natural form of glutamate is found in many foods, and when 'free' (not bound to a protein) it enhances savoury flavours, which is called umami in Japanese. MSG is a chemically refined form of glutamate, bound to salt.

Since MSG is a sodium-containing salt, many of the health concerns associated with [[Cookbook:Salt|table salt]] also apply to MSG, but many people have reported additional negative experiences. Some of these apparently-MSG-specific problems are experienced as a short-term 'reaction', whereas most concerns about salt are over a longer time frame. Many authorities disclaim health concerns over MSG, and on the other hand, many consumers of the substance claim first-hand experiences which resound widely. It may therefore be inferred that a certain amount of disinformation or misinformation exists regarding this widely-used product. Care should be taken in evaluating the issues surrounding MSG, and sensitivity provided to those who believe their real negative experiences are caused by the substance, whatever may be the technicalities.

Many people with migraine headaches report MSG as a trigger substance.

The use of MSG can also actually reduce total sodium content in food, because the food may not need as much table salt to taste good. A small amount of MSG might typically reduce salt usage by 20% to 45% without loss of flavour, and this might be seen as a health benefit, if no negative effects occur due to MSG.

Glutamate in some form is found naturally in [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]], in fermented [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] products such as [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]] and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] (1.0%), and especially in [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] extracts like [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]] (1.4%) and [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] (2.0%). Small quantities are also present in [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (1.2%). 

A traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Italian]] meal with tomato sauce and lots of Parmesan cheese can contain far more glutamate than would normally be added as MSG to [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_China|Chinese]] take-out food.{{citation needed}}

Glutamate being produced for refinement into MSG is most-frequently commercially produced via fermentation; the result of this stage of the production process is 100% identical to the glutamate found naturally in many foods. Another path is by hydrolisis of gluten, eg from wheat.

''&quot;The crude glutamic acid produced in this process is then filtered, purified and converted by neutralisation into monosodium glutamate. After additional purification, crystallisation, drying and sieving, monosodium glutamate has the form of pure white crystals ready for packing and use.&quot;'' [http://www.glutamate.org.au/main.html]

Food products sometimes show ingredients like &quot;autolysed yeast&quot; and &quot;hydrolysed protein&quot;, without necessarily using the word MSG or the recognised numeric codes (E621, HS29224220) on the label. These ingredients may in fact contain MSG, or at least free glutamate. There is some confusion as to whether health concerns correlate with free glutamate as well, or just with MSG. It is unlikely that protein-bound glutamate is problematic for the vast majority of people, as this would be absolutely crippling.

MSG often is used by adds extra flavour to snack foods, frozen dinners, and instant meals, for example the seasoning mixtures for instant noodles.

Like [[Cookbook:Salt|table salt]], MSG tends to enhance our perception of other flavours.
MSG is widely used in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian cuisine]] and in [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] recipes. Usage is a pinch of MSG, much the same as with table salt.

==Install to USB Pendrive==

For ease of use, and portability, USB installs are probably the best option for most users. A PDF manual can be found on the [http://vmwaros.blogspot.com/2010/06/create-your-own-icaros-stick.html Icaros Desktop site]. There have been a few attempts to provide an img (image) file ready to write transfer [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=49365#forumpost49365 directly] to a USB drive directly with some/little success. 

[http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6216&amp;post_id=58272 See here for an install guide using Windows XP QEMU]. 


* Good - Sandisk Cruzer Micro 512MB (U3 removed), Sandisk Micro Skin 4GB, Sandisk Cruzer Blade 16GB, Sandisk Cruzer 8GB, Sandisk Micro SD 2GB (couple of wipes needed), Corsair FlashVoyager 4GB, HP Mini Nano, Verbatim, TDK, Buffalo, Emtec C400 8gb, TX Nano+ 4gb, Emtec S300 2gb, PNY Attache 8GB, PNY Attache 16GB (delay booting), 
* Bad  - Maxell 2GB, Nilox UDF140 8 gb, Emtec C250 4gb, Dikom PDS 4gb, Sandisk Cruzer Blade 8GB, Sandisk 8GB micro SDHC in USB adapter, Verbatim PinStripe, 

 The Bad usb pen drive sticks will still work as storage devices though NOT as bootable AROS drives. 



* Set up Partitions 
* Installing to a Partition 
* Booting from that and other partitions 





===Aros Installer===

 make sure '''DU0:''' is selected or else your '''hard drive data''' might vanish instead. 
 In fact, '''to be safe''', always double check these options '''BEFORE''' clicking proceed. 

Start from a clean USB pendrive: no partitions at all, use the wipe option from InstallAROS to clear the USB pendrive 

A few times the existing non-AROS partitions are still there after the wipe. So remove the usb drive, re-insert it and start installAROS again. 

 make sure '''DU0:''' is selected or else your '''hard drive data''' might vanish instead. 
 In fact, '''to be safe''', always double check these options '''BEFORE''' clicking proceed. 

Choose 'only use free space' option from the AROSInstall app. OK. Setup how many partitions needed and note DU0 being displayed 

Before rebooting, open SYS:Tools/HDToolbox and look under usbscsi device to see if a PC-EBR and AROS RDB partition(s) has been created. If not start InstallAROS again which sometimes does the job. 

'Use existing AROS Partitions' 



Things to keep in mind...

* There are additional issues with U3 partitions and other extra/hidden partitions already existing that Sandisk and others in the past have used. They can be [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4036&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=35018#forumpost35018 removed] or '''BETTER''' assign the AROS partition to unit number 1 or higher. 
* Do not under ANY circumstances change the name of the boot volume or the install won't work 
* using default install selecting usbscsi.device and unit 0 or 1 - needs to match the physical unit number see HDToolBox to investigate 
* don't try Freedroid or any SDL program whilst making your USB stick as it causes the whole machine to freeze/slow. 
* You may need to use this [http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-192053-unable-to-format-my-micro-sd-card-2gb utility] to recover a damaged corrupted usb drive or use the HP [http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;swItem=MTX-UNITY-I23839&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN boot utility]. Please note these have not been tested under Windows and should be virus checked before use. 





Before installing AROS, you may want to add a [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=5188&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=47628#forumpost47628 FAT16] or FAT32 partition, to aid copying files between various operating systems... 

1. boot windows or use Linux GParted (Primary Partition Fat32) 

2. right click on My Computer, choose Manage &gt; System &gt; Disk management.

3. Click on the pendrive's blank space

4. create a small FAT volume on it (0.5 to 1Gb), and quick format it in simple FAT mode




If a FAT Partition is not required...

1. boot into AROS from a CD and then plug in the USB pendrive. 

2. Double click with the mouse on AROSInstall on the screen 

3. Choose Use Free Space with arrow keys or mouse 

4. Change IDE option to '''USB'''. To the right, '''usbscsi''' device should now show  (DH0: should change to '''DU0:''')

5. choose to create a new AROS partition, create a 500MB partition for nightlies or a 2GB+ partition for Icaros (for example a small DU0: for sys: and larger DU1: for Extras:) 

7. reboot when required - AROS will load again - make sure that a desktop icon with a name of '''Aros''' shows

8. launch AROSInstall again by double clicking with left mouse button, choose use existing aros partitions, if DU1: created tick choose use Work: partition for

You can have four primary partitions, or three primaries and one extended. The extended can be split into up to more than 60 logical partitions, the amount supported is OS dependent. These are the rules that Microsoft created, and that MS-DOS implemented. Microsoft OSes will not allow you to create another extended partition if there is already an extended partition in the MBR. 

An example of finished stick with 2 FAT partitions and unallocated on Unit 0 or other higher numbers if more than 1 device tethered 
&lt;pre&gt; 
* primary Fat32 Partition Table: PC-MBR  Partition Type: Win95 FAT32 
* primary Fat32 Partition Table: PC-MBR  Partition Type: Win95 FAT32 
* unallocated  
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Using AROSInstall turns the rest of the unallocated space into an extended partition to save losing more PC-MBR slots (max 3 or 4) 
&lt;pre&gt;
* partition Partition Table: PC-EBR and using a Partition Type: Extended 
     partition with Partition Table: RDB (rigid disk block) and using a Partition Type: AROS RDB Partition Table 
         DU0: Partition Table: Unknown Partition Type: SFS BE filesystem - Switches Bootable and Automount 
         DU1: Partition Table: Unknown Partition Type: SFS BE filesystem - Switches Automount 
     Unallocated if all the space within the extended partition is not used 
&lt;/pre&gt; 




===Manually via HDtoolBox===


* Physical media device e.g. Hard Disk, usb, etc 
* Partition table types (either UEFI newest or MBR old) 
* Partitions - however many sub disks you need and the sizes can vary up to the size of the physical media 
* Filesystem - usually NTFS (windows), ext3 / ext4 (Linux) or hfs+ Journaled (Mac OSX) and SFS on AROS 
* Files - your stuff 


Read more [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=7864&amp;forum=4&amp;post_id=77257 here] and [http://reziztanzia.free.fr/Aros/Doc/aros-qemu-hardfile.html here]. 

If an icon does not show on the desktop after using InstallAros, you will be left with the only option using HDToolBox. 

[[File:HDToolBox1.png|thumb|Open HDToolBox and click on usbscsi device ie USB drive]]

Double click on sys:Tools/HdToolBox and you are presented with two windows - left hand side (LHS) the drives and to the right (RHS) information regarding the drives. 

In the left hand side window (LHS) double click on usbscsi.device and it will change to show the Units (could show as the name of the device) that are available, click one of these to show the Partitions already on the drive. 

[[File:HDToolBox2.png|thumb|Select Correct Unit]]

There can be three 'layers' of Partitions - top layer is primary/extended partitions, followed by another lot in the extended one and finally within that are the DH0: DH1: (hard disk)  DU0: DU1: (usb stick pen drive) 

[[File:HDToolBox3.png|thumb|See Partitions top layer]]
[[File:HDToolBox4.png|thumb|See Aros Partition ie the next layer]]

So selecting the right layer. Select the last Partition and click on the '''Add Entry''' button below. Add Entry presents a window with four conditions along the top - Unselected Empty, Selected Empty, Unselected Used, Selected Used and a long track underneath with represents the total storage capacity available and this is where the above four states are shown in various positions on the device according to how you setup 

select the empty space (usually to the right) on the long track and click '''OK'''

'''* Partition 0''' 

don't worry about it showing another partition 0 as it gets renamed when you save later. 

select it and choose '''Resize/Move''' button if the partition is of the incorrect measurement - click on the partition on the long track that needs resizing and change the size in gigabytes G on the lower RHS gadget and press return (typical MUI behavior). The track information should change to indicate the correct partition size. Click OK. 

'''* S Partition 0''' shows that something has changed or amended 

Select the new partition 0 and Click '''Create Table''' and click on one selection of RDB, PC-MBR or PC-EBR. Highlight one and click OK 

* If PC-MBR primary chosen for FAT32 partitions (limit of 3 or 4 slots) 
* If PC-EBR extended chosen for AROS partitions to save running out of PC-MBR 'spaces' 
* If RDB Amiga/AROS special, select 'Change Type' button and select AROS RDB Partition Table 

Click '''Change Type''' for the filesystem used on this partition and a requester shows with type already set to 0x30 (Aros Installer default). It needs to be changed to 0x2f in the lower zune (mui) text box ie SFS BE (Smart File System) partition, press return/enter key and click OK 

* Old Filesystem
* Fast Filesystem 
* Fast Filesystem (intl)
* Smart Filesystem BE (PowerPC Amiga etc) 
* Smart Filesystem LE (IBM PCs) 
select SFS BE for historic reasons 

Go up a level - Click '''Rename''' if DH0 is not the correct device (used quite often). 

If you need to go to the top of the left hand side window where there are '''two white ..''' or the '''Parent''' button 
which means going up in terms of information (ie. Partitions (DU0, AROS, PC) -&gt; Units (Named) -&gt; Devices Driver #?.device) 

Click on '''Switches''' button and tick 
* '''Active''' for partition table use usually (usually on the primary/extended layer ie not used often) 
* '''Automount''' for most DH? or DU? and '''Bootable''' used on one DH0 or DU0 only - then click on OK 

Selecting back to the usbscsi.device or Units display info but not '''double clicking''' will allow the '''Save Changes''' box to become available. Save Changes. 



The new partition is not automatically formatted. Open a shell (right win key and w) - type assign to see if one or more USBSCSIxPy has been set up (take a note of the x and y are numbers). 

format DEVICE USBSCSIxPy: Name Aros QUICK 

assign DU?: USBSCSIxPy: 
'''?''' in the amiga world represents a character (in this case a number) just like dos and linux use '''*''' 



'''Summary''' 

Usual sequence of Button pressings = Add Entry - Resize/Move - Create Table - Change Type - Rename - Switches 

* Partition Table - needed for most 'Add Entry' except the last bit adding devices DH0, DH1, DH2, DU0, DU1, DU2 etc 
* Partitions - auto set depending on how many 'Add Entry' made 
* Partition Type - needed for each 'Add Entry' 
* Active - set one partition (usually PC-EBR which usually includes the AROS RDB Partition Table one) 
* Bootable - for your DH0 or DU0 via Switches button 
* Autoboot - for all your DH? or DU? via Switches button (? in this case represents a number starting from 0) 


Add RDB Table partition 

Add Entry - Create Table - Change Type - Switches



Add AROS Partitions 

Add Entry - Resize/Move - Change Type - Rename - Switches





===Grub4DOS===

grub4dos can already boot the kernel via the floppy image 

&lt;pre&gt;
title AROS
find --set-root --ignore-floppies /boot/aros-pc-i386.img
map --mem /boot/aros-pc-i386.img (fd0)
map --hook
chainloader (fd0)+1
rootnoverify (fd0)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As soon as the fat-handler is romable all you would have to do is extract to a fat usb drive and use grub4dos. :) 



Unfortunately, that (making a 'stock' USB image) doesn't work for many systems:

* USB flash drives with hardcoded geometries
* USB flash drives that are no-MBR, FAT only - they exist, and they turn into little bricks if you put on a MBR or NTFS - SanDisk Industrial CF devices used to do this too.
* USB flash drives with wear levelling logic that only works if they are FAT formatted - These are even more fun. They seem all fast and speedy when using FAT, but go very slow with any other FS. - And they wear out faster.






==Installing to Hard Disc==


* Set up Partitions 

* Installing to a Partition 

* Booting from that and other partitions 



=== EFI GPT based Partitions ===

 Inside the EFI firmware - Boot from UEFI to Legacy   or   Security -&gt; Secure Boot SB disabled and CSM Legacy enabled and reboot 

Press ESC or F2 or F10 or Del depending on the hardware to gain entry into the EFI. Please check that Secure Boot can be disabled and CSM enabled. 


DO NOT USE at the moment - WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP) 

There has been no time to complete GPT partition table handling (it's currently read-only, you can install AROS onto a GPT partition but you have to use 3rd party tools to partition the drive). Writing GPT is currently enabled, but DO NOT TRY THIS. It WILL destroy your partition table!!! CRC and backup table are not updated!!!

With the introduction of the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ie EFI v2) specification based hardware around 2012 which replaced older computers based on the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) boot and its associated MBR (Master Boot Record). 

The EFI brought GUID Partition table (GPT) based partitions which Windows(TM) 7 and 8 now use. 
AROS had an update to the partition.library to support &quot;GUID Partition Table&quot; format disks added by Sonic Amiga in 2011/12. 

GUID should not to be confused with UUID in linux. 


* MBR legacy from the MS-DOS days 
* UEFI spec 


GPT does not have primary and logical (and therefore extended) partitions, but just partitions (if choosing the partition type gpt) 



Grub does not understand GPT partition tables and needs to be tricked into starting from one. You need to create a very small partition at the start of your disk to hold the grub stage2, (or stage1.5 if you would like to start stage2 from /boot). 

Grub should store its configuration data on the EFI System Partition (ESP) aka EFI boot partition (type EF00). 
If your computer came with Windows pre-installed, an ESP should already exist, and you can use it in AROS and Linux. If not, create an ESP of around 550MiB or little more in size. Create a FAT32 filesystem on it and give the partition a &quot;boot flag.&quot;  

Although partition sizes are no longer an issue (greater than 128GB), the filesystem size limitations (SFS) now come into play. 

Boot Manager and Boot loader functions are usually both covered by the latest [http://devil-detail.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/install-grub2-on-gpt-disk-dedicated-partition.html GRUB], [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB2 GRUB2], [http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/index.html rEFInd] or [http://www.blinkenlights.ch/ccms/linux/ux21a.html Elilo] 

NB. You need a BIOS boot partition for a BIOS native install to GPT. You need an EFI system partition for a UEFI native install. You don’t need either for a BIOS native install to MBR. You never need both. 



If you install windows 7 or 8 from DVD media onto a fresh unpartitioned disk it will convert your HDD to GPT partition table and dual boot will be almost impossible... (or will give you a lot of headache) to avoid this, dump the win7 iso to an usb using Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool or have the disk setup as bios/mbr partitions first. Installing from USB should not change the hdd into a GPT partition table based partitions. 

As a last resort, a protected MBR allows booting from a legacy BIOS, and and protects GPT from GPT-unaware utilities (such as fdisk) 
NB. Choose the option to create a new partition table. Choose MSDOS from the list. Hit ok than apply/commit all changes. 
'''ATTENTION''' this will erase all your data and MS Windows (or any other OS) will disappear from your hard disk. Your HDD is now converted from GPT to MSDOS (MBR type). You can now boot your preferred distro, create your partition scheme in the old way. This could possibly void your warranty, so check with the hardware vendor first. 


DB DBX and SB (KEK and PK) options are not signed allocated keys options for AROS yet due to Microsoft(TM) Revenue generating fee. 






=== BIOS boot and MBR based Legacy Partitions ===

 Best '''NOT''' to use WIPE with other partitions on a hard drive 

Usually a hard drive needs to be partitioned (i.e. make space available within a hard drive's capacity) for any operating system (OS) to be installed. '''But''' AROS requires that 5GB, 10GB or more are left '''unpartitioned''' i.e. empty at the end of the drives' capacity. You do '''NOT''' have to create partitions, the installer will do that automatically. SFS filesystem that AROS currently uses has a partition size limit of 120GB but it can be anywhere on a larger hard drive with other partitions. 

The [https://sites.google.com/site/arosaspireone/installation AROSInstall] program, using free space option, has also on its' first page an option tick to set up a Work (DH1:) partition. Then a reboot. On the first page again, select use AROS partitions. After the bootblock, locales and other dev packages tick page, there is another page with two/three tick options for using/installing/formatting to Work (DH1:). '''Please''' read these pages carefully to use properly.  

An alternative is to use Linux to create the partitions, you can skip the RDB and create two primary/logical partitions for AROS in Linux with type 2F hex. The partitions will be called &quot;ATAxPy:&quot; in AROS, where x is the ata.device unit number and y is the partition number. The AROS shell command &quot;Assign DEVICES&quot; will show you their names so you won't have to guess. 

Created First partition ( 20 GB ) on SDA1 , with 0x2F ID. Zeroed under linux ( dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 ) to be sure to destroy any data on this partition.

Boot Icaros ( 1.3.x ) release and did the following : 

Checked partition ready in system - open a shell and assign, and saw a partition called 'ATA0P0'. 

 format DRIVE ATA0P0: name Aros QUICK

 assign DH0: ATA0P0: 

And launched the installer and installed the basic system. Did a reboot and checked that all files are there. 




====One Hard Disk Drive====

If the whole hard drive is one big windows partition, then a partition utility can be used to shrink the partition down in size. '''Care''' must be taken or you take the risk of rendering the drive inoperable especially with Windows Vista.  If you are in any doubt, do not change anything or maybe think about an USB drive install instead. 

For XP, you just right click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and choose Manage &gt; storage &gt; disk management, then resize the XP partition. Leave some free unpartitioned space at the end of the drive, say 10 or 20 GBs, and AROS will use it for its own partition when you'll install it. Other examples are gparted in Linux and [http://www.vistarewired.com/2007/02/16/how-to-resize-a-partition-in-windows-vista Vista Resize]. 




====Two or more Hard Disk Drives====

In my case I had to use the &quot;drivemap&quot; command and &quot;chainloading&quot; because my configuration is: 

&lt;pre&gt;
- Bios-Booting hard-disk - first partition = AROS
- 2nd hard-disk - first partition = Windows XP 
&lt;/pre&gt;

First of all I found odd but if you have a hard-disk on the 2nd IDE channel, but is set as first boot device on BIOS, grub will see it as &quot;(hd0,1)&quot; = first hard-disk. 

So, since Windows doesn't like to be booted from a 2nd hard-disk, I had to use command &quot;drivemap -s (hd0) (hd1) as described above. 

An example entry in Grub.cfg is: 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Windows XP-SP3 ENG&quot; { 
drivemap -s (hd0) (hd1) 
insmod chain 
insmod ntfs 
set root=(hd1,1) 
chainloader +1 
} 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that even after using the &quot;drivemap&quot; command to swap the drives, the Windows hard-disk is still seen as (hd1,1) = 2nd hard-disk, first partition. 

To check how your hard-disk partitions are seen by grub you can simply enter in command-line mode and type &quot;ls&quot; command to list all partitions, then &quot;ls (hd1,1)&quot; for example to see the information on the partition.

There are ways to editing the bios every time, but it's much faster and nice to select the OS on Grub menu IMHO. Most old MB Bioses do have a boot-menu pressing F8 or F12 at boot time, but you can choose only HD, removable devices (CD-ROM) or network boot, and if you choose hard-disk, it won't let you choose which one, taking always the first-ide channel. 

Read [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/ more here] or Double-click on InstallAROS application icon (then read the Icaros [http://www.icarosdesktop.com/icarosfiles/IcarosDesktop_manual.pdf manual])!! and here

=== Errors ===

 VESA display options do not have scrolling debug output though 

Once AROS is installed, you may need to edit the grub boot option. It is found in SYS:boot/grub/grub.cfg.  Or you can use the cursor/arrow keys on the boot screen to move up and down. Press e to edit. Ctrl and X to exit. 

To check how your hard-disk partitions are seen by grub you can simply enter in command-line mode and type &quot;ls&quot; command to list all partitions, then &quot;ls (hd1,1)&quot; for example to see the information on the partition.

====Unknown root partition - Error 100====

Getting a &quot;Could Not Open Root Partition&quot;, &quot;Unknown Error 100&quot; when trying to install Aros.

* Some Sandisk 8GB and 16GB were a problem until you deleted the FAT partition already on the usb drive (did not work if resizing) and using another partition creator (like Linux GParted) to create a new Primary Fat32 partition. Afterwards, AROSInstall would then create the PC Extended AROS RDB partitions correctly. Icaros 1.3 can only install to one partition but 1.4 should install to dual partitions. 
* If the partitions have been created with Windows(TM), please use ArosInstaller. It is Aros Installer that gives the error. That happens when the unit number is wrong. You can use HDToolBox to find out the correct unit number (although InstallAROS should be able to figure it out by itself in theory: maybe your RAID set-up is confusing it). Another reason could be that a partition editor like linux gparted or dos PartitionMagic has created a moveable? 1mb partition which is confusing the partition numbering system. It could also be that the partitions can no longer be detected. Check with a LiveCD of Linux or Haiku and use [http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download TestDisk] with '''care''' to investigate. 
* Sounds like AROS doesn't detect your HD. Add the option debug=memory to the GRUB config, and then when you boot, run &quot;Tools/Debug/Bifteck to T:boot.log&quot; in a shell. If you can, post the log to Aros-Exec (e.g. put it on a USB flash drive); if you can't get it off your AROS PC, just post some of the &quot;[ATA]&quot; lines from it.
* Also, does your AROS GRUB entry have &quot;enableusb&quot;? Without this any USB is not setup. 
* There's probably a bug or incompatibility in ata.device then. The only potential short-term fix I can suggest is to try setting the drive to SATA mode in the BIOS.




====DMA Error====

&lt;pre&gt;
Volume 'AROS' (DH0: ata.device, unit 0)

There was an error while accessing this volume:
DMA error. The transferring of data to/from the device failed. 

Errorcode = 41
io_Command = 49152
io_Offset = 239738880
io_Length = 8192
io_Actual = 0
&lt;/pre&gt;


* Try ATA=32bit,nodma or ATA=nodma on the grub boot line (e to edit and Ctrl-X to reboot).

====No bootable media==== 

* Try a reboot (nearly always works) 
* press space bar whilst booting, try all the boot options, including booting without a startup-sequence 
* use a CD or DVD boot disc to access the drive (especially with usb drives - unplug and plug in again) 
* or as a last resort, reinstall grub either through the AROSInstaller (make sure that only the Boot Block Loader is ticked) or manually below (best avoided unless you know what you are doing)

===Grub 2===

for others with grub2, i.e. grub 1.97 or later, you must edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-11-generic&quot; {
set root=(hd0,x)
linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-11-generic root=UUID=6f78a220-070b-4d52-81d1-3361818bc614 ro quiet splash
initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.27-11-generic
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace UUID with your system's own unique number. You will have to write it down before hand or use Linux LiveCD to look it up from Linux grub menu entry (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) There you will find also the correct kernel version of your Linux installation.

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Newer Puppy x.xx&quot; {
set root=(hd0,x)
linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3 ro vga=normal 
initrd /boot/initrd.img
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Take a look at this [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4230&amp;forum=24&amp;post_id=36911#forumpost36911 thread] or this [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3511&amp;forum=24&amp;post_id=29554#forumpost29554 one]



===Grub 1 not used much now===

In the root partition you have a directory called /boot in there are the files needed to boot Linux. You have to add an entry in grub config file, for grub1 version 0.97, it's /boot/grub/menu.lst) pointing to these files..

&lt;pre&gt;
title Fedora
root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6 ro root=/dev/sda1 rhgb quiet
initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.img
&lt;/pre&gt;

title you put whatever your want 
root (hd0,0) is important it specifies what disk and partition to use
hd0,0 means 1st harddisk, 1st partition e.g. it could have been (hd1,0) (2nd harddisk, 1st partition) 
then the kernel line it points to a file in /boot called vmlinuz-something (something=version)
same for initial image ram-disk (initrd) if you see you have such file in /boot - it's not always the case..

&lt;pre&gt;
title Old Puppies 1.9 with old 2.4.x kernels
root (hd0,5)
chainloader +1
&lt;/pre&gt;





====Linux====

Having installed Linux first (Ubuntu, etc.), you will find installing AROS next will replace the linux installed grub boot and will no longer show Linux as an option. 

One option to get around this is to install the boot (grub, lilo, etc) on the Linux Partition itself (root) rather than to the MBR. Let AROS install to the MBR as it always does and set root and chainloader +1 to get to the Linux boot options. It does lead to two boot options being made rather than one. 

To check how your hard-disk partitions are seen by grub you can simply enter in command-line mode and type &quot;ls&quot; command to list all partitions, then &quot;ls (hd1,1)&quot; for example to see the information on the partition as well as the UUID. 



====Haiku====

After Haiku has installed and bootmon (not used)?... Install AROS and add the following to  /boot/grub/grub.cfg - changing the x in hd(0,x) to a number that matches your partition holding Haiku. 
(Ctrl-C then ls at grub boot edit) 

for others with grub2, i.e. grub 1.97 or later, you must edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Haiku&quot; {
set root=(hd0,x)
chainloader +1
}
&lt;/pre&gt;




====Windows 2000====

After installing Win2k no grub entry is shown after an AROS install, so add the following to  /boot/grub/grub.cfg - changing the x in hd(0,x) to a number that matches your partition holding Windows. (Ctrl-C then ls at grub boot edit) 

for others with grub2 (i.e. grub 1.97 or later) you must edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Windows 2000&quot; {
set root=(hd0,x)
chainloader +1
}
&lt;/pre&gt;




====FreeDOS====

After installing FreeDOS no grub entry is shown after an AROS install, so add the following to  /boot/grub/grub.cfg  - changing the x in hd(0,x) to a number that matches your partition holding FreeDOS. (Ctrl-C then ls at grub boot edit). FreeDOS only likes primary partitions (1-3 or 4). No later logical partitions supported.  

for others with grub2, i.e. grub 1.97 or later, you must edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;FreeDOS&quot; {
set root=(hd0,x)
chainloader +1
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If FreeDOS is on another drive 
&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry “FreeDOS on Other Drive (hd1,1) {
drivemap (hd0) (hd1)
drivemap (hd1) (hd0)
set root=(hd0)
chainloader  (hd1,1)+1
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Other partitions booting using grub2 needs parttool

 parttool PARTITION COMMANDS

&lt;pre&gt;
#hide a partition (&quot;hide&quot; as it was in grub legacy grub1)
parttool (hd0,3) hidden+

#unhide a partition (&quot;unhide&quot; as it was in grub legacy grub1)
parttool (hd0,4) hidden-

#make a partition active (&quot;makeactive&quot; in grub legacy)
parttool (hd0,4) boot+

#remove active flag from a partition
parttool (hd0,3) boot-
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Kids Operating System&quot; {
insmod chain
insmod ntfs
parttool (hd0,2) hidden-
parttool (hd0,1) hidden+
parttool (hd0,5) hidden+
set root= (hd0,2)
search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 9A18464D18462919
chainloader +1
}
&lt;/pre&gt;




==Setup AROS within a LINUX install==

=== EFI GPT Partition ===

TO DO 



=== GRUB ===

Normal Linux grub cannot recognize amiga (ffs/sfs) filesystems.
But you can put AROS-kernel (aros-pc-i386.gz) and other .gz files to the place, where grub can find it. e.g. copy boot/aros-pc-i386.gz from AROS-cd to /boot directory (on a Linux partition). Now come tricky part, edit grub configuration file. 


====Grub 1 (0.97)====


'''Icaros 2.x 




'''Icaros 1.5.x and below... 

copy the .gz files from AROS's boot drawer/directory to Linux partiton's boot directory and take a 
look in linux's /boot/grub/ directory, if there is menu.lst file then your grub is version 1 

edit menu.lst in linux's boot/grub/ and add the following lines 

&lt;pre&gt;
title Icaros Desktop (VESA best fit, true colour, floppy disabled)
root (hdXXX,YYY)
kernel /boot/aros-pc-i386.gz vesa=32bit ATA=32bit floppy=disabled
boot
&lt;/pre&gt;

or since September 2011 
&lt;pre&gt;
title Icaros Desktop (VESA best fit, true colour, floppy disabled)
root (hdXXX,YYY)
kernel /boot/bootstrap-pc-i386.gz vesa=32bit ATA=32bit floppy=disabled
boot
&lt;/pre&gt;

XXX is hard drive number, (start at 0).
and YYY is the Linux root partition number (start at 0).
example first drive,second partition = root (hd0,1)


'''or''' if you are using 2011 module boot grub (i.e. loads of .mod files in that directory) 

&lt;pre&gt;
title Icaros Desktop (VESA best fit, true colour, floppy disabled)
root (hdXXX,YYY)
kernel /boot/aros-pc-i386.gz vesa=32bit ATA=32bit floppy=disabled nomonitors
module /boot/aros-kernel-pc-i386.gz
module /boot/aros-usb-pc-i386.gz
boot
&lt;/pre&gt;

or after August 2011
&lt;pre&gt;
title Icaros Desktop (VESA best fit, true colour, floppy disabled)
root (hdXXX,YYY)
kernel /boot/bootstrap-pc-i386.gz vesa=32bit ATA=32bit floppy=disabled nomonitors
module /boot/aros-kernel-pc-i386.gz
module /boot/aros-usb-pc-i386.gz
boot
&lt;/pre&gt;


====Grub 2 (1.97 and later)====


'''Icaros 2.x 

use the original grub.cfg file. That file has menu entries that uses the correct locations.

Since the list of modules to be loaded is almost 7 feet long, wanted to refrain from mentioning them as they can be copied form the original grub.cfg 

The 'trick' is in loading the AROS-partions and sfs module into grub 2, so that the AROS partition can be accessed.

When setting the root you'll do just that and be able to 'load' the rest of the required modules from there.

( So, the first 3 lines in the menu entry from that example should be working, and the rest should be copied from an icaros grub.cfg file, so that the correct locations are being used).

At least that is how we recently got things working for someone on irc (i got some help from one of our dragons in aiding the person).

Problem is that i know nothing about burg, and if it's capable of loading these modules (if even present). Assuming it can not, the only other option that i know of is chain-loading into grub 2 (and again i have no clue as of how Burg can do that, and/or if even possible with burg).




'''Icaros 1.5.x and below... 

If grub is version 1.97 or so (it is GRUB2)
edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add lines: ( Look example from aros-cd boot/grub/grub.cfg )

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;Icaros Desktop 1.2&quot; {
set root=(hd0,5)
multiboot /boot/bootstrap-pc-i386 vesa=32bit ATA=32bit floppy=disabled root=/dev/sda3
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



or with 2011 module (.mod) based grub boot 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;AROS (true colour VESA graphics: 1024x768)&quot; {
    multiboot /boot/bootstrap-pc-i386.gz vesa=1024x768 ATA=32bit floppy=disabled nomonitors
    module /boot/aros-kernel-pc-i386.gz
    module /boot/aros-usb-pc-i386.gz
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

or 

&lt;pre&gt;
menuentry &quot;AROS (native graphics)&quot; {
insmod part_amiga
insmod sfs
set root='(hd1,msdos5,amiga1)'
multiboot /boot/bootstrap-pc-i386.gz gfx=hidd.gfx.nouveau lib=DRIVERS:nouveau.hidd ATA=32bit floppy=disabled debug=serial 
module /boot/aros-kernel-pc-i386.gz
module /boot/aros-usb-pc-i386.gz
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


Take a look at this [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4338&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=38055#forumpost38055 thread]. 







==ISO Image==


===QEmu Install===

Icaros Full and Light have a QEmu setup included within. 


 qemu-img create icaros.img 40968M

 qemu -cdrom icaros.img -hda icaros.img -m 256 -boot d

 qemu -hda /whereever/AROS/image/kept/icaros.img -m 384

 -net nic,model=e1000
 -net nic,model=rtl8139
 -net nic,model=ne2k_pci

 -soundhw es1370 
 -soundhw all

If you don't hear any sound in QEMU 0.10.x, you'll have to set QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=fmod (available: dsound; fmod; sdl; none ; wav (dump to file) - see QEMU documentation for information. 

Have used as complete Qemu start command, which have worked for most operating systems 

 qemu -no-quit -smp 1 -m 512M -soundhw all -usb -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user



For older QEmus 

 $ qemu-img create AROS.img 2G
 $ qemu-system-i386 -cdrom  distfiles/aros-pc-i386.iso -serial stdio -m 1024 -hda AROS.img 



To make sure your keyboard is set correctly make sure that the corresponding values are like the ones below:

 Keyboard=en-us
 KeyboardIndex=5

Should you find that some of your keys do not work or &quot;press&quot; the wrong key (in particular, the arrow keys), you likely need to specify your keyboard layout as an option. The keyboard layouts can be found in /usr/share/qemu/keymaps.

 qemu -k [keymap] [disk_image]



PS: if QEMU can see your C:\ drive as a FAT device, you can mount it on AROS. But you've better using ftp.

launch qemu
install IcAROS on a virtual hard drive of Qemu
enter prefs/ConfigIP
choose &quot;manual configuration&quot;
change AROS IP address according to your local network/machine
save and reboot
launch FileZilla on Windows
configure a entry for the IcAROS machine (use active transfers mode)
transfer file to/from AROS

IcAROS has a special place (PUB:) for handling files. The ftp server is on the AROS side, it's loaded at boot time and accepts connection to the PUB: directory. Use this place to keep your files and then move 'em wherever you want. If you want to get files FROM AROS, just place 'em in PUB: launch FileZilla on windows and get 'em with it.




====Issues====

absolutely do not use usb-hubs, usb-switches etc. also try all usb-ports. Remove as much devices from same usb header as possible.

You could also try usb-legacy mode in bios.

If you have done all of that and it still does not work than you are one of the unlucky people that have a problem with usb-support for your usb-device and/or chipset 

The 32bit.bat file contains the -usb switch. But that's not nearly enough to have Icaros give you access to the usb stick. The switch won't automount or do anything to your plugged in usb stick. It doesn't appear, whether you plug it before, after qemu starts, after or before you reach workbench, whatever. Qemu won't autoload the usb that's connected, worst, Kqemu doesn't solve or optimize that whatsoever.

===VMWARE Install===

Create a new virtual machine with
&lt;pre&gt;
1 core processor
256 mb ram minimum
6 gb IDE hardfile
&quot;other&quot; OS type
&lt;/pre&gt;
mount Icaros Live CD/DVD iso image as a CD/DVD unit and install it as you would on a real machine

If you do not have a server version of vmware this link will be useful:

http://vmcreator.com/

It will create a .vmx file of the desired size and attributes. You use it as main disk and install AROS on there. 

This [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=3316&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC link] will help setting up the network. 

just read the Icaros Desktop manual: a DETAILED how to is already available there. You just have to change &quot;insert DVD&quot; with &quot;mount DVD ISO in VmWare&quot; when required.





===Sun Virtual Box Install===

VirtualBox emulates a system, so your current machine's hardware is not important. Specific emulated machine hardware can be set in VirtualBox config, but the default values should work. 

Please do not use any existing VBox VE images, just create a 2Gb+ disk drive and boot the CD/DVD image and install from there. To install the ISO, use the wizard of VBox. By creating a new virtual machine and an empty HDD (I've used a 5Gb HDD and it's far from being full), then mount the cd image of Icaros in VBox and boot your system (for &quot;mounting&quot; i mean select the disc image from your VBox' virtual cd/dvd drive)

====Issues====

A P4 system, most definitely, does not have the virtualisation support i.e. slow. Most later CPUs (2006+) often needed a bios setting manually enabled for core2duos or athlon x2s to do hardware virtualization. They were shipped with it disabled. This provides faster running speed but not better compatibility. 

Booting issues try disabling DMA from the GRUB's command line, it is known to cause several issues with virtualbox's IDE. 


[http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#id2684797 Here] is the information to set custom screen resolution. 
VboxManage is actually a tool located in the installation folder of VirtualBox, you need to launch it from a command prompt with the above parameters in one line, changing &quot;VM name&quot; with the name of your virtual machine. The .xml file will be auto-magically updated then, no need to manual edit it.

 VBoxManage setextradata &quot;VM name&quot; &quot;CustomVideoMode1&quot; &quot;1400x1050x16&quot;

 VBoxManage list vms

To add the resolution:

 VBoxManage setextradata &quot;AROS Broadway&quot; &quot;CustomVideoMode1&quot; &quot;1920x1200x32&quot;

 VBoxManage startvm &quot;Icaros Desktop&quot;

Then in AROS, I edited AROS:boot/grub/grub.cfg - I just copied an existing entry and changed it to 1920x1200 and made sure ATA=32bit,nodma 



The hang while booting AROS on VirtualBox 4.0.0 seems to be caused by the timer hardware emulation (again!) rather than anything ATA specific. ata_InitBus() asks timer.device to wait for 100us but it never finishes. 
However, AROS programs the oldstyle PIT controller in a dynamic way, a way which new virtualbox don't like as it seems. VBox boots again if timer 0 is set to mode 0 or 3. I haven't tried this on real hardware yet though. 


If you just want to exchange files between AROS and windows, use the following set up:
* attached to : Host Only adapter
* name : VirtualBox Host only adapter
* Adapter : PCnet-FastIII (Am79C973)
* MAC adress : ?????????????

In AROS choose HDCP and Use FileZila client from windows and Icaros default configuration for the FTP server. 






===Microsoft Virtual PC===

still being tested...







==Floppy==


===Writing===

To create the boot floppy, you will need to download the disk images from the download page, extract the archive, and write the boot image to a floppy disk. If you are using a UNIX-like operating system (such as Linux or FreeBSD), you can do this with the following command:

 cd AROS-i386-pc

 dd if=aros-boot.img of=/dev/fd0

If you are using Windows, you will need to get rawrite to write the image to a floppy. Please see the documentation of rawrite for information on how to use it.



===Booting===

Simply insert the boot floppy into the drive and reboot the computer. When disk access stops and the screen is blank, replace the boot floppy with the system floppy (you can also insert a boot CD at this point if your PC has trouble booting directly from CD). If everything works you should see a nice screen after a while.

==Technical==

Although there are many partitioning schemes, PC-MBR (4 partitions, or 3 plus 1 extended), Amiga RDB, or 68k/PPC Apple Partition Map. AROS uses a dedicated PC-MBR partition 'slot' containing something like amiga RDB as the first sector, with several partitions/filesystems inside (FreeBSD style...). Consequently, Linux can't normally read AROS FFS partitions because they're not contained directly in an MBR partition. However, there is a patch around for the Linux kernel to make this possible. Alternatively, you can create MBR partitions of type 0x2e and 0x2f in Linux to make FFS and SFS partitions. These will be named ATAxPy: in AROS, where x is the drive number and y is the partition number (both start at zero).

The installer should never overwrite any existing MBR primary or logical partitions, but it won't set up Linux in its Grub menu. If asked to install Grub, the installer will overwrite the MBR, but you can always save it beforehand of course.



I want to create the Aros partition for the installation with an external app. Like Acronis Disk Director.

I create an 0x30 type unformated partition, then on the Aros installer I use &quot;Use existing AROS Partition&quot; and ata.device unit 0 for the bootloader (I type ata.device myself it doesn't have it there already) and then the installation fails, with Aros installer asking me for volume DH0.

The x30 partition is a virtual harddrive for AROS. You still need to create an AROS partition table (a.k.a. RDB) and AROS partitions on this virtual drive. HDToolbox is the tool to use for that. You could have created the x30 partition with HDToolbox, too. Would have saved you one time booting with Acronis.



I am trying to figure out how to create more than 2 partitions on my fresh Icaros install. Is this supposed to be working at the moment? The reason I ask this: I had 3 partitions in the past, but after some update, the third partition became &quot;invisible&quot;. I could only see it when I booted a CD with an old version.

Now, with my fresh install on my 60 GB hard disk, I created a 4 GB dh0: and 10 GB dh1: partition in order to create a third partition for my data afterwards. But hdtoolbox tells me that there is no more free space next to dh0: and dh1:. I could add another &quot;partition 0&quot; one level higher, but I can't save the changes. Any ideas?

It can be done without reinstall. The trick was to resize the RDB partition table with hdtoolbox. After that, I was able to add another partition to it. Care should be taken though. 

After partitioning with the installer, it should also be possible to create a second RDB table within the extended partition. I tried that, but the partition was also named &quot;partition 0&quot; and I was not able to rename it. I also couldn't create partitions in it. 




Relabel does not rename the partition, it only renames the volume. In order to rename the partition, you need to run HDtoolbox, find the partition and enter a different name, then reboot.

The name displayed on the desktop is the volume name, though. The partition name is only used by DOS.

In order to relabel a volume, you don't need to find the partition name. You can enter

 relabel oldname: newname




keep all my work in a dedicated partition (dh3), so normally formatting and/or reinstalling to dh0 my work is safe). Using 68k os3.x hdtoolbox however strips the drive of its &quot;aros&quot; drive tables, etc. (I knew this already, but in my frustration just didnt think about it), so I believe I may have lost everything. I'd repartitioned the drive to include an os3.x dh0: and dh1:, before I reaslied my error (have left a good chunk of the drive raw still too).
Anyway, my question is in regards to data recovery. Is there a way to restore things to how they where, even if its just for the raw areas on the drive ?

As you read through these tutorials, you will encounter cryptic codes such as {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|LMB}} and ''Timeline &amp;rarr; End Frame''. These codes describe actions you perform using the keyboard and mouse. The notation used in this book comes from the Blender community, and it is standard there. We will try to import those standards here to facilitate our studies.

If you're reading this book online, you may wish to print this page for future reference. In addition, you can bookmark in your browser for faster reference when behind your PC.

== Hotkeys ==
[[File:Toetsenbord numeriek.jpg|100px|right|thumb|A typical numpad]]
Most computer keyboards have number keys in two different places: in a row above the letters and in a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|numpad}} (numeric keypad) on the right side of the keyboard. While many applications use these two sets of keys interchangeably, Blender does not. It assigns different functions to each set. If you're using a laptop keyboard without a separate numeric keypad, this might cause some difficulty. You'll need to use your ''function key'' to do some things. It is possible to indicate to Blender the type of keyboard you are using, but we strongly recommend you use a standard external keyboard even if you're on a laptop for these tutorials as it will make your studies and usage of Blender much more straightforward and enjoyable.

This book often assumes that your keyboard has a numpad. If yours doesn't, consult the tutorial on [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Non-standard equipment|Non-standard Input Devices]] for alternative ways to access the numpad's functions.

|}
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin-left:50px; margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;
Combinations that involve holding down a key while performing another action are written with a plus sign (+). Thus:
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Tab}} means to {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} while holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}
and
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Ctrl|F9}} means to {{B3D:N2P/Do|F9}} while holding down both {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
== Mouse Notation ==
Blender uses three mouse buttons and the scroll wheel as well, if you have one. If your mouse only has one or two buttons, consult the tutorial on [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Non-standard equipment|Non-standard Input Devices]] for alternative ways to access the functions assigned to these buttons.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:50px&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Notation !! Action or Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} || click with the Left Mouse Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} || click with the Right Mouse Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} || press down on (don't turn) the scroll wheel ''or'' Middle Mouse Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} || turn the scroll wheel in either direction
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Mouse and keyboard actions are often combined. {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}} means to click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} while holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
== Navigating Menus ==

Blender uses both pop-up and pull-down/pull-up menus. Many menus have '''sub menus''' (menus that are reached by going through another menu). If a menu item displays a triangle, that means it leads to a sub menu. For instance, the pull-down menu shown below has seventeen items, four of which lead to sub menus: 

[[File:Blender3D File menu screenshot.png|The File menu]]

You can move through items in a menu by:
* moving the mouse pointer up and down
or
* pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Up  Arrow}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Down  Arrow}}

You can enter a sub menu either by:
* moving the mouse pointer to the right
or
* pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Right  Arrow}}

You can leave a sub menu either by:
* moving the mouse pointer to the left
or
* pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Left  Arrow}}

To initiate a menu action, you can either:
* click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}
or
* press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}

You can escape from a menu either by:
* moving the mouse pointer away from the menu
or
* pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}}

For each menu, Blender remembers which item you chose last time and highlights it for you the next time you enter the menu.

=== Notation ===
Menu notation is fairly self-explanatory.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|A}} ''Mesh &amp;rarr; UV Sphere''

Means:
# Press Shift+A
# In the menu that pops up, move through the items until ''Mesh'' is highlighted
# Enter the ''Mesh'' sub menu
# Move through the items until ''UV Sphere'' is highlighted
# Press Enter or click the left mouse button to initiate the action
&lt;/div&gt;

'''Miso''' is a fermented paste which greatly resembles peanut butter in appearance, and has a strong, salty taste somewhat like [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]] (but not as strong). It is made from [[Cookbook:Soy|soy beans]], grain, and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

Like [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], uncooked Miso contains bacteria that can be benefical.
Miso is a rich source of protein. Miso also contains antioxidants and [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]].  Miso that is marked as USDA organic will not contain MSG.

Miso is particularly associated with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]], where it is used in [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]], dengaku, and in sauces of all sorts. A version of miso is also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korea]].

The '''Soy''' bean is a small fat green bean. It is particularly associated with [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian cuisines]], large-scale commercial cooking, meat analogues for vegetarians, and industrial processes. Soy beans may be served uncooked and whole during a Japanese meal. They may be cooked and pressed to yield [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]], which can then be coagulated to make [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]. They may be fermented to produce [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], natto, [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]], and [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]]. Soy beans may be used to produce [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]] that are larger than the normal ones produced from [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|mung beans]]. Soy bean [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] has a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]], making it suitable for high-temperature frying.

==Edamame==
To eat beans right out of the shell, [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] them until they are al dente (still slightly firm). Rinse to cool slightly, and season ([[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], generally) as desired. You can easily suck the al dente beans out of the shell. Beans may also be shelled and added to other dishes, such as [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]]. Beans are easy to shell after they are boiled briefly.

'''Soy sauce''' (soya sauce) is a dark brown liquid made from fermented [[Cookbook:Soy|soybeans]] (soya beans), roasted [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]], water and salt. Soy sauce is
common in the cuisines of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korea]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]].

Japanese soy sauce tends to contain more wheat than Chinese soy sauce, giving Japanese soy sauce a slightly sweeter taste.

Soy sauce contains a small amount of naturally occurring [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]. It can also be extremely [[Cookbook:Salt|salty]].

Soy sauce is shelf-stable because it contains added [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Alcohol|alcohol]], or sodium benzoate. Since alcohol quickly boils off when [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-frying]] (a typical use of soy sauce), an alcohol-based soy sauce is preferable when using copious amounts.

'''Canola oil''' or '''LEAR oil''' is low erucic acid rapeseed oil. Canola is the marketing name, for obvious reasons. Erucic acid is poisonous.

It has a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] which makes it suitable for high-temperature frying. It is also composed of mostly mono-unsaturated fat, considered good for health.

'''Seaweed''' is edible algae that grows in the sea. It is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]]. It is also used in the cuisines of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korea]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Wales|Wales]] and
[[Cookbook:Native American cuisine|North American Indians]].

Seaweed naturally contains many vitamins, folic acid, [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]], niacin, and many minerals.
Seaweed is very low in calories.

Types of seaweed commonly eaten include:

* [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp, or laver), eaten fresh as [[Cookbook:Sashimi|sashimi]] or used to make [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]]
* [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]], dried and used to wrap sushi rolls
* [[Cookbook:Dulse|dulse]]
* [[Cookbook:Laver|laver]]
* [[Cookbook:Wakame|wakame]]

Seaweed derivatives are also used in cooking and food products, especially [[Cookbook:Agar|agar]] and [[Cookbook:Carrageonan|carrageenan]].</text>

A '''mushroom''' is the spore-forming part of a fungus. Many edible mushrooms are cultivated, while some edible wild mushrooms are commercially harvested from nature.

A serving of mushrooms can contain 1/3 of a person's daily need for selenium. Mushrooms contain large amounts of riboflavin, plus decent amounts of niacin and pantothenic acid. Mushrooms contain a small amount of naturally occurring [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]. A serving of mushrooms contains about 10% of a person's daily need for potassium. Mushrooms are low in calories.

Many wild mushrooms are very good for cooking, however, other wild mushrooms are poisonous, some even deadly. When picking mushrooms in nature or using wild picked mushrooms, proper care should be exercised and unknown mushrooms never eaten. Often there exist guidebooks to help identify mushrooms in a given region.

==Some types of food mushroom==
===Shiitake mushroom===
This medium-sized brown mushroom has an earthy taste. It is primarily used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]]. Dried shiitake are often preferred over fresh.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

===Common or white mushroom===
[[Image:ChampignonMushroom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|common mushroom]]
This is the typical mushroom used on [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] and generally in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cuisine]]. These mushrooms taste much better when cooked. They are commonly available pre-cooked and pre-sliced in cans and jars; the see-through jars generally have better quality. Also called: ''Agaricus bisporus'', cultivated mushroom, and champignon de Paris.

Contrary to popular belief, mushrooms '''''do not'' ''' absorb water when washed or soaked.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

===Portobello mushroom===
This is an overgrown crimini (brown) mushroom (head is 4&quot;-6&quot; in diameter). It is often [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbecued]] without the stalk, to be used as a vegetarian substitute for a [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]]. A common alternate spelling is &quot;Portabella&quot;.

===Straw mushroom===
This is a small mushroom well-suited to [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir fry]] and often available canned. Straw mushrooms look like Smurf houses.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

===Enokitake mushroom===
[[Image:EnokitakeJapaneseMushroom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Enokitake]]
This is a very tall and narrow mushroom sometimes added to soup, particularly in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]]. Also referred as &quot;golden needle mushrooms&quot;, or &quot;golden mushrooms&quot; in some countries, including [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]].
&lt;br clear=all&gt;.

===Oyster mushroom===
This is a trumpet- or oyster-shaped mushroom, which tastes somewhat fishy, hence the name. They will often appear sliced into strips and fried.

===Chanterelle===
[[Image:Cantharellus_cibarius_1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chanterelle]]
A bright yellow funnel-shaped mushroom with a very characteristic fruity flavour. 
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some persons fear others because they are the opposite gender. But most persons have male and female relatives (fathers, brothers, grandfathers, uncles, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, aunts, cousins...). If you do not fear these persons, then you need not fear other men or women.

Males and females have different body parts and brain chemistry.

== Fear itself ==
[[wikt:Fear|Fear]] leads to [[wikt:inhibition|inhibition]].
There are several thoughts, feelings, actions that build up to fear.

If you ever were forced to jump from a tall tower or bridge into a distant body of water, or anything similar that gives you a physical, instinctive fear which affects your entire body, you have been in a real conflict between a subconscious fear (fear of heights, of danger) and your rational mind saying, &quot;Is it rational to fear this? Is this artificial fear or should I really be afraid.&quot; The subconscious mind can be made to accept and feel comfortable with such situations by repeated exposure. It can be made to accept reality, or to ignore it. Most of the time you have to impress a made-up idea upon your subconscious to make it accept it. This is a suggestion, which the subconscious mind turns into reality.

{{warning|Move the next paragraph to a module about sexual health?}}

Some obstacles creating fear are sexual: always check with your doctor to ensure your sexual health.  If you are having serious problems with assertiveness or confidence, try joining a club or society that allows you the opportunity to mix with members of the opposite sex in a comfortable setting where you can make friends as well as chat with women.  If all else fails, see a psychiatrist or psychologist; they may recommend talk therapy or medication. Just remember: taking a pill cannot fix all of your problems.  

{{warning|Some of the next paragraphs are temporarily struck through until someone decides what to do with them.}}

Another sign of fear or inconfidence, once you have found yourself a date is being overly &quot;clingy&quot; to your partner. While this may appeal to those who are essentially caretakers/nurturers, more independent women may be put off. Adolescence and early 20s is really the time to individuate, and a woman may hate being treated like your mother.  Acting this way may also be seen as inferior and boring.  There is a fine line between being intensely attentive to or absorbed by someone, and being clingy; make sure you know where that line is.

With the theory out of the way, let's fool the subconscious that prevents you from getting a date!

==Exercises to reduce fear==
To overcome fear, it helps to have clear simple steps towards a larger goal.

===Awareness===
Wherever you go, pay attention.  Look around you for the beauty in each person. (FIXME Only for persons of a certain gender? Only beauty and no other traits?) Find what you like about each, and say it to yourself quietly. Practice this, so YOU know what you like.

After a while you should feel comfortable with what you find attractive of another person. (FIXME?) Much of the fear you feel is from the possibility of failure, so you can desensitize yourself to this fear by not allowing yourself to think about the possibility of success. This does not entail assuming that you will always fail (otherwise, why try?) but rather the view that, &quot;There's a very good chance that it won't work. So what? I won't know unless I try. I wasn't dating her 5 minutes ago and I was getting along just fine; I'll be fine if I'm not dating her 5 minutes from now.&quot;

===Assertiveness===
Start to state your compliments of the attire, hairstyle, figure or tattoos of a potential mate louder and louder, until it is a normal conversational tone.

Next, take the leap! Actually go meet the person, and not in a creepy, sulking way, but directly, and politely. Promise yourself that, regardless of the actual response of the person is, you will not say anything other than that compliment.

You are in effect building up good karma to use later.  Something simple...&quot;Excuse me miss.  I just had to tell you that your hair looks simply beautiful today.&quot;  Smile, and walk away. Of course, it pays to be a little selective, though- if she appears to be in a bad mood or very busy, it could lead to you being &quot;shot down&quot; which might negatively affect your confidence for awhile.

This will help you practice breaking the ice with pretty strangers, and make plenty of persons have a better day.

===Thought Experiments===
This is a list of items to only think of.

(FIXME are these only general conversation tips? Move to Guide to Social Activity/Conversation or keep here?)

* Think about conversing with strangers. Try to provoke the emotions you want to avoid. Know how it feels. Then try to force your emotions away. Do this in the presence of such a person (without that person noticing your thoughts), because this makes it more real and your subconscious mind will more likely try to intervene!

* Realize that all [[w:Neurotypical|neurotypicals]] are probably equally nervous about social situations and everyone is worried about how they are perceived.  If you can pretend to be confident, people will perceive you as confident.  Pretend that you are charming. Pretend that you are witty. Practice it with people of either gender, until you can consistently get favourable reactions. Much charm and wit can be honed with guys and still be effective on girls. Once you've got the hang of acting like you know what you are doing, you will realize that you DO know what you are doing, and you will be able to be yourself without feeling self-conscious.   
** If you still find yourself becoming self-conscious, FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS on the girl and forget about yourself.

=== (Body Language ===
*'''The eyes''':  Look into the eyes of as many women as you can, don't stare, just fix them with a nice smile on your face.

*'''Your face''':  Vary your facial expressions when you tell stories.  Don't be afraid to make silly faces at appropriate moments when you tell stories.

=== Making contact ===

It is sometimes easiest to do this in a group of trusted friends, as this makes for a more friendly atmosphere, and provides moral support in case of embarrassment.  The woman you are seeking has to be approachable, and should have shown a degree of interest in you. Ideally, she ought to be as interested in you as you are in her, but some of these exercises you can try on people the instant you meet them.  Asking someone out on a date is less frustrating, faster, and easier once you have got used to it. It is also more fun!

* Hit girls with pick-up lines.  No kidding.  Deliver in a joking manner, like you want to make fun of her, seeing whether she can laugh about herself. Do it over and over again with women you don't know and just meet casually in the bus, sub-way, in the city. They will never recognise you again and even if they do they won't do anything. You will see it's just your mind that gives you the uncomfortable feeling - with practise this feeling goes away!   (warning - using profanity may be offensive)

* Reciprocity is a powerful and universal social behavioral trait.  Translation: when people receive something, they feel obliged.  In dating the obvious examples would be buying a girl a drink or bringing flowers to a girl on a date.  There are more subtle ways to use the rule of reciprocity.  When you give your name to a girl she will feel obliged to give you hers.  If you volunteer some personal anecdote or opinion, she will often do the same.    

* Build rapport through use of the word &quot;we&quot;.  It helps to put people at ease if they feel that you are on their side.  For example - if you are learning to dance and you want to build rapport with your partner, say something like &quot;We are doing really great.  I think we nailed that last step.&quot;

* Ask if you know them from somewhere, or ask if you've met them before.   This gets them to look at you closely to see if they recognize you, but even if they say no, quickly introduce yourself and ask them what their name is, ask where they are from, or ask something related to where you both are at the moment. whatever comes to your head, just keep the conversation going.  Concentrate on ignoring uncomfortable feelings, and concentrate on her.   Joke around a little.  If the conversation goes well, ask for her number or email address, and give her yours.  Then call her that night and tell her you enjoyed talking to her.  

* Compliments are effective for expressing interest without being perceived as vulnerable.  The more subtle, the better.  &quot;I like... the way you carry yourself/ the way you smile/ the way your eyes sparkle/ the way you walk/ the way you think.&quot;  Only compliment if that's the way you really feel.  Although people tend to believe compliments - even when it is understood that the flatterer stands to gain from their liking him.  Giving compliments increases ones likeability.  Don't throw out compliments too often - maybe once during a date - so make it a good one!  

* The impersonal interrogative comment (IIC) allows you to invite someone into a conversation without risking rejection or making your object of interest uncomfortable.  An example of the IIC is, &quot;Beautiful day today, isn't it?&quot;  Or, (at the beach) &quot;The water is freezing this time of year, isn't it?&quot;  This type of comment can be responded to with a simple grunt or a nod - or if the girl is interested she might say, &quot;I think the water is invigorating!  And once you get in its not so bad.&quot;  The longer and more personalized the response, then more positive for your chances.

* Use the internet - the barrier is lower for initiating a conversation. If you are very sensitive, chatting online may be enough to make you blush. However, you can practice wording and conversation to your heart's content.  Have a goal of arranging an in-person meeting in under an hour.  You don't need anything other than your natural wit and maybe a photo.  Part 2 of the exercise: date them. This will get you into the dating game for practise.

* Go dancing! Not in a club or disco. Learn how to dance: salsa/mambo, Caribbean stuff; often the cheaper the lessons are, the better.  East Coast Swing (aka jitterbug) is a dance that is relatively easy to learn - an hour is enough to learn the basics.  Be warned that Lindy Hop (eight count swing) is much more difficult.  If you know a sport dancing-club, see if you can join. University sports are fine locations for that, too. The difference between classic dancing schools and the sport-dancers/non-Latin salsa scene is that in the schools they teach figures, as fast as they can, and you will not be able to take advantage of your knowledge!! The hobbyists on the other hand emphasize much more on &quot;feeling&quot; the music, feeling and leading the partner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A girl will never judge your dancing abilities on the basis of how many figures you can do, she wants to feel good, and you need to be able to lead!  Followers (girls) prefer a strong lead.  It is much easier for them if they don't have to guess where the dance is going.  In sport dancing they emphasize the so called &quot;basics&quot;, the way to move your feet, your arms, hands, rhythm.  You will be able to dance with girls in a disco much more comfortably (for both of you) and you can teach them how to dance like they do in the films ;)  Be sure to smile and look like you are having fun - even if you are nervous or stressed about your footwork.  Dancing will also help you lose any inhibitions about being in someone else's personal space.  

----
Never look back.  Someone can turn you down, but she can't defeat you!

==Have no regrets==

Consider this situation: you are 85 years old, and looking back upon your life. What are your biggest regrets? 

Be aware that this particular issue has been studied. One common theme in the responses given by old people is this: they regret the things that they did NOT do. Ask an old man one of his greatest regrets, and he will eventually tell you about a beautiful woman he knew when he was young. He will tell you how he regrets never pursuing her. He will tell you that at the time it made him nervous, but now he has learned that it's really not that big of a deal, especially considering other things in life.

What is important here is to consider a perspective where you accept the possibility that there is NOT life after death, heaven, hell, or reincarnation. There IS a possibility that you will live once, then cease to exist, and that’s it! With this in mind, do you want to repeat the mistakes of others and not live (your ONLY) life to the fullest? Do you want to allow your fear, pride, ego, etc., to limit your life? 

Change is not easy, but it is possible. You have learned to ride a bike, even though you crashed a few times along the way. You have learned many hard to speak/spell English vocabulary words, yet when you were young you thought you could never learn a big list of words every week. You thought about all the things you think you could not do, yet you have done many of them. Stop thinking that you can't get women, because you can. Stop thinking that your situation is unique, because it's not. Men-seeking-women is as old of a subject as humans, it's the source of countless songs, poems, books, movies, and history.

Nothing is easy at first, that's just part of life. Do you think you can't skydive from an airplane? Consider warming up to the challenge of women by first conquering your fear of heights. Yes, go skydive. Then tell yourself &quot;if I can do THAT, then getting women is also possible.&quot;

Convince yourself that you do not care about the outcome of pursuing a woman, because either you will succeed OR gain practice, and either one is acceptable.

And besides... the old adage, &quot;It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all&quot; is very true. So, even if you try to establish a relationship with someone and eventually get shot down, you will have grown from the experience. It might hurt in the short term, but you will be better prepared for the next time. ''There will be a next time.''

==Approach Girls With Confidence==

When someone interrupts you, you find it rude, it's intrusive, as a man it's disrespectful. Women are different however, they like it when you interrupt them. It's as if they want you to disregard what they are talking about. It's taking charge and showing your decisiveness about what's important. You can't just interrupt at any time, but when you have something more important to say they won't stop for you. They want their conversation to be controlled by you. When you interrupt at a time when you know that you have something good to say, something funny that will interest them they will actually be receptive..
There is a specific way to interrupt a girl.

'''1 - Open Circle'''

When women want you to approach they have way of letting you know. If there's more than two of them, they stand in a circle that is open towards you. They are basically making space for you to fill in the gap. If there's just two of them talking they also keep themselves open. They are not standing this way by coincidence, this is your chance.

'''2 - Animated Behavior'''

You can tell that girls want to be approached because they talk a little bit more pronounced and louder than they have to. They enunciate certain words and phrases more than the rest of the conversation. They are basically talking amongst themselves and they are being overly excited. It's not because they've got some great new topic, they've already finished introducing themselves to each other, they are long time friends. The reason they are being just a little too loud and overtly expressive is because they like you and that's their way to draw attention. Words like Wow, That's So Cool, Awesome, It's The Best... and so forth will be a little more pronounced. They are interested, they want to compliment you, but instead of doing that directly they use those words amongst themselves. Anything that sounds like a compliment will be better pronounced.

'''3 - Eye Line'''

They will look directly and more intensely at each other. In normal conversation the speakers eyes wonder around the listeners face, scanning the environment around the listener, looking to the side when telling a story etc. Once the girls have noticed you, they will try not to look at you so as to not to be to direct with you. As a result they will stop scanning around and lock eye contact with themselves. That means they have already noticed you, and if their body language is open, that means they like you. Don't wait too long, they might get uncomfortable and by the time you approach them, attraction will turn into resentment. Then you have to show more responsiveness to their signals. Find the girl with the most intense eyes, she is the one that likes you. Check to make sure that her body language is open and then just walk right in.

'''4 - Looking Around'''

When girls start looking intensely at each other, you know they have already noticed you, but if they haven't noticed you yet, they will be making glances. Look for girls that are glancing to the sides, scanning the crowd, looking at the door, watching for somebody new to come in. If they are doing that, that means they are looking for a man, come closer and see if they notice you. But don't come too close; you just want to be in their line of sight, where they are making passes. If they stop glancing after they've seen you, that means you're the one they've been looking for.

'''5 - Standing Alone In A Visible Area'''

If it really was a private conversation, they would move to a secluded place. They would go to a corner, grab a table or a booth where they wouldn't be disturbed. But if they are standing at a bar, by the fireplace, near the door, near the window, generally in a central location where people pass through. The only exception is if they are standing by the door on their way out. Otherwise, if the girls are in a central location, they want to be approached, don't expect a special invitation, although it's happened before.

'''6 - Other Girls Leaving'''

If there's a group of four or more girls, chances are that not all of them are going to like you. The ones that haven't found what they are looking for will be wanting to move on. They will excuse themselves from the rest of the group. If the remaining girls aren't sticking with their friends chances are they have found a reason to stay.

'''7 - Light Conversation'''

In order to interrupt girls their conversation should be light and funny, no serious topics. Watch out for conversations on money, work, talking about a man, talking about a woman, talking about a specific person, career, politics, religion, popularity, attractiveness. Those are sensitive topics to people and if they are talking about it chances are they will not be in a casual mood for you. If on the other hand, from a distance you can hear that everything is light and funny, even though they seem to be having a private conversation, you really know that they are ready to meet a man.

'''8 - No Hierarchy'''

No Hierarchy means there is no leader within the group of girls. It's a social function, the atmosphere should be casual and that means balanced. Contrary to popular belief, meeting a member of the opposite sex is not a popularity contest. The only person hugging the spot light should be the band that's playing up on center stage. However this does happen often sometimes, some girls try to be the leaders of the group, they try to lead the conversation, they want to make sure they get the final word. Don't approach a group where there is a power struggle going on, the girls will be preoccupied. This really should not happen because if it's a social event, the idea is to make the atmosphere supportive. However, sometimes a girl doesn't find what she's looking for, so instead of feeling sorry for herself she starts working the crowd made up of her friends. That's not the right way to treat a friend, but if she has good social skills, she can get away with this. Sometimes she is jealous of a better looking girl friend of hers and showing off her popularity is her way of settling her score. If her friends fall for it, don't interrupt them, they will be preoccupied any way. What you can do is go for the leader and watch her drop her followers in a second.

'''9 - Body Language Symmetrical Synchronized'''

We know the importance of open body language when approaching a girl with any interruption, and what else is important is symmetry. Girls like to move their hands when they talk. When she's gesturing check that she is moving both hands. Her stance should be straight. She shouldn't be leaning on one leg or the other or tilting her head to either side either. Studies show that asymmetrical posture signals a preoccupied and a distant mind. If they are having fun, they should also be in synch with one another. If one is laughing they should all be laughing. If one is using gestures they should all be gesturing. If one is holding a drink, they should all be drinking and so forth. You might have spotted the girl you want, but if there's something not in tune with the group she's with don't interrupt just yet. Be patient. If she is interested in you too she will gradually distance away from her group and make herself available. Instead of approaching girls that are preoccupied look for girls that are having a good time and are receptive to meeting a new guy.

'''10 - Three Second Rule'''

The most important rule about interruptions is to do it right away. You need to recognize these signals and be able to identify them with confidence. As soon as you spot these signals, more right in, it's an interruption, it should be considered rude, but if you do it right it will actually be welcomed.

      <comment>/* Language comparisons */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Language comparisons ===
There is not a perfect language. It all depends on the resources (tools, people, and even available time) and the objective. For a broader look on other languages and their evolution, a subject that falls outside of the scope of this book, there are many other works available, including the [[Computer Programming]] wikibook.

This section is provided as a quick jump-start for people that already had some experience in them, a way to edify notions about C++ language's special characteristics, and as a demonstration of what makes it distinct.

==== Ideal language ====
The ideal language depends on the specific problem. All programming languages are designed to be ''general mechanisms for expressing problem solving algorithms''. In other words, it is a language - rather than simply an expression - because it is capable of expressing solutions to more than one specific problem.

The level of generality in a programming language varies.  There are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language domain-specific languages] (DSLs)  such as regular expression syntax which is designed specifically for pattern matching and string manipulation problems.   There are also general-purpose programming languages such as C++. 

Ultimately, there is no perfect language.  There are some languages that are more suited to specific classes of problems than others.  Each language makes trade-offs, favoring efficiency in one area for inefficiencies in other areas.   Furthermore, efficiency may not only mean ''runtime performance'' but also includes factors such as development time, code maintainability, and other considerations that affect software development.   The best language is dependent on the specific objectives of the programmers.

Furthermore, another very practical consideration when selecting a language is the number and quality of tools available to the programmer for that language.  No matter how good a language is in theory, if there is no set of reliable tools on the desired platform, that language is not the best choice.

The optimal language (in terms of run-time performance) is machine code but [[w:Machine code|machine code]] (binary) is the least efficient programming language in terms of coder time. The complexity of writing large systems is enormous with high-level languages, and beyond human capabilities with machine code. In the next sections C++ will be compared with other closely related languages like [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/C|C]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/Java|Java]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/C Sharp|C#]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/Managed C++|C++/CLI]] and [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/D|D]].
&lt;!-- Full path is needed so not to break the print version ---&gt;

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=''«When someone says &quot;I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done,&quot; give him a lollipop.»''|caption=&lt;small&gt;--published in SIGPLAN Notices Vol. 17, No. 9, September 1982&lt;/small&gt;}}

The quote above is shown to indicate that no programming language at present can translate directly concepts or ideas into useful code, there are solutions that will help. We will cover the use of [[w:Computer-aided software engineering (CASE)|Computer-aided software engineering (CASE)]] tools that will address part of this problem but its use does require planning and some degree of complexity.

The intention of these sections is not to promote one language above another; each has its applicability. Some are better in specific tasks, some are simpler to learn, others only provide a better level of control to the programmer. This all may depend also on the level of control the programmer has of a given language.

==== Garbage collection ====
In C++ garbage collection is optional rather than required. In the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/Garbage Collection|Garbage Collection Section]] of this book we will cover this issue deeply.

==== Why no &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; keyword? ====
As we will see in the [[C++ Programming/RAII|Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) Section]] of the book, RAII can be used to provide a better solution for most issues.  When &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; is used to clean up, it has to be written by the clients of a class each time that class is used (for example, clients of a ''fileClass class'' have to do I/O in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block so that they can guarantee that the ''fileClass'' is closed).  With RAII, the destructor of the ''fileClass'' can make that guarantee. Now the cleanup code has to be coded only once &amp;mdash; in the destructor of ''fileClass''; the users of the class don't need to do anything.

{{TODO|Split this explanation to RAII and only provide the reference|C++ Programming}}

==== Mixing languages ====
{{TODO|Add relevant information|C++ Programming}}
By default, the C++ compiler normally &quot;mangles&quot; the names of functions in order to facilitate function overloading and generic functions.  In some cases, you need to gain access to a function that wasn't created in a C++ compiler.  For this to occur, you need to use the {{C++ Programming/kw|extern}} keyword to declare that function as external:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
extern &quot;C&quot; void LibraryFunction();
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many treatises have been written, by better and more experienced authors, on the subjects of extracting commitment from another person - even unto a lifelong relationship and lasting dynasty - that is in the long term mutually beneficial.  Suffice it to say that, should you be willing to undertake the ordeal, there are many avenues to explore.

That said, building a self-sustaining relationship which will survive through the ages despite the best efforts of third parties and human nature, and without constant vigilance on your part, remains a difficult and unsolved problem.

It is important to recognize that you wish to enter into a form of a contract with another person involving [[social transaction| social transactions]]. You intend to make an agreement to be monogamous, among other things. As is the case with ANY contract, you must first evaluate if the other party is trustworthy/honorable. To be blunt, do not chose a loser/player/bad-boy, with the hope of changing him. A serious mistake in life is to assume you have the ability to change other people; you do not. You can only indirectly influence them to chose to change themselves. Should you chose a loser, and believe you can change him, you will be repeating a common error; you will be setting yourself up for a broken heart.

'''Parmesan cheese''' is a hard dry white Italian cheese that stores well. It has a particularly buttery, salty taste. It is also known as '''Parmigiano-Reggiano'''.

It is available ready-grated as a powder intended for sprinkling onto food at the table.

Grating or shaving the cheese into thin slivers immediately before use will give a moister result. Parmesan is the traditional topping to many Italian dishes, including [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]], where it adds a final richness and creaminess. 

With the advent of refrigeration and pre-shredded soft cheeses, [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] can now take the place of parmesan for table usage but the taste is blander.

Parmesan cheese is used in the making of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]].

[[Image:Mozzarella.jpg|right|thumb|Mozzarella cheese]]

'''Mozzarella cheese''' is a mild soft white cheese, originating in the area of Naples, Italy. Mozzarella cheese is often used:
*as a topping for [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]]
*in hot sandwiches
*deep-fried to make [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Sticks|mozzarella sticks]]
*in [[Cookbook:Melanzane alla Parmigiana|melanzane alla parmigiana]] and baked pasta dishes
*raw, in tomato salads. 

With the advent of refrigeration and pre-shredded soft cheeses, it has become practical to use mozzarella cheese at the table in place of the strong-smelling [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]].

The most authentic mozzarella is made fresh in Italy from raw Water Buffalo milk, formed into balls, and does not last more than about a day: this type of mozzarella cannot be used in cooking as it turns into string instead of melting.  World-wide mozzarella is mostly made from pasteurized cow milk, in a form with a longer shelf life: this form of mozzarella is often known to Italians as ''fiordilatte'', and is used in baked dishes.  It is sometimes sold processed as String cheese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Contrary to what this page says, JavaScript supports pretty much all of the OO features that it says it does not.

I agree. A quick google for &quot;classes in JavaScript&quot; and &quot;object-oriented Javascript&quot;
* http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=classes+in+Javascript&amp;btnG=Google+Search
* http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=object-oriented+Javascript&amp;btnG=Search
shows quite a few pages about classes (and other OO features) in Javascript.

Definitely we'll want to talk about this in the JavaScript book.
Should we stick information about implementing &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;member methods&quot; in Javascript at the end of the &quot;JavaScript:Variables and types&quot; chapter for now?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:40, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
:JavaScript can imitate classes, but it is important to stress that it does not actually have them.  Instead it has a more flexible paradigm.  [http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html] --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 09:15, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

Perhaps this is a simplistic question, but what is the definition of a &quot;type&quot;? [[User:Webchoc|Webchoc]] ([[User talk:Webchoc|talk]]) 04:53, 19 November 2009 (UTC)
:Every constructor function is, in effect, a type.  All of the basic types have constructor functions, even though best practice is to use their literal forms (if applicable) instead. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 09:12, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

IIRC, JavaScript strings are Unicode. If this is true, it is important enough to go into this page. [[User:Yaronf|Yaronf]] ([[User talk:Yaronf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yaronf|contribs]]) 11:49, 23 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

'''The Coming of the First Settlers'''
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Namigration.png|thumb|The theorized migration path of the immigrating people.]]&lt;/div&gt;
As there are no written records maintained from the era prior to the coming of Europeans to North America, there is no exact information on how the people now referred to as First Nations came to the continent.  There have been theories proposed to explain the coming of the people, with one being generally accepted as the most plausible; the Landbridge Theory.

During the most recent of the Ice Ages large portions of the northern hemisphere were coated in ice. This ice covered much of what is now Canada.  As all of this ice was formed the water levels around the world lowered, causing land masses previously inaccessible to become available. One such landmass was located where the Bering Strait is today: Beringia which formed a link between what is now Siberia and Alaska.  This newly formed landmass is estimated to have been 1000 kilometres wide and 90 kilometres long (the modern distance between the two continents).

With the increasing cold, plant life in the northern lands was dwindling and causing an exodus of wildlife. Animals began roaming farther in search for sustenance.  As the people of the time were dependant on both, they were forced to follow or die.  Those that moved across Beringia were a nomadic people which followed their prey into the previously untapped lands which now include Alberta and parts of the Yukon and British Columbia.  This migration of people happened some time between 100,000 and 30,000 years ago.

About 17,000 years ago the temperatures in North America began to increase once more, and the ice, which is thought to have been upwards of 3 kilometres thick in locations over the Rocky Mountains and Hudson's Bay, began to melt off.  With the receding of the ice at the end of this time, the scars in the land carved by the coming of the glaciers and their movement were filled with the water produced by the melting.  This is used to explain the creation of what is now the Great Lakes of Ontario and the myriad of other small bodies of water through Canada.

Beringia, the Bering Strait landbridge, ceased to exist approximately 10,000 years ago with the rising of water levels.

A secondary theory that is accepted to a lesser degree is the Watercraft Theory, which states that Asian people could have created rafts in order to travel on the ice-free Pacific Ocean into what is now California.

The reason that these two theories are accepted over theories of Africans moving to South America and then into North America is the links between Asian and North American species and the physical resemblances between Asians and Native Americans.  All three of these theories of American infusion have since been correlated via genetic sampling, as well as archaeological evidence.  Genetically, Native North Americans are almost entirely Asian in origin, while Native South Americans are largely African in origin.  The archaeological evidence is illustrated by technological jumps reached by the North American tribes and nations via the Pacific at various times.

The Viking Landings, talk about Red and Eriksson, the Scandinavian colonization of Iceland, Greenland and temporarily of Vinland.

Mention the historical notes of white skinned natives in Labrador and Newfoundland, also the proposed reasons for the colony's failure.

==Leif Ericsson==
 
Christopher Columbus was not the first European to discover North America. Nearly five hundred years early, Leif Ericsson or “Leif the Lucky” heard of a mysterious land to the west. He set off in search of this place and discovered the land he called Vinland. This expedition is documented in two sagas: Grœnlendinga saga and Eiríks saga rauða. They describe Erikson establishing a Norse settlement in Vinland.
 

Leif Eriksson grew up with his father’s adventursome spirit and urge to travel bred within him. When he was only 13 years old, Leif’s father, Erik the Red, was banished from Iceland and so the family voyaged to Greenland. It was then that Leif first learned how to man a ship. At the age of 24, he captained his first expedition – a trip to bring gifts for King Olav in Norway. Leif came back Christian and restless for another voyage. 

 

In an attempt to prove claims of land to the west, Leif Eriksson set off on his second expedition. Bjarni Herljulfsson, a Norse trader, had been blown far off course during his last voyage and described seeing a lush, forested land. Leif Eriksson was enticed by these tales and bought Bjarni’s ship. With a crew of 34, he sailed for 600 miles before landing on a flat, glacier covered area. Leif named it Helluland after the flat rocks. The barren place (now thought to be Baffin Island) was disappointing and he left in search of a more fertile land. Leif travelled south and came to a wooded territory with white beaches. He named it Markland or Woodland. Yet, this too did not match Bjarni’s descriptions and he sailed on once more. 

 

Leif and his crew journeyed for two days and arrived at another land, which is now believed to be somewhere near Newfoundland. According to the Grœnlendinga saga, the salmon were bigger than they had ever seen, there were abundant pastures for cattle, and rich forests grew. One of the crew members went missing while exploring the area and came back babbling about a patch of grapes. For this reason, Leif named it Vinland (Wineland). He built at least one permanent settlement and stayed in Vinland for the winter. The next spring, Leif and his crew returned to Greenland. There are no records stating that Leif Eriksson ever came back to Vinland.

'''Cornstarch''' is a starch made from corn. It is not to be confused with [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]. Both cornstarch and finely-ground cornmeal are sometimes called cornflour; this is thus a bad term to use.

Cornstarch is commonly used to thicken sauces. Commonly, anywhere from 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] to 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of cornstarch are added to 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of fluid. The mixture must be boiled to activate the cornstarch. When a recipe uses cornstarch in this way, you can often substitute one of [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|xanthan gum]], [[Cookbook:Pectin|pectin]], [[Cookbook:Agar|agar]], or [[Cookbook:Gelatin|gelatin]].

Cornstarch can be applied to wet items, drying them off so that batter will stick. This is commonly done for [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep-fat frying]]. When a recipe uses cornstarch in this way, you can often substitute [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]].

Cornstarch may be added to [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]] to prevent clumping.

'''Cornmeal''' is ground up corn. It is not to be confused with [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]. Both cornstarch and finely-ground cornmeal are sometimes called cornflour; this is thus a bad term to use.

Cornmeal is commonly used to keep baked goods from sticking, though it is not used on sweets. It would be used for [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]].

Cornmeal can be applied to wet items, drying them off so that batter will stick. This is commonly done for [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep-fat frying]]. When a recipe uses cornmeal in this way, you can often substitute [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]].

Cornmeal is commonly used in batter for deep-fat frying.

Cornmeal is an essential ingredient for [[Cookbook:Corn Bread|corn bread]] and [[Cookbook:Corn Muffins|corn muffins]].

'''Masa''' is finely ground [[Cookbook:Hominy|nixtamal]] ([[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] treated with either slaked lime or lye, in a process called [[w:Nixtamalization|nixtamalization]]). It is not to be confused with [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]. 

Corn masa is used to make [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortillas]] and [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]].
Like cornstarch, it can be used to thicken sauces.

'''Corn''' refers to any of the cereal grains such as oats, wheat, barley, and maize. For the purposes of this article corn is taken to mean maize. It can be served fresh as a vegetable, or used as a grain. Fresh corn quickly turns starchy after it is picked; ideally it should be eaten the day it is picked. Because of this, frozen corn is often the most tasty type available.

'''Corn oil''' is oil produced from [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]. Some kinds of corn have more oil than the type normally sold to consumers.

Corn oil has a medium-high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]], which makes it a good choice for most high-temperature [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]. Corn oil is composed of polyunsaturated fat, which is considered reasonably good for human health. Corn oil is typically an inexpensive oil.

The '''Mung bean''', also '''moong''', is a small green [[Cookbook:Legume|legume]] particularly associated with [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian cuisine]].

Mung beans are sprouted into [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]], and a type of [[Cookbook:Vermicelli|vermicelli]] called ''bean threads'' is made from mung bean flour, with both being used commonly in [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asian cuisines]]. [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]] use mung beans both whole, and split (as moong [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] &amp;ndash; small, yellow, and often skinless).

The '''lima bean''', also known as the '''chad bean''' or '''butter bean''', is a large disk-shaped bean used in [[Cookbook:Succotash|succotash]]. Lima beans originated in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]] and have been grown there since 6000 B.C. The name comes from the capital city of Peru, Lima. Lima beans are almost always called &quot;butter beans&quot; in the [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|southern part of the United States]], even in markets and restaurants.

Lima beans come in three main varieties:

*'''Large lima beans''' are green or speckled. The speckled kind have a creamy texture and a strong earthy flavor, unlike the pale green ones.
*'''Small lima beans''' are also called '''sieva beans''', '''Carolina bean''', '''civet''', '''seewee''', and '''sivvy'''. Most small limas are pale green. They are less starchy than the larger varieties.
*'''Dwarf lima beans''', also known as '''butter peas''', are white and speckled and the least starchy of the limas.

Fresh lima beans are difficult to find in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], but can occasionally be found at farmers' markets. It is easier to find lima beans in the [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|southern United States]] than anywhere else in the country. Most lima beans are dried, canned, or frozen.

==Preparation==
Fresh lima beans need to be shelled before they are eaten. Shelling can be a little tricky, especially with larger beans. Beans are easier to handle if they are tender and have full pods. One method used for larger beans is to simply cut open the pod with scissors and remove the beans by hand. To remove the beans from smaller limas, pull off the string along the seam, and press the two sides open to pop the beans out. Rinse canned limas before using them to reduce their gas-promoting properties.

Lima beans should never be eaten raw (see warning below). The most common methods of preparation are [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] and [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaving]]. Only a small amount of water needs to be used for either method.&lt;br&gt;
Dry lima beans require [[Cookbook:Soak|soaking]] before cooking.

==Warning==
Do not eat lima beans raw. When eaten raw, lima beans produce the poison [[w:Cyanide|cyanide]].

The '''[[w:Lentil|Lentil]]''' is a small [[Cookbook:Legume|legume]] shaped like a lens. It is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]], often in combination with [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]] or [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

Lentils are used throughout the [[Cookbook:Mediterranean cuisines|Mediterranean]] regions and the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]], and are popular in India, where they are cooked to a purée.

A variety of lentils exist with colors that range from yellow to red-orange to green, brown or even black.  There are both large and small-seeded varieties.  Lentils are generally sold as dry seeds.

Lentils have been part of the human diet since the aceramic Neolithic period.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and other [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]], the English word ''lentil'' is applied to many different legumes including lentils, beans and peas. Although sometimes used whole, they are more often used split and hulled (skin removed), in which case they are called ''[[Cookbook:Dal|dal]]'' or ''dhal''. Stripped of their outer skin, split lentils are usually bright yellow, orange, green or brown in color. The thick, often spicy stew prepared from lentil and other dals is also known as dal.

[[Image:mung_CDC.jpg|right|frame|mung bean sprouts (''Vigna radiata'')]]
The '''bean sprout''' is a very young bean plant, whole, harvested prior to the development of leaves.
While washing bean sprouts prior to use, discard any that are not crisp and white.

Bean sprouts are most commonly made from [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|mung beans]]. Larger ones can be made from [[Cookbook:Soy|soybeans]]. Bean sprouts are particularly associated with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese cuisine]], and with [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian cuisine]] in general.

Bean sprouts are often added to [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]]. They should be added near the end, because they are very easy to overcook. Overcooked bean sprouts are translucent, brown, and limp.

It would be great to an in-page media player, like [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Player this plugin]. Currently, it's hard to see the text of the examples and the audio examples.

----

This section on pronounciation isn't particularly helpful for native english speakers (presumably that majority of readers). Need more examples of the usage in words. For example the vowel &quot;i&quot;. The pronounciation can short or long, &quot;like&quot; vs &quot;little&quot;. I'm guessing that it's more like a short &quot;ee&quot; as in &quot;beet&quot;? [[User:Bwood|Bwood]] 03:52, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::Completely agree.  We need more examples, and clearer examples.  For instance, the very first vowel in the list &quot;a&quot; has no notes or English examples at all in the chart.  Is it pronounced like &quot;a&quot; in &quot;hat&quot;, or &quot;a&quot; in &quot;car&quot;, or &quot;a&quot; in &quot;cake&quot;?  
:::Notes are given for the consonent &quot;r&quot;, but they are ambiguous:  &quot;Rolled r. r is also acceptable.&quot;  Well, which is it?  A &quot;rolled r&quot; sounds very differnt from &quot;r&quot; in English.
:::And again, for &quot;w&quot; -- &quot;Pronounced like v.  Before voiceless consonants, it may be pronounced as f.&quot;  OK, fine.  But how do I know which consonants are &quot;voiceless&quot; in Polish, if I'm not a native speaker?  None are listed, nor are any word examples given.[[Special:Contributions/74.92.174.105|74.92.174.105]] ([[User talk:74.92.174.105|discuss]]) 02:01, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

Not like in &quot;like&quot;, ''i'' is short vowel similar to ''ee'' in feet. In Polish aren't differences between short and long vowels, but diffrences was some hundreds years ago and now in Polish language is ''o'' (old short /o/) and ''ó'' (old long /o/, now /oo/).

in ''like'' ''i'' is pronunce as ''aj'' in Polish.
----
Nie tak jak w ''like'', ''i'' jest krótką samogłoską podobną do ''ee'' w feet. W polskim nie ma różnic między krótkimi i długimi samogloskami, ale różnice były kilka setek lat temu i teraz w języku polskim jest ''o'' (stare krótkie /o/) i ''ó'' (stare długie /o/, teraz /u/).

w ''like'' ''i'' jest wymawiane jak ''aj'' w polskim.
----
Come on!! &quot;ci&quot; does NOT sound like &quot;chea&quot; in &quot;cheap&quot;. Not at all! It sounds rather like three sounds &quot;tsi&quot; pronounced all together. It's of course very difficult for a forigner but that's the way we pronouce &quot;ci&quot;. Otherwise I'll sound awfully strange, weird.
----
Another mistake! &quot;ź&quot; sounds like &quot;z&quot; and &quot;i&quot; pronounced together!! Never like &quot;j'y&quot; in French &quot;j'y vais&quot;!

----

Sorry but you're wrong on both counts. I'm a native Polish speaker who learned English (Canadian-English) at an early age. tsi is not even close to Polish ci. After i, c is pronounced like a soft ch. &quot;chea&quot; in &quot;cheap&quot; is a pretty good example. 
And ź sounds like zi pronounced together only from the point of view of a native Polish speaker. However, we're aiming this guide at people who are just learning Polish. Being Canadian I have studied French for a few years in school and j'y seems like an ok example to me, but my French is not that great so I'd welcome input from someone who's fluent in it.


----

Another mistake is suggesting &quot;nail polish&quot; for pronuncisation of &quot;o&quot;.  In American English, that &quot;o&quot; sounds close to an &quot;a&quot;.  A better example would be an &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;blog&quot;.  I assume the writer of this guide studied British English.

== Encoding ==

It would be a great help if it could be indicated somewhere what encoding (UTF-8, Central European (DOS), Baltic (Windows)) should be used to display this and other guides to pronunciation. And also a list of what browsers reproduce the text correctly. &lt;br&gt;

--[[Special:Contributions/194.74.152.66|194.74.152.66]] ([[User talk:194.74.152.66|talk]]) 11:03, 3 June 2008 (UTC) Paul Redfern

: I don't understand. UTF-8 is used on all pages on Wikipedia, Wikibooks etc. There is nothing special to this page in terms of character encoding. Furthermore, I don't think that a program which does not handle UTF-8 encoding on this page should be called &quot;browser&quot;. All modern browsers have to be able to display contents here. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:52, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

:::All browsers may have the ''ability'' to display these characters, provided they are properly ''set up'' to do so.  I've viewed Wikipedia with many different &quot;modern browsers&quot; that rendered phonetic characters as with question marks ( ???? ) or small hollow boxes (▫▫▫▫).  Don't just ''assume'' that everyone who views the page is seeing the same thing '''you''' happen to be seeing, with your setup.
:::I don't see anything wrong with giving some indication of the encoding at the top of any page that makes heavy use of characters other than basic, generic ASCII.[[Special:Contributions/74.92.174.105|74.92.174.105]] ([[User talk:74.92.174.105|discuss]]) 02:01, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

One note - rz is not always pronounced ʐ (Hard zh). There are some words that have r and z sounds pronounced separately. Marznąć - to feel cold, zamarzać - to freeze, obmierzły - foul, ugly are examples of this. All of them come from stem mróz - frost.

There is a mistake in the special letters table (letter ś/si) - &quot;gęsi&quot; is pronounced like &quot;gęśi&quot;, not like &quot;gęśe&quot;.

== pronounciation of special and compound letters ==

I can't agree that 'si' is pronounced same like 'ś'. That 'i' is really audible (also in rest of that compositions: 'ć'/'ci', 'ń'/'ni' etc.).
compare 'ś'/'si' words &quot;śnieg&quot; and &quot;siniak&quot;, in both cases 'ś'/'si' is followed by 'n', but sound differs (in second case there is obvious 'i' sound). Also in article is example with &quot;gęsi&quot;. Its funny cos if you pronouce it like article says, it sounds like singular (&quot;gęsi&quot; is plural form of &quot;gęś&quot;). With other letters is same problem.</text>

Warning: Australia uses a metric [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] defined to be 20 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], while many other countries use a tablespoon that is approximately 15 mL. An Australian tablespoon contains 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]], not 3. Australian recipes might use this, and might also use normal-sized tablespoons due to foreign influence. Be wary.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Secfan. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Secfan~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Multimedia==

Multimedia is a process of putting many media together. Even people who have never used a computer before have encountered images, music, videos and games. Some of this media is highly similar to their non-computer form, and others are highly unique. Multimedia files, like other files, are stored on the computer and cannot do anything by themselves. They need programmes to open them, and programmers, designers and you to edit them.

==Games==

A game, on the other hand, is an executable file or an application. This means that it is usually (on Windows) an .exe, .com, or .bat file. Games come from the manufacturer. Some operating system versions, like Windows 3.1, had games that come on floppy disks or CD-ROMS. Many of those games were created in Visual Basic or other programming languages or game engines. Many games can also be downloaded from the Internet and are often played there.

Games in the computer world are often as variable as those in the non-computer world. Many games have systems of artificial intelligence to make them more interesting. Many games get much harder as the player goes on, and some users like to cheat or modify the game. There are two sorts of modifications: cosmetic and fundamental.

===Playing Games===

In most games, it is a case of installing and loading the particular game from the Setup file. The Setup file will ask you where to save the game. It will either have its own folder, or be installed in Program Files. Program Files is slightly easier, and having games on the desktop is easiest of all.

Before playing the game, you might like to read the Terms of Service and disclaimers. Most game developers and publishers who release games on a commercial basis are very strict on this. With shareware and freeware, it is desirable, though not required, to acknowledge the developer by paying a nominal amount of money or sending them a postcard.

If your game happens to be limited to a certain amount of play, like 10 days or 28 days, respect that and delete it when you've got your use out of it. Some games will have a limited amount of plays, rather than time.

Wikipedia has a list of freeware games and some links to shareware outlets, which will cover a wide range of the twenty-five year history of personal computing. Each archive has its own procedures and rules, such as limits on how much a user can download at a time. Games are considered to be a relatively heavy use of bandwidth, so use common sense and discretion in regard to where and when you load them on your Internet Service Provider.

In the end, it's all an issue of personal preference-what educates and entertains you. Many successful games immerse their users into another world where they can learn computer-and other-skills.

Games also use images, sounds and often videos-either pre-recorded, or in real time.

===Making and Modifying Games===

As you become more experienced and confident at a particular game (or game principles in general), you might like to know how to modify your favourite game. Many platform-type games, for instance, have various modifications, like how many or how few obstacles are present in a particular level. Text-based adventure games can be modified by changing the foreground and background colours, changing the grammar of commands or by unlocking a certain cheat. Often a user can find extra information in the manual or on a website about the game. Often, too, other people who play games like to share their modifications in public. Thus we have skins (clothes) from the Sims and Sims 2. Simulation games, like the ones from Maxis/Electronic Arts, are often customisable across a wide range of functions.

The simplest way to modify a game is if the developer puts in an editor with the game. This is common with puzzle games, where users like to create their own levels. The editor runs more or less separately from gameplay, so you can load, save and modify features of the game to your heart's content. A useful thing which editors can do is test your created scenarios to see whether and how they are feasible in the context of the game. It might be fun to make the player-character invincible, as can happen in Pacman, and in some roleplaying games. Conversely, the player character can be put in extreme situations like heat, cold, gravity and natural disasters. It is not just the players and their capacities which can be modified; non-playing characters and the environment can be modified too.

The second easiest way to modify a game is to go to the game's menu and look for preferences or options. Each game, and each game-playing experience, is different!

How do you actually create a game? Programmes like Klik &amp; Play (available in a free version on the Internet, but you might like to ask your computer shop to order it) or a graphic user interface engine would make programming easier. They generally create genre-games. Many fan-games-often very sophisticated-have been created through a Klik &amp; Play interface or similar.

A presentation programme like PowerPoint or Impress (part of the OpenOffice.org suite) might be another option which does not involve buying specialist software. These programmes offer 'click on me' interaction and forms. Something of the same kind of idea was available on almost every Macintosh in the form of HyperCard Player. Windows has similar applications like SuperCard and ToolBook. It is worthwhile to spend a few hours with tutorials. If you want your game to have splash screens and animations, spend time in your graphics programme and then use a client-side language like Flash. If you want to create a hypertext game, then HTML is a good choice. Perl and Python make clean code.

Again, if you can't see and preview what the game is doing, it is not likely to be very successful. Get some of your family members to be beta testers or at least to look at your proposed concept. It can be good to get it on paper, like a storyboard, before putting it to Flash.

It's true that with making a game, you need first to try and then to try again. You might also like to read books on these concepts and techniques to bolster your own practice, and also theses. One example of a good book is Chris Crawford's The Art of Computer Game Design [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html], and a thesis which describes the processes a class of gifted Queensland students used to create a transgressive computer game for the education market is Doing Serious Work of Just Playing: Computer Games in Subject English by Donna Lynette McGrath of the Queensland University of Technology. Chapter Four is especially relevant [http://adt.library.qut.edu.au/adt-qut/uploads/approved/adt-QUT20040713.153317/public/05Chapter4.pdf], as well as the appendices and tables [http://adt.library.qut.edu.au/adt-qut/uploads/approved/adt-QUT20040713.153317/public/08Appendixes.pdf]. Both sources introduce the idea of a strong narrative or story to a game.

Wikipedia also has many links to tools that will help us make and modify games. Type in particular concepts or genres into your search engine, or bookmark relevant sites in open directories and archives.

Another good way to program a game is to use a Logo-type piece of software. This is particularly used in educational settings, and has a moderate balance between graphics and instructions with a learning curve similar but slightly more difficult than KlikPlay.

If you're really ambitious, you can use 3D or Virtual Reality. However, please remember these games need graphics cards and are not available to the majority. The same is true of games like Active Worlds and Second Life. Much graphic fun can be created with sprites. Create squares, circles and isometric images first!

==Images==
Looking at pictures is fun. They spice up time at the computer and make boring text fresh and exciting. But before you view pictures, you should know what you're looking at.

===File Types===
====Compressed Formats====
'''[[w:JPEG|jpg]] or [[w:JPEG|jpeg]]''' - Most realistic photos are in this format. Almost every digital camera uses the jpeg format for their pictures. It has great compression and supports enough colors to suit most people's needs. The only draw back is that it uses lossy compression, which means that pictures saved in jpeg loose quality. Line art looks really bad in jpeg, but there are other formats for that.

'''[[w:GIF|gif]]''' - An easy and common format for creating animated images on web site. Commonly, used for advertisements. It only supports 256 different colors in any given image, thus it often looks grainy. Gif images have a lossless compression, so pictures saved in this format do not lose quality unless they have more than 256 colors.

'''[[w:PNG|png]]''' - Another popular image type on the Internet.  It was created to be an open source replacement for gif's, but it doesn't support animation.  This format like jpeg's allows for enough colors to create a realistic photo.

'''[[w:MNG|mng]]''' - An image format that has potential, but isn't used frequently. Mng has a lot in common with png and is made by most of the same people. The advantage of mng is that it also supports animation like gif's.

====Uncompressed Formats====
Images that aren't compressed get really big. The most popular format is bmp.

====Vector====
Every picture format described so far are raster. This means that they are drawn using different colored dots, or pixels.

Vector images are different because they are drawn with mathematical or vector images. For example, a circle is described using a mathematical equation instead of a whole bunch of dots that are placed to look like a circle. Because of this, you can zoom in forever and the vector circle would not lose quality. Most clip art is some sort of vector format. The main one is that if there was a circle, diagonal line, or something similar, one could zoom in forever and the picture wouldn't 

Here are some popular vector formats:

'''[[w:Swf|swf]]''' - A proprietary format used by Macromedia Flash. Most animated movies on the internet use the swf.

'''[[w:Scalable Vector Graphics|svg]]''' - A basic and widely used format. It's not used for animations with sound.

===Popular image viewing software===

Some of the popular image viewers are:
====Google Picasa====

This viewer has a good user interface and is easy to use. Besides being free of cost, it provides good basic image editing features also.

====Windows Media Player====

This comes in built with all Microsoft Windows OS. Although not so rich as the Google Picasa, it is a good alternative.

==Music==
Music is a great way to change the mood while working on the computer. With music on your computer, you can make customize CDs, create your own jukebox, and listen to a wide variety of radio stations from all around the world.

===File Types===
====Lossy Formats====
Lossy compress music, discarding data in order to compress the file to something much smaller than lossless compression and the original PCM stream. The resulting file will sound inferior to the original. Lossy formats can be compressed to varying sizes, with smaller file sized having lower quality.&lt;br&gt;
*'''[[w:MP3|MP3]]''' -The most popular lossy compression format, and the one that is synonymous with digital music. It is supported by all major DAPs and multimedia players. 
*'''[[w:OGG Vorbis|OGG Vorbis]]''' - A higher quality codec than MP3, it is also free, but with limted support from DAPs. It is supported by the Rio Karma and most iRiver [[DAPs]]. 
*'''[[w:WMA|WMA]]''' -
*'''[[w:AAC|AAC]]''' - The format used by iTunes, but with FairPlay DRM. The iPod is the only major DAP to support it.
*'''[[w:RealAudio|Real Audio]]''' -

====Uncompressed Formats====
Uncompressed formats store music in the [[w:PCM|PCM]] format, the same used by the Red Book audio CD format. For 2 Channel, 44.1kHz 16 bit audio, this takes up 1378Kbp/s compared to 192Kbp/s for lossy formats like MP3.

'''[[w:AIFF|AIFF]]''' -

'''[[w:WAV|WAV]]''' -

====Lossless Compressed Formats====
Lossless compression shrinks a music file, without a loss of any sound, and can be decompressed back into the original file. However, at around 75% of the original file, they take up more room than lossy compression formats.

'''[[w:FLAC|FLAC]]''' - A patent free format by the [[w:Xiph.org Foundation|Xiph.org Foundation]], who made Ogg Vorbis.

'''[[w:Apple Lossless|Apple Lossless]] (MP4)''' -

'''[[w:Shorten|Shorten]] (SHN)''' - A lossless file format written by [http://www.tonyrobinson.com/ Tony Robinson].

'''[[w:Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless|Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] (WMA)''' -

===Listening===
There is a wide variety of audio players available for free off of the Internet.  They usually support Audio CDs and MP3s.  Often they also support proprietary formats as well.

'''[[w:iTunes|iTunes]]''' -  Apple's popular audio player which supports listening to CDs, converting audio CDs into a jukebox, making custom CDs, downloading songs off of Apple's iTune store, and listening to streaming radio stations.  iTunes also supports listening to music off other computers running iTunes through a local area network (LAN) and uploading songs to popular MP3 players including Apple's iPod.

'''[[w:Musicmatch|Musicmatch]]''' - Musicmatch similar audio CD features as iTunes.  Plus, it has its own Music store.  One unique feature it supports is the ability to stream any song in the Musicmatch library for a monthly fee.

'''[[w:RealPlayer|RealPlayer]]''' -  

'''[[w:Winamp|Winamp]]''' - Compared to the jukebox style music players, Winamp's GUI is simple and takes up very little screen space.

'''[[w:Windows Media Player|Windows Media Player]]''' -

==Video==
===Media Types===
A media type is how one would store video if they wanted to share it with other people. For example, a DVD is what most new movies are stored on.

'''[[w:DVD|DVD]]-Video''' - The popular format that replaced '''[[w:VHS|VHS]]''' as the standard for hollywood production movies. This standard is only produced by manufactures of large movie companies.  Home users can not produce this format of video. Video is encoded in MPEG2. Audio can be encoded in PCM, MPEG2 Audio, Dolby Digital, and DTS. However, the DVD spec requires that a DVD contain a PCM or Dolby Digital sound track. Up to 8 audio channels may be used.

'''[[w:DVD-R|DVD-R]]''' and '''[[w:DVD plus R|DVD+R]]''' - A popular format for home made DVD movies.  These disc play in most standalone DVD players.  These disc can be single layer or dual layer.  The single layer are relatively inexpensive and can hold 4.7 GB.  The dual layer are very expensive and can hold roughly twice the information.

'''[[w:DVD-RW|DVD-RW]]''' and '''[[w:DVD plus RW|DVD+RW]]''' - A similar format to DVD-R and DVD+R expect it is rewritable.

'''[[w:DVD-RAM|DVD-RAM]]''' - A format that requires a special drive and isn't real popular.  It can support single layer 4.7 GB disc and 9.4 dual layer disc. Like DVD-RW and DVD+RW, it is rewriteable.

'''[[w:Video CD|VCD]]''' - A low quality video disc contraining 1374Mb/s MPEG1 video, the same bitrate as audio CDs. VCDs can be burned onto regular CD-Rs and CD-RWs with a CD burner.

'''[[w:SVCD|SVCD]]''' - Similar to VCD but with slightly higher quality at the cost of not being able to store as much video.

===File Types and Codecs===
A file type is the video itself. For example, if someone had a .mpg file on their computer, that would be the file type. When they put in on a DVD-R disk, they are using DVD-R as the media type.

Uncompressed video is very large. Because of that, many compression formats have been developed. Every file type here is a compressed format. Better yet, every file type here uses lossy compression. This means that in order to make the file smaller, quality is lost. Because of this, it is not a good idea to convert from one format to another because more quality will be lost.

====Codecs====
'''[[w:MPEG-1|MPEG-1]]''': Used for [[w:Video CD|Video CD]]s, and also sometimes for online video. The quality is generally less than that of VHS. Includes the [[w:MP3|MP3]] standard. Stored in a MPEG file.

'''[[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]]''': Used on [[w:DVD|DVD]] and in another form for [[w:SVCD|SVCD]]. When used on a standard DVD, it offers great picture quality and supports widescreen. When used on SVCD, it is not as good but is certainly better than VCD. Unfortunately, SVCD will only fit around 40 minutes of video on a CD, VCD will fit an hour. Stored in a MPEG file.

'''[[w:Windows Media Video|Windows Media Video]] (WMV)''': [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]'s proprietary format. It can do anything from low resolution video for dial up internet users to High Definition video to view on an HD TV. files can be burnt to CD and DVD or output to any number of devices. It is also useful for Media Centre PCs. Stored in a .wmv.

'''[[w:RealVideo|RealVideo]]''': Developed by [[w:Real Networks|Real Networks]]. A popular codec in the earlier days of internet when bandwidth was scarce. Now less popular because the required player adds all kinds of unnecessary extras, and monitors usage behavior.

'''[[w:Sorenson codec|Sorenson 3]]''': A popular codec used by Apple's QuickTime.  Many of the Movie trailers found on the web use this codec.

'''[[w:Cinepak|Cinepak]]''': A very early codec used by Apple's QuickTime.

'''[[w:MPEG4|MPEG4]]''': The latest MPEG codec can be used for internet and on disc like WMV.

'''[[w:DivX|DivX]] &amp; [[w:Xvid|Xvid]]''': Types of MPEG 4. Usually stored in an AVI or OGM file.
====File Types====
A player that can play a certain file type will not be able to play that type of file with a codec it can not play.

'''[[w:AVI|AVI]]''': Used with many different codecs. Can also store uncompressed video. Uses the .avi extension.

'''[[w:OGM|OGM]]''': A file format similar to AVI supporting soft subtitles. Uses the .ogm extension.

'''[[w:MPEG|MPEG]]''': A file format used to store various versions of the MPEG codec. Uses the .mpeg or .mpg extension.

'''[[w:QuickTime|QuickTime]]''': Strickly speaking QuickTime is not a codec, but a file format, API set, and media player developed by Apple.  It supports many popular codecs.  Some of the more popular include Cinepack, Sorenson 3, and MPEG-4 Video.  QuickTime also supports a plug-in architecture that allows other popular codecs such as MPEG 2 and DivX to be added by the user. Uses the .mov extension. And one more product developed by Apple. That is iTune. Used for Downloading MP3 Musics from Various sites. it can easily access to Download Musics Easily.

==Few words about me==
Born in [[1975]].&lt;br /&gt;
I am living in [[Baia Mare]], [[Romania]].&lt;br /&gt;

My primary language is [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. I am able to read [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] because they are [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]] and I am able to understand [[Latin language|Latin]] too. Now, I am learning [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. I knew [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[German language|German]] but I didn't practice them for a long time so...

My profession is [[physician]] but I am also interested in [[anthropology]]+[[paleoanthropology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[history]], [[arts]] ([[dance]], [[music]], [[painting]], [[photography]], etc.), [[psychology]]+[[psychiatry]], etc. etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Monetary policy concerns three main methods of '''government intervention''' in an economy. These are changes in the money supply, the rate of interest and the exchange rate, and are covered in more detail below. They are grouped like this as they directly affect '''aggregate demand''' (but also indirectly affect supply in a variety of ways).

== Money Supply ==
This does exactly what it says on the tin! A government can increase the money supply by printing money or providing incentives for banks to increase the lending of money (not changing interest rates). This results in an increase in the amount of &lt;b&gt;disposable income&lt;/b&gt; people will have to spend on goods and services. This shifts aggregate demand, as ''' AD = C + I + G + (X - M) ''', with consumer spending represented by 'C'.

=== Consequences of changing the Money Supply ===
* Since increasing the money supply can affect AD, then &lt;b&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/b&gt; (cp.) inflation in prices will result at the same time as an increase in output, as can be shown on any [[w:demand and supply| demand and supply]] diagram. A central bank must decide whether the benefits of demand-side economic growth outweigh the costs of potential demand-pull inflation.
* This resultant inflation could cause the currency to depreciate against others, as fewer goods and services can be bought for the same nominal amount of money. This means that the exchange rate is lower, increasing the price of &lt;b&gt;imports&lt;/b&gt; and increasing the competitiveness of &lt;b&gt;exports&lt;/b&gt; with their associated effects on the economy!

== Interest Rates ==

This is the major method of monetary policy used today, although this was not always the case. The rate of interest is a return on savings set by the national bank, meaning that if an individual saves a sum of money in a bank, they will receive a '''rate of interest''' similar to that set by the central bank. Because of this, a change in the rate of interest will result several macroeconomic effects. A rise in interest rates will:
*reduce '''consumption''' and '''investment''', and consequently AD. This is due to the fact that individuals and firms will be more inclined to save wages and profits than invest or spend them, as the return on saving per year is greater
*raise the cost of borrowing from banks, as the rate of interest on repayments is greater. This could further reduce spending and investment
*encourage foreign investment in domestic institutions and firms to increase, as a high rate of return on savings is attractive. High demand for the currency will raise its value (like any other product). This would lead to an increase in the price of exports and a fall in the price of imports, resulting in an increase in imports and fall in exports as they are less competitive globally. This would lead to a fall in AD ( '''X - M''' )
The major purpose of a rise in interest rates is to 'cool down' an economy that is overheating ie. to reduce inflationary pressure due to high aggregate demand and no complementary increase in long run aggregate supply.

The exact opposite applies to a fall in interest rates. A cut in interest rates is often used to aid economic recovery and boost consumer demand, make exports more competitive, and encourage capital investment by firms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. I have removed the following section: &quot;Following this, there was a reaction against what was seen as excessive systematisation of music, with a number of composers (foremost among them [[w:John Cage|John Cage]] and the [[w:New York School|New York School]]) choosing to write music (known as [[w:Aleatoric music|'aleatoric music']]) containing far greater elements of chance. Following this, in the 1970s musical [[w:minimalist music|minimalism]] (as developed by [[w:Steve Reich|Steve Reich]], [[w:Terry Riley|Terry Riley]] and [[w:Philip Glass|Philip Glass]], among others) again attacked serialism (and atonality with it) as being too incomprehensible, suggesting a return to a static form of tonality based on repetition.  The last 25 years have, in general, followed the same pattern of 'reaction' and 'counter-reaction': while some composers (such as [[w:David Del Tredici|David Del Tredici]]) have re-embraced tonality completely, others have moved towards music of ever-increasing complexity and difficulty (most notably [[w:Brian Ferneyhough|Brian Ferneyhough]] and other [[w:New Complexity|New Complexity]] composers).&quot;

2. Cage's music is not a reaction against atonality, and his contributions/innovations really have nothing to do with this topic. (See below, point 6, right after point 5 &quot;this page is hopelessly confused.&quot;)

3. Except for the mention of Del Tredici, the passage above has nothing to do with atonality. If you want to write a history of the reactions against atonality (not serialism), then write about the neo-Romantics (like Del Tredici, but more importantly John Corigliano and John Adams). And quit being so white-centric -- why aren't we writing about atonalists Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman, and the jazz musicians who &quot;reacted&quot; against them? -- this history plays out among African-American composers in countless ways that were actually more widely appreciated by the public.

4. It's true that minimalists rebel against serialism but they don't do it by writing music that is any more tonal or any less atonal-- minimalism generally does nothing more to clarify dissonance/consonance relationships than serialism does. You can write a tonal serial piece, and you can write an atonal minimalist piece. The conflict between serialists/pointillists and minimalists simply has nothing to do with atonality; it is a conflict about the pace at which information unfolds, and the prioritization of one kind of information over another. 

5. This page is hopelessly confused. 

6. John Cage was not opposed to the systemization of music, and chance operations are not &quot;less systematic&quot; than serial operations; in fact, Cage embraced systems more fully than most serial composers, since he used them as a deliberate and rigorous way of distancing musical outcomes from composer control. That ability to separate the composer from the work was a matter of spiritual importance to Cage, and systematization was a deeply important aspect of it. Both Cage's experimentation with aleatoric processes, and the &quot;total serial&quot;/&quot;integral serial&quot; crowd are examples of high modernism, which in general abandons of historical notions of aesthetics or creative language, and favors empirical and experimental approaches to discovering a kind of musical future; the one is no way a reaction against the other.

7. Serialism as a topic needs to be treated separately from atonality; it is just one technique by which composers ensure some kind of structural unity without privileging one note or another. Berg and Schuller and others have elaborately written &quot;tonal&quot; serial works.

8. Grammar/logic: you cannot &quot;assimilate&quot; a language. In the sense being invoked here, it is an intransitive verb; you don't do it &quot;to&quot; a language or culture -- you just do it as a being and doing involves adaptation and accommodation and compromise as part of its intransitive process. (And when it is a transitive verb--a later sense of the word, I think--it has to be done by a culture TO a people, not the other way around. As in &quot;the U.S. assimilated many immigrant cultures in the 19th century.&quot;) 

Assimilation is the process of adjusting to a norm, adapting the values (and sometimes the language) of a dominant culture. It implies undermining the power of your native culture. It's a silly verb to associate with the idea of acquiring a comprehension of a language or growing accustomed to it.





'''Some people claim atonal music is not music in the same way some claim abstract art is not art.
'''

*What about music from the movie &quot;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/ Star Wars]&quot; (1977) ? That was atonal music. [[User:Felixpetrar|Felix Petrar]]

**It is? I've never seen anything about that music being atonal.
***I agree. As far as I can tell it's quite tonal. Was there a specific piece of music that struck you as being atonal?  [[User:Acipolone|A.C.]]
****Overall, the music is tonal, but if you limit the meaning of tonal to its technical definition- that is, as every note fitting into tonality in a 17th century way - very little music is &quot;tonal&quot; as such. For practicality's sake, the layman term tonality refers to music following key structurs, maintaining the primacy of the V-I, etc. I would consider most film music to be more influenced by romanticism than classical music, and so it is not TECHNICALLY tonal.

In programming, a variable is a container for data that the program can change. You typically declare variables before you use them to provide information on what kind of data they should store.  However, Fortran allows variables to be created implicitly.  Absent an &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT&lt;/code&gt; statement, undeclared variables and arguments beginning with &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; (the &quot;in&quot; group) will be &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;, and all other undeclared variables and arguments will be &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.

Many consider using variables without declaring them bad practice.  If you want to be forced to declare variables, code &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT NONE&lt;/code&gt; first.

Examples of variables:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 INTEGER, PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7 ! declare a constant, whose value cannot be changed
 INTEGER            :: i, j(2), k(0:1), m(3,4) ! declare i as an integer, j as an array of 2
                                               ! integers from j(1) to j(2), k as an array
                                               ! of 2 integers from '''k(0)''' to k(1), and m as a 2-dimensional 
                                               ! array of 12 elements
 REAL               :: c(0:3) ! declare c as an array of 4 floating point numbers from c(0) to c(3)
 CHARACTER (LEN=5)  :: word   ! declare word as a string of length 5
 LOGICAL            :: tf     ! declare a boolean variable with values .TRUE. or .FALSE.
&lt;/source&gt;
The following does exactly the same thing, but in the shorter, more archaic form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 INTEGER, PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7
 DIMENSION j(2), k(0:1), m(3,4), c(0:3)
 CHARACTER*5 word
 LOGICAL tf
&lt;/source&gt;
If memory layout counts to you, note that m(1,1) is followed in memory by m(2,1), and not by m(1,2).

A variable can be set by placing it before an equal sign, which is followed by the value to which it is set. Given the declarations above, the following assignments are possible:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 i    = 3*4                 ! set i to 3*4 = 12         
 j    = (/1,4/)             ! set j(1) to 1, j(2) to 4
 c    = (/1.0,4.0,5.0,9.0/) ! set c(0) to 1.0, c(1) to 4.0, c(2) to 5.0, c(3) to 9.0
 word = 'dog'               ! set word = &quot;dog  &quot; . The variable word is padded with spaces on the right
 tf   = .TRUE.              ! set tf to True
&lt;/source&gt;

A variable can appear on both sides of an assignment. The right hand side is evaluated first, and the variable is then assigned to that value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 i = 3     ! i has value 3
 i = i**i  ! i has value 3**3 = 27
&lt;/source&gt;

Variables can be converted from one type to another, but unlike in C++ or Java where you would typecast the variable, in Fortran you use the intrinsic procedures:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 REAL             :: r = 1.5
 DOUBLE PRECISION :: d = 1.5
 INTEGER          :: i = 1
 PRINT *, DBLE(r), DBLE(d), DBLE(i)   ! Convert number to a double precision
 PRINT *, REAL(r), REAL(d), REAL(i)   ! Convert number to a single precision (REAL)
 PRINT *, INT(r), INT(d), INT(i)      ! Convert number to an integer
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, the same thing in the simpler, archaic form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 DOUBLE PRECISION d = 1.5
 r = 1.5
 i = 1
 PRINT *, DBLE(r), DBLE(d), DBLE(i)
 PRINT *, REAL(r), REAL(d), REAL(i)
 PRINT *, INT(r), INT(d), INT(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

A Fortran program reads from [[w:standard_input|standard input]] or from a file using the '''read''' statement, and it can write to [[w:standard_output|standard output]] using the '''print''' statement. With the '''write''' statement one can write to standard output or to a file. Before writing to a file, the file must be opened and assigned a unit number with which the programmer may reference the file. If one wishes to use the '''write''' statement to write a statement to the default output, the syntax is write(*,*). It is used as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Fortran&quot;&gt;
program HelloWorld
  implicit none
  write(*,*) &quot;Hello World!&quot;
end program
&lt;/source&gt;

This code writes &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the default output (usually standard output, the screen), similar to if one had used the print* statement. 

As a demonstration of file output, the following program reads two integers from the keyboard and writes them and their product to an output file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Fortran&quot;&gt;
program xproduct
  implicit none
  integer            :: i,j
  integer, parameter :: out_unit=20

  print*,&quot;enter two integers&quot;
  read (*,*) i,j

  open (unit=out_unit,file=&quot;results.txt&quot;,action=&quot;write&quot;,status=&quot;replace&quot;)
  write (out_unit,*) &quot;The product of&quot;,i,&quot; and&quot;,j
  write (out_unit,*) &quot;is&quot;,i*j
  close (out_unit)
end program xproduct
&lt;/source&gt;

The file &quot;results.txt&quot; will contain these lines:

&lt;pre&gt;
 The product of 2 and 3
 is 6
&lt;/pre&gt;

Each print or write statement on a new line by default starts printing on a new line. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Fortran&quot;&gt;
program HelloWorld
  implicit none

  print*,&quot;Hello&quot;
  print*,&quot;World!&quot;
end program
&lt;/source&gt;

Prints, to standard output:

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello
World!
&lt;/pre&gt;

If one had put &quot;Hello World!&quot; in one print statement, the text &quot;Hello World!&quot; would have appeared on one line.

''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

== Hello_World.f ==

Below is a simple Fortran program. You can paste this into a text editor (such as [[w:GNU Emacs|Emacs]] or [[w:Vim_(text_editor)|Vim]].) Source code must be in a plain text file, so don't use a word processor (such as [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]), because its native format is usually not plain text, or otherwise contains special formatting data.

Give the file a name such as '''hello.f''' - common Fortran file suffixes are '''.f''', '''.FOR''', '''.for''', '''.f77''', '''.f90''' and '''.f95'''. You may also use '''.F''', '''.fpp''' and '''.FPP''' (which support [[Fortran/Preprocessed Files|Preprocessing]]).

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       program hello
          print *, &quot;Hello World!&quot;
       end program hello
&lt;/source&gt;
or the archaic but shorter form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       PRINT *, &quot;Hello World!&quot;
       END
&lt;/source&gt;

Fixed format source code needs 6 spaces before code begins, but the free source form of Fortran 90 does not.

Because Fortran is case insensitive, one could just as easily write the first 'hello' program as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
      Program Hello
      Print *, &quot;Hello World!&quot;
      End Program Hello
&lt;/source&gt;

The only case sensitive part of this program is what contained in the quotation marks of the print statement. (&quot;Hello World!&quot;)

==Compiling==

=== Unix ===

There are several Fortran compilers available for Unix. Among the most popular are:

* Fortran 95 optimizing compiler from [[w:Oracle Solaris Studio|Oracle Solaris Studio]]. Invocation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
f95 -o hello hello.f
&lt;/source&gt;

* G95, a compiler compliant with the Fortran 95 standard. Some of Fortran 2003 standard features are also supported. Invocation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
g95 -o hello hello.f90
&lt;/source&gt;

* GNU Fortran compiler from the [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], which is a fork of G95. Invocation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
gfortran -o hello hello.f90
&lt;/source&gt;
Note: the GNU Fortran compiler uses the Fortran 77 standard by default, so the input file must have the &lt;tt&gt;.f90&lt;/tt&gt; (or of later standard) suffix, so that the compiler can guess the desired standard automatically. Alternatively you can supply the &lt;code&gt;-ffree-form&lt;/code&gt; option with the usual &lt;tt&gt;.f&lt;/tt&gt; suffix to enable free-form format instead of the fixed-form format used by the Fortran 77 standard.

Once the program is compiled and linked, you may execute it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./hello
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Windows ===

On Windows, you will need to install a compiler. You may also want to install an [[w:Integrated development environment|IDE]] for that compiler, which acts as an editor and allows you to compile the program more easily.

When you have a [[w:compiler|compiler]], open a command prompt (MS-DOS prompt). This looks like
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
 C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
or something similar. At the prompt, you need to move into the folder containing the .f90 file. Then, to compile, type
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
 f95 hello.f90 -o hello.exe
&lt;/source&gt;
This assumes the compiler is called &quot;f95&quot;. The Intel compiler is typically &quot;ifort&quot;. You may need to specify where this is, for example if it's in Program Files\Compiler, use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
 &quot;C:\Program Files\Compiler\f95&quot; hello.f90 -o hello.exe
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, you could install a text editor with support for Fortran compilers. Such as SciTE [http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html]
The above commands produce an executable called '''hello.exe''' - to run this, just type
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
 hello
&lt;/source&gt;
at the command prompt

=== OpenVMS ===

On VMS you will need the DEC Fortran90 compiler installed and licenses loaded. This is available as part of the hobbyist project. These commands work for Fortran on both Alpha and VAX.

To compile, type the following at the DCL prompt:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ FORTRAN HELLO.F
&lt;/source&gt;

To link the file to the Run-Time Lib (RTL) type the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ LINK HELLO.OBJ
&lt;/source&gt;

To Run the executable image, type the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ RUN HELLO.EXE
Hello World!
$
&lt;/source&gt;

Enjoy all that VMS and Fortran offers.

''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

Fortran has the following arithmetic operators:
:'''+''' addition
:'''-''' subtraction
:'''*''' multiplication
:'''/''' division
:'''**''' exponentiation (associates right-to-left)

Here are some examples of their use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 i = 2 + 3   ! sets i equal to 5
 i = 2 * 3   ! sets i equal to 6
 i = 2 / 3   ! sets i equal to 0, since 2/3 is rounded down to the integer 0, see mixed mode
 x = 2 / 3.0 ! sets x approximately equal to 2/3 or 0.666667
 i = 2 ** 3  ! sets i equal to 2*2*2 = 8
&lt;/source&gt;

Fortran has a wide range of functions useful in numerical work, such as '''sin''', '''exp''', and '''log'''. The argument of a function must have the proper type, and it is enclosed in parentheses:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 x = sin(3.14159) ! sets x equal to sin(pi), which is zero
&lt;/source&gt;


The intrinsic math functions of Fortran are '''elemental''', meaning that they can take arrays as well as scalars as arguments and return a scalar or an array of the same shape:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 real :: x(2),pi=3.14159
 x = sin((/pi,pi/2/))
&lt;/source&gt;

The above program fragment sets the two elements of array x, x(1) and x(2), equal to sin(pi) and sin(pi/2) respectively.

''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

==Selection==
=== if ===
:''if (...) then ... else ... end if''
Fortran has a block-if statement of the form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 if (logical expression1)      then
    ''Lines of Fortran''
 else if (logical expression2) then
    ''Lines of Fortran''
 else if (logical expression3) then
    ''Lines of Fortran''
 else
    ''Lines of Fortran''
 end if
&lt;/source&gt;

The following operators can be used when making the logical expression:
*Greater than or less than
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 .GT. .LT. &gt; &lt;
&lt;/source&gt;
*Greater than or equal to or less than or equal to
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 .GE. .LE. &gt;= &lt;=
&lt;/source&gt;
*Equal to and Not equal to
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 .EQ. .NE. == /=
&lt;/source&gt;

To check more than one statement, use &lt;code&gt;.AND.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.OR.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.NOT.&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 IF ((a .GT. b) .AND.NOT. (a .LT. c)) THEN
&lt;/source&gt;

The following program generates a random number between 0 and 1 and tests if it is between 0 and 0.3, 0.3 and 0.6, or between 0.6 and 1.0.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 program xif
    implicit none
    real :: x
    real, parameter :: x1 = 0.3, x2 = 0.6
    call random_seed()
    call random_number(x)
    if (x &lt; x1) then
       print*,x,&quot;&lt;&quot;,x1
    else if (x &lt; x2) then
       print*,x,&quot;&lt;&quot;,x2
    else
       print*,x,&quot;&gt;=&quot;,x2
    end if
 end program xif
&lt;/source&gt;

There are two interesting archaic forms of &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 IF (''logicalExpression'') GO TO ''lineNumber''
 IF (''arithmeticExpression'') ''firstLineNumber'', ''secondLineNumber'', ''thirdLineNumber''
&lt;/source&gt;
In the first form, things are pretty straightforward.  In the second form, the arithmetic expression is evaluated.  If the expression evaluates to a negative number, then execution continues at the first line number.  If the expression evaluates to zero, then execution continues at the second line number.  Otherwise, execution continues at the third line number.

===case (switch)===
:''select case(...) case (...); ... end select''
If an if block consists of repeated tests on a single variable, it may be possible to replace it with a '''select case''' construct. For example, the code
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 if      (month == &quot;January&quot;)  then
    num_days = 31
 else if (month == &quot;February&quot;) then
    num_days = 28
    print *,&quot;You can put more stuff here.&quot;
 else if (month == &quot;March&quot;)    then
    num_days = 31
 else
    num_days = 30
 end if
&lt;/source&gt;
can be replaced by
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 select case (month)
    case (&quot;January&quot;)
       num_days = 31
    case (&quot;February&quot;)
       num_days = 28
       print *,&quot;You can put more stuff here.&quot;
    case (&quot;March&quot;)
       num_days = 31
    case default
       num_days = 30
 end select
&lt;/source&gt;
Fortran does not need a break statement.

==Loops==
:''do i=1,10 ... end do''
To iterate, Fortran has a '''do''' loop. The following loop prints the squares of the integers from 1 to 10:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=1,10
    print*,i**2
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;


One can exit a loop early using exit, as shown in the code below, which prints the squares of integers until one of the squares exceeds 25.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=1,10
    isquare = i**2
    if (isquare &gt; 25) exit
    print*,isquare
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;

Loops can be nested. The following code prints powers 2 through 4 of the integers from 1 to 10
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=1,10
    do ipower=1,3
       print*,i,ipower,i**ipower
    end do
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;
In an archaic form of &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt;, a line number on which the loop(s) end is used.  Here's the same loop, explicitly stating that line 1 is the last line of each loop:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 DO 1 i=1,10
    DO 1 ipower=1,3
       1 PRINT *,i,ipower,i**ipower
&lt;/source&gt;
If using the archaic form, the loop must not end on an &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GO TO&lt;/code&gt; statement.  You may use a &lt;code&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/code&gt; statement instead in these cases.

There is also an optional increment argument when declaring a '''do''' loop.  The following will count up by two's. 2, 4, 6, ...
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=2,10,2
    write (*,*) i
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;

Arguments to the do loop don't have to be numbers, they can be any integer that is defined elsewhere in the program. ''start, end,'' and ''increment'' can be any variable name.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=start,end,increment
     ''code goes here''
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;

==Simple statements==

&lt;code&gt;GO TO ''statementNumber''&lt;/code&gt; will jump to the specified statement number.

&lt;code&gt;STOP ''conditionCode''&lt;/code&gt; will stop with the specified condition code or exit code.  &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; may be coded without an argument.  Note that on many systems, &lt;code&gt;STOP 0&lt;/code&gt; is still a failure.

&lt;code&gt;EXIT&lt;/code&gt; will leave a loop.

&lt;code&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/code&gt; can be used to end an archaic &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; loop when it would otherwise end on an &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;CYCLE&lt;/code&gt; will transfer the control of the program to the next &lt;code&gt;END DO&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; leaves a subroutine or function.

== Organizing wikibooks ==

Hi Noogz, I noticed that you started to spread the word about splitting up books. If you do so, don`t forget to provide a link to a recent discussion and recently converted book, like [[How To Build A Computer]], and the advice giving there: [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. There are many ways of splitting up books wrongly, and it is much harder to move all pages once the book has been split. (Not all new users might know about subpages via &quot;/&quot;.) Also, please point to [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. I welcome your initiatives. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:13, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Concurrent''' programming is a computer programming technique that provides for the execution of operations concurrently - either within a single computer, or across a number of systems. In the latter case, the term distributed computing is used. Multiprocessor machines achieve better performance by taking advantage of this kind of programming.

Concurrent programming is now the only way to make a CPU-intensive program run twice as fast.
(Historically another popular approach was to wait a couple of years for a CPU with twice the clock speed to show up, but that trend ended around 2003).&lt;ref&gt;

In parallel programming, single tasks are split into a number of subtasks that can be computed relatively independently and then aggregated to form a single coherent solution. Parallel programming is most effective for tasks that can easily broken down into independent tasks such as purely mathematical problems, e.g., factorisation. 

One way to achieve parallel programming is through distributed computing, which is a method of information processing in which work is performed by separate computers linked through a communications network.

== Mutual Exclusion==
;'''Definition'''
:Formally defined and solved by E.W. Dijkstra in 1965 [D65].

:We have a collection of processes that alternate  repeatedly between two sections of code: non-critical section and critical section(CS). The problem is to provide a synchronisation algorithm in the form of a trying and an exit protocol to be executed, respectively, immediately before and after the CS: 

* non-critical section 
* trying protocol 
* critical section 
* exit protocol

:, so that the following properties hold:

:*Mutual Exclusion 
::No two processes are in their CS at the same time. 
:*Lockout-freedom 
::If a process enter the trying protocol, then it eventually enters the CS.
:*Absence of unnecessary delay: 
::A process attempting to enter its critical section is prevented from doing so only by another process that is executing its critical section or by other processes attempting to enter their critical sections.
:*Bounded exit
::If a process enters the exit protocol, then it enter the non-critical section within a bounded number of its own steps.

==Solutions of Mutual Exclusion==
:According to [Y03], there are thousands of solutions of mutual exclusion, some invented by clever experts, some found by brute force approaches with a computer. 

:Here are some famous ones:
;'''Dijkstra's algorithm'''
:The first try.
:According to [K66][D67], this algorithm allows for the possibility that an individual computer, when contending for access, might have to wait indefinitely.
;'''Lamport's bakery algorithm'''
For ease of understanding, we begin with 2 processes with a modified version of the original bakery algorithm:
:'''For 2 processes'''
&lt;code c&gt;  
  Process p0 {
    // non-critical section
    // entry protocol
    &lt;u&gt;turn0 = 1;&lt;/u&gt;
    turn0 = turn1 + 1;
    while( turn1 != 0 &amp;&amp; turn0 &gt; turn1);
    //critical section
    turn0 = 0;
  }
  
  Process p1 {
    // non-critical section
    // entry protocol
    &lt;u&gt;turn1 = 1;&lt;/u&gt;
    turn1 = turn0 + 1;
    while( turn0 != 0 &amp;&amp; turn1 &gt;= turn0);
    //critical section
    turn1 = 0;
  } 
&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Informal proof'''
:*Suppose p0 is attempting to enter its critical section while p1 is in its non-critical section. Then, p0 gains access because turn1 is 0;
:*Suppose p0 is attempting to enter its critical section while p1 is in its critical section. Then, p0 will busy wait because turn 1 is not 0 and turn0 was set to be greater than turn1. When p1 finishes its critical section, it sets turn1 to 0. There are two subcases. In each case, p0 will enter its critical section.
:**If p1 is executing in its non-critical section when p0 tests turn1(i.e., turn1 is 0), then p0 will enter its critical section.
:**On the other hand, p1 might finish its non-critical section and set turn1 to turn0+1 as part of its entry protocol. When p0 retests this condition, it will find it false because turn1 is greater than turn0. So, p0 will enter its critical section.
:*Suppose that p0 and p1 begin execution of their entry protocols at about the same time and each completes their first assignment statement; so, each turn variable is 1. Suppose further that, say, p0 completes its second assignment statement and evaluates its condition before p1 executes its second assignment statement; so, turn0 is 2 and turn1 is 1. Then p0 will wait while p1 continues to execute and sets turn1 to 3. '''Note how one process setting its turn variable to 1 forces the other process to wait until the first process has finished picking its value for the turn variable.'''
:*Suppose p0 and p1 are as in the previous case.  They complete their first assignment statements, which set each turn variable to 1. Suppose now that execution of the second assignment statement is interleaved at the machine instruction level. Then the following execution ordering can occur:
:**p0 reads turn1's value (1);
:**p1 reads turn0's value (1);
:**p0 adds 1 and stores the result (2) into turn0;
:**p1 adds 1 and stores the result (2) into turn1;
::Although the turn variables have equal values. p1 will defer to p0 because its condition uses &gt;= whereas p0's uses &gt;.
:'''Why underline codes?'''
:The necessity of underline codes might not be obvious. 
:See [http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/classes/ecs150-1999-02/sync-bakery.html UCDAVIS: Bakery Algorithm] for an in-depth discussion.
:'''For N processes'''
&lt;code c&gt;
  // declaration and initial values of global variables
  Entering: array [1..N] of bool = {false};
  Number: array [1..N] of integer = {0};
      
  lock(integer i)
  {
    Entering[i] = true;
    Number[i] = 1 + max(Number[1], ..., Number[N]);
    Entering[i] = false;
    for (j = 1; j &lt;= N; j++) {
      // Wait until thread j receives its number:
      while (Entering[j]) { /* nothing */ }
      // Wait until all threads with smaller numbers or with the same
      // number, but with higher priority, finish their work:
      while ((Number[j] != 0) &amp;&amp; ((Number[j], j) &lt; (Number[i], i))) {
      /* nothing */
      }
    }
  }
  unlock(integer i) { Number[i] = 0; }
  
  Thread(integer i) {
    while (true) {
        lock(i);
        // The critical section goes here...
        unlock(i);
        // non-critical section...
    }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;

:In the pseudocode there is a comparison of the form:

&lt;code c&gt;
(a, b) &lt; (c, d)
&lt;/code&gt;
:which is equivalent to:

&lt;code c&gt;
(a &lt; c) or ((a == c) and (b &lt; d))
&lt;/code&gt;

:'''Why call it the bakery algorithm?'''
:Lamport envisioned a bakery with a numbering machine at its entrance. So each customer is given a unique number. Numbers increase by one as customers enter the store. A global counter displays the number of the customer that is currently being served. All other customers must wait in a queue until the baker finishes serving the current customer and the next number is displayed. When done shopping, the customer loses its number and it can then do whatever it wants, except that it cannot shop without getting a new number.

In computer science, '''imperative programming''', as opposed to [[W:declarative programming|declarative programming]], is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of a [[W:program state|program state]] and statements that change the program state.  In much the same way as the [[W:imperative mood|imperative mood]] in natural languages expresses commands to take action, imperative programs are a sequence of commands for the computer to perform.  The hardware implementation of almost all computers is imperative; nearly all computer hardware is designed to execute [[W:machine code|machine code]], which is native to the computer, written in the imperative style.  From this low-level perspective, the program state is defined by the contents of memory, and the statements are instructions in the native machine language of the computer.  Higher-level imperative languages use [[W:variable|variable]]s and more complex statements, but still follow the same [[W:paradigm|paradigm]].  Recipes and process checklists, while not computer programs, are also familiar concepts that are similar in style to imperative programming; each step is an instruction, and the physical world holds the state.  Since the basic ideas of imperative programming are both conceptually familiar and directly embodied in the hardware, most computer languages are in the imperative style.

If you want activated regions only, then you should apply a t-test (F tests find differences in 'any' direction while t-tests distinguish between directions).

There are some predefined contrasts in SPM when you estimate a model (e.g. the &quot;effects of interest&quot; f-contrast). If you hadn't defined your
control (or baseline) task then it would find areas activated for stimulus A and also areas activated for stimulus B.

[[Cell Biology/Cell types/Eukaryotes|&lt;&lt; Eukaryotes]] | Unique Properties of Plant Cells

Plant Cells have a number of important differences compared to their animal counterparts. The major ones are the Chloroplasts, Cell walls and Vacuoles. Unlike animal cells, plant cells do not have centrioles.

== Chloroplasts ==
The chloroplasts are an organelle similar to the mitochondria in that they are self reproducing and they are the energy factories of the cell.they are near the large center vacuole. There most of the similarities ends. Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and convert it into ATP and sugar. In this way the cell can support itself without food.

== Vacuoles ==
Plants often have large structures containing water surrounded by a membrane in the center of their cells. These are vacuoles and act as a store of water and food (in seeds), a place to dump wastes and a structural support for the cell to maintain turgor. When the plant loses water the vacuoles quickly lose their water, and when plants have a lot of water the vacuoles fill up. In mature plants there is usually one large vacuole in the centre of the cell.

== Cell walls ==
Plant cells are not flaccid like animal cells and have a rigid cell wall around them made of fibrils of cellulose embedded in a matrix of several other kinds of polymers such as pectin and lignin. The cellulose molecules are linear and provide the perfect shape for intermolecular hydrogen bonding to produce long, stiff fibrils. It is the cell wall that is primarily responsible for ensuring the cell does not burst in hypotonic surroundings.

Commercially produced '''Grits''' are coarsely ground [[Cookbook:Hominy|hominy]] ([[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], treated with [[Cookbook:Lye|lye]]). [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|Corn masa]] is similar, but more finely ground. Traditional grits are stone-ground maize (corn) that has been sifted to isolate the middle-sized granules, coarser than the product used in baking as corn meal.  

Grits are a common breakfast food in the southern USA. They are often served much like [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]] or as a side dish with fried or scrambled eggs. Unlike oatmeal, grits are often topped with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]].

The basic recipe for preparing quick-cooking hominy grits:

4 cups boiling water,
1 cup grits,
1/2 to 1 tsp. salt,
black pepper to taste,
(butter or margarine),
(grated cheddar cheese),

4 - 6 servings.

Bring the water to a boil in a 1 - 2 quart saucepan. Add the grits, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally until until grits begin to thicken. Cover and continue to cook on low heat for about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid sticking. Stir in a small amount of water if the grits become too thick. Correct the seasoning before serving, adding black pepper to taste. Serve with a pat of margarine, butter, or grated cheese on top.

The recipe above may be used to prepare stone-ground grits, but cooking time must be increased to at least 25 minutes. Some cooks prefer a longer cooking time--approximately 45 to 50 minutes. If the grits become too thick or begin to stick, stir in 1/8 - 1/4 cup boiling water. Many Southerners prefer to substitute milk for 1 or 2 cups of the water, especially if the grits are to be served as part of a main dish, such as shrimp and grits. 

Note: This recipe will work for smaller quantities of grits, using a 4:1 ratio of water to grits.</text>

'''Hominy''', also known as '''nixtamal''', is [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] treated with [[Cookbook:Lye|lye]].
The corn is soaked in water with lye to remove the hard outer hulls. This process makes the corn more palatable, easier to digest, and easier to process. The process also converts some of the niacin in the maize into a form more absorbable by the body.

Some recipes using hominy include [[Cookbook:Menudo|menudo]], a [[Cookbook:Tripe|tripe]] and hominy stew; [[Cookbook:Pozole|pozole]], a [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and hominy stew; [[Cookbook:Hominy Bread|hominy bread]]; [[Cookbook:Hominy Chili|hominy chili]]; [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans#Enameled Cast Iron|casseroles]] and [[Cookbook:Fry|fried]] dishes. Hominy can be ground coarsely to make [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]], or into a fine mash to make [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa]] for [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]] and [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]].

If you dare to make hominy yourself, you can try the [[Cookbook:Hominy recipe|recipe]] for it.

=Why bother setting up a production company?=

==One company per project==
''As a disclaimer, the legal information provided in this section should not be taken as 100% true and is merely sourced from some second-hand knowledge and my experience. You should ALWAYS contact a business lawyer to confirm legalities, especially in the formation of partnerships and companies in the name of business.''

Some people suggest that you should setup one company per project - specifically an LLC. An LLC has advantages over a corporation for many reasons that work towards streamlining (ie no shareholder meeting, simple operating agreements instead of strict rules and guidelines, etc) the business process; in other words, decisions can be made quickly without chain-of-command consultation. From the Wikipedia Entry on [[w:LLC|LLC]]s:
::'One reason that businesses choose to be organized as an LLC is to avoid &quot;double taxation.&quot; A traditional corporation is taxed on its income, and then when the profits are distributed to the owners of the corporation (i.e., the shareholders), then those dividends are also taxed. With an LLC, income of the LLC is not taxed, but each owner of the LLC (i.e., each member) is taxed based on its pro rata allocable portion of the LLC's taxable income, regardless of whether any distributions to the members are made. This single level of taxation can lead to significant savings over the corporate form. Similarly, under some circumstances, members of an LLC may deduct losses of the LLC on their personal tax returns.'
By creating an LLC under ownership of a corporation or a single proprietor, not only are rights more easily transferred (ie if rights belonging to an owner is sold to a separate owner), but in terms of profits and losses, if a film bombs (ie fails or results in more expenses than profits), it may be written as a tax writeoff, as losses can be deducted in the United States. However, as with any incorporating action, there are a series of legalities that follows that may be undesirable, of which I don't know the exact specifics.

Before incorporating under an LLC, please contact a lawyer or legal consultant, especially one that is trained in business-related law. Incorporation is no simple matter and comes with its own pitfalls, as deceptively simple as the forms may be.

=Choosing a name for your production company=

==UK==

1) Check with the names database at companies house: http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk

2) Check to see if your name is already used on a website: Use this page for .uk domains: http://www.nominet.org.uk/   (use the search on the bottom left)

3) Check with companies house to make sure you're not using any banned words or phrases.

=Registering your production company=

==UK==

A solicitor will charge around £200 to set-up a limited company; by following the guide below you can do it yourself for just over £40. That said, this is not legal advice, and if you have any doubts or queries you should contact a solicitor, accountant, and/or Companies House. 

# Download form 10 and form 12 from the Companies’ House website. Download form 10cs if you have more than two directors.

== Overview ==

The standard Ada libraries provide several Input/Output facilities, each one adapted to specific needs. Namely, the language defines the following dedicated packages:
* Text_IO
* Sequential_IO
* Direct_IO
* Stream_IO

The programmer must choose the adequate package depending on the application needs. For example, the following properties of the data handled by the application should be considered:
* '''Data contents''': plain text, or binary data?
* '''Accessing the data''': random access, or sequential access?
* '''Medium''': data file, console, network/data-bus?
* '''Data structure''': homogeneous file (sequence of the same data field), heterogeneous file (different data fields)?
* '''Data format''': adherence to an existing data format, or the application can freely choose a new one?

For example, Stream_IO is very powerful and can handle complex data structures but can be heavier than other packages; Sequential_IO is lean and easy to use but cannot be used by applications requiring random data access; Text_IO can handle just textual data, but it is enough for handling the command-line console.


The following table gives some advices for choosing the more adequate one:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Simple heuristics for choosing an I/O package'''
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Data access
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Plain text
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Binary data
|-
! Homogeneous || Heterogeneous
|-
! Sequential
| Text_IO || Sequential_IO || Stream_IO
|-
! Random
| Stream_IO || Direct_IO || Stream_IO
|}

So the most important lesson to learn is choosing the right one. This chapter will describe more in detail these standard packages, explaining how to use them effectively. Besides these Ada-defined packages for general I/O operations each Ada compiler usually has other implementation-defined Input-Output facilities, and there are also other [[Ada Programming#Other Language Libraries|external libraries for specialized I/O needs]] like XML processing or interfacing with databases.

== Text I/O ==

[[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Text_IO|Text I/O]] is probably the most used Input/Output package. All data inside the file are represented by human readable text. Text I/O provides support for line and page layout but the standard is free form text.

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
  
 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Main {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   Str  {{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} String {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}1 {{Ada/delimiter|1=..}} 80{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
   Last {{Ada/delimiter|1=:}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
   Ada{{Ada/delimiter|1=.}}Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|1=.}}Get_Line {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}Str{{Ada/delimiter|1=,}} Last{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
   Ada{{Ada/delimiter|1=.}}Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|1=.}}Put_Line {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}Str {{Ada/delimiter|1=(}}1 {{Ada/delimiter|1=..}} Last{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=)}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|1=;}}

This example copies text from standard input to standard output when all lines are shorter than 80 characters, the string length. See package [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Text_IO|Text I/O]] how to deal with longer lines.

The package also contains several generic packages for converting numeric and enumeration types to character strings; there are child packages for handling Bounded and Unbounded strings, allowing the programmer to read and write different data types in the same file easily (there are ready-to-use instantiations of these generic packages for the Integer, Float, and Complex types). Finally, the same family of Ada.Text_IO packages (including the several children and instantiation packages) for the type Wide_Character and Wide_Wide_Character.

It is worth noting that the family of Text_IO packages provide some automatic text processing. For example, the Get procedures for numeric and enumeration types ignore white space at the beginning of a line (Get_Line for String does not present this behavior), or adding line and page terminators when closing the file. This is thus adequate for applications handling simple textual data, but users requiring direct management of text (e.g. raw access to the character encoding) must consider other packages like Sequential_IO.

== Direct I/O ==

Direct I/O is used for random  access files which contain only elements of one specific type. With Direct_IO you can position the file pointer to any element of that type &lt;small&gt;(random access)&lt;/small&gt;, however you can't freely choose the element type, the element type needs to be a [[ada Programming/Subtypes#definite_subtype|definite subtype]].

== Sequential I/O ==

Direct I/O is used for random access files which contain only elements of one specific type. With Sequential_IO it is the other way round: you can choose between [[ada Programming/Subtypes#definite_subtype|definite]] and [[ada Programming/Subtypes#Ada Programming/Subtypes#indefinite_subtype|indefinite]] element types but you have to read and write the elements one after the other.

== Stream I/O ==

Stream I/O is the most powerful input/output package which Ada provides. Stream I/O allows you to mix objects from different element types in one sequential file. In order to read/write from/to a stream each type provides a [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Read|'Read]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Write|'Write]] attribute as well as an [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Input|'Input]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Output|'Output]] attribute. These attributes are automatically generated for each type you declare.

The [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Read|'Read]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Write|'Write]] attributes treat the elements as raw data. They are suitable for low level input/output as well as interfacing with other programming languages.

The [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Input|'Input]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Output|'Output]] attributes add additional control information to the file, like for example the [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'First|'First]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Last|'Last]] attributes for an array.

In object orientated programming you can also use the [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Class|'Class]][[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Input|'Input]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Class|'Class]][[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Output|'Output]] attributes - they will store and recover the actual object type as well.

Stream I/O is also the most flexible input/output package. All I/O attributes can be replaced with user defined functions or procedures using representation clauses and you can provide your own Stream I/O types using flexible object oriented techniques.

A '''Calorie''' or '''kilocalorie''' (sometimes '''kcal''', '''C''', '''Cal''' or less accurately '''calorie''' or '''cal''') is a unit of energy; it is equal to 4185.5 [[w:Joule|Joules]] or 3.968 [[W:Btu|Btu]].

Calories provide the energy needed for growth and activity. Consumable calories come from four main sources: [[Cookbook:Protein|proteins]],  [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Cookbook:Fat|fats]] and [[Cookbook:Alcohol|alcohol]].

Proteins provide 4 calories per gram, and are found large concentrations in [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]], [[Cookbook:Meat and Poultry|meats, poultry]], and [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]].

Fats, such as [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], and [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], supply 9 calories per gram.

Like proteins, carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram. Foods with high concentrations of carbohydrates are sweet or starchy, such as [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugars]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], and [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]. Carbohydrates can lead to one ingesting more calories than the numbers suggest, because carbohydrates do not suppress appetite as well as proteins and fats do.

Alcohol provides 7 calories per gram, but is not recommended as a dependable source of energy, due to health problems related to its over-consumption.

==Decreasing Caloric Intake==

Some people may wish to decrease their caloric intake in order to lose weight, for appearance, health or overall well-being. Decreasing caloric intake can be done through reducing the overall amount of food one eats, switching to lower-calorie foods, or a combination of both methods.

==Increasing Caloric Intake==

Some people may need to increase their caloric intake in order to gain weight, or just in the short-term for increased energy.

One can increase the calorie content of one's food by adding [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and fat. A tasty way to do this is by [[Cookbook:Fry|frying]] food; in particular the [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat]] method adds a large amount of fat to food. Oil can be added to many [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]], without lessening the enjoyment of the soup, for increased calories.

Normally low-calorie foods such as [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] can be enhanced by adding [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Salad dressing|salad dressing]], cheese [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]], and [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]]. [[Cookbook:Fruit|Fruits]] can be treated with [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]. Many snack foods, such as pretzels and crackers, can be dipped in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]].

If one is increasing his/her caloric intake for a shorter-term jolt of energy (such as for running a race), greatly increasing consumption of fats is not recommended. Typically, in the day or two before the needed energy boost, one should consume a larger amount of carbohydrates.

=Software=

There is a large variety of software available, ranging from free solutions such as Windows Movie Maker/iMovie (included with any new PC/Mac), to professional solutions like Adobe Premier Pro (available for Windows and Mac OSX) and Final Cut Pro (Mac OSX only).  There is also a number of programs in between: Adobe offers Premier Elements, essentially a stripped down version of Premier Pro, for more basic editing.  Apple likewise offers Final Cut Express.  If you are building a workstation specifically for editing, you are probably looking at something like Premier Pro.  It should be noted that Adobe offers a Production Package that includes a number of titles from the Adobe family, including Premier, AfterEffects, and Photoshop Extended, all of which can be very useful for even more advanced editing than what Premier alone offers.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt; A quickstarter &lt;/b&gt; is a feature that can be found in the ''system tray'' (at the bottom right of the computer, along with the clock etc. (at least on MS Windows Operating Systems). Basically it serves to accelerate the process of starting programs such as OpenOffice.org. In OpenOffice.org it typically reduces the time taken to load the initial document from maybe 50 seconds down to 15 or 20 seconds.

The downside of having it constantly monitoring your computer could be that it uses memory, which on a low cost computer may be better used by other, more crucial, programs. Nevertheless any current operating system has virtual memory support, and programs are swapped to disk when they are inactive. In these cases no resources will be wasted if we have enough swap space.

It is started by default unless you indicate that you do not want the quickstarter feature when you first install the program.

== Using and removing the quickstarter ==
If you '''right click''' on the OpenOffice.org logo (the seagull on ocean logo in the system tray) you get a list of options to create new OpenOffice.org documents, or to open a ''template'', you also get an opportunity to open an existing document, of any format.  At the bottom you can see options to exit the quick starter, and above it there should be a tick where it asks whether you want to load OpenOffice.org during system startup. If you click to exit the quickstarter, then when you restart the computer the quickstarter will re-appear. To make it go away for good you must click where it asks if you want to load OpenOffice.org during system startup, so that the tick disappears. If you '''hold the mouse over the quickstarter''' a piece of text indicates OpenOffice.org, version, and quickstarter. If you '''left click''' a box appears offering options to open documents, templates or samples, create new documents, or explore the My Documents folder. This is the best way to take advantage of the features the quickstarter offers.

== If you want quickstarter to reappear ==
Windows: Find the quickstart executable (in a typical Windows install, it would be at C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 2.0\program), and launch it. 

You should then see an icon in the System Tray. Right click the System Tray icon and select &quot;Load OpenOffice.org During System Start-Up&quot;.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Cuisine of Ethiopia]]
             
'''Injera''' is a [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] eaten in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] and Eritrea. It is made with [[Cookbook:teff|teff]] flour.   Teff is a tiny round grain that is grown in the highlands of Eritrea and highlands of Ethiopia.  While teff is very nutritious, pure teff flour contains no [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]], and little else in the way of binding proteins. This makes teff ill-suited for making raised bread, however injera still takes advantage of the special properties of [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]]. A period of fermentation gives it an airy, bubbly texture, and also a sour taste.

==Ingredients==

* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Teff|teff flour]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (warm - but not hot!)
* a [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying
* optional: fermentation starter (see notes). Note that fermentation starter may contain gluten.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Falasha gondar injera 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Making injera]]
# Mix the flour with the water, and the salt. Add your fermentation starter if using one (see notes).
# Set aside to ferment overnight, or at least 12 hours. There should be bubbles on the surface from fermenting, before you use it.
# Heat a large, flat [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]] until it is hot enough to make a droplet of water sizzle. Oil it very lightly, just enough to make the pan shine.
# Pour or [[Cookbook:Ladle|ladle]] some batter onto the pan, spiralling outwards from the centre. Only a thin cover is required, a little thicker than a [[Cookbook:Crêpe|crêpe]] but not by much.
# As it cooks, the surface of the injera will become covered in holes or pits. When the entire injera has changed colour and the edges start to lift from the pan, remove it and set aside, then pour the next injera and repeat until finished.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you can't get it to ferment by itself, try a good fermentation starter like a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]]. [[Cookbook:Yeast|Baker's yeast]] alone will not make for good flavour, as bacteria are needed also, but a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|yoghurt]] plus a pinch of yeast might do the trick if you can't get kefir.
* Traditional injera is made with teff, however if this is difficult to get, it can be made with [[Cookbook:Sorghum|sorghum]] or [[Cookbook:Flour|wheat flour]].
* Since teff is often quite expensive outside of Africa, it is often mixed with wheat flour to give the injera some of the teff flavour but for less expense. Mix ¼ cup of teff flour with ¾ cup of sorghum or wheat flour, for the recipe above.

== Introduction ==


The [[w:Basque_Country|Basque Country]], or Euskal Herria as it is known to its inhabitants, encompasses three provinces of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]] and four of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]]. The origins of the Basque people are unknown, but it is likely that they have inhabited the region since prehistoric times. 

Like the Basque language, which is distinct from any other known language, Basque cuisine is unique and superb. Its major focus is on fresh, well-prepared dishes using local, seasonal ingredients. 

Food is an integral part of Basque culture, so important that gastronomic societies, where men meet to cook, eat and engage in other social activities exist throughout the country. 


== Dining Customs ==

[[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]] is a light meal, often accompanied by cafe con leche, or coffee with milk. [[Cookbook:Dinner|Dinner]], the major meal of the day is usually served at in the mid-afternoon. It often includes [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] and several other courses served with [[Bartending:Wine|wine]]. [[Cookbook:Supper|Supper]] is served at 9:00pm and is a lighter meal than dinner. 


== Basque Cuisine ==

Basque dishes are not based on elaborate [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauces]] or [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|spice]] combinations. The excellence of Basque cooking is due to the use of high quality, local ingredients in season, combined with preparation that enhances, rather than masks, the natural flavor of the food. The most important ingredient in Basque cuisine is the fresh ingredient. 

The Basque Country borders the Atlantic Bay of Biscay, and its people have a long history of seafaring. [[Cookbook:Seafood|Seafood]] is one of the mainstays of Basque cuisine. Cod, hake and fresh tuna are popular, although more unusual dishes are also served, using [[Cookbook:Bream|bream]], [[Cookbook:Eel|elvers]] or other types of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] and seafood. 

Dried [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]] are another staple of Basque cuisine and are especially common during the winter months. The traditional broad bean has become largely replaced by the haricot bean. Several excellent varieties of beans are grown in the Basque Country, including the Alubias de Tolosa. A variety of other [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] are used in Basque cuisine including [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]. 

[[Cookbook:Meat|Meat]], including [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] and [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], as well as [[Cookbook:Poultry|poultry]] and wild [[Cookbook:Game|game]] also have their place in Basque cooking. Cured meats such as excellent [[Cookbook:Ham|hams]] and [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]] are produced in the Basque Country. 

Other foods common to Basque Cuisine include [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] which are very popular, especially in the spring and fall when they are in season and hand-made [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] from ewe's milk.


== Basque Dishes ==
 

=== Fish and Seafood ===

'''Bacalao al Pil-Pil - Cod with [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] Sauce'''

The first section of the Handbook will guide the new user through the installation of Slackware Linux and gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin the OS. Working through this section requires little more than the desire to learn and the fortitude to attempt an installation.

The second, far larger, section of the Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest to Slackware Linux system administrators. Some of these chapters may recommend that you do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter.

__NOTOC__
Dashi is a broth used to make [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]].

==Ingredients==

One or more of:

* dried [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp) seaweed (''konbu'')
* [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] (''asari'' or ''shijimi'')
* [[Cookbook:Bonito Flakes|dried bonito flakes]] (''katsuo-bushi'')
* [[Cookbook:Mackerel|dried mackerel flakes]] (''sababushi'')
* dried sardines or [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]] (''niboshi'')
* dried shiittake mushroom [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (''hoshi-shiitake'')

* dried young &quot;flying fishes&quot; (飛魚;''tobiuo'' or あご;''ago'',unique name to Japanese-oceanside.)

==Procedure==
#If using sardines or anchovies, remove the heads and intestines. Discard these, keeping the bodies.
#Boil fish in water, as if you were making tea.
#Filter the liquid or scoop the solids out of it. The liquid is your dashi.

When only kelp (''konbu'') is used, you get ''kombu-dashi''. This is bland, and appears to be unpopular for use in miso soup. A chunk of kelp about 6 inches across might be reasonable for a [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of broth.

When sardines or anchovies also used, you get ''niboshi-dashi''. This seems to be the most popular choice for making [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]]. You might add a bit of [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]] in this case. About 10 little [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] (guppy-sized) per quart of broth should do.

When both kelp (''konbu'') and bonito flakes (''katsuo-bushi'') are used, you get ''katsuobushi-dashi''. This appears to be the second most popular choice for making miso soup. About 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of bonito flakes per quart of broth should do. At first you produce primary dashi (''ichiban-dashi''). This is good for clear soups. If you use the solids a second time, you get secondary dashi (''niban-dashi''). This is good for thick soups and for cooking vegetables.

==Simple Soup Dashi==
This Dashi can be used to make a miso soup similar to those served in restaurants in North America. 
===Ingredients===
*3 large handfuls of dried, smoked, thinly-shaved skipjack tuna (katsuobushi)
*4 or 5 4 inch long sheets of kombu seaweed
*4-8 cups of water (7 cups, or 1.5L of water, will make a strong enough dashi for restaurant-quality miso)  
===Process===
#Cut small gashes into the kombu. ''Do not'' wash the kombu; the white powder on the exterior is actually natural, crystallized MSG and gives the soup flavour. 
#Place the kombu into the water and bring it to a boil, skimming the surface periodically
#Just as the water begins to simmer, remove the kombu (this may be re-infused with less water a second time to make an inferior dashi suitable for cooking)
#Let the stock cool down for approximately 5 minutes
#Add the flaked tuna and stir, returning to heat 
#Permit it to boil for about 30 seconds and remove from heat
#After a few minutes, the fish will sink to the bottom. Strain the stock through a fine mesh filter (cheese-cloth works well), squeezing the fish to extract every bit of juice (this may be re-infused as well)
#Store in the fridge for up to 5 days, and in the freezer for up to 6 months 
===Tips===
*Both kombu and the fish may be found at most reasonably-sized Asian markets or bought cheaply on-line 
*Katsuobushi is sold in many forms, including small, single-serving packets and in mesh bags to aid removal. An 80g bag of the flakes will make about 4L of stock. 
*Most cheap restaurants in Japan and abroad use a powdered mix of salt, MSG, and fish-flavour extract from Ajinomoto, the company whose founder discovered MSG and a Knorr-like presence in Japan. This powdered &quot;instant dashi&quot; is also readily available in the places mentioned above. The recipe provided here will provide a less-salty, deeper-flavoured but similar broth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of the Slackware Handbook project is to create a document that closely resembles the FreeBSD Handbook in framework and content, but all about Slackware Linux. Envisioned by Narayan Newton and brought to life by Mad Penguin, the Slackware Handbook is unlike any other technical documentation in the world in that it is a completely 'live' medium. This is one book that will never age, never become obsolete, never collect dust... all because it is in perpetual development by dedicated technology professionals from around the globe.

Anyone will be allowed to contribute, but everything submitted to the book is moderated by a peer review system. If something is inaccurate or misleading, it will be caught and fixed. If something is out of date, it will be updated. In keeping with the true nature of Open Source, it will be completely open for anyone to read, download, and share. The Slackware Handbook will prove to be one of the most accurate technical documents on the planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution still in active development. Dating back to 1993, it is still being maintained by its creator Patrick Volkerding with help from developers from all around the world.

It is a very sturdy yet simple distribution, whose main goals are simplicity and stability. Slackware also strives to be the most &quot;UNIX-like&quot; Linux distribution.

If you want a distribution that will force you to understand Linux and its Unix heritage, Slackware is for you. If, instead, you want the complexities of Linux hidden from you, look for a different distribution.

Don't however let this intimidate you, Slackware is no more difficult to learn or become proficient in than any other distribution. The main difference will be in the way you perform tasks, Slackware is far more dependant on the command line interface (cli) than it is on graphical tools. If you compare it to driving a car, you can think of Slackware as a manual/stick and distributions like Mandrake and Redhat as automatics.

To Quote the Slackware Web page:

'''What is Slackware Linux?'''

&quot;The Official Release of Slackware Linux by Patrick Volkerding is an advanced Linux operating system, designed with the twin goals of ease of use and stability as top priorities. Including the latest popular software while retaining a sense of tradition, providing simplicity and ease of use alongside flexibility and power, Slackware brings the best of all worlds to the table.

&quot;Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, the UNIX(tm)-like Linux operating system now benefits from the contributions of millions of users and developers around the world. Slackware Linux provides new and experienced users alike with a fully-featured system, equipped to serve in any capacity from desktop workstation to machine-room server. Web, ftp, and email servers are ready to go out of the box, as are a wide selection of popular desktop environments. A full range of development tools, editors, and current libraries is included for users who wish to develop or compile additional software.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Synopsis==

The following chapter will cover most of the basic installation procedures for the Slackware Linux operating system. Much of this material has been collected from the Internet and from my personal Slackware experiences.

After reading this chapter, you will know:

* What the system requirements for Slackware are
* How to obtain Slackware CD's
* How to prepare for installing Slackware Linux
* How to allocate space and format your hard drives
* How to become familiar with the install tool
* How to choose your installation media
* How to choose what you want installed
* The basics of the actual operating system install
* What your post installation options are

==Pre-install preparations==

Before installing Slackware Linux on your system, there are a few things that need to be done.

2.2.1 Know your system

It is a good idea to make a list of components inside your computer. The easiest way to do so is to use an application on an installed operating system. If you don't have an OS installed you can maybe use a Live CD or you could just open up your case and see what's inside.
Once you have the information you need, you can check the internet to see if there are any known problems between Linux and your hardware.
Slackware requires at least:

* a 486 processor
* 16MB RAM
* a 3.5&quot; floppy drive, however you can now perform the installation with a CD set, so a CD-ROM drive is recommended

Another good thing might be to run &quot;lspci&quot; from inside a Linux environment on your computer, whether during install or from a Knoppix or other bootable environment.

2.2.2 Backup

When you want to install Slackware Linux on a disk which contains valuable data it is recommended to backup that data. Also make sure the backups are usable! Slackware Linux asks for confirmation before erasing or overwriting data on your disk, but once you have confirmed there is no way to undo the action.

2.2.3 Installation Location

If you want Slackware Linux to install to the whole disk and don't want to keep any of the data on that disk, you can skip this section.

A hard disc can be divided into different pieces. These pieces are called partitions. Originally PC's only supported upto four partitions, these 'main' partitions are therefore named the primary partitions. Because four partitions in some cases were not enough, a new kind of partition was created: the extended partition. This is a special partition because it contains other partitions, these partitions are named the logical partitions.

To install Slackware Linux you need at least two partitions: one primary partition to install Slackware and a swap partiton.

A swap partition is used by the kernel to write unused memory blocks to the hard disc, it can be either a logical or a primary partition. The size can be anything up to 2 Gb for Intel machines. However, there is no official rule to the minimum size although a lot of people use the same size for their swap as they have in RAM. These two, swap size and RAM size, are added together and make virtual memory. On older machines the minimum virtual memory is 12 MB. The total size depends on what kind of applications you are going to use.

Partitions are defined by a number which represents the kind of data the partition contains: the partition ID. For a Linux swap partition the ID is 82 and for a normal Linux partition the ID is 83.

The normal primary Linux partition only has a minimum size which differs from every distribution. Slackware Linux needs approx. 200-500 MB for an minimal installation (without X or extra applications) and 2 GB for a full installation.

For those of you into the security aspect, you can visit
http://www.linuxpackages.net/gen_pdf.php?file=securing.html to read &quot;Securing Slackware 8&quot; by a SANS graduate.

The partitions on your disk(s) can be modified in several ways.You can use:

    * fdisk in DOS or Windows.
    * the built-in fdisk with the Slackware Linux installation CD.
    * PartitionMagic®, which is a commercial program for Windows which can resize NTFS and other partitions.

Be careful with using these programs though, if you make a mistake, you can lose all your data. Be sure to make backups!

Note: A software RAID installation paragraph should also be considered. For this, John Lange should be contacted and asked if he agrees to put in here his tutorial from http://www.langefamily.ca/howto/SlackwareRaidHowTo.html . LVM/EVMS installation instructions could also prove useful.

2.2.4 Network configuration information

During installation the installer will ask you for your Network details. It is a good idea to write these details down, from maybe your Windows settings.
If you don't know your networking details, ask your Internet service provider or Network Administrator.

If you connect to the Internet with DSL or Cable you may need the following information:

    * IP address (example, 192.168.1.100)
    * IP address of the gateway (example, 192.168.1.1)
    * IP address of the DNS server (example, 4.2.2.2)
    * Hostname (example, &quot;mybox&quot;)
    * Subnet Mask (example, 255.255.255.0)

If you do not need this information because it is configured automatically with DHCP you do not have to write down anything, but remember to select DHCP.

If you connect to the Internet using a modem you will need the following information:

    * Your ISP's phone number to dial.
    * The COM: port to which your modem is connected.
    * Username and password to login with your ISP.

2.2.5 Download installation files

You should consider what kind of install you would like to do. The easiest and recommended method is to purchase Slackware on CD or burn it to CD yourself. At the Slackware website, simply click &quot;Get Slack&quot; and from there pick a location and mirror you would like to download from. Simply download the .iso files and burn them to CD. As of Slackware 9.1, there are two CDs to Slackware. The first CD is essential, containing the kernel, GNU applications and utilities, the graphical environment (X.org) and some graphical environments and applications. The second CD contains only KDE and Gnome desktop environments, and is optional.

==Starting the Installation==

===Booting===

# Start with your computer turned off.

# Turn on the computer. As it starts it should display an option to enter the system set up menu, or BIOS, commonly reached by keys like F2, F10, Del, or Alt+S. Use whichever keystroke is indicated on screen. In some cases your computer may display a graphic while it starts. Typically, pressing Esc will dismiss the graphic and allow you to see the necessary messages.

# Find the setting that controls which devices the system boots from. This is usually labeled as the ``Boot Order'' and commonly shown as a list of devices, such as Floppy, CDROM, First Hard Disk, and so on.

If you needed to prepare boot floppies, then make sure that the floppy disk is selected. If you are booting from the CDROM then make sure that that is selected instead. In case of doubt, you should consult the manual that came with your computer, and/or its motherboard.

Make the change, then save and exit. The computer should now restart.

===Installing from CDROM===

If you have the bootable CD, available in the official disc set published by Slackware, Inc. or by downloading the cdrom image from http://www.slackware.com/getslack/, a CD-based installation will be a bit simpler for you. To start the installation you are going to have to put the cd in the cdrom and restart the computer, granted that you changed the bios options to accommodate for the cdrom boot. If everything goes as planned you should see this prompt.

 ISOLINUX 2.10 2004-06-18 Copyright (C) 1994-2004 H. Peter Anvin
 
 Welcome to Slackware version 10.0 (Linux kernel 2.4.26)!
 
 If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after the name of the kernel to boot (scsi.s etc). NOTE: In most cases
the kernel will detect your hardware, and parameters are not needed.

Here are some examples (and more can be found in the BOOTING file):
hdx=cyls,heads,sects,wpcom,irq (needed in rare cases where probing fails)
or hdx=cdrom (force detection of an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive)
where hdx can be any of hda through hdt.

In a pinch, you can boot your system from here with a command like:

For example, if the Linux system were on /dev/hda1.

boot: bare.i root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro

This prompt is just for entering extra parameters. If you don't need to enter
any parameters, hit ENTER to boot the default kernel &quot;bare.i&quot; or press [F2]
for a listing of more kernel choices.

==Installing nvidia graphical drivers==

NOTE: this guide assumes you have already gone run though xorgconfig and are already using working video drivers.

If you own a nvidia based Geforce video card than installation of the drivers cannot be easier. Head over to the nvidiadriver selectionpage and select the latest released drivers suited to your computers architecture.

It is highly recommended that you read the README which will explain in deph a whole lot of stuff about the drivers installation and settings of the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. But basically all you need to do is log out of X and as root cd to where the drivers were downloaded to and run:

(arch being the architecture and x representing the version)

# sh NVIDIA-Linux-arch-x.x-xxxx-pkg1.run

This will unpack the self archiving package and take you though the nvidia-installer's step by step driver installation.

Once this is done open up your xorg.conf file (/etc/X11/xorg.conf) and found in the &quot;# Graphics device section&quot; and change the line:

Driver &quot;nv&quot;
(or) Driver &quot;vesa&quot;

to

Driver &quot;nvidia&quot;

and in the Module section make sure you have the following line

Load &quot;glx&quot;

and remove these lines if they exist

Load &quot;dri&quot;
Load &quot;GLcore&quot;

Now you should be able to start up X again and everything should be fine.

The following chapter will cover the basic commands and functionality of the Slackware Linux operating system. Much of this material is relevant for any UNIX® like operating system. Feel free to skim over this chapter if you are familiar with the material. If you are new to Slackware, then you will definitely want to read through this chapter carefully.


After reading this chapter, you will know:

* How to use the &quot;virtual consoles&quot; of Slackware.
* How UNIX file permissions work.
* The default Slackware file system layout.
* The Slackware disk organization.
* How to mount and unmount file systems.
* What processes, daemons, and signals are.
* What a shell is, and how to change your default login environment.
* How to use basic text editors.
* What devices and device nodes are.
* What binary format is used under Slackware.
* How to read manual pages for more information.

==Virtual Consoles and Terminals==

Slackware can be used in various ways. One of them is typing commands to a text terminal. A lot of the flexibility and power of a UNIX® operating system is readily available at your hands when using Slackware this way. This section describes what ``terminals'' and ``consoles'' are, and how you can use them.

===The Console===

By default, Slackware is configured to boot into the command line interface, unless you've changed this, the system will present you with a login prompt after it boots, right after the startup scripts finish running. You will see something similar to:

 Loading OSS compatibility modules for ALSA.
 
 
 Welcome to Linux 2.4.26 (tty1)
 hawk login:

The messages might be a bit different on your system, but you will see something similar. The last two lines are what we are interested in right now. The second last line reads:

 Welcome to Linux 2.4.26 (tty1)

This line contains some bits of information about the system you have just booted. You are looking at a ``Slackware'' console. The name of this machine (every UNIX machine has a name) is hawk, and you are now looking at its system console--the tty1 terminal.
Finally, the last line is always:

 login:

This is the part where you are supposed to type in your ``username'' to log into Slackware. The next section describes how you can do this.
===Logging into Slackware===

Slackware is a multiuser, multiprocessing system. This is the formal description that is usually given to a system that can be used by many different people, who simultaneously run a lot of programs on a single machine.
Every multiuser system needs some way to distinguish one ``user'' from the rest. In Slackware (and all the UNIX like operating systems), this is accomplished by requiring that every user must ``log into'' the system before being able to run programs. Every user has a unique name (the ``username'') and a personal, secret key (the ``password''). Slackware will ask for these two before allowing a user to run any programs.
Right after Slackware boots and finishes running its startup scripts, it will present you with a prompt and ask for a valid username:

 login:

For the sake of this example, let us assume that your username is john. Type john at this prompt and press Enter. You should then be presented with a prompt to enter a ``password'':

 login: john
 Password:

Type in john's password now, and press Enter. The password is not echoed! You need not worry about this right now. Suffice it to say that it is done for security reasons.
If you have typed your password correctly, you should by now be logged into Slackware and ready to try out all the available commands.
You should see the MOTD or message of the day followed by a command prompt (a #, $, or % character). This indicates you have successfully logged into Slackware.
3.2.3 Multiple Consoles

Running UNIX commands in one console is fine, but Slackware can run many programs at once. Having one console where commands can be typed would be a bit of a waste when an operating system like Slackware can run dozens of programs at the same time. This is where ``virtual consoles'' can be very helpful.
Slackware can be configured to present you with many different virtual consoles. You can switch from one of them to any other virtual console by pressing a couple of keys on your keyboard. Each console has its own different output channel, and Slackware takes care of properly redirecting keyboard input and monitor output as you switch from one virtual console to the next.

Special key combinations have been reserved by Slackware for switching consoles. You can use Ctrl+Alt-F1, Alt-F2, through Alt-F8 to switch to a different virtual console in Slackware. TTY1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1) is the default virtual console that you see at login. TTY1 through TTY6 are available at all times in text mode. TTY7 and higher become graphical virtual consoles when the graphical system is started.

As you are switching from one console to the next, Slackware takes care of saving and restoring the screen output. The result is an ``illusion'' of having multiple ``virtual'' screens and keyboards that you can use to type commands for Slackware to run. The programs that you launch on one virtual console do not stop running when that console is not visible. They continue running when you have switched to a different virtual console.

==Permissions==

Slackware is based on several key UNIX concepts. The first and most pronounced is that Slackware is a multi-user operating system. The system can handle several users all working simultaneously on completely unrelated tasks. The system is responsible for properly sharing and managing requests for hardware devices, peripherals, memory, and CPU time fairly to each user.

Because the system is capable of supporting multiple users, everything the system manages has a set of permissions governing who can read, write, and execute the resource. These permissions are stored as three octets broken into three pieces, one for the owner of the file, one for the group that the file belongs to, and one for everyone else. This numerical representation works like this:
 Value Permission 	              Directory Listing
 0     No read, no write, no execute  ---
 1     Read, no write, execute        --x
 2     No read, write, no execute     -w-
 3     No read, write, execute        -wx
 4     Read, no write, no execute     r--
 5     Read, no write, execute        r-x
 6     Read, write, no execute        rw-
 7     Read, write, execute           rwx


You can use the -l command line argument to ls(1) to view a long directory listing that includes a column with information about a file's permissions for the owner, group, and everyone else. For example, a ls -l in an arbitrary directory may show:

 % ls -l
 total 530
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 512 Sep 5 12:31 myfile
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 512 Sep 5 12:31 otherfile
 
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 7680 Sep 5 12:31 email.txt
...

Here is how the first column of ls -l is broken up:

 -rw-r--r--

The first (leftmost) character tells if this file is a regular file, a directory, a special character device, a socket, or any other special pseudo-file device. In this case, the - indicates a regular file. The next three characters, rw- in this example, give the permissions for the owner of the file. The next three characters, r--, give the permissions for the group that the file belongs to. The final three characters, r--, give the permissions for the rest of the world. A dash means that the permission is turned off. In the case of this file, the permissions are set so the owner can read and write to the file, the group can read the file, and the rest of the world can only read the file. According to the table above, the permissions for this file would be 644, where each digit represents the three parts of the file's permission.

This is all well and good, but how does the system control permissions on devices? Slackware actually treats most hardware devices as a file that programs can open, read, and write data to just like any other file. These special device files are stored on the /dev directory.

Directories are also treated as files. They have read, write, and execute permissions. The executable bit for a directory has a slightly different meaning than that of files. When a directory is marked executable, it means it can be traversed into, that is, it is possible to &quot;cd&quot; (change directory) into it. This also means that within the directory it is possible to access files whose names are known (subject, of course, to the permissions on the files themselves).

In particular, in order to perform a directory listing, read permission must be set on the directory, whilst to delete a file that one knows the name of, it is necessary to have write and execute permissions to the directory containing the file.

There are more permission bits, but they are primarily used in special circumstances such as setuid binaries and sticky directories. If you want more information on file permissions and how to set them, be sure to look at the chmod manual page.
3.3.1 Symbolic Permissions



Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

Symbolic permissions, sometimes referred to as symbolic expressions, use characters in place of octal values to assign permissions to files or directories. Symbolic expressions use the syntax of (who) (action) (permissions), where the following values are available:

 Option Letter 	Represents
 (who) 	u 	User
 (who) 	g 	Group owner
 (who) 	o 	Other
 (who) 	a 	All (``world'')
 (action) 	+ 	Adding permissions
 (action) 	- 	Removing permissions
 (action) 	= 	Explicitly set permissions
 (permissions) 	r 	Read
 (permissions) 	w 	Write
 (permissions) 	x 	Execute
 (permissions) 	s 	Set UID or GID	

These values are used with the chmod command just like before, but with letters. For an example, you could use the following command to block other users from accessing FILE:

% chmod go= FILE

A comma separated list can be provided when more than one set of changes to a file must be made. For example the following command will remove the groups and ``world'' write permission on FILE, then it adds the execute permissions for everyone:

% chmod go-w,a+x FILE

==Processes==

Slackware is a multi-tasking operating system. This means that it seems as though more than one program is running at once. Each program running at any one time is called a process. Every command you run will start at least one new process, and there are a number of system processes that run all the time, keeping the system functional.

Each process is uniquely identified by a number called a process ID, or PID, and, like files, each process also has one owner and group. The owner and group information is used to determine what files and devices the process can open, using the file permissions discussed earlier. Most processes also have a parent process. The parent process is the process that started them. For example, if you are typing commands to the shell then the shell is a process, and any commands you run are also processes. Each process you run in this way will have your shell as its parent process. The exception to this is a special process called init(8). init is always the first process, so its PID is always 1. init is started automatically by the kernel when Slackware starts.

Foreground and Background

When you run a command, usually that command is in the foreground (you see it) and it's using the computer until it is finished. This might seem obvious until you realize that there are things that can be done about this. For example, if you start a command and then decide that you would like to terminate it, you can usually use Ctrl+C to terminate it. Also, if you'd like to start other commands rather than wait for the program to quit, you may use Ctrl+Z to stop it, so that it will no longer run and be &quot;in your way&quot;.

A stopped application can be brought to the foreground once again using the &quot;fg&quot; command, where it will resume running. This is useful if you want to let the command continue, or if you'd like to use Ctrl+C to terminate it.

Another thing that can be done is to use an ampersand (&amp;) after a command to cause it to run in the background. When you do this, you might see the following:

root@darkstar:~# updatedb &amp;
[1] 12353

This means that the program has been started, and has been given the PID (program identification number) of 12353, which is useful should you want to terminate it with &quot;kill 12353&quot;.

Two commands are particularly useful to see the processes on the system, ps(1) and top(1). The ps command is used to show a static list of the currently running processes, and can show their PID, how much memory they are using, the command line they were started with, and so on. The top command displays all the running processes, and updates the display every few seconds, so that you can interactively see what your computer is doing.

By default, ps only shows you the commands that are running and are owned by you. For example:

 raven@hawk:~$ ps
 PID TTY TIME CMD
 31674 pts/1 00:00:00 bash
 31686 pts/1 00:00:00 ps

As you can see in this example, the output from ps(1) is organized into a number of columns. PID is the process ID discussed earlier. PIDs are assigned starting from 1, go up to 99999, and wrap around back to the beginning when you run out. The TT column shows the tty the program is running on, and can safely be ignored for the moment. STAT shows the program's state, and again, can be safely ignored. TIME is the amount of time the program has been running on the CPU--this is usually not the elapsed time since you started the program, as most programs spend a lot of time waiting for things to happen before they need to spend time on the CPU. Finally, COMMAND is the command line that was used to run the program.

ps(1) supports a number of different options to change the information that is displayed. One of the most useful sets is auxww. a displays information about all the running processes, not just your own. u displays the username of the process' owner, as well as memory usage. x displays information about daemon processes, and ww causes ps(1) to display the full command line, rather than truncating it once it gets too long to fit on the screen.
The output from top(1) is similar. A sample session looks like this:

 raven@hawk:~$ top
 
 top - 22:52:10 up 11:29, 2 users, load average: 0.13, 0.04, 0.01
 Tasks: 34 total, 1 running, 33 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
 Cpu(s): 0.0% user, 0.0% system, 0.0% nice, 100.0% idle

 75 root 8 0 688 688 520 S 0.0 0.4 0:00.17 cardmgr
 157 root 9 0 492 460 428 S 0.0 0.2 0:00.00 dhcpcd
 272 root 9 0 0 0 0 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.00 khubd

 778 daemon 9 0 616 616 548 S 0.0 0.3 0:00.01 atd

The output is split into two sections. The header (the first five lines) shows the PID of the last process to run, the system load averages (which are a measure of how busy the system is), the system uptime (time since the last reboot) and the current time. The other figures in the header relate to how many processes are running (47 in this case), how much memory and swap space has been taken up, and how much time the system is spending in different CPU states.

Below that are a series of columns containing similar information to the output from ps(1). As before you can see the PID, the username, the amount of CPU time taken, and the command that was run. top(1) also defaults to showing you the amount of memory space taken by the process. This is split into two columns, one for total size, and one for resident size--total size is how much memory the application has needed, and the resident size is how much it is actually using at the moment.

top(1) automatically updates this display every two seconds; this can be changed with the s option.

==Text Editors==

Much of UNIX administration involved editing configuration files, most of which are simply text files.  Here we will address several of the most common UNIX text editors and their basic operations.

===vi===

There is arguably no text editor more ubiquitous in the UNIX world than vi.  This fact alone serves as a reason that all serious UNIX (and Slackware) users should learn at least its basic features.  The name comes from the command &quot;visual&quot; used to switch the ex line editor into '''vi'''sual mode.  This fact serves to illustrate two interesting things about vi.  First, that vi is a modal editor, which means that its editing functions change depending on the state, or mode, that the program is in.  The second interesting thing to note is that the name is, like much of UNIX programs, and extension of another.  vi has all the user customization and extensibility UNIX users demand, which makes it an extremely powerful program.

====Modal Editing====
By contrast to some text editors that simply echo keystrokes to the screen and rely on function key combinations for extended features, modal editors--and by extension, vi--use the editor mode to define what actions are perform on the text file.  This is best explained by example.

What you see is a modern version of vi called Vim.  Vim inherits nearly all of the features of the original, proprietary version of vi, and adds a multitude of its own features which are distributed under a GPL-compatible free software license.  The screen above is what Vim looks like when it first loads.  In this state, it is in '''Normal''' mode. Normal mode is also referred to as '''Command''' mode, because from this mode you can execute various commands, or actions, on the text, such as changing, deleting, copying, etcetera.  To enter text in standard fashion, you must first switch vi to Insert mode.

From this initial mode we can enter text by switching to '''Insert''' mode in one of several ways.  The easiest is just to press the &quot;i&quot; key (for '''i'''nsert).  Now you can enter text as you wish.  All standard alphanumeric characters, including punctuation, are echoed to the display as typed:

; Figure 5.1.1-1 :

 -- INSERT --

You can see from this example that Vim displays the text as typed, &quot;vi is my favorite text editor.&quot;, as well as the fact that it is now in Insert mode.  To switch back to Command mode, simply press the escape key (Esc).  vi will return to Command mode (and Vim will change its display to reflect this by removing &quot;-- INSERT --&quot; from the bottom of the screen.

; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;Important&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;Commands Are Case Sensitive&lt;/span&gt; : Be careful.  vi commands (such as &quot;i&quot; here) are case sensitive, so a capital &quot;I&quot; is not the same command as a lower case &quot;i&quot;.  By the same token it is highly recommended not to use CAPSLOCK on your keyboard while editing in vi.  Despite being largely superfluous to most typists anyway, using CAPSLOCK can lead to unexpected results when you switch back to Command mode.

====Basic Commands====

&quot;So what good is Command mode?&quot; you ask.  Good question.  Let's take a look at some basic commands that illustrate the power of modal editing.

=====Moving the Cursor=====

Command mode may seem to add complication to the text editing process, but it is actually designed to increase productivity.  One of the first fruits you will glean from Command mode is increased speed editing text.  Command mode makes text editing faster than standard text editing even if you only know a handful of commands.  Take the previous example (see Figure 5.1.1-1).  If you were to press &quot;Esc&quot; at the end of the line, vi would enter Command mode and the cursor would be placed atop the last character typed.  From this state, you can use the &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;l&quot; keys to move the cursor left, down, up, and right, respectively, throughout the file one character at a time.

=====Yanking, Putting and Deleting Text=====

vi uses registers to store text temporarily.  Using the yank and put commands, you can copy or remove text from a portion of the file into the register and put it somewhere else.

=====File Operations=====

So now that you can do a few commands, you probably want to open a file do some editing.

===Emacs===

Emacs is another popular UNIX text editor and, like vi, is extremely powerful.  Emacs was originally conceived by Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU project, as a set of editor macros for another text editor.  This eventually became what is known today as Emacs (derived from '''E'''ditor '''MAC'''ro'''S''').

== Initial definitions ==

Before stating the axioms, we must first assume a knowledge of first order logic and its connectives and quantifiers. Our variables will simply represent sets in the universe of set theory, and so any letter&amp;mdash;capital, lowercase, roman, Greek, etc.&amp;mdash;will represent a set unless otherwise stated.  We must also accept the basic property of ''membership'' so we can state that ''x'' is an element of ''y''.  For example, 1 is an element of &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

After defining appropriate axioms, we can freely use the equality symbol &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; to mean that two sets are identical.  See the axiom of extensionality below to see how equality is defined for sets.

== Axioms of Set Theory ==

In order to prove some of the fundamental results of set theory, and to begin to define other branches of mathematics based on it, we need to start with some axioms that we can assume to be true. There are many possibilities for choices of axioms, but the most popular set of axioms is the Zermelo-Fraenkel system, or, more generally, Zermelo-Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice.

We start by constructing the axiom system known as &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;

We'll need a notion of equality between sets.  The following axiom gives that.

:'''Axiom of Extensionality''': If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are sets such that &lt;math&gt;x\in A\iff x\in B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt;.

We'll define a set that contains nothing:

:'''Axiom of Empty Set''': There is a set ''X'' such that for all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \not\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the empty set is written as &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Uniqueness of the empty set follows immediately from the axiom of Extensionality.

Now we need the ability to take a set, and divide up the elements based on whether or not they satisfy some property.

:'''Axiom of Separation''': If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a condition on elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\{x:x\in A\hbox{ and } P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

The uniqueness of such a set follows again from the axiom of Extensionality.  The condition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be described precisely using mathematical logic; a vague condition could lead to an ambiguous idea of what the set contains.

Axiom of separation is sometimes called schema of separation, since it comprises infinitely many axioms - one for each condition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the restriction &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; in this axiom helps us to avoid Russell's paradox - in this paradox a &quot;set&quot; of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x: P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; P(x)= x\not\in x &lt;/math&gt;, was used.

The following three axioms are required to generate new sets from given sets.

:'''Axiom of Pair''': If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are sets, then there is a set containing exactly &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Axiom of Union''': If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then &lt;math&gt;\{x\mid x\in B\hbox{ for some } B\in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set. In other words, for any set A, there exists another set whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of A.

:'''Axiom of Power Set''': If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set, then there is a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{P}(A)\iff&lt;/math&gt; each &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

These six axioms, taken together, allow the development of the operations that were discussed in the previous chapter.

==Zermelo-Fraenkel==
To derive certain fundamental results in various branches of mathematics, there is need for more axioms.  While all mathematicians agree on the above six axioms, other axioms become controversial in various ways.  The following axioms together with the above are called the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, often abbreviated ZF.

As we will see, there is no way to define an infinite set given our current axioms, so we require separate axioms for that.

:'''Axiom of Infinity''': An inductive set exists.  An inductive set is a set ''I''  such that, &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x \in I \Rightarrow x \cup \{x\} \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

We shall see later why the following axiom is needed.

:'''Axiom of Replacement''': If &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is a property such that for each ''x'', there is a unique ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; holds, then for every set ''A'' there is a set ''B'' such that for every &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;  for which &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; holds.

Note that like the axiom of separation, the axiom of replacement is often called an axiom schema because there are infinitely many properties &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to which such an axiom applies.

The following axiom is somewhat of a convention but various models of set theory have been defined without it, or even using axiom stating things close to the opposite.

:'''Axiom of Regularity''': For every non-empty set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is some &lt;math&gt;y \in x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \cap y=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Axiom of Choice===
The last Axiom in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is called the Axiom of Choice.  It remains the most controversial axiom among mathematicians, and for that reason, when using ZF with the Axiom of Choice, it is often specified as ZFC.

:'''Axiom of Choice''': For every set ''S'' of nonempty disjoint sets, there exists a function ''f'' defined on ''S'' such that, for each set &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Introduction==
Nuclear fusion and fission are the processes by which the nucleus of an atom gains (fusion) or loses (fission) protons, transforming into a different type of atom. Both processes release energy. Nuclear fusion and fission occur in nature, for example, within a star, and artificially, for example in a nuclear reactor.

Energy is released from the nucleus if the [[../Nuclear Binding Energies/]] of the nucleus is increased. 

===Where Does the Energy Come From? ===
Everyone has heard of the equation &lt;math&gt; E = mc^2 &lt;/math&gt; but surprisingly few know what it actually means. As well as having heavy implications in [[electrodynamics]] and other fields, it says that energy and mass are like beasts, and you can convert one to the other. The Binding Energy, also known as the mass defect, is where this energy comes from. Mass is lost from the nucleus, and energy is released.

==Fusion==

Fusion is the process of combining the nuclei of smaller atoms(less protons &amp; neutrons and hence, a smaller atomic number) to create a larger atom. In many stars, the process starts with hydrogen (H) atoms combining to form helium atoms (He) then combining again to form Beryllium (Be) atoms and so on... The process stops when all the atoms are converted to Iron (Fe) and the star is thus dead. The reason for this is that once the atoms reach Iron and higher, the energy required to fuse the atoms becomes greater than the energy released by the atoms.

More precisely, fusion is only favourable up to Iron since it is only up to this point that the energy per nucleon (proton and neutron) continues to decrease.  The most efficient energy/nucleon reactions that can occur in the process of fusion are Hydrogen-Hydrogen reactions, or between various isotopes of hydrogen.  For nuclei heavier than Iron, the tendency is for fission (see other section) to become more viable in terms of liberating energy, i.e. to reduce stored energy/nucleon.

Fusion occurs naturally in environments where a sufficiently large amount of matter is collapsed under gravitational pressure that atoms are stripped of their electrons and nuclei have a sufficiently low mean free path (i.e. their density is fairly high).  The aggregate of matter forming such an object is then usually referred to as a star.

==Fusion Power==

Since the yield from hydrogen fusion is actually higher than for uranium fission, the byproducts are largely benign (with the exception of high energy neutrons), and the materials can be readily obtained by electrolysis from a plentiful resource (water), it is natural to consider trying to build fusion power plants.  Since the nuclei are charged, it is possible to control them using powerful magnetic fields, and this is the standard idea in trying to control hydrogen plasma in order to produce a sustained and controlled nuclear reaction.  Although progress has been steady, considerable engineering obstacles still need to be overcome.

[[w:Fusion_Power|Wikipedia's entry on Fusion Power]]

==Fission==
This is the breakdown of large, heavy nuclei, to make smaller, lighter, more stable nuclei with a lower energy state and release energy at the same time, this is the process used in creating nuclear weapons.
A nucleus may split in many different ways, in fact it is very rare for an even split to occur, one &quot;half&quot; being larger than the other in most cases.
the mechanism maybe something like this 
an unstable (large Neutron rich isotope)is held together by the strong nuclear force
because it is unstable it distorts allowing the coulomb repulsion between the positive protons to over come the strong nuclear attraction and separate them
this forms two highly energetic halves.
these may increase their stability by emitting neutrons, these are known as prompt neutrons.
Other neutrons maybe emitted later these are known as not surprisingly delayed neutrons.
There are two types of fission, the first is spontaneous(this happens without first absorbing a neutron)and more common neutron induced fission which is as its name implies.

For power generation only nuclear fission occurring in a chain reaction is of interest. It is performed controlled in a reactor and uncontrolled in a nuclear bomb. For running a chain reaction the absence of neutron captures and materials with fissionables nuclei are required. The only natural nuclei, which can be used for reactor operation is uranium235. Others like plutonium239 have to be created artificially, however also in a reactor, which requires a fuel like uranium235 or plutonium239. Interestingly a few billion years ago, building a reactor would have been much easier, as there was a much higher concentration of uranium235 in natural uranium! You can read the exact content therefore under [[../Change of isotope composition of natural uranium|Change of isotope composition of natural uranium]].

== Driving a Star==
===The Proton-Proton Chain===
This is the main fusion process in stars with masses similar to our Sun. The core temperature reached in such stars is in the order of 15 million Kelvin. For larger stars, with higher core temperatures, the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle fusion process becomes the dominant mechanism.
Basically the Branch I reactions are as follows, with the ultimate generation of 26.72 MeV of energy. These reactions generate approximately 85% of the Sun's solar energy production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;i&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He = &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He +2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Branch II and III of main sequence hydrogen burning produce much less energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Branch II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be + &lt;i&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li + &lt;i&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li = &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Branch III&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be = &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;B + &lt;i&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;B = &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;br&gt;

===The Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen Cycle===

This reaction takes place in stars 1.3 times more massive than our own, it is almost exactly the same as the proton-proton chain except that it uses carbon as catalyst.  The carbon in the reaction is not used up and is recycled at the end of the reaction. The CNO process generates 26.72 MeV of energy, this is the main branch.

p + &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C = &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N + γ + 1.95 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N = &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.22 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C + p = &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + γ + 7.54 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + p = &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O + γ + 7.35 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O = &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.75 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N + p = &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + 4.96 MeV

'''Branch ||'''

There is a small chance that the last reaction in the branch above will not happen and that instead this reaction will.

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N + p = &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O +  γ + 12.13 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + p = &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;F +  γ + 0.60 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;F = &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.76 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + p = &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + 1.19 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + p = &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O + γ + 7.35 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O = &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.75 MeV

However the nitrogen produced in the last reaction will eventually take part in the last reaction of the first branch.

'''Branch |||'''

The last branch only takes place in particularly very massive stars where the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + p in the third reaction of the second branch produces a &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F +  γ instead. This can also be called the OF cycle as the oxygen and fluorine used in the reaction are recycled.

&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + p = &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F +  γ + 5.61 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F = &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.65 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O + p = &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F +  γ + 7.99 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F + p = &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + 8.11 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + p = &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;F +  γ + 0.60 MeV

&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;F = &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;

It is important to note that all of the cycles can be simplified into one reaction because all branches will use the same reactants and produce the products.

4p = &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + 2e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + 3γ + 26.72 MeV

The positrons released in the reaction will annihilate with the electrons and produce more energy in the form of gamma rays.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Nuclear Physics/Page}}

Binding energy is the amount of energy required to separate something down into its base components. In nuclear terms, the energy is derived from the ''Strong Nuclear Force''.

The binding energy must come from somewhere, and in the case, because mass and energy are so strongly linked by Einstein's Equation E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the Binding Energy is proportional to the Difference in Mass of the Atom, compared to the sum of its parts. This is also called the '''mass defect'''. The larger the mass defect, the more stable the isotope is.

Example of Binding Energy:

=== The Binding Energy of a Deuteron &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H ===

A deuteron is the nucleus of a deuterium atom, and consists of one proton and one neutron. The masses of the constituents are:

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007276 u (where u represents the Atomic mass unit ≈ 1.66053886 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-27&lt;/sup&gt; kg)
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;= 1.008665 u
: m&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; + m&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007276 + 1.008665 = 2.015941 u

The mass of the deuteron is:

: Atomic Mass &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H = 2.013553 u

The mass difference = 2.015941 - 2.013553 = .002388 u. = 3.9654 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms.

=== Binding Energies of Isotopes ===
Iron is one of the most stable nuclei around.
A picture should really be added here.

but if h= 1.007277, then 2h= 2.0014554 and the difference between p and n is .001388.
when you add this difference you get 2.0028434=2h.

try this h=1,007825,n=1.008665 then 2h =2.01565 and 1.008665-1.007825=.00084
then add that difference to change p to n, so 2.01565+.00084=2.01649
now sub. the so call binding energy, 2.01649-.002388= 2.014102 and this is mass of
2d that I find in text books!!!
also .002388u mult. by 931.5 = 2.224422 in MeV units!
if you follow the above 2.014102 times 2 is 4.028204. and 3 times 4.028204 is 12.084612, this is carbon. 12carbon(12.084612) + 1.007825 = 13nitrogen(13.092437) + .00084 = 13.093277(before the loss of a +beta and neutrino!). 13.093277 - .002388 = 13carbon(13.090889), add 1.007825 to get 14nitrogon(14.098714). again add 1.007825 to get 15oxygen(15.106539). again add .00084 to get 15.107379(again this is before loss of a +beta and neutrino!). again subtrack .002388 to get 15nitrogen(15.104991). now add 1.007825 to get 16oxygen(16.112816).
  16oxygen(16.112816) = 12carbon(12.084612) + 4helium(4.028204) and this is the carbon cycle in stars.

in David Wayne Ferrin's note: the proton is 1.007277, and Hydrogen is 1.007277+(+beta=.000548)= 1.007825. Also .002388= (2(+beta)+2(-beta)+2(.000098)) or .002388=(.001194+.001194)=((.000548)+(.000548)+(.000098))x2, that is in a world with perfect field breaking symmetry, in fusion this happens 1.007825 + (1.007825 + .000840) = 2.01649.
  Ok, look this .002388 - .000840 = .001548, .000840 = .000548(first beta) + .000292,
  and .000292 = (.000098 + .000098 + .000096),
  and .001548 = (.001096(.000548x2)(second and third) + .000452),
  now add .000096 + .000452 = .000548(fourth).
  When betas are formed they do so in pairs (one real, one virtual), so do neutrinos = .000098.
Now take 2.016490-1.006985(too light)=1.009505(too heavy). To 1.006985(tl) add .000292= 1.007277 add .000548= 1.007825 add (.000292+.000548)=.000840= 1.008665 add .000840= 1.009505(th). And if 1.006985/3= .3356616667 add .000840= .3365016667*3= 1.009505.
.3356616667*931.5= 312.6688425, .3365016667*931.5= 313.451325, and 312.6688425 + (2*313.4513025)=939.5714476/931.5= 1.008665.</text>

----
I have a passion for the written word.  I love to read and have since I was a child.  I came from a very literary minded family.  My mother works as a children's librarian and through her I have come to my love for reading.  It was my purpose with the SLES to create a forum much like that of the ancient philosophers; a place where students and teachers would be able to create their own texts and study the work of previous attendees.  Hopefully this goal will someday be achieved.

I have a personal blog, [http://handwrittenhypertext.blogspot.com the handwritten hypertext], which I  use as my base of operations and discussion on the web.  There, you will find links to my [http://del.icio.us/jdl32579 del.icio.us] tags and other original content.  There will also be a course on the writing of the weblog posted there in a serial lesson system.

Enjoy all the SLES has to offer.  Please feel free to contact those others who are involved with this school and we will continue to serve the knowledge seeking public.

:I absolutely agree, but where to go?  People seem to be dead around this place and kicking them into gear seems to be difficult.  Go with whatever ideas you have and any help from me you have with you.  Put something up on the talk page or maybe at the bottom of the main page. ~[[User:Atrivedi|Amish]]

===Names===
:I thought about that and if you're up for it, we can certainly do it.  I mean, I'm using my user name like you are, in that it's basically my name anyways.  I figure if folks are interested, they can always click and see my name.  [[User:Atrivedi|Amish]]


==Requirements of a &quot;Decree&quot;==

At some point, we should come up with a list of requirements in order to get a &quot;decree&quot; (which is what the Wikiversity folks call it, not me).  What courses, what level courses, etc.  Just a thought.  There's no rush and I think we should take some time in deciding.  This would be something no one else in the Wikiversity has done thus far, and that, too, makes it exciting! [[User:Atrivedi|Amish]]

== New to Wikiversity ==

Justin, Amish-

Just wanted to say hello.  I've been using Wikipedia for some time now, just dabbling here and there in some of the areas where I know things.  I stumbled onto this Wikiversity page a few days ago and would like to be more involved.  My schedule is hectic at times, but I'd like to do as much as I can.  

My focus is primarily Writing and Rhetoric (or Rhetoric and Composition depending on where you study), and I was curious about how you see that component falling under the larger umbrella of English and Literature Studies.  I know that Writing and Rhetoric can tend to be a hot button item within schools of English, so I wanted to check with you before making major changes. 

Would you be interested in having a school of Rhetoric and Composition under the larger umbrella of English and Literature studies that would cover the courses for composition, linguistics, grammar, professional (or other forms of non-creative) writing, rhetoric, teaching writing, etc.?

My thought is, the English department could be split into three &quot;schools&quot; or &quot;sub-departments&quot;?  One school could focus on English studies, which consists primarily of literature and languages.  Another school would focus on rhetoric and composition, which covers the previously mentioned headings.  And our third school would cover all of our creative writing components.

So, if a student were in pursuit of a decree in English from our Wikiversity, the literature classes the student takes would be handled by faculty from the school of English studies.  The composition classes would be handled by faculty from the school of Rhetoric and Composition.  And any creative writing would be handled by faculty from the school of Creative Writing.

In order for a student to receive a decree, they would have to take a certain number of classes from each &quot;school&quot; of English.  Depending on their focus, they might be obligated to take more classes in a certain school than another.  

This just seems like a great place to be innovative with our decisions and think outside of the box.  Wikiversity, as much as we might want it to be, is not a university.  And I don't think that's a bad thing.  Universities have set ways, traditions.  This is our chance to be progressive and change the way we handle our fields of interest.  

Just let me know if we can continue discussing some possible options for renovating how we do business.  I mean, do we have to use the same class numbering system as a major university for our classes to mean as much?  I don't think so.  Why don't we sit down and think about how we can improve what we didn't like about the format of our educations?  What do we have to lose?

I don't know if you guys saw Kathleen Blake Yancey's speech at the Conference on College Composition and Communication last year, but it addresses some of these key issues.  We are in a revolutionary time right now, thanks to technology and the ability to communicate in new and different ways.  We should be thinking of new ways to conduct our business.  If you'd like a copy of the speech, e-mail me at ztheday@hotmail.com, and I can get it to you.

Thanks,

ztheday aka John Anderson

:I personally think we're better off with the standard numbering.  I also think that we should be able to move freely within SLES and run courses where we like.  With only three of us so far, why should we limit ourselves, especially since I feel we would all have knowledge in every area.  I don't see why I couldn't run a course in CW and LS and Justin run in Web Writing and LS or Comp, etc.  I figure we have the ability to run more courses in this forum than in a real university setting (where maybe you could run 2 or 3 at the most!).  While the courses themselves can be reworked, I think that a basic frame is a decent idea.  [[User:Atrivedi|Amish]]

==Welcome Back!!!==

Boy am I glad to see you!  I haven't been doing much of late as I'm not sure what will happen with Wikiversity.  I say we start building this section into a perfect model and see if we can't get this whole project kick started.  Up for it?  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]

:  Also, if you want it, the top departmental slot is yours.  Just keeping the seat warm :) [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]

== [[Template:Miscellaneous bookshelf]] ... ==

... is only for existing book of good quality.

== Stages. ==

The lowest possible stage is {{stage short|00%|3 Feb, 2006}} and {{stage|00%|3 Feb, 2006}} - Please fill in the propper date. A red link (non existing book) can not - by definition - be finished by 25%. It is also not finished by 1% as it has not been started ;-).

== Redesign for the school ==

As you can tell, I've been thinking a lot about what this school is to become.

I figure that this is the safest place to write about what I want to do with this thing.  I think it is best to do it point by point.

*First of all, the basic structure of the school at this point could survive in the form of a text book.  I believe it is important for us to look at building a textbook with what we have and working from there.  It would be a great idea for us to hold off on working through a school and set our sights on writing the text book first.
*Secondly, course names and numbers: There should not have been so many course names and numbers this early.  I know I fell into the trap of writing the names of every class I've ever seen in a course catalog.  At this point, there should be a basic set of work to look at.  I don't think I would be able to build much more than a couple courses at this point, and the work that would be done in just one class would be crazy enough.  The courses I teach at the University are bad enough.
*Third, the name of the school.  English isn't the only language that has literature or writing.  Any language that has a body of writing should be present here.  Without naming it something along the lines of the school of world literature, we should stick to a basic, all encompassing name.  My suggestion [[Wikiversity:School_of_Composition_and_Literature| School of Composition and Literature]].  It's short, gets the point across.
*Finally, the command structure.  I don't know how long it will mean anything, but we'll try to have a board of directors and a person in charge of this board.  I think that most of the other schools are going with who posted to them first, so that is the way this will stand as well.  Those of you who have put your names on the lists of faculty will be considered the members of the board until such time as you see fit to no longer be attached.  It is the only really fair way to do this.

Overall, I think this will create a better system of keeping up with what I hope will be a busy schedule.  We have to let Wikimedia know that we're in this for the long haul.  As it's really really late here, I'm going to bed.  See you all around!  Cheers. --[[User:JustinLillich|JustinLillich]] 06:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

:I suggested 'School of Literary Studies' on the SLES talk page. It was a part of my master plan from before.  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]

===oh yeah===

I believe a &quot;Dean&quot; is the head of a &quot;School&quot;, where as a &quot;Chair&quot; is the head of a department, which is what you are :).  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]

== Makes sense ==

I suppose.  I wasn't thinking about it that way, as I'm trying to bring all narrative languages under one heading instead of the traditional university English department.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called JustinLillich. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name JustinLillich~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Fish''' are odorless, nutritious, and tasty.

'''Fish''' should never have the so-called &quot;fishy&quot; smell, which actually comes from bacterial decay.
It is best to get live fish. The second best choice would be frozen-at-sea fish, often marked FAS.
Refrigerated fish are generally a poor choice, especially for timid buyers who are hesitant to demand
a chance to smell the fish prior to purchase. Avoid fish with any discolored area. Do not store unfrozen fish for long.

Canned fish are often good, but very different in taste, and selection is limited. Canned [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] and [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]] are particularly high in calcium,
because the bones are softened by canning and are eaten with the flesh.

While it is generally unwise to eat any fish raw, wild freshwater fish are particularly likely to carry parasites that can infect humans.

Note: the names of fish vary around the world. Also, many different fish are often sold under the same name if they share roughly the same appearance.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.63}}

===Frames and Keyframes===
A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|frame}} is a snapshot of the scene at one moment in time. An animation consists of displaying a succession of frames representing successive moments in time; if these are shown sufficiently quickly (at least 24 frames per second), the eye is fooled into seeing smooth movement, instead of a succession of still poses.

This is the principle behind both cinema film and digital video. But long before these were invented, it was known that you could make a sequence of drawings on pages of a ''flipbook'', which could then be rapidly flipped by hand to produce an animation.

In live action video, we can capture the frames simply by letting the camera record as the scene unfolds. In hand-drawn animation (cartoons), each frame had to be drawn by a human animator (though there were some shortcut techniques like articulated character pieces, separately-moving scenery layers etc). Actually what would happen was that the most skilled artists would create {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|keyframe}}s representing pivotal points in the animation (starting and ending poses in a character’s movement etc), and the lower-paid assistants would have the job of filling in all the intermediate frames to produce smooth movement between those endpoints.

Computer animation works in a similar way, except here Blender is your lower-paid assistant. You go to crucial points in the timeline of your animation, position and pose your objects/characters appropriately, and tell Blender that this is a keyframe for the relevant transformations (positioning/rotation/scaling) of those objects/characters. Then when you run the animation, Blender will ''interpolate'' the specified transformation parameters between keyframes, giving you smooth motion over those intervals.

== The Timeline ==

At the bottom of the default Blender screen layout is a window called the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|timeline}} [[File:Blender270TimelineIcon.png]]. This gives you an overview of your animation.

[[File:Blender263Timeline.png|800px]]

You can zoom the view in and out with the mouse wheel, or scroll left and right with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}.

The numbers across the bottom are frame numbers, with your animation starting at frame 1. The light grey background indicates the total duration of the animation. The vertical green line is positioned at the current frame time, and the current frame number is also displayed in the box between the start/end values and the transport controls, and at the lower left of the viewport in the 3D view window. Yellow lines indicate where keyframes have been inserted.

You can set the current frame time by clicking with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} at the desired position. You can hop forward and backward a frame at a time with the left- and right-arrow keys, skip to the next or previous keyframe with the up- or down-arrow keys, and jump immediately to the first or last frame by holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}} and pressing left- or right-arrow.

You can also “scrub” by dragging with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} across the timeline, which causes the animation to run backwards or forwards at whatever speed you choose, locked to the times across which you drag.

==Why we need the real numbers==

This is a good juncture to justify the subject of real analysis, which essentially reduces to justifying the necessity of studying &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
So, what is missing?  Why do we need anything beyond the rationals?

The first sign of trouble is square roots.  Famously, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not rational - in other words, there is no rational number which squares to &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; (see the exercises).  This fact has a curious consequence - consider the following function:

&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb Q\to\mathbb Q;x\mapsto \left \{
\begin{matrix}
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x^2&lt;2 \\
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x^2&gt;2 \\
\end{matrix}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly this function has a dramatic jump in it around the rational &lt;math&gt;1.4&lt;/math&gt;, where it suddenly changes from being equal to zero and starts being equal to one.
However, it's difficult (or even impossible) to pin down exactly where this jump happens.  Any specific rational number is safely on one side or the other, and, indeed, in the standard [[Topological Spaces|Topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt;, this function is continuous (don't worry if that makes no sense to you).

It is this flaw which the real numbers are designed to repair.  We will define the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; so that no matter how clever we try to be, if a function has a 'jump' in the way that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does, then we will always be able to find a specific number at which it jumps.

The following sections describe the properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; which make this possible.

==Different perspectives==

In order to prove anything about the real numbers, we need to know what their properties are.  There are two different approaches to describing these properties - axiomatic and constructive.

===An axiomatic approach===

When we take an axiomatic approach, we simply make a series of assertions regarding &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that they hold.
The assertions that we make are called ''axioms'' - in a mathematical context this term means roughly 'basic assumption'.
The advantage of this approach is that it is then clear exactly what has been assumed, before proceeding to deduce results which rely only on those assumptions.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it might not be immediately clear that any object satisfying the properties we desire even exists!

===[[Real analysis/Constructing the real numbers|A constructive approach]]===

With a constructive approach, we are not happy simply to assume exactly what we want, but rather we try to ''construct'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; from something simpler, and then prove that it has the properties we want.  In this way, what could have been axioms become theorems.  There are several different ways to do this, starting from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; and using some method to 'fill up the gaps between the rationals'.
All of these methods are fairly complex and will be put off until the next section.

==The axioms==

So, what are these axioms which we will need?  The short version is to say that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''complete ordered field''.  This is in fact saying a great many things:

* That &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Real analysis/Rational Numbers|totally ordered field]].
* That &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is complete in this ordering (Note that the meaning of completeness here is not quite the same as the common meaning in the study of partially ordered sets).
* That the algebraic operations (addition and multiplication) described by the field axioms interact with the ordering in the expected manner.

In more detail, we assert the following:

# &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a field.  For this, we require binary operations ''addition'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and ''multiplication'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;) defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, and distinct elements &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; satisfying:
## &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb R, +, 0)&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative group, meaning:
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R: (x+y)+z=x+(y+z)&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in\mathbb R: x+y=y+x&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb R: x+0=x&lt;/math&gt; (identity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb R:\exists y\in\mathbb R: x+y=0&lt;/math&gt; (inverse)
## &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}, \times, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative group, meaning:
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}: (x\times y)\times z=x\times (y\times z)&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}: x\times y=y\times x&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}: x\times 1=x&lt;/math&gt; (identity)
### &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}:\exists y\in\mathbb R\setminus \{0\}: x\times y=1&lt;/math&gt; (inverse)
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R: x\times(y+z)=(x\times y)+(x\times z)&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity)
# &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered set.  For this we require a relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) satisfying:
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb R: x\leq x&lt;/math&gt; (reflexivity)
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R: (x\leq y \mbox{ and } y\leq z)\implies x\leq z&lt;/math&gt; (transitivity)
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in\mathbb R: (x\leq y \mbox{ and } y\leq x)\implies x=y&lt;/math&gt; (anti-symmetry)
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in\mathbb R: \mbox{either } x\leq y\mbox{ or }y\leq x&lt;/math&gt; (totality)
# &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is complete in this order (see below for details).
# The field operations and order interact in the expected manner, meaning:
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R:x\leq y\implies (x+z)\leq(y+z)&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb R:(x\leq y\mbox{ and }0\leq z)\implies (x\times z)\leq(y\times z)&lt;/math&gt;

This is a substantial list, and if you are not used to axiomatic mathematics (or even if you are!) it may seem somewhat daunting, especially since we have yet to give details of what completeness means.  This is amongst the longest list of axioms in any region of mathematics, but if you examine each in turn, you will find that they all state things which you have probably taken for granted as 'the way numbers behave' without a second thought.

These axioms are so exacting that there is a sense in which they specify the real numbers precisely.  In other words &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is the ''only'' complete ordered field.

===Further notation===
Having defined these operations and relations on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, we need to introduce more notation to aid in talking about them.  Hopefully all these conventions should be familiar to you, but it is important to formally present them all to avoid confusion following from misunderstanding of notation:

* Rather than writing &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; for multiplication, we may simply denote it by juxtaposition.  In other words, we write &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; to denote &lt;math&gt;x\times y&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since both multiplication and addition are associative, we omit unnecessary bracketing when several numbers are added or multiplied.  In other words, rather than writing &lt;math&gt;(x+y)+z&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x+(y+z)&lt;/math&gt;, which are equal, we simply write &lt;math&gt;x+y+z&lt;/math&gt; to denote their common value.
* To further save writing of brackets, by convention, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.  So, for example, the expression &lt;math&gt;x+yz&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;x+(yz)&lt;/math&gt;, not as &lt;math&gt;(x+y)z&lt;/math&gt;.
* The number &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''sum'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The number &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''product'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The additive inverse of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt;, and called the ''negative'' or ''negation'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;x+(-x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* The multiplicative inverse of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and called the ''reciprocal'', or simply the ''inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;x(x^{-1})=1&lt;/math&gt;.
* We define the binary operation of ''subtraction'' as follows: For &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, we set &lt;math&gt;x-y=x+(-y)&lt;/math&gt;.  The number &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''difference'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* Subtraction has the same precedence as addition (less than that of multiplication), and when the two operations are mixed without bracketing, left-associativity is implied.  For example, &lt;math&gt;a+b-c-d+e&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;(((a+b)-c)-d)+e&lt;/math&gt;.
* We define the binary operation of ''division'' as follows: For &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;y\not=0&lt;/math&gt;, we set &lt;math&gt;x/y=x(y^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.  The number &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''quotient'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and is also denoted &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Division has a higher precedence than that of addition or subtraction, but there is no simple convention as to how to handle mixed multiplication and division.  Using the &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt; notation, rather than the &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt; notation helps to avoid confusion.
* We define the binary operation of ''exponentation'' as follows:  For &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb N_0&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; recursively by &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1}=(x^n)x&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we define &lt;math&gt;x^n=(x^{-1})^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Exponentation has a higher precedence than any of division, multiplication, addition and subtraction.  For example, &lt;math&gt;ab^2+d^3&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;(a(b^2))+(d^3)&lt;/math&gt;.
* We write &lt;math&gt;x\geq y&lt;/math&gt; to mean &lt;math&gt;y\leq x&lt;/math&gt;.
* We write &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/math&gt; to mean &lt;math&gt;x\leq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\not=y&lt;/math&gt;.
* We write &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to mean &lt;math&gt;y&lt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* To abbreviate a collection of equalities or inequalities, they may be strung together.  For example, the expression &lt;math&gt;a\leq b=c=d&lt;e&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;a\leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;e&lt;/math&gt;.
* To say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''positive'' means &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* To say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''negative'' means &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* To say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''non-positive'' means &lt;math&gt;x\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* To say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''non-negative'' means &lt;math&gt;x\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* We also introduce notation for several common varieties of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.  All of these subsets are called ''intervals'':
** &lt;math&gt;[a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb R:a\leq x\leq b\}&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''closed interval'' from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;)
** &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb R:a&lt;x&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''open interval'' from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;)
** &lt;math&gt;[a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb R:a\leq x&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;(a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb R:a&lt;x\leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
** In all these cases, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''lower limit'' of the interval, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''upper limit''.
** An excluded lower limit (as in the second and fourth cases) may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that there is no lower restriction.  For example &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b]=\{x\in\mathbb R:x\leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;.
** Similarly, an excluded upper limit (as in the second and third cases) may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)=\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
** Some specific intervals which appear frequently are the ''closed unit interval'', or just ''unit interval'', which is &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^+=(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, the positive real numbers.

===Completeness===
The rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; satisfy all of the axioms above which have been explained in detail, and so if we are to escape the problem which we described [[Real analysis/The real numbers#Why we need the real numbers|above]] then we clearly need something more.  This 'something more' is ''completeness''.  There are several equivalent ways of describing completeness, but most of them require us to know about [[Real analysis#Sequences|Sequences]], which we do not introduce until the next chapter, so for the moment we can only give one definition.

====Upper bounds====

Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.  We say &lt;math&gt;b\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is an ''upper bound'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall s\in A:s\leq b&lt;/math&gt;
For example, &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound for &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, as is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not, because &lt;math&gt;1\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. A set with an upper bound &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''bounded above by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;''.  
=====Least Upper Bound=====
We say &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a ''least upper bound'' or ''supremum'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is any upper bound for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;s\leq b&lt;/math&gt;.  More formally:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall a\in A:a\leq s)\mbox{ and }(\forall b\in\mathbb R:((\forall a\in A:a\leq b)\implies(s\leq b)))&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we say &lt;math&gt;b\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''lower bound'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a\in A:a\geq b&lt;/math&gt;
and we say &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is a ''greatest lower bound'' or ''infimum'' for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall a\in A:a\geq i)\mbox{ and }(\forall b\in\mathbb R:((\forall a\in A:a\geq b)\implies(i\geq b)))&lt;/math&gt;
The supremum and infimum of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are denoted &lt;math&gt;\sup A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\inf A&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

====The Least upper bound axiom====

Now we are finally ready to state the last axiom:
* If &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and has an upper bound, then &lt;math&gt;S\ &lt;/math&gt; has a least upper bound in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the axiom of the real numbers that finally satisfies what was lacking in the rationals: completeness. It is worth noting at this point, to avoid possible confusion, that in the study of general partially ordered sets, the definition of completeness is that ''every'' subset has a least upper bound, and there is no condition that they be non-empty or bounded above.
Nevertheless, we really do wish to impose these two conditions in this case.

====Other completeness axioms====
There are other equivalent ways to state the completeness axiom, but they involve [[Real analysis/Sequences|sequences]], so we shall delay them until after the discussion of that topic.  Because of the existence of these other forms, this axiom is sometimes called the ''least upper bound axiom''.</text>

==Definition==
Sequences occur frequently in analysis, and they appear in many contexts.  While we are all familiar with sequences, it is useful to have a formal definition.

:'''Definition''' A ''sequence'' of real numbers is any function ''a''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''N'''→'''R'''.

Often sequences such as these are called ''real sequences'', ''sequences of real numbers'' or ''sequences in'' '''R''' to make it clear that the elements of the sequence are real numbers.  Analogous definitions can be given for sequences of natural numbers, integers, etc.

Given a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), a ''subsequence'', notated as &lt;math&gt;(x_{n_j})_{j=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, is a sequence where (''n''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) is strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. Phrased differently, a subsequence is a sequence where (''n''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) is an interval between the subscriped number and the superscripted number, from the notation.

For example, taking ''n''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;=2''j'' would the subsequence consisting of every other element of the original sequence, that is (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…).

===Sequence Notation===
However, we usually write ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for the image of ''n'' under ''a'', rather than ''a''(''n'').  The values ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are often called the ''elements'' of the sequence.  To make a distinction between a sequence and one of its values it is often useful to denote the entire sequence by &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, or just (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Some employ set notation and denote it as {''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}  When specifying a particular sequence, it may be written in the form (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, …), when the sequence is infinite, or (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) when the sequence is finite. We tend only to discretely write down enough elements is so that the pattern is clear, which is typically 3 times.

===Examples of Sequences===
(1, 2, 3, 4, …), (1, -2, 3, -4, …), and (1, π, π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, π&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, π&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, …) are all examples of sequences.  Note, however, that there need not be any particular pattern to the elements of the sequence.  For example, we may specify ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the ''n''-th digit of π.  Often sequences are defined recursively.  That is, to specify some initial values of the sequence, and then to specify how to get the next element of the sequence from the previous elements.  For example, consider the sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;3.  This sequences is known as the Fibonacci sequence, and its first few terms are given by (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …).  Another familiar example of a recursive sequence is Newton's method.  With an initial guess ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the zero of a function, Newton's method tells you how to construct the next guess.  In this way you generate a sequence which (hopefully) converges to the zero of the function.

===Operations on Sequences===
We can also perform algebraic operations on sequences.  In other words, we can add, subtract, multiply, divide sequences.  
These operations are simply performed element by element, for completeness we give the definitions.

: '''Definition''' Given two sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and a real number ''c'', we define the following operations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ Sequence operators

|-
| Addition || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| Subtraction || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;minus; (''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| Multiplication || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;sdot; (''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sdot; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
| Division || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;frasl; (''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) || (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), if ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n'' in '''N'''

|}

===Classification of Sequences===
Some properties of sequence are so important that they are given special names.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ Different types of monotone sequences

|-

|-

&lt;/div&gt;

Some of these terms are prefixed with ''strictly'' because the term ''increasing'' is used in some contexts with meaning either that of strictly increasing or of non-decreasing, and similarly ''decreasing'' can mean the same as either strictly decreasing, or non-increasing.  As a result, these ambiguous terms are usually prefixed with and ''strictly''. We will try adhere to using this unambiguous term.

From here, we will also describe properties of sequences based on ''boundedness'', a word which we will define for sequences below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ Different types of boundedness
! Definition !! Property
|-
| ''bounded above'' || if there exists ''M'' in '''R''' such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;''M'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''
|-
| ''bounded below'' || if there exists ''M'' in '''R''' such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;''M'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''
|-
| ''bounded'' || if the sequence is both ''bounded above'' and ''bounded below''
|-
| ''Cauchy'' || if for all ε&gt;0 there exists a natural number ''N'' so that, for all ''n'', ''m'' &amp;gt; ''N'', &amp;#124;''a''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε
|}

==Convergence==
A further important property of sequences (arguably the most important property from the perspective of analysis) is the property of convergence. THis property can be easily described by extending the epsilon-delta definition. However, because sequences are relative to counting numbers, there exists an additional way to imagine convergence. Both methods are described below.

:'''Definition''' Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of real numbers.  The sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is said to ''converge'' to a real number ''a''.
:if for all ε&gt;0, there exists ''N'' in '''N''' such that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''|&amp;lt;ε for all ''n''&amp;ge;''N''. 

If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges to ''a'' then we say  ''a'' is the ''limit'' of (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and write

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=a&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x_n\to a&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

This is read ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''approaches'' ''a'' as ''n'' ''approaches'' &amp;infin;.  If it is clear which variable is playing the role of ''n'' then this may be abbreviated to simply ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;→''a'' or lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=''a''.

If a sequence converges, then it is called ''convergent''.

It is also useful to extend this concept and allow sequences whose limits are either &amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;  

:'''Definition''' We say ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;→&amp;infin; as ''n''→&amp;infin; if for every ''M'' in '''R''' there is a natural number ''N''  so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ge; M for all ''n''&amp;ge;''N''.  We say ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;→&amp;minus;&amp;infin; as ''n''→&amp;infin; if for every ''M'' in '''R''' there is a natural number ''N'' so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;le; M for all ''n''&amp;ge;''N''.

Despite this, we do not refer to sequences such as these as convergent. They are instead called ''divergent''.  

Although convergence can be proven using the epsilon-delta definition as proof, another method to prove convergences of sequences is through mathematical induction, since sequences are referenced using counting numbers. Through this method, some theorems are easier to prove. However, proof using mathematical induction cannot generalize to real numbers like a proof using epsilon-delta can.  

The following theorems will prove that variations of a convergent sequence, expressed either through inductive notation, limit notation, or Cauchy notation, converges to exactly one number.  This may seem intuitively clear, but remember that intuition often fails us when it comes to limits. It is also in proper mathematical style to rigorously prove every mathematical notion presented to us.   
===Theorem (Uniqueness of limits)===
A sequence can have at most one limit.  In other words: if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b'' then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''.
=====Proof=====
Suppose the sequence has two distinct limits, so ''a''&amp;ne;''b''.
Let ε=|''a''&amp;minus;''b''|/3.

Certainly ε&amp;gt;0, using the definition of convergence twice we can find natural numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;|x_n-a|\leq\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

and

:&lt;math&gt;|x_n-b|\leq\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.

Taking ''k''=max(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,''N''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;) then both of these conditions hold for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence we deduce that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''a''|&amp;le;ε and |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''b''|&amp;le;ε.  Applying the triangle inequality, we see 
:&lt;math&gt;|a-b|=|(x_k-b)-(x_k-a)|\leq 2\epsilon=(2/3)|a-b|,&lt;/math&gt;
which is a contradiction.  Thus, any sequence has at most one limit.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Convergent Sequences Bounded)===
If the subsequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is a convergent sequence, then it is bounded.
=====Proof=====
Let &lt;math&gt;a=\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt;, and let ε&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

From the [[Real analysis/Sequences#Convergence|definition of convergence]] there exists a natural number ''N'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;|x_n-a|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N''.

The sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n=N+1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by ''a''+1 and below by ''a''&amp;minus;1.  Let ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max(|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|,|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|,|''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|,…,|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;|, |''a''|+1).  It follows that &amp;minus;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''M'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''.  Hence the sequence is bounded.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Boundedness of Cauchy Sequences)===
If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence, then it is bounded.
====Proof====
Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a Cauchy sequence. By the definition of a Cauchy sequence, there is a natural number ''N'' such that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;lt;1 for all ''n'',''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  In particular, |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N+1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;lt;1 for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  It follows by the reverse triangle inequality that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. If we take ''M''=max(|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|,&amp;nbsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;|,&amp;nbsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), then |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''M'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

The following theorem tells us that algebraic operations on sequences commute with the taking limits.  This simple theorem is a useful tool in computing limits.

==Properties of Sequences==
Given our new definition of convergence, it should be essential that we can use the values we get from them algebraically and whether or not we can apply algebraic intuition in regards to converging sequences as well.

=== Algebraic Operations ===
If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are convergent sequences and ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R''', the following properties hold:
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}(x_n+y_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}(x_n)+\lim_{n\to\infty}(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}(x_ny_n)=\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n\right)\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}y_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}(ax_n)=a\lim_{n\to\infty}(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{x_n}{y_n}\right)=\frac{\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}x_n}{\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}y_n}&lt;/math&gt; (assuming ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n'' in '''N''' and lim&amp;nbsp;y_n&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0).
# If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''n'' in ''N'', then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n \leq \lim_{n\to\infty}y_n&lt;/math&gt;.
====Proof====
1. Let ''x''=lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''=lim&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  We need to show that for any ε&amp;gt;0 there is natural number ''N'' so that if ''n''&amp;ge; ''N'', then |(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')|&amp;le;ε. Given any ε&amp;gt;0 we have ε/3&amp;gt;0 so from the [[Real analysis/Sequences#Convergence|definition of convergence]] there is a natural number ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''x''|&amp;le;ε/3 for all ''n''&amp;gt;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, similarly we can choose ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; |''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''y''|&amp;le;ε/3 for all ''n''&amp;gt;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Let ''N''=max(''N''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ,''N''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;).  If ''n''&amp;gt;''N'', then by the triangle inequality we have
:&lt;math&gt;|(x_n+y_n)-(x+y)|=|(x_n-x)+(y_n-y)| \leq \epsilon /3 + \epsilon /3&lt;\epsilon,&lt;/math&gt;
which is what we needed to show. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

2. Let ''x''=lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''=lim&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since these sequences are convergent they are bounded.  Let ''M''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; be a bound for (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and let ''M''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; be a bound for (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). By increasing these quantities of necessary we may also assume ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''y''. Given ε&amp;gt;0, there exists some ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|x_n - x| &lt; {\epsilon \over 2M_y}&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;|y_n - y| &lt; {\epsilon \over 2M_x}&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;.
Then for every ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;max(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;),
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x_n y_n - xy|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= |(x_n - x)y_n + x(y_n - y)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\leq |x_n - x|M_y + M_x |y_n - y|&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\leq \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

3. Let ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' for all ''n'' in '''N'''. The statement now follows from 2. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

4. We can reduce this to showing that lim&amp;nbsp;(1/''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) exists and equals 1/(lim&amp;nbsp;y&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Then it follows by 2 that we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{x_n}{y_n}\right)= \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} {1 \over y_n} \right) \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} {x_n} \right)=\frac{\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n}{\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} y_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''y''=lim&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the exercises, since y and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are not 0, we can find δ&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 so that |''y''_n|&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;δ and |''y''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;δ.  It follows that 1/|''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''|&lt;1/δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Given ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 choose ''n'' in '''N''' so that |''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ε.  We  have  
:&lt;math&gt;\left| {1 \over y_n} - {1 \over y} \right| = |y - y_n|{1 \over |y_n y|} \le \frac{|y - y_n|}{\delta^2} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} {1 \over y_n} = {1 \over y}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

5. We first can reduce to the case when one sequence is identically 0.  To see this let ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n'' in '''N'''.  Let ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose that ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 then we can then find an natural number ''N'' so that
:&lt;math&gt;|z - z_N| &lt; z\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Since ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', the absolute value equals ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Subtracting ''z'' we find that &amp;minus;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0.  Hence ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive. Contradiction. Therefore we must have that ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;0.  Which means that by 1 we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n - \lim_{n \to \infty} y_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z \le 0.&lt;/math&gt; 
Therefore lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Squeeze/Sandwich Limit Theorem)===
This is the important squeeze theorem that is a cornerstone of limits. SInce converging sequences can also be thought of through limit notions and notations, it should also be wise if this important theorem applies to converging sequences as well.

Given sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), and (''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converge to ''a'' and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''a''.
====Proof====
Fix ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. We need to find an ''N'' such that |''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.
Since (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a'' and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a'' the [[Real analysis/Sequences#Convergence|definition of convergence]] ensures that
there exists integers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and |''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;.  

Let ''N''=max(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Then, for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have &amp;minus;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' and  ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε.  Since ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''.  

Thus if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N'', then  &amp;minus;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε.
In other words, |''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Completeness ==
The following results are closely related to the completeness of the real numbers.
===Theorem (Convergence of Monotone sequences)===
Any monotone, bounded sequence converges.  If the sequence is non-decreasing, then the sequence converges to the least upper bound of the elements of the sequence.  If the sequence is non-increasing, then the sequence converges to the greatest lower bound of the elements of the sequence 
====Proof====
Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be any monotone sequence that is bounded by a real number M.  Without loss of generality, assume (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is non-decreasing. Since (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is bounded above, it has a least upper bound by the least upper bound axiom.  Let ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''N'''}.  We will now show that  (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''.

Fix ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. As was shown in the exercises, if ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sup(''A''), then for any  ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there is an element ''a'' in ''A''  so that  ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''.  
Hence, it follows that there exists an ''N'' in '''N''' so that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''.  

For any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', since ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is non-decreasing, we have that 
:&lt;math&gt;x- \epsilon &lt; x_N \leq x_n &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε and by the [[Real analysis/Sequences#Convergence|definition of convergence]], (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges to ''x''. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Nested intervals property)===
If there exists a sequence of closed intervals ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'', then &amp;cap;''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is nonempty.
====Proof====
Since ''I''&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; it follows that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n+1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Since (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are monotonic sequences they converge by the previous theorem.  
Furthermore, since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'', it follows that lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &lt;/sub&gt;. 

By the monotonicity of (''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) we have for every ''n'' 
:&lt;math&gt;a_n \leq \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n \leq \lim_{n\to\infty}b_n \leq b_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;[''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] for every ''n'', which implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n \in \bigcap _{n=1}^{\infty} I_n.&lt;/math&gt; 

Thus the intersection is nonempty. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Bolzano&amp;mdash;Weierstrass)===
Every bounded sequence of real numbers contains a convergent subsequence.
====Proof====
Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of real numbers bounded by a real number ''M'', that is  |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''M'' for all ''n''.  We define the set ''A'' by ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''r''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|''r''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''M'' and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for infinitely many ''n''}.  We note that ''A'' is non-empty since it contains &amp;minus;''M'' and ''A'' is bounded above by ''M''.  Let ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''A''.  

We claim that, for any ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there must be infinitely many points of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε).  Suppose not and fix an ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 so that there are only finitely many values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε). Either ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for infinitely many ''n'' or ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for at most only finitely many ''n'' (possibly no ''n'' at all).  Suppose ''x''&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for infinitely many ''n''.  Clearly in this case ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''M''.  If necessary restrict ε so that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''M''.  Set ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2 we have that ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for infinitely many ''n'' because there are only finitely many ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the set [''x'',''r''] and ''x'' must be less than infinitely many ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, furthermore |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''M''. Thus ''r'' is in ''A'', which contradicts that ''x'' is an upper bound for ''A''. Now suppose ''x''&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for at most finitely many ''n''. Set ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε/2.  Then there are at most only finitely man ''n'' so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''y''.  Thus, if ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for infinitely many ''n'', we have that ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''y''.  This means that ''y'' is an upper bound for ''A'' that is less than ''x'', contradicting that ''x'' wast the ''least'' upper bound of ''A''.  In either case we arrive at a contradiction, thus we must have that for any ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there must be infinitely many points of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε).
    
Now we show there is a subsequence that converges to ''x''.  We define the subsequence inductively, choose any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; from the interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).  Assuming we have chosen ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, choose ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; to be an element in the interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/k,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/k) so that ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;notin;{''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;k&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, this is possible as there are infinitely many elements of (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in the interval. Notice that for this choice of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; we have that |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;1/k.  Hence for any ε&gt;0, if we take any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1/ε, then  |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;-x|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε.  That is the subsequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Cauchy criterion)===
A sequence converges if and only if it is Cauchy.
Although this seems like a weaker property than convergence, it is actually equivalent, as the following theorem shows:
====Proof====

First we show that if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;x then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is Cauchy. Now suppose that for a given ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we wish to find an ''N'' so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε for all ''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  We will choose ''N'' so that for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε/2.  By the triangle inequality, for any ''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have:

:&lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m| \leq |x_n - x| + |x_m - x| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  

Thus (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence.


Now we show that if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence, then it converges to some ''x''.  Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a Cauchy sequence, and let ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. By the definition of a Cauchy Sequence, there exits a natural number ''L'' so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε/2 whenever ''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''L''.  Since (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence it is bounded.  By the Bolzano&amp;mdash;Weierstrass theorem, it has a convergent subsequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) that converges to some point ''x''.  Now we will show that the whole sequence converges to ''x''

Because (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) converges, we can choose a natural number  ''M'' so that if ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''M'', then |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;x|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;ε/2.  Let ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max(''L'',&amp;nbsp;''M''), and fix any ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  For ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have that

:&lt;math&gt;|x_n - x| \leq |x_n - x_{n_k}| + |x_{n_k} - x| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  

Thus by definition of convergence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


These theorems all describe different aspects of the completeness of the real numbers.  The reader will notice that the least upper bound property was used heavily in this section, and it is the axiom that separates the real numbers from the rational numbers.  While these theorems would be false for the rational numbers, not all of them can substitute for the least upper bound property.  The Cauchy criterion and the nested intervals property are not strong enough to imply the least upper bound property without additional assumptions, while the Convergence of Monotone sequences theorem and the Bolzano&amp;mdash;Weierstrass property do imply the least upper bound property.

==Limit superior and limit inferior==

Limits turn out to be a very useful tool in analysis, their primary draw back is that they may not always exist.  Occasionally it is useful to have some notion of limit that makes sense for any sequence.  To this end we introduce the limit superior (often just called the &quot;lim sup&quot;) and the limit inferor (often called the &quot;lim inf&quot;).

'''Definition''' For a sequence (x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) we define the limit superior, denoted lim&amp;thinsp;sup by:
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} x_n=\inf_{k}\sup_{n\geq k} x_n.&lt;/math&gt;  
Similarly we define the limit inferior, deonoted by lim&amp;thinsp;inf by:
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n=\sup_{k}\inf_{n\geq k} x_n.&lt;/math&gt;  
If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is not bounded above, we say that lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;.  If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is not bounded we say that lim&amp;thinsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;infin;.

Notice that for bounded sequences the lim&amp;thinsp;sup and the lim&amp;thinsp;inf always exist.  As we know general bounded sequence the limit doesn't always exist.  But in the case when the lim&amp;thinsp;sup and lim&amp;thinsp;inf are equal, life is nicer as the next theorem shows.  

===Theorem (Limit Superior and Inferior)===
Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a bounded sequence.  Then (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x'' if and only if lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;thinsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Proof====

First suppose (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''.  Fix an  ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 choose a natural number ''N'' so that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε
for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.
Hence for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have that 
:&lt;math&gt;x-\epsilon\leq \sup_{n&gt;k}x_n\leq x+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
and hence ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε.
Since ε was arbitrary, this can only happen if lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.  A similar argument shows that lim&amp;thinsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.

Now suppose lim&amp;thinsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and we wish to show that lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.  

First recall that the x=lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\inf_k\sup_{n&gt;k} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

Given an ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, since we can get arbitrarily close to the infimum, we can choose we will choose ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''ls''&lt;/sub&gt; so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{n&gt;N_{ls}} x_n - x &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly recall that the x=lim&amp;thinsp;inf&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\sup_k\inf_{n&gt;k} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

Since we can get arbitrarily close to the supremum, we can choose we will choose ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''li''&lt;/sub&gt; so that 
:&lt;math&gt;x-\sup_{n&gt;N_{li}} x_n&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''ls''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''li''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Now if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', then 
:&lt;math&gt;\inf_{n&gt; N_{li}}\leq \inf_{n\geq N}\leq x \leq \sup_{n\geq N}\leq \sup_{n&gt; N_{ls}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''  
:&lt;math&gt;x-\sup_{n&gt; N_{ls}} x_n \leq x-x_n\leq x-\inf_{n&gt;N_{li}} x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

By our choice of ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''ls''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''li''&lt;/sub&gt; this implies for any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''

:&lt;math&gt;-\epsilon \leq x-x_n\leq \epsilon.\quad\Box&lt;/math&gt;</text>

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=Introduction=
In a one-to-many relationship, one object can reference several instances of another. A model is mapped into a schema whereby each data model entity becomes a complex element type. Each data model attribute becomes a simple element type, and the one-to-many relationship is recorded as a sequence.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Exhibit 1:Data model for 1:m relationship'''
&lt;br/&gt;
:::&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Xmldmcityhotel.png|1:m relationship - City Hotel]] --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the previous chapter, we introduced a simple XML schema, XML document, and an XML stylesheet for a single entity data model.  We now include more features of each of the key aspects of XML.

==Implementing a one-to-many relationship==
There are three different techniques for implementing a one-to-many relationship:

Containment relationship: A structure is defined where one element is contained within another. The &quot;contained&quot; element ceases to exist when the &quot;container&quot; element is removed. For instance, where a city has many hotels, the hotels are &quot;contained&quot; in the city.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cityDetails&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopa&lt;/cityName&gt;
    &lt;hotelDetails&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Bull Frog Inn&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotelDetails&gt;
    &lt;hotelDetails&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Pook's Hill Lodge&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotelDetails&gt;
  &lt;/cityDetails&gt;
  &lt;cityDetails&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/cityName&gt;
    &lt;hotelDetails&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Pan Pacific Kuala Lumpur&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotelDetails&gt;
    &lt;hotelDetails&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotelDetails&gt;
  &lt;/cityDetails&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Intra-document relationships: In a case where you have one city with many hotels, rather than a city containing hotels, a hotel will have a &quot;location in&quot; relationship to a city. A city id is used as a reference on the hotel element. Therefore, rather than the hotels being contained in the city, they now just reference the city's id via the cityRef attribute. This is very similar to a foreign key in a relational database.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cityDetails&gt;
   &lt;city ID=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopa&lt;/cityName&gt;
   &lt;/city ID&gt;
   &lt;city ID=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/cityName&gt;
   &lt;/city ID&gt;
  &lt;/cityDetails&gt;
  &lt;hotelDetails&gt;
    &lt;hotel cityRef=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Bull Frog Inn&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotel&gt;
    &lt;hotel cityRef=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;hotelName&gt;Pan Pacific Kuala Lumpur&lt;/hotelName&gt;
    &lt;/hotel&gt;
  &lt;/hotelDetails&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Inter-document relationships: The inter-document relationship is much like the intra-document relationship.  It also uses the id and idRef attributes to assign an attribute to a parent attribute.  The difference is that the inter-document relationship is used when tables, such as the city and hotel tables, might live in different filesystems or tablespaces. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;city id=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopa&lt;/cityName&gt;
  &lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;city id=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/cityName&gt;
  &lt;/city&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;hotel&gt;
    &lt;city href=&quot;cityDetails.xml#c1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;hotelName&gt;Bull Frog Inn&lt;/hotelName&gt;
  &lt;/hotel&gt;
  &lt;hotel&gt;
    &lt;city href=&quot;cityDetails.xml#c2&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;hotelName&gt;Pan Pacific Kuala Lumpur&lt;/hotelName&gt;
  &lt;/hotel&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;Fair&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=XML schema=
Some of the built-in data types for an XML schema were introduced in the previous chapter, but still, there are more that are very useful, such as anyURI, date, time, year, and month.  In addition to the built-in data types, a custom data type can be defined by the schema designer to accept specific data input.  As we have learned, data are defined in XML documents using markup tags defined in an XML schema.  However, some elements might not have values.  An empty element tag can be used to address this situation.  An empty element tag (and any custom markup tag) can contain attributes that add additional information about the tag without adding extra text to the element.  An example will be shown in the chapter, using attributes in an empty element tag.

==Empty elements with attributes in XML document==

Elements can have different content types depending on how each element is defined in the XML schema. The different types are element content, mixed content, simple content, and empty content.  An XML element consists of everything from the start of the element tag to the close of that element tag.  

*An element with element content is the root element - everything in between the opening and closing tags consists of elements only.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;&gt;Example:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;87%&quot;&gt;&lt;tourGuide&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/tourGuide&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
*A mixed content element is one that has text and as well as other elements between its opening and closing tags.  
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;&gt;Example:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;87%&quot;&gt;&lt;restaurant&gt;My favorite restaurant is&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;restaurantName&gt;Provino's Italian Restaurant&lt;/restaurantName&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/restaurant&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
*A simple content element is one that contains only text between its opening and closing tags. 
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;&gt;Example:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;87%&quot;&gt;&lt;restaurantName&gt;Provino's Italian Restaurant&lt;/restaurantName&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
*An empty content element, which is an empty element, is one that does not contain anything between its opening and closing tags (or the element tag is opened and ended with a single tag, by using / before the closing of the opening tag.
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;13%&quot;&gt;Example:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;87%&quot;&gt;&lt;hotelPicture filename=&quot;pan_pacific.jpg&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; value=&quot;Image of Pan Pacific&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

An empty element is useful when there is no need to specify its content or that the information describing the element is fixed.  Two examples illustrated this concept. First, a picture element that references the source of an image with its attributes, but has no need in specifying text content. Second,  the owner’s name is fixed for a company, thus it can specify the related information inside the owner tag using attributes.  An attribute is meta-information, information that describes the content of the element.

==XML schema data types==

Some of the commonly used data types, such as string, decimal, integer, and boolean, are introduced in chapter 2.  The following are a few more data types that are useful.

'''Exhibit 3:Other data types:'''

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;7%&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;25%&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;18%&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;year&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;YYYY&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1999&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;month&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1999-03&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Month type is used when the day is irrelevant for the data element&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;time&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;hh:mm:ss.sss with optional time zone indicator&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;20:14:05&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Z for UTC or one of –hh:mm or +hh:mm to indicate the difference from UTC. This time type is used when you want the content to represent a particular time of day that recurs every day, such as 4:15 pm.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;date&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/td&gt;

==More data types==
Besides the built-in data types, custom data types can be created as required.  A custom data type can be a simple type or complex type.  For simplicity, we create a custom data type that is a simple type, which means that the element does not contain other elements or attributes. It contains text only.  The creation of a custom simple type starts from using a built-in simple type and applying it with restrictions, or facets, to limit the acceptable values of the tag.  A custom simple type can be nameless or named.  If the custom simple type is to be used only once, then it makes sense to not name it; thus, that custom type will only be used in where it is defined.  Since a named custom type can be referenced (by its name), that custom type can be used wherever necessary.  

A pattern can be used to specify exactly how the content of the element should look.  For example, one might want to specify the format of a telephone number, a postal code, or a product code.  By having a defined pattern for certain elements, the data exchanged will be uniform and the values will be consistent when stored in a database.  A useful way to set patterns is through Regex, which will be discussed in later chapters.

==Schema examples==

The following is a schema that extends the schema introduced in the  previous chapter to include a one-to-many relationship of city to hotels with two examples of custom data types.

'''Exhibit 1:Data model for 1:m relationship'''
:::[[Image:Xmldmcityhotel.png|1:m relationship - City Hotel]]

Important, this is a continuing example, so new code is added to the last chapter's example!

*The valid element naming structure applies to attribute names as well
*In a given element, all attributes’ names must be unique
*An attribute may not contain the symbol ‘&lt;’ The character string ‘&amp;amp;lt;’ can be used to represent it
*Each attribute must have a name and a value.  (i.e. &lt;hotelPicture filename=“pan_pacific.jpg” /&gt;, filename is the name and pan_pacific.jpg is the value)
*If the assigned value itself contains a quoted string, the type of quotation marks must differ from those used to enclose the entire value.  (For instance, if double quotes are used to enclose the whole value then use single quotes for the string: &lt;name familiar=”’Jack’”&gt;John Smith&lt;/name&gt;)

| Besides the simple built-in data types (e.g, year, month, time, anyURI, and date) schema designers may create custom data types to suit their needs.  A simple custom data type can be created from one of the built-in data types by applying to it some restrictions, facets (enumerations that specify a set of acceptable values), or specific patterns.  

An empty element does not contain any text, however, it may contain attributes to provide additional information about that element. 

The presentation layout for displaying a HTML page can include code for style tags, background color, font size, font weight, and alignment.  Table tags can be used to organize the layout of content in a HTML page, and images can also be displayed using an image tag.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Files==
===Background Information===
Any information that is stored on the computer for later use is saved in a file. If there was music on your computer, it might be saved in an mp3 or ogg vorbis file. If one acquired a picture of a monkey and wanted to save if for later use, they might save it as a jpg or png file.

===File Naming===
When there is a file on the computer, it is saved on the '''hard drive''' with a name. This name can be whatever you may desire, but it will have an extension at the end. For example, the picture of a monkey might be called monkey.png. There may be spaces, dashes, and underscores in file names. Using any other special characters such as parenthesis and @ symbols is generally a bad idea. Capital Letters can also be used. If you had a band with the name of Green Pickles and a song called Soup, the name for this song on the computer could be GreenPickles-Soup.mp3, Green Pickles - Soup.mp3, green_pickles-soup.mp3, or whatever you want.

There will also be times when files don't have an extension. Those are mostly text files or executable files which will be explained.

===Organizing and Creating Files===
Hard drives are very big these days, and people have a whole bunch of files. To organize all of these files, a method that can be thought of as a brief case can be used. To look at files, humans use a file manager. Clicking on My Computer from the desktop or start menu will do.

Try this:

# Click on My Computer on the '''Desktop''' or Windows Explorer (Start -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Windows Explorer).
# Go to Tools -&gt; Folder Options... and click on the File Types tab.
# If &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot; is checked, uncheck it by clicking in the checkbox.
#* The previous two steps are not necessary but very useful.
# Go to the c: drive (pronounced &quot;c drive&quot;) by double clicking on it.
#* You have just dived into your hard drive. This is where most of your files are stored.
#* a is the floppy drive, d is usually the cd-rom or dvd-rom drive, and other peripherals like usb drives are the next letters.
# Scroll up and down. You should see quite a few folders. One will be called &quot;Program Files&quot; and another one will be called &quot;Windows.&quot; There will also be more.
# The first thing you need is a place to put all of your personal documents. Luckily, Windows has these folders already pre-made. There are folders called My Documents in Windows.
## When you are in the c drive, right click in empty space and click New -&gt; Folder. You can also do this by going to File -&gt; New -&gt; Folder. Give the folder your name by typing it, and press Enter on the keyboard when your finished.
# Now, go into that folder by double clicking on it.
# If you want, make a few more folders inside of that one for more organization. For example, have one for pictures, one for school/work, one for music, and whatever you can think of. You can also make those folders as you go along.
# Close the window when finished.

Now we are going to make a simple file.
# Open Notepad.
# Type &quot;Hello, I am practicing my computer skills&quot; or whatever you want to type.
# Click on File -&gt; Save As
# Navigate to C:\YourName\ and call the text file practice.txt.
# Open My Computer or Windows Explorer.
# Go to C:\YourName\
# You will see that there is a file called practice.txt.
# Double click on it.
#* practice.txt was just opened by Notepad!
# Close Notepad.

===Moving Files with the Cut, Copy, and Paste===
You will now learn how to move files.
# Open up My Computer or Windows Explorer
# Make a new folder in your folder called computer-practice. For example, it could be C:\YourName\computer-practice\.
# Go to C:\YourName\, right click on practice.txt, and press copy.
# Go to C:\YourName\computer-practice\
# Right click in empty space and choose paste.
# Go to C:\YourName\, right click on practice.txt, and press delete.
#* When the file is deleted, it is not gone forever. To remove it more, read about the '''&lt;recycle bin&gt;'''.
#* To save time, cut could have been used instead of copy. The difference is that when you paste after pressing cut, the file is deleted from its original location. You shouldn't use this too much just in case something goes wrong.

Moving one file at a time is fun, but sometimes we need to move a whole bunch at a time.
# Go to C:\YourName\computer-practice\
# Copy practice.txt
# Press paste lots of times. (Hold ctrl and keep pressing v)
#* The new files will be renamed to something like &quot;copy of practice.txt&quot;
# There are two ways to select all of the files in this folder.
## Press Ctrl-A or Edit -&gt; Select All
## Click the one on the top, hold shift, and click the one on the bottom.
# When they are all highlighted, right click on one of them and press copy.
#* As usual, the same thing can be done with Edit -&gt; Copy or Ctrl-v
# Go to C:\YourName\
# Paste the files
# Delete all the text files that you just made in C:\YourName\

Sometimes, you only want to select some of the files in a folder
# Go to C:\YourName\computer-practice\
# Click on the first file.
# Hold shift down and click on another one towards the middle.
#* The files you clicked on and everything in between has been selected.
# Click in empty space so everything is deselected.
# Click on the first file again.
# Hold ctrl and click another file.
#* The files you clicked are the only ones that are selected.
# Hold ctrl and click yet another file.

===Searching For Files===
Knowing the name of a file, but not the location, can be very aggravating. Who wants to spend hours searching through an endless amount of folders? The answer is not very many people and that is what file searching is for.

Let's say that someone has a file called important.zip. This person lost it, so they are now going to find it quickly. Here's what the person would do.
# Right click Start -&gt; Search.
# Type in the file name, select where the file may be located [i.e. My Documents, My Computer.]

There are other things to be done with the find utility. One feature is using *. The * means that anything can be there. For example, searching for *.ogg would find any file that had a .ogg at the end. Searching for *report* would find anything that had the word report in the file name.

===Shortcuts===
A shortcut is a file that leads to another file or a website. There main use is for the desktop (The screen behind all the windows. Icons are on the desktop). 

Here is one way to use a shortcut.
# Right click on the desktop.
# Click New -&gt; Shortcut
# A '''wizard''' will come up.
# Make the shortcut name &quot;Notepad&quot; and the link location C:\WINDOWS\system32\notepad.exe.

With this shortcut, you can open Notepad in the click of a button. You may now delete this shortcut if you think you'll never use it by right clicking on it.

Here is one way to use an Internet shortcut.
# Open up My Computer or Windows Explorer
# Go to C:\YourName\computer-practice\
# Do the same thing that you would do to make a folder, but click shortcut instead.
# A '''wizard''' will come up.
# Make the shortcut name &quot;Never Used A Computer&quot; and the link location http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Never_Used_A_Computer/.

With this shortcut, you can go to this book's website when you are in the computer-practice folder. You may now delete this shortcut because you'll probably never use it.

===Compression===
When a file or more than one file is too big, compression can be used. Compression is used on the internet a lot because it is better to download smaller files. If you've ever seen a file with a .zip extension, then you have witnessed the most common type of compression in Windows. There are also compression formats with a .gz, .bz2, or .rar extension.

====Extracting====
&quot;I got a .zip file from the Internet, now what?&quot; is a common question. The answer is actually quite simple starting with Windows XP. All you have to do is right click on it in My Computer or Windows Explorer and choose &quot;Extract All...&quot; A wizard will come up and it is pretty straightforward. When you click next, it will ask you where to put the files. The default folder is usually good, but you can change it if necessary. Also, if the file has a password, click the Password... button and type it in. When you click Next, the files will be extracted to the directory, and one more thing will come up. It'll be a check box that says &quot;Show extracted files&quot;. It is a good idea to make this unchecked because it'll open up a new window if you don't, which is annoying.

If you have an older version of Windows or want to be able to extract files other than zip files, a great option is [http://7-zip.org/ 7-zip]. It works basically the same way as the first method, or you can use their 7-zip File Manager which should be in the Start Menu.

====Compressing====
Just like files can be uncompressed, it is also possible to make your own .zip files. The easiest way to do this is to do these steps.
# Open up My Computer or Windows Explorer
# Right click on a file or folder that you want to be compressed.
# Choose Send To -&gt; Compressed (zipped) Folder
#* A .zip file with the same name as the original file for folder will be created in the same directory as the original file or folder.
#* For example, if there was a file called C:\Ronald\Bacon\BaconBenefits.doc, and you compressed it, there would now be a file called C:\Ronald\Bacon\BaconBenefits.zip. BaconBenefits.doc is still there.
# If you want to add to the archive, right click the .zip file and click Open.
# You can add more files by copying and pasting them in the new window that opens up.

The same can be done in other applications such as 7-zip, WinZip, and WinRar.

==Types of Applications==
There are a few types of applications
* Open Source - Free software where the source code, the language programmers use to make computers do their jobs, is available to everyone. Anyone can change the code and see how it works. 
* Freeware - This is free software that you may acquire legally without any fees.
* Shareware - This is free software that you may acquire legally without any fees.  However, there may be some restrictions (e.g. more advanced features may require a payment.) 
* Commercial - This software is normally sold in boxed packages.
* Free-Trial - This software allows a period of time where the software can be used without cost, but extended use requires a small payment.

==Installing Applications in Linux==
Most Linux-based operating systems come with a [[w:package management system | package manager]], a tool that simplifies the process of installing and removing programs, and automatically updates installed software. A list of how to install application in major distributions follows (application= name of application you want to install):
====Arch/Chakra Linux====
pacman -S application
====Fedora/Cent/RHT Linux====
yum install application
====Ubuntu====
apt-get install application

==Installing Applications in Windows==
Your computer probably came with some software already on it, but what if you need to do something fancy? For almost every task you could think of doing with a computer, there is a software program to let your computer do it. 

There are a few ways to install applications
* Install from a CD or DVD - You put the disc in the drive and follow instructions. The defaults will usually work fine.
* Install from the internet
** You download a file, extract it if it's compressed (.zip, .bz2, .gz, etc.), click on the file with a .exe extension, and follow instructions.
** On a very rare occasion you have to compile a program from source. This can be tough, but the program will probably have a file called INSTALL that should be read.

Learning is fun, so here's some more useful info. An executable file has either no extension at all or a .exe extension. When a file is executable, you can run it and it will do something. For example, the executable for Notepad is C:\WINDOWS\system32\notepad.exe. When you click on Start -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Notepad, it is really the same thing as going to notepad.exe in Windows Explorer and double-clicking it.

==Uninstalling Applications==
===Windows===
Sometimes a application is installed, but you don't want it anymore. Removing unwanted applications is like eating pie, easy.
# Go to Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Add or Remove 
# Highlight what you want to remove by clicking on it.
# Press Remove or Change/Remove
# Follow the instructions. They will most likely be pretty straight forward.
===Linux===
==Customizing==
This chapter will not explain every secret and tweak in Windows. What it will do is describe things that everyone should know in terms of customizing their computing experience to suite their needs.
===Start Menu===
====Contents====
Applications usually put themselves in the Start Menu automatically, but you may find that there is something that needs to be added or tweaked.

There are two ways to edit what is inside of the start menu. Try the first one, and if that doesn't work, the second method will work.

=====Dragging, Dropping, and Right Clicking=====
===Taskbar===
====Auto-Hide the Taskbar====
Have you ever seen someone's desktop and noticed that there is no taskbar, but then when they put their mouse at the bottom of the screen, it appears? That is called auto-hiding the taskbar. This is the kind of thing where some people love it and some people hate it. Here's how to do it.
# Right click on the taskbar.
# Click Properties.
# Check Auto-hide the taskbar.
# Press OK or Apply. (Apply won't close the window)
To make it normal again, do the same thing but this time uncheck the box.

====Show Quick Launch====

# Do the first two steps as Auto-Hide the Taskbar.
## Right click on the taskbar.
## Click Properties.
# Check Show Quick Launch.
To deactivate it, do the same thing but this time uncheck the box.

===Screen Size (Resolution)===
There are two factors in determining the size of an image on the monitor. The first one is obvious, the physical size of the monitor. These would be values like 15&quot;, 17&quot;, 19&quot;, etc. Of course, this can't be changed without buying a new monitor.

The other thing that can determine the size of images on the screen is the resolution. To understand it, you have to know a little bit about how monitors work. It's not much.

A pixel is dot on the screen that has exactly one color. When all of those dots are combined, they make up what you see on the monitor. The resolution is how many dots are on the screen. When people describe resolution, they are talking about how many rows and columns of pixels there are, like a chess board. For example, a resolution of 640x480 means that there are 640 pixels going from the left to the right of the screen in one row, and there are 480 pixels going from the top to the bottom of the screen in one column.

Changing the resolution is very simple in Windows.
# First right click on the desktop, the area in the screen where the icons are, and click properties. You can also do the same thing by going in Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Display.
# After that, go to the Settings tab.
# Click and hold the slider under Screen Resolution. Let go when you are at a suitable resolution.
#* 1024x768 is a good choice. If your monitor can go higher, then do that if the text isn't too small.
# Press Apply.
#* If the screen looks really weird and gets all funky, don't panic. If you don't press Ok to the dialog that comes up, it will automatically change back to where it was in a few seconds.

Also, notice the Color Quality section. Putting it on 32-bit color is a good idea if it isn't there already because it makes everything look so much nicer. If you monitor can't handle it, change it back.
&lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Boeuf bourguignon''''' ([[w:French language|French]] for [[w:Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] beef) is a well known, traditional [[w:French cuisine|French]] stew prepared with beef braised in red wine (originally [[w:Burgundy wine|Burgundy wine]]) and beef broth, flavored with garlic, onions, carrots, a [[w:bouquet garni|''bouquet garni'']] and garnished with mushrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cooking.knopfdoubleday.com/2009/07/13/julia-childs-boeuf-bourguignon-recipe/ A copy of Julia Child's ''boeuf bourguignon'' recipe from her book ''Mastering the art of French Cooking'' posted on the Knopf Doubleday website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, chefs larded the meat with [[w:lardon|''lardons'']], but modern beef is so tender and well marbled that this time-consuming technique is rarely necessary.

[[w:Julia Child|Julia Child]] included a recipe for ''Sauté de Boeuf à la Bourguignonne'' in [[w:Mastering the Art of French Cooking|''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'']], her famous first book.

Child recommends serving this dish &quot;in a casserole, or on a platter surrounded with steamed rice, ''risotto'', or potato balls sautéed in butter&quot;, and also states that &quot;buttered green peas or beans could accompany it, and a good red Bordeaux wine&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Mastering the Art of French Cooking (Second Edition, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; She also points out that this is a dish that benefits from a day in the refrigerator.

{{cquote|Fortunately you can prepare it competely ahead, even a day in advance, and it only gains in flavor when reheated.}}

==History==
''Boeuf bourguignon'' is one of many examples of peasant dishes slowly evolving into [[w:haute cuisine|''haute cuisine'']]. Most likely, the method of slowly [[w:simmering|simmering]] beef in wine originated as a means of tenderizing cuts of meat that were too tough to cook any other way. Also, simmering these two ingredients together helps to create a unique and pleasant flavor.

French culinary expert [[w:Auguste Escoffier|Auguste Escoffier]] first published the ''boeuf bourguignon'' recipe once the dish became a standard of French cuisine. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saltlakemagazine.com/Salt-Lake-Magazine/February-2009/One-Pot-Parties/index.php?cparticle=5&amp;siarticle=4 Info and history on ''boeuf bourguignon'' on the ''Saltlake'' magazine website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time it has undergone subtle alterations, owing to changes in cooking equipment and available food supplies.

==Alternate spellings==
* beef ''bourguignon'' (This is the dish's most common English name.)
* ''bœuf à la bourguignonne''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.infoplease.com/boeuf-bourguignon Correct spelling and pronunciation of ''boeuf bourguignon'' on the Infoplease website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''bœuf bourguignon'' (''Le Cordon Bleu Professional Cooking'', Wayne Gisslen, Fifth Edition, 2003)
* ''beef bourguignonne'' (incorrect spelling found for example in [[w:Food Lover's Companion|Food Lover's Companion]], Sharon Tyler Herbst, Third Edition, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;''Bourguignonne'' is the French feminine adjectival form of ''[[w:fr:Bourgogne|Bourgogne]]'', [[w:Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Beef, ''boeuf'' in French, is masculine in that language, and therefore ''bourguignon'', the masculine form, is correct usage. Reference, Wiktionnaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* beef burgundy or burgundy beef

==Recipes==
There are two recipes posted below. The first is based on Julia Child's recipe&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe?id=8222804 Julia Child's ''boeuf bourguignon'' recipe on the ''Good Morning America website'']&lt;/ref&gt; and includes ''lardons''. The second is a simpler version that omits them.

==An adaption of Julia Child's original recipe (serves six to eight)==
===Ingredients===
''From Page 333 &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cocking&quot; - Volume 1''
*6 ounces (170 g) of chunk bacon
*3 1/2 tablespoons [[cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]] 
*3 pounds (1360 g) lean stewing [[cookbook:beef|beef]], cut into 2-inch cubes 
*1 [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]], sliced 
*1 [[cookbook:onion|onion]], sliced 
*Salt and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] 
*2 tablespoons [[cookbook:flour|flour]] 
*3 cups [[w:red wine|red wine]], young and full-bodied (like Beaujolais, Côtes du Rhone or Burgundy) 
*2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups brown [[w:beef stock|beef stock]] 
*1 tablespoon [[w:tomato paste|tomato paste]] 
*2 cloves mashed [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] 
*1/2 teaspoon [[w:thyme|thyme]]
*A crumbled [[w:bay leaf|bay leaf]] 
*18 to 24 white onions, small 
*3 1/2 tablespoons [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
*Herb bouquet (4 [[w:parsley|parsley]] sprigs, one-half [[w:bay leaf|bay leaf]], one-quarter teaspoon thyme, tied in [[w:cheesecloth|cheesecloth]]) 
*1 pound [[w:mushrooms|mushrooms]], fresh and quartered

===Preparation===
#Remove bacon rind and cut into ''lardons'' (sticks one quarter-inch thick and one and a half inches long). Simmer rind and ''lardons'' for ten minutes in one and a half quarts water. Drain and dry. 
#Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230C). 
#Sauté ''lardons'' in one tablespoon of the olive oil in a flameproof casserole pan over moderate heat for two to three minutes to brown lightly. Remove to a side dish with a slotted spoon. 
#Dry beef in paper towels; it will not brown if it is damp. Heat fat in casserole until almost smoking. Add beef, a few pieces at a time, and sauté until nicely browned on all sides. Add it to the ''lardons''. 
#In the same fat, brown the sliced vegetables. Pour out the excess fat. 
#Return the beef and bacon to the casserole and toss with one half teaspoon of salt and one quarter teaspoon of pepper. 
#Then sprinkle on the flour and toss again to coat the beef lightly. Set casserole uncovered in middle position of preheated oven for four minutes. 
#Toss the meat again and return to oven for four minutes (this browns the flour and covers the meat with a light crust). 
#Remove casserole and turn oven down to 325 degrees F (160C). 
#Stir in wine and two to three cups stock, just enough so that the meat is barely covered. 
#Add the tomato paste, garlic, herbs and bacon rind. Bring to a simmer on top of the stove. 
#Cover casserole and set in lower third of oven. Regulate heat so that liquid simmers very slowly for three to four hours. The meat is done when a fork pierces it easily. 
#While the beef is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms. 
#Heat one and a half tablespoons butter with one and one-half tablespoons of the oil until bubbling in a skillet. 
#Add onions and sauté over moderate heat for about ten minutes, rolling them so they will brown as evenly as possible. Be careful not to break their skins. You cannot expect them to brown uniformly. 
#Add one half cup of the stock, salt and pepper to taste and the herb bouquet. 
#Cover and simmer slowly for 40 to 50 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but hold their shape, and the liquid has evaporated. Remove herb bouquet and set onions aside. 
#Wipe out skillet and heat remaining oil and butter over high heat. As soon as you see butter has begun to subside, indicating it is hot enough, add mushrooms. 
#Toss and shake pan for four to five minutes. As soon as they have begun to brown lightly, remove from heat. 
#When the meat is tender, pour the contents of the casserole into a sieve set over a saucepan. 
#Wash out the casserole and return the beef and ''lardons'' to it. Distribute the cooked onions and mushrooms on top. 
#Skim fat off sauce in saucepan. Simmer sauce for a minute or two, skimming off additional fat as it rises. You should have about two and a half cups of sauce thick enough to coat a spoon lightly. 
#If too thin, boil it down rapidly. If too thick, mix in a few tablespoons stock. Taste carefully for seasoning. 
#Pour sauce over meat and vegetables. Cover and simmer two to three minutes, basting the meat and vegetables with the sauce several times. 
#Serve in casserole, or arrange stew on a platter surrounded with potatoes, noodles or rice, and decorated with parsley.

==Recipe '''without''' ''lardons'' (serves four)==
===Ingredients===
* 3 large [[cookbook:onion|onions]]
* 1kg [[cookbook:beef|beef]], [[wikipedia:blade steak|blade steak]], or stewing shoulder cut
* 300g of chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 300g of button [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* bouquet of herbs: [[cookbook:basil|basil]], [[cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]] and [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] tied with string
* 2-4 cups of [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]]
* 1-2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* [[cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
* [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
''Note: Use a low-fat cut of beef and serve with boiled potatoes or steamed rice on the side to lower the fat and calories of this dish.''

===Preparation===
# Cut beef into large, five-centimeter chunks. Season with salt, pepper and olive oil.
# Cook beef a small amount at a time in a [[cookbook:dutch oven|dutch oven]] or large [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]] until it's golden brown on the outside. Remove each portion as it's done and set aside.
# Add three large onions and garlic to the same pot and cook till golden brown.
# Sprinkle with two tablespoons of flour. Cook a few minutes longer.
# Add one to two cups of red wine.
# Bring wine to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]] then [[cookbook:simmer|simmer]] for five minutes.
# Add beef, carrots, herbs and mushrooms.
# Add another couple of cups of red wine and water; enough to cover the meat and vegetables.
# Cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove surface scum as required.

===Tips===
Use leftovers to make [[wikipedia:meat pies|meat pies]] or [[cookbook:puff pastry|puff pastries]].

Add a small amount of dried Trompettes de la mort ([[wikipedia:Craterellus cornucopioides|Craterellus cornucopioides]]). For a dish serving 4, 4 trompettes can be used depending on taste. Cut off parts that may contain sand, rinse, cut in small pieces, soak for 5 minutes in warm water and add to the dish after adding the wine. Can be used instead of garlic.

I would strongly suggest that this entire wikibook be deleted as a &quot;wikibook&quot; and it become a subchapter of a parental topic such as atmospheric science, meteorology, and climatology.  It should also be written from the point of neutrality - which I would suggest means that as long as their is a controversial discussion about &quot;climate change&quot; that it not be represented from a single point of view (i.e. man-made, and/or natural).

Per the person who made this statement - &quot;the vast majority of the scientific community now believe that we must cut our emissions or else face some truly terrible consequences.&quot;  You should perhaps read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles.   

--------

Hmmm... I have to say this book is attracting more interest from Climate Change cynics than I had suspected.  My own understanding of the situation is that - yes - the scientific community was unsure of the causal link between man-made pollution and climate change.  But things have moved on significantly in the past few years and it's now almost certain that humans are responsible for the recent increases in temperatures that we have witnessed.

For example: http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050131/full/050131-14.html

For those of you with access to the academic literature, I '''urge''' you to run some searches on &quot;climate change&quot;.  The '''vast majority''' of the scientific community now believe that we must cut our emissions or else face some truly terrible consequences.  People (not to mention countless animals and plants) are '''already dying''' because of our actions.  Please look at the ''up to date'' facts before posting any cynical content on this book.

Please.  For the good of our planet. - [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 7:10am 9th Feb 2005 GMT

Follow the money.

You need to understand academic literature and research before you can properly judge this. Consider three equally prominent (or obscure) researchers with equally sound (or unsound) science. One researcher says that we are causing our doom by our actions, one says that we are doomed no matter what, and one says that everything will be OK. Which of the three will get funding?

Going against the flow of money is a dumb career move, at least in the short term. Consider the cases of stomach ulcers (caused by bacteria) and cancer growths (which emit chemicals that cause blood vessel growth). Money went to the researchers denouncing these now-proven theories. In the field of computer science, from about 1985 to 1995 all OS researchers had to accept the idea that microkernels were superior. Those who pointed out the idiocy of microkernels were denied funding. Linus Torvalds, lead developer for Linux, was even taunted/confronted/teased/insulted by one of the big-name OS researchers for going against the fad... yet today we see that Linux is a solid high-performing OS while not even one true microkernel (no, MacOS X only pays it lip service) is into the big leagues. That big-name OS researcher had a profitable textbook to promote; you can see the bias if you follow the money. For many, tenure is at stake, and so they must support those who will be voting to grant tenure or not.

Climate change research is certainly not immune to these political problems. Researchers must defend themselves and their profitable theories. It's all &quot;gloom and doom, but send more money and maybe we can figure something out or see how bad it is&quot;.

I have just contributed some words on anthropogenic climate change.
Although this is not my field, I don't want to see it parched and lifeless, if I may be allowed to freely mix metaphors:-)

My comment on Pascal's wager may be of interest regarding the arguments for and against the validity of climate change evidence.

When we refer to 'emissions' we may need to distinguish between the different sorts of emissions: carbon dioxide contributes around 20% of the total greenhouse effect and methane, nitrous oxide and a number of other gases contribute another 20%.

== Sources from wikipedia ==

([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 23:09, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)) There are lots of source pages within wikipedia for content here: the most obvious are: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_temperature_record, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change and links therein.

: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 21:42, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)) Hmmm... well, the wikipedia climate change pages are fairly mature. I can't quite see the point in fighting the same old wars over here.

== some scientifically oriented content ==

I've been editing this page a bit. I'm trying to insert some sound science into the description of climate change. I think the organization of the page needs some work too, and if I have a chance I'll try to arrange things in a little more coherent order. [[User:Skymath|Skymath]] 07:52, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Great Global Warming Swindle ==

A programme by the same name as this was screened in the UK in March 2007. It caused great debate because it provided a number of reasonably highly profiled academics who repudiated many of the claims of the climate change scientists. Upon closer scrutiny, however, and after watching the online debate, it would seem that the contrarian view (one often taken by this particular documentary film maker) was somewhat misinformed and misrepresented some of the facts. This massaging was sufficient to call into doubt the integrity of the programme. Others discontent with the programme, in various discussion venues on the internet cited a webpage called exxonsecrets.com which indicated cash flows from Exxon, to key government departments and research individuals, who presumably have been on the payroll to promote a degree of disinformation. It would seem that the only thing absolutely certain about climate change is that it produces spin.

:I think that climate changes is evident, even to the proverbial blind person. The reason can be varied but thinking that humans have no impact is the same as stating that acid rain never existed, that we are not about to reach the planet record population of 9 billions (and all the related implications) and the it is becoming increasingly rare to find an ecosystem without stress due to human actions.
:The issue is that there are geopolitic interests behind the disinformation. Coal producers for instance, and at the other end of the spectrum solar cell producers or heolic turbine manufactures. This of course in due to economic motives and in great part of the world, economics dictates policies and shapes the future. For me some of the greatest errors coming from this are the &quot;fake solutions&quot; like carbon trading or similar concepts, like most of the carbon capturing proposal, all these invested interests are creating a general mess on the ability to scientifically address the issues so we can at least stabilize the situation.    --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:43, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

== GLOBAL DIMMING ==

The article fails to mention anything about global dimming. This effect, under it's current understanding, is a very large factor in the progress of the climate.  Someone should add it in.

I have moved things back into the proper namespace, articles on programming ''should'' be in the Programming: namespace (IMO the new naming scheme wasn't very workable and was a bit cumbersome in some times). If you wish to update the older articles, update the articles.

Hope I'm not treading on many feet here. I like the new systematic handling of this textbook, it just needs to be named better. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:40, 20 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Basic pascal and ... are functional languages? They are PROCEDURAL languages.
Functional languages are very different languages e..g Haskell.

Shouldn't these things be in seperate text books? I don't see why they all should be considered one book. Do you ever go to the bookstore and buy a book that tells you how to program 20 languages? [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 19:43, 8 Oct 2003 (UTC)
:I agree. [[User:Noldoaran|Noldoaran]] 17:00, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Is there one language that people could agree on to write one textbook in?  Once we have one textbook, most of it can likely be ported to other languages.  Another option is to write one textbook completely language neutral (maybe pseudo-code) and have separate textbooks that teach languages specifically without the accompanying concepts (presumably with the concept book as a prerequisite).  Any thoughts?  [[User:Xygorn|Xygorn]] 5:49, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:: Nope, doesn't work like that. Each language has its own nuances and particulars that need to be taken into consideration - take C for example. In order to teach people how to write ''good'' C, you have to instruct them as to what the Standard says on things, about bounds checking, and all that lovely C-jazz, which you don't ''need'' to in other languages. Other languages may have their own special specifics. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:03, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I thought that [[Computer programming]] is like the gateway page to all the Programming: languages? Each language can be considered to be in its own volume? I don't know, just my 2c [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:36, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)

The way [[Computer programming]] is positioned on the main page, I interperted it to be a shelf of it's own with the various texts on languages therin. Though [[Computer programming]] does need to have it's own book however for the programming patterns that are not language dependent, like looping in general or how to build a recursive function/method to keep all of the book from having to be Language101. As it stands, I see [[Computer programming]] as a very good introduction page. [[User:Dbroadwell|Dbroadwell]] 03:21, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Should beginners care about speed? ==

I'm going to remove a lot of discussion on speed differences in languages, which I think is largely irrelevant these days, especially for beginners in programming.  

Even if you don't agree about speed of execution, at least you would agree about speed of compiling right?  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:15, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC) 

: Beginners, no. Compilation speed, yes. But what languages are that slow to be noticeable? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:39, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I think there should at least be a mention of Forth, though I don't know what category it belongs in.

The Abstraction Leaks sub paragraph needs to be filled in. [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:49, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I have changed the reference about [[Programming:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]] as being easily learned to read simply as [[Programming:Basic|Basic]] because. 
* '''Visual Basic''' is NOT an easily learned language and was never designed as a teaching language.  Microsoft seem to have developed it as a common automation technique for various Microsoft Office applications and it has been so useful or necessary that a lot of people now use it as a programming language.
* '''Basic''' was originally developed as a teaching language.
I have also added a paragraph about availability and suitability of a language choice, and the need to learn to read legacy source code so it can be maintained or updated.

Feel free to adjust/reverse if any of this is not correct [[User:210.86.34.179|210.86.34.179]] 07:26, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)

** If that's the case, we might as well just get rid of Basic altogether (not an idelogical statement) because nobody actually teaches with it.  VB is easy not because of the language but because of the visual GUI editor.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:23, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

BTW: Has anyone heard about '''Structured Programming''' - which is a language independent technique and can be done in any language the programmer might choose, including English.  Rather than launching straight into a discussion about what language to choose, one could discuss the benefits of structuring and planning a programming task so that it can be organised into modules and sections before coding commences.  The use of Structured Programming techniques can do as much for the speed of a programming application as the choice of language as they create efficient source code.

: Of course. Wish there were more people capable of doing it. Wish I had time to write a book about it. But doing it right takes time and effort; I'm not sure if anybody here has that kind of time to spend. --[[User:BenTels|BenTels]] 06:05, 25 Jan 2004 (PST)

I think the term '''Scripting''' has been abused.  Scripting languages are used to script behaviours in executables.  Lua and JavaScript are used exclusively for scripting, hence they would be '''Scripting Languages''', however Python and  Perl are only rarely used for embedding in other executables, so I wouldn't call them Scripting Languages.  '''Interpreted''' would be a better name.

: Lisp and perl are not interpreted, they are compiled just in time. CommonLisp runs as fast as C. The proper classification should include ''static'' and ''dynamic''; where dynamic languages pushes as much choices to run-time and static languages try to do everything in compile-time. 

: For ease of learning I would sugest dropping Basic (which will teach you very bad programming) and opt for PLT Scheme as a good place to start. A small compact language with a good book to learn if from.

Hi, I just stumbled above the wikibooks site. I think the programming book is, err.. a bit incomplete :-) I mean, it is only talking about coosing a programming language! What about
* Algorithms
** complexity
** sorting
** searching
* Data structures
* procedural programming
* structured programming
* object oriented programming
* functional programming
* how to design a program (bottom up, top down, ...)

I could contribute to any of these subjects from time to time. I think it is important to create a good structure of these topics first, and THEN start writing some content. Not important stuff should be left out, who cares about all the tiny bits of advantages/disadvantages one programming language has over another? Just choose one that allows a simple start, and get going. IMHO Ruby would be a very good choice. It's both extremely simple to learn and all of the above programming concepts are possible with it.

== We should switch to a Computer Science namespace. ==

Nobody gets a degree in computer programming; programming is just one aspect of computer science.  Theoretical courses like discrete math might never involve writing programs.  I suggest we use a computer science namespace for stuff like data structures and algorithms, and programming should be a category inside computer science that describes the nuances of various different languages.--[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 00:23, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: I think things are fine as they stand. It would be unfortunate to have Computer science:Programming:Some Language as the title for an article. There doesn't need to be any highly visible overlap - we can create new wikibooks under the Computer science namespace or whatever if need be. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:41, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Why not use the category system instead of namespaces? A book on algorithms could be part of the [[:Category:Computer science]] category. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mxn|[[User:Mxn|Minh Nguyễn]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mxn|talk]], [http://mxn.f2o.org/index.html blog])&lt;/small&gt;]] 16:17, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I agree with Minh Nguyễn. The category system is much more appropriate than a hierarchial namespace. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:36, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I don't think a &quot;computer science&quot; namespace is a good idea. Also, few or none of the other books (i.e. I couldn't find any) do that. Instead, they create a namespace for each book, and each chapter is at '''Bookname:Chapter name'''. I think this is a good idea. Categories are good too. The current '''Programming''' namespace is not good. --[[User:Yath|Yath]] 21:16, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Exercises and solutions ==

I have not seen a consistent handling of exercises and their solutions in Wikibooks so far (someone correct me if I've missed it). I think exercises can reasonably be embedded in a page with explanatory text, or collected on separate exercise pages. I prefer to do the former. I plan to have separate 'solutions' pages though, which will have the same name as the page with the exercises, and '-solutions' appended. See [[Programming:Python Creating Python programs]]. --[[User:Yath|Yath]] 21:52, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Setting the PATH in Windows ==

Several of these books have places (e.g. [[Programming:Python Getting Python]]) where a guide to setting the PATH in Windows would be helpful. I do not have a Windows system to experiment on. It would be great if someone could write this up. --[[User:Yath|Yath]] 01:04, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Too much stuff! ==

Ugh. This module has become rather unwieldy.  How do you think we should trim it? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:08, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Finding the gradient of a straight line is simple. For a line &lt;math&gt;y=mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, the gradient is ''m''. But how do you find the gradient of a curve at a particular point? Suppose we want to find the gradient of the tangent line to &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; at the point (3,9). Immediately, this question poses a problem. How are we supposed to find the gradient of a line when only one point can be known? We can use a sequence of chords:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!x !! y !! m
|-
|4 || 16 || 7
|-
|3.75 || 14.0625 || 6.75
|-
|3.5 || 12.25 || 6.5
|-
|3.25 || 10.5625 || 6.25
|-
|3.005 || 9.030025 || 6.01
|}

The gradient of the tangent line at (3, 9) is 6. As you can see, this method is rather tedious. Luckily for us we have the derivative, which can accurately and quickly determine any rate of change.

== Derivative ==
The derivative is the rate of change of a function. It is found using the gradient of a line formula when the distance between the first and second point approaches 0: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x\right)}{h} = f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;. A function is differentiable at the point '''a''' only if the limit exists at the point '''a'''. The notation for derivative is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}\ or\ f' \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;.

===Differentiation Rules===
# Derivative of a constant function: &lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left (c \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# The Power Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left (x^n \right) = nx^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
# The Constant Multiple Rule:&lt;p&gt; If c is a constant and f(x) is a differentiable function: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} c f \left ( x \right ) = c \frac{d}{dx} f \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;
# The Sum Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \begin{bmatrix} f \left ( x \right ) +  g \left ( x \right ) \end{bmatrix} = \frac{d}{dx} f \left ( x \right ) +  \frac{d}{dx} g \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;
# The Difference Rule:&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \begin{bmatrix} f \left ( x \right ) -  g \left ( x \right ) \end{bmatrix} = \frac{d}{dx} f \left ( x \right ) -  \frac{d}{dx} g \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;

==Gradient of a Line==
The derivative is used to find the gradient of a line at the point '''a'''. Then the point '''a''' is substituted into the derivative. The resultant will give us the gradient at the point '''a'''. The first derivative of a distance function is velocity and the second derivative is acceleration. &lt;p&gt;
The distance that a car has travelled is given by the function &lt;math&gt;s = 1.25t^2 -5&lt;/math&gt;t. Where s is the distance travelled in metres and t is the time elapsed. What is the velocity of the car when 12 seconds have elapsed?&lt;p&gt;
1) Using the power, the constant multiple rule and the difference derivative rules we get v = 2.5t - 5:&lt;p&gt;
2) Now we substitute the time into the function: v = 2.5x12 - 5, we get that v = 25 metres/second.&lt;p&gt;
So after 12 seconds the car will be travelling at 25 metres per second.

===Tangent Lines===
Since we can find the gradient of a function at any point we can also find the equation of the tangent line to the function at any point:&lt;p&gt;
What is the equation of the tangent line for the curve &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x -16&lt;/math&gt; at the point x = -4?&lt;p&gt;
First we need to find the derivative of the equation.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we find the gradient at the point x = -4.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\left ( -4 \right) + 3 = -5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using the original function we find the corresponding y value to the x value at the point of tangency.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = -4^2 + 3 \left (-4 \right) -16 = -12&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we use the point-gradient equation to find the equation.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y + 12 = -5 \left ( x + 4 \right )&lt;/math&gt; so the equation of the tangent line is y = -5x - 32....

===Normal Lines===
A Normal line is the line perpendicular to the Tangent Line. Therefore when we determine the equation of the normal line the procedure is very similar to when we determining the equation of the tangent line. Example:&lt;p&gt;
What is the equation of the normal line for the curve &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x -16&lt;/math&gt; at the point when x=-4?&lt;p&gt;
First we need to find the derivative of the equation.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we need to solve for the given x value.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\left ( -4 \right) + 3 = -5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we use the perpendicular line equation to find the gradient of the normal line.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m_1 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;-5 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt; so the gradient is &lt;math&gt;m_2=\frac{-1}{-5}&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Then we find the y value corresponding to x value&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = -4^2 + 3 \left (-4 \right) -16 = -12&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we use the point-gradient equation to find the equation.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y + 12 = .2 \left ( x + 4 \right )&lt;/math&gt; so the equation of the normal line is y = .2x - 11.2

==Higher Derivatives==
By C2, you will be expected to have a brief understanding of the applications of the second (and third, in some cases) derivative of a function. The second derivative is exactly what it sounds like, it is the derivative of a derivative. The third derivative is the derivative of the second derivative, and so on.The notation for the second derivative is, assuming we are talking in terms of y with respect to x: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; And subsequent derivatives simply have larger numbers in their indices.

==Application of Derivatives to Graphs==
Derivatives also help us to graph functions, by locating minimum, maximum, and inflection points. They can also determine the interval on which a function is convex or concave.&lt;p&gt;
'''Convex''' - The graph is below the tangent lines. Example &lt;math&gt;-x^2&lt;/math&gt;, think of a frown.&lt;p&gt;
'''Concave''' - The graph is above the tangent lines. Example &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, think of a smile.&lt;p&gt;
'''Inflection Point''' - The point when a function changes from convex to concave or vice versa. Example &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; at x = 0.&lt;p&gt;
'''Maximum Point''' - The highest point of a function on a convex interval.&lt;p&gt;
'''Minimum Point''' - The lowest point of a function on a concave interval.&lt;p&gt;
'''Stationary Point''' - A point where f'(c) = 0

===Rules of Stationary Points===
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) &lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local maximum point of f(x). The graph of f(x) will be convex on the interval.
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local minimum point of f(x). The graph of f(x) will be concave on the interval.
*If &lt;math&gt;f' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' \left ( c \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f''' \left ( c \right ) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then c is a local inflection point of f(x).

===Locating And Evaluating Stationary Points===
''The Function''&lt;p&gt;
The original function is used to determine when the function crosses the x and y axis's.&lt;p&gt;
''The First Derivative Test''&lt;p&gt;
The first derivative is used to find all the minimum, maximum or inflection points. At these points f'(x) = 0. Also if we make a sign chart we can see at which intervals the function is increasing and decreasing, but the second derivative is a better test of this.&lt;p&gt;
''The Second Derivative Test''&lt;p&gt;
The second derivative is used to find the points when a function is concave or when it is convex at these points &lt;nowiki&gt;f''(x)&lt;/nowiki&gt; = 0. Then you need to make a sign chart. The interval(s) that the sign of the second derivative is positive the function is concave and if the sign is negative the function is convex. When f'(a) is zero and on that interval &lt;nowiki&gt;f''(x)&lt;/nowiki&gt; is negative then the point ''a'' is a maximum point, before this point the function will be increasing afterwards the function will be decreasing. When f'(a) is zero and on that interval &lt;nowiki&gt;f''(x)&lt;/nowiki&gt; is positive then the point ''a'' is a minimum point, before this the function will be decreasing afterwards the function will be increasing.&lt;p&gt;
''The Third Derivative Test''&lt;p&gt;
The third derivative test determine if a point is an inflection point. This usually is not necessary If &lt;nowiki&gt;f''(c) = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'''(c) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; the f(c) is an inflection point.

====An Example====
Sketch the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 -4x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1) The function will tell us that:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2(x - 4)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = x^2(x - 4)&lt;/math&gt; x = 0 and x=4 are the x-intercepts. 
: &lt;math&gt;y = 0^2(0 - 4)&lt;/math&gt; y = 0 is the y-intercept. 
2) Then we use the first derivative test.&lt;p&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = x(3x - 8)&lt;/math&gt; x = 0 and x=2.66 are the minimum or maximum or inflection points.
3) Then we use the second derivative test.
: &lt;nowiki&gt;f''(x) = 6x - 8&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
: 0 = 6x -8  so x = &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.
: We now make a number line __f&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(0) = -8______ 1.333____f&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(2) =  4.
: Before 1.333 the function will be convex after 1.333 the function will be concave.
4) Then we use the third derivative test.&lt;p&gt;
: &lt;nowiki&gt;f'''(x) = 6&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f'''(\frac{4}{3}) = 6&lt;/math&gt; The point is an inflection point.
5) Now we gather all the information into a table. Also we need to find the corresponding y values to all the x values that we obtained from steps 1 to 3 using f(x).
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! Interval or Point !! f(x) behaviour
|-
| x &lt; 0 || Increasing
|-
| (0,0) || Maximum Point, x-intercept, and y-intercept
|-
| 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.33 || Decreasing
|-
| (1.33,-4.74) || Inflection Point 
|-
|1.33 &lt; x &lt; 2.66 || Decreasing
|-
| (2.66,-9.48) || Minimum Point
|-
|2.66 &lt; x &lt; &lt;math&gt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; || Increasing
|-
|(4,0) || x-intercept
|-
|}
6)Now we can draw our graph:&lt;p&gt;

*** Subset analysis. 331 patients with pretreatment tumor blocks, stained for p16. p16+ in 25% (oropharynx 37%, SGL 21%, others 10%)
*** Outcome: Nimorazole improved LRC overall (HR 0.7, SS). p16- improved LRC overall (HR 0.4, SS). If p16-, nimorazole improved LRC (HR 0.7, SS), but if p16+, nimorazole did not improved LRC (HR 0.9, NS)
*** Conclusion: Hypoxic modification improved outcome in HPV/p16 negative patients, but had no impact in HPV/p16 positive patients

== Effect of surgery to radiotherapy interval (SRI) ==
=== Higher dose may &quot;make up for&quot; prolonged treatment time ===
* MSKCC, 1990 - PMID 2325418 — &quot;Impact of the time interval between surgery and postoperative radiation therapy on locoregional control in advanced head and neck cancer.&quot; Schiff PB et al. J Surg Oncol. 1990 Apr;43(4):203-8.
** Patients receiving &lt; 60 Gy had locoregional recurrence rate of 7% when SRI &lt; 6 weeks vs 27% when greater than 6 weeks. However when doses &gt; 60 Gy were given, failure rates were 15% and 12%, respectively.

== Recursive Partitioning Analysis ==
* RTOG RPA, 1996 - PMID 8646692 — &quot;Recursive partitioning analysis of 2105 patients treated in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group studies of head and neck cancer.&quot; Cooper JS et al. Cancer. 1996 May 1;77(9):1905-11.
** 2105 pts. For survival, most predictive factor was T stage. For T1-T2, next most important was tumor location, whereas for T3-T4, it was KPS. For LRC, N stage was most important; for N0, T stage was next most important, whereas for N+ number of treatment fractions was. 
** Survival: '''Group 1)''' T2 or less, glottic, age &lt; 75; '''2)''' Group 1 but age &gt;= 75; '''3)''' T2 or less, not glottic, N0-2, KPS &gt;= 80, age &lt; 75; ''or'' T3-4 N0-2 site:NP,OP,SGL,sinus KPS 90-100; '''4)''' T2 or less, not glottic, N3, KPS &gt;=80; ''or'' T3-4, N0-2, KPS 90-100, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or glottis; ''or'' T3-4 N3 or Nx KPS &lt; 90; '''5)''' T2 or less, not glottic, KPS &lt;80; ''or'' N3, T3-4, KPS 90-100, N3; ''or'' T3-4, N1-3, KPS &lt; 90.
** Local control: 

* PMID 11443750 - &quot;Validation of the RTOG recursive partitioning classification for head and neck tumors.&quot; Cooper et al. - Tested validity using a separate database from RTOG 85-27.

* PMID 15672358, 2005 - &quot;Comparison of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning classification and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer TNM classification for patients with head and neck carcinoma.&quot; 
** 2166 pts classified both by RPA and TNM stage and compared overall survival and loco-regional DFS. No differences between the systems in terms of survival, but for locoregional control, RPA system depended on treatment and was not generalizable.


== Surgery + RT vs. Chemo-RT ==
* '''Singapore''' (1996-2000)
** Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 199 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, oropharynx 21%, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo
** '''2005''' PMID 16012523 -- &quot;Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III/IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison.&quot; (Soo KC, Br J Cancer. 2005 Aug 8;93(3):279-86.) Median F/U 6 years
*** Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, oropharynx 55%, oral cavity 21%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors (possibly due to larger proportion of T4 and oral cavity cancers)
*** Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx. Poor organ preservation (and salvage) in oral cavity

== Reviews ==
* PMID 3278390, 1988 - &quot;Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies in head and neck cancer.&quot;


== Prediction of Response ==
* '''MSKCC, 2007''' PMID 17416856 -- &quot;Identification of angiogenesis/metastases genes predicting chemoradiotherapy response in patients with laryngopharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Ganly I, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10;25(11):1369-76.)
** Gene arrays. Correlation of 277 genes (angiogenesis and/or mets) to locoregional control
** MDM2 and erbB2 are predictors of locoregional failure in patients treated with chemo-RT


== Patterns of failure ==
* M.D.Anderson, Hong, 1985 - PMID 4027864 — &quot;Patterns of relapse in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients who achieved complete remission after combined modality therapy.&quot; Hong WK et al. Cancer. 1985 Sep 15;56(6):1242-5.
** 103 pts treated with induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and/or RT. 71 pts were free of disease. 5-year recurrence rate was 51% (39% local and 26% distant failure). Relapse patterns were affected by: site (oral cavity more likely to fail locally, hypopharnx more likely to have DM); type of treatment (surgery + RT had lower local failure); TN stage (T3-4N3 had higher risk of local and distant failure); oropharynx (higher local + distant failure). 


== Planned Neck Dissection ==
* General consensus suggests that adjuvant neck dissection is not necessary for patients with N1 neck and CR after chemo-RT
* Historically, ipsilateral neck recurrence was lower for N2/N3 disease after primary RT + adjuvant neck dissection than either modality alone
* The necessity of adjuvant neck dissection after chemo-RT is controversial
** ~25% of patients with clinical/radiographic CR who undergo neck dissection have residual disease
** 30-40% of patients with clinical/radiographic detectable disease who undergo neck dissection have no residual disease
** Thus, overall accuracy of neck response by clinical/radiographic evaluation is ~60%
** PET shows promise, and appears more accurate than clinical, CT, or MRI neck evaluation
** It may be reasonable to observe patients with clinical/radiographic CR, and negative PET 12 weeks after completing chemo-RT
** It is not clear what negative PET means in setting of clinical/radiographic detectable disease
* TROG 98.02 subset analysis suggests that after chemo-RT, ipsilateral failure is low in patients with clinical/radiographic CR


* '''RTOG 98.02'''
** Subset analysis. TROG 98.02 is Phase II randomized trial of RT 70/35 with Arm 1) concurrent cisplatin/tirapazamine vs. Arm 2) concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. Subset patients with initial N2-3 disease, who achieved complete clinical/radiological CR at 12 weeks (N2 63%, N3 40%) and no planned neck dissection was performed
** '''2008''' PMID 18286488 -- &quot;N2-N3 neck nodal control without planned neck dissection for clinical/radiologic complete responders-Results of Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group Study 98.02.&quot; (Corry J, Head Neck. 2008 Feb 19 [Epub ahead of print]). Median F/U 4.3 years
*** Outcome: First failure: local 4%, locoregional 2%, distant 28%, locoregional + distant 6%. No patients with neck-only failure
*** Conclusion: Patients with CR do not need planned neck disection

== Radiation Injury ==
Please see [[Radiation Oncology/Toxicity/Head &amp; Neck]]


== Other histologic types ==
'''''Sarcomatoid carcinoma''''' - also called spindle cell carcinoma
* '''MDACC; 1998''' PMID 9591559 -- &quot;Radiation therapy for early stage (T1-T2) sarcomatoid carcinoma of true vocal cords: outcomes and patterns of failure.&quot; (Ballo MT, Laryngoscope. 1998 May;108(5):760-3.)
** 5-yr LC 94% for T1 and 54% for T2. 10-year DSS 92%, OS 63%
** Conclusion: similar control rates to typical squamous cell carcinoma. The histologic diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma by itself should not influence the decision to treat a patient with early stage glottic disease with irradiation.

This page discusses how the time from surgery, overall treatment time, and time to deliver a fraction have an impact on the success of treatment.  
:''See also:'' the appropriate Radiobiology concepts.

The concept of '''surgery to radiotherapy interval''' ('''SRI'''):
*effect of boost dose
*sequencing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (in particular for breast cancer)
*[[Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/General|Radiation Oncology:H&amp;N]] - see discussion for head and neck tumors
*[[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Breast overview|Radiation Oncology:Breast overview]] - see discussion for breast cancer

The concept of '''overall treatment time''':
*cervical cancer


==Head &amp; Neck==
*'''Aarhus, 2007''' (Denmark) PMID 17493700 -- &quot;Tumor progression in waiting time for radiotherapy in head and neck cancer.&quot; (Jensen AR, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Jul;84(1):5-10.)
**Retrospective. 61 patients with SCCHN, with diagnostic and treatment-planning CT scan. Median interval between scans 28 days (5-95)
**Outcome: 62% patients measurable increase in tumor volume; median increase 46% (6-495%). 20% new LN mets, 16% progression in T-stage
**Doubling time: median 99 days, but median for faster half was 30 days. 
**Conclusion: Negative impact of waiting time; majority showed progression within 4 week waiting time
**Editorial PMID 17574695 -- &quot;Killing time: The consequences of delays in radiotherapy.&quot; (Mackillop WJ, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Jul;84(1):1-4.)

**LQ modelling for various schedules, calculated tumor log cell kill, with acute and late complications
**Conclusion: Schedules of 4-6 weeks give 11 log10 cell kill; most require two fractions/day

*'''Ontario, 1996''' PMID 12118558 -- &quot;The effect of delay in treatment on local control by radiotherapy.&quot; (Mackillop WJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jan 1;34(1):243-50.)
**Monte Carlo simulation, applied to tonsillar CA
**Outcome: at some point for every patient, probability of local control decreases sharply over a relatively short time period. LC rate decreases by ~10% per month for tonsillar CA
**Conclusion: Waiting times for RT should be As Short As Reasonably Achievable (ASARA)

==NSCLC==
*'''Netherlands; 2003''' PMID 14676792 -- &quot;Accelerated regrowth of non-small-cell lung tumours after induction chemotherapy.&quot; (El Sharouni SY, Br J Cancer. 2003 Dec 15;89(12):2184-9.)
**Retrospective. 23 patients with NSCLC. Interval times between end of induction of start of RT evaluated. Mean time to RT 80 days
**Outcome: 41% potentially curable patients became incurable; tumor median doubling 29 days (8.3-171 days)
**Conclusion: Accelerated tumor cell proliferation, much shorter doubling time than for untreated tumors. Gain from chemo (tumor decrease) was lost with waiting for RT</text>

This chapter deals with general concepts of breast cancer treatment, not related to more specific chapters dealing with treatment of different presentations of breast cancer.


==Epidemiology==
*'''2007 American Cancer Society''' PMID 17237035 -- &quot;Cancer statistics, 2007.&quot; (Jemal A, CA Cancer J Clin. 2007 Jan-Feb;57(1):43-66.)
**Incidence: 178,500 (#1 for women, accounting for ~25%)
**Prevalence: 2,385,000 (#1 for all) - based on NHIS 2003 data
**Deaths: 40,500 (#2 for women, accounting for ~15%)
*'''2002 [http://www-dep.iarc.fr/ IARC] Worldwide data'''
**Incidence: 1,151,000 (#1 for women, accounting for ~23%)
**Deaths: 411,000 (#1, accounting for ~14%)


==Risk factors==
**&lt;u&gt;Gender&lt;/u&gt;: 100x more frequent in women
**&lt;u&gt;Age&lt;/u&gt;: Incidence rises steeply until ~50 (menopause), then more slowly 50-75, then essentially flat 75+
**&lt;u&gt;Ethnicity&lt;/u&gt;: In US, incidence highest in Caucasians (141/100,000), then African-Americans (119/100,000), Asian Americans (97/100,000), Hispanics (901/100,000), American Indians (55/100,000)
**&lt;u&gt;Breast density&lt;/u&gt;: by mammogram
**&lt;u&gt;[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Benign|Benign Breast Disease]]&lt;/u&gt;: Proliferative with atypia RR 4, proliferative without atypia RR 2, nonproliferative no increase
**&lt;u&gt;Personal h/o BCA&lt;/u&gt;: invasive contralateral risk 1%/year premenopausal, 0.5%/year postmenopausal
**&lt;u&gt;Family history&lt;/u&gt;: age-dependent
**&lt;u&gt;Genetic mutations&lt;/u&gt;: [http://www.geneclinics.org/servlet/access?db=geneclinics&amp;site=gt&amp;id=8888892&amp;key=BJaBikTCUeOkI&amp;gry=&amp;fcn=y&amp;fw=BDjc&amp;filename=/profiles/brca1/index.html BRCA1/BRCA2], p53 ([[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Li-Fraumeni_Syndrome|Li-Fraumeni Syndrome]]), ATM ([[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Ataxia-Telangiectasia|Ataxia-Telangiectasia]]), PTEN ([[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#PTEN_Hamartoma_Tumor_Syndrome_.28PHTS.29|PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome]])
**&lt;u&gt;Hormone exposure&lt;/u&gt;: Age at menarchy, age at menopause, parity, age at first birth, hormone replacement therapy; breastfeeding protective
**&lt;u&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;: see Harvard Nurses study below 
**&lt;u&gt;Diet&lt;/u&gt;: see Harvard Nurses study below
**&lt;u&gt;Exposure to RT&lt;/u&gt;: Highest risk pre-pubertal, no excess risk after 45


*'''Risk factors for men'''
**&lt;u&gt;Klinefelter's syndrome&lt;/u&gt;, 
**&lt;u&gt;Family history&lt;/u&gt;
**&lt;u&gt;Genetic mutations&lt;/u&gt;: BRCA2
**&lt;u&gt;Testicular or liver disease&lt;/u&gt;


*Patient age and relation to tumor features - PMID 8164038


*''''''Harvard Nurses'''' Health Study''' NHS I (1976 - 1996), NHS II (1989 - )
**2005 (Review): PMID 15864280 &amp;mdash; &quot;The Nurses' Health Study: lifestyle and health among women.&quot;
**121,700 women. Designed to test oral contraceptive use on breast cancer. Questionnaire every 2 years.
**Increased risk:
***'''High/moderate alcohol use is associated with the highest increase in risk. Also increases colon cancer risk.'''
***Hormone replacement has an increased risk of 1.2 with estrogen only or 1.7 for estrogen + progestin. Increased risk with high hormonal levels of estrogen, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in pre-menopausal women, and prolactin levels in post-menopausal women. 
***'''Body-mass index associated with increased risk''' (but less of a risk factor when increased estrogen levels are factored out).
***Dense breasts&gt; (assessed by mammography) have higher risk. 
**Past OC use had no increase in risk. Modest increase in risk for current OC users (but very low incidence in this age group). OC use protective against ovarian cancer (persists for many years) and colon cancer. 
**Decreased risk (protective):
***Folate in diet and higher intake of vegetable fat. '''No associate with fat intake, meat or fish comsumption.''' 
***'''Physical activity results in 20% decrease in risk for 7 or more hours/week vs 1 hour or less/week.'''

===Predictive Models===
*'''Tyrer-Cuzick Model''' (Cancer.org.uk, 2004) PMID 15057881 -- &quot;A breast cancer prediction model incorporating familial and personal risk factors.&quot; (Tyrer J, Stat Med. 2004 Apr 15;23(7):1111-30.)
**Model incorporating BRCA genes, a low penetrance gene, and personal risk factors

*'''BRCAPRO Model''' (Duke, 1998) PMID 9443863 -- &quot;Determining carrier probabilities for breast cancer-susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.&quot; (Parmigiani G, Am J Hum Genet. 1998 Jan;62(1):145-58.)
**Model for evaluating a probablity that a woman is a BRCA1/BRCA2 carrier
**Variables: FH of breast and ovarian CA in 1st and 2nd degree relatives. Relationships, ages of onset, and ages of no disease important

*'''Claus Model''' (Yale, 1994) PMID 8299086 -- &quot;Autosomal dominant inheritance of early-onset breast cancer. Implications for risk prediction.&quot; (Claus EB, Cancer. 1994 Feb 1;73(3):643-51.)
**Tables for age-specific risk of BCA in women with FH of BCA

*'''Gail Model''' (1989) - PMID 2593165 [http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/jnci;81/24/1879 Full text (PDF)] &amp;mdash; &quot;Projecting individualized probabilities of developing breast cancer for white females who are being examined annually.&quot; Gail MH et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1989 Dec 20;81(24):1879-86.
**Risk factors: age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of previous biopsies, and number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer

===Obesity===
*'''Danish DBCG; 2010''' (1977-2006) PMID 21115856 -- &quot;Effect of obesity on prognosis after early-stage breast cancer.&quot; (Ewertz M, J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jan 1;29(1):25-31. Epub 2010 Nov 29.)
**Registry study. 18,967 women, early stage BCA, BMI available, complete follow-up to 10 years
**Outcome: 10-year DM risk increased by 46% if BM &gt;30 kg/m2, risk of death increased by 38%. No impact on loco-regional recurrences
**Conclusion: Obesity independent prognostic factor for development of distant mets and breast cancer death. Effect of adjuvant therapy less in obese patients

==Screening==
*'''ACR Appropriateness Guidelines; 2012''' [http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/Diagnostic/BreastCancerScreening.pdf Full Report]
**Annual Screening Mammography Recommended starting at 1) Age 40 for general population; 2) age 25-30 for BRCA carriers and untested relatives; 3) Age 25-30 or 10 years earlier than the age of the affected relative at diagnosis for person with first degree relative with pre-menopausal breast cancer or for women with lifetime risk &gt; 20%; 4) 8 years after radiation therapy but not before age 25 for women who received mantle radiation between ages 10-30; 5) Any women with biopsy proven lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, DCIS, or invasive breast cancer.


*'''US Preventive Services Task Force; 2009''' [http://www.annals.org/content/151/10/716.full Full Report]
**Age 40-49: No routine screening mammography; decision to start screening should be individual one
**Age 50-74: Biennial screening mammography
**Age &gt;=75: Insufficient evidence for mammography
**Insufficient evidence for digital mammography or breast MRI over film mammography
**Evidence for additional benefit/harm of clinical examination (in addition to mammography) is insufficient
**Recommend against teaching breast self-examination

===Mammography===
*'''UC Davis, 2007''' (1998-2002) PMID 17409321 -- &quot;Influence of computer-aided detection on performance of screening mammography.&quot; (Fenton JJ, N Engl J Med. 2007 Apr 5;356(14):1399-409.)
**Retrospective. Screening data from 43 facilities and 429,345 mammograms. 
**Implementation of computer-aided detection: specificity decreased 90% to 87% (SS), sensitivity remained unchanged, PPV decreased 4.1% to 3.2% (SS), rate of biopsy increased 20% (SS). No difference in cancer detection rate (4 per 1000 screening mammograms)
**Conclusion: Computer-aided detection resulted in reduced accuracy. Increased rate of biopsy was not associated with improved detection 

*'''Toronto, 2007''' PMID 17229950 -- &quot;Mammographic density and the risk and detection of breast cancer.&quot; (Boyd NF, N Engl J Med. 2007 Jan 18;356(3):227-36.)
**Case-control. 1112 pairs. Evaluated % density and risk of BCA
**Risk of BCA: low density (&lt;10%) vs. high density (&gt;75%) OR 4.7 (SS), persisted &gt;8 years after study entry
**In younger women (&lt;56): 26% of BCA and 50% of CA detected &lt;1 year after negative screen were in density &gt;50%
**Conclusion: extensive mammographic density associated with risk of BCA

===MRI===
'''''American Cancer Society Guidelines'''''
*'''2007''' PMID 17392385 -- &quot;American cancer society guidelines for breast screening with MRI as an adjunct to mammography.&quot; (Saslow D, CA Cancer J Clin. 2007 Mar-Apr;57(2):75-89.)
**Annual Screening (Based on Evidence): BRCA mutatation, 1st degree relative of BRCA carrier, lifetime risk &gt;=20% by models
**Annual Screening (Based on Expert Opinion): Chest RT age 10-30, [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Li-Fraumeni_Syndrome|Li-Fraumeni syndrome]] and 1st BCA degree relatives, [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Cowden.27s_syndrome|Cowden's syndrome]] and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes and 1st degree BCA relatives
**Insufficient Evidence: lifetime risk 15-20%, LCIS/ALH, ADH, dense breasts on mammography, personal history of BCA
**No MRI Screening: &lt;15% lifetime risk  


'''''Of the contralateral breast in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer:'''''
*'''ACRIN 6667''' (2003-4)
**969 women. Diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer. Negative mammogram and clinical exam of contralateral breast. Considered positive for cancer if histologic evidence of malignancy within 1 yr of exam. 
***MRI detected occult malignancy of the contralateral breast in 3.1% (30/969). Sensitivity 91%, Spec 88%, NPV 99%. Biopsy for positive MRI finding in 12.5% (121/969); 24% of these were positive (30/121); 18 of 30 were invasive. Mean size of invasive tumors 10.9 mm. 
**Conclusion: MRI can detect cancers missed by mammography. 
**PMID 17392300, 2007 &amp;mdash; &quot;MRI Evaluation of the Contralateral Breast in Women with Recently Diagnosed Breast Cancer.&quot; Lehman CD et al. New Engl J Med. 2007 Mar 29;356(13):1295-1303.

==Pathology==
*Non-invasive
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/LCIS | Lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS)]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/DCIS | Ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS)]]
*Invasive (infiltrating)
**Ductal carcinoma
**Lobular carcinoma
**Others below


===Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma===
*About 10% of invasive carcinomas. Bilateral in 6-28%. 
*Higher frequency of skeletal, visceral, serosal and retroperitoneal mets. 
*Early prognosis significantly better than IDC, but late prognosis significantly worse than IDC


*'''International BCSG trials; 2008''' (1978-2002) PMID 18458044 -- &quot;Distinct clinical and prognostic features of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast: combined results of 15 International Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trials.&quot; (Pestalozzi BC, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 20;26(18):3006-14. Epub 2008 May 5.)
**Retrospective. 12,206 patients on 15 trials. Categorized as ILC (6%), IDC (71%), or other/mixed (23%). Median F/U 13 years
**ILC patient characteristics: older age, larger tumors, better differentiated, ER+, less LVI+. Mastectomy used more frequently (SS)
**ILC outcome: significantly better early DFS/OS advantage, but significantly worse late (6 and 10 years) DFS/OS. Similar outcome when stratified by ER status
**Conclusion: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma carries distinct prognostic and biologic implications

===Special histologic types===
Need to have &gt; 90% predominant pattern.

Most have better prognosis (80-90% 10-year survival)

'''''Tubular:'''''
*Tubular carcinoma - 1.3% of all breast cancer cases. Older median age (67), 74% detected by mammography, remainder with palpable mass, 92% Estrogen receptor positive; bilateral presentation in 8%; indolent natural history with rare distant metastases
**PMID 11899414 -- &quot;Tubular breast cancer experience at Washington University: a review of the literature.&quot; (Holland DW, Clin Breast Cancer. 2001 Oct;2(3):210-4).
**''Need for RT:''
***'''2012: SEER''' PMID 22543207 -- &quot;Adjuvant Radiation Therapy and Survival for Pure Tubular Breast Carcinoma-Experience From the SEER Database.&quot; (Li BInt J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Sep 1;84(1):23-9.)
****Conclusion: &quot;Since sufficiently powered large scale clinical trials are unlikely, we would recommend that adjuvant radiation be considered in PTCB patients age 65 or younger, although consideration of the small absolute survival benefit is important. Adjuvant radiation can be omitted for patients older than 65.&quot;
***'''MGH; 2005''' (1980-2002) PMID 16142444 -- &quot;Tubular carcinoma of the breast: a retrospective analysis and review of the literature.&quot; (Sullivan T, Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2005 Oct;93(3):199-205.)
****Retrospective. 13 women treated without RT, none recurred.
***'''2005''' (1972-2001) PMID 15730459 -- &quot;Excision only for tubular carcinoma of the breast.&quot; (Leonard CE, Breast J. 2005 Mar-Apr;11(2):129-33.)
****44 pts. Median f/u 5.4 yr. 2 local recurrences, crude LC 96% (2/44). 
***'''2003''' (1987-1999) PMID 12846864 -- &quot;Tubular carcinoma of the breast: an institutional experience and review of the literature.&quot; (Cabral AH, Breast J. 2003 Jul-Aug;9(4):298-301.)
****Retrospective. 44 pts. 20 pts treated with breast conservation without RT: local recurrence in 1 of 20. Pts with RT: LR in 0 of 13. Second breast cancers developed in 16% of cases. 


*Mucinous carcinoma (colloid) - excellent prognosis. 1-6%. usually ER+.
*Cribriform carcinoma - excellent prognosis. usually ER/PR+. 
*Invasive papillary carcinoma


Similar prognosis (as IDC)
*Secretory carcinoma
*Metaplastic carcinoma
*Medullary carcinoma - traditionally felt to have excellent prognosis, despite being high grade. 5-7%. Most are triple negative. &lt;U&gt;However&lt;/u&gt;, per NCCN guidelines (v.2.2010), medullary carcinomas have a risk for distant metastases similar to other high grade carcinomas, and thus should be treated similarly to other triple negative invasive breast cancers, rather than be treated per guidelines for favorable histology.



Worse prognosis
*Micropapillary carcinoma (PMID 16196516)
**Predominant or focal papillary clusters, devoid of fibrovascular core with empty lacunar spaces
**On histology frequently with high proliferation index, p53+ and ER-; however, no basal-like staining pattern
**Frequent LVI+, nodal mets and poor prognosis
**Also present in lung, ovary, bladder, and salivary gland. If metastatic deposit, should evaluate those organs as primary site


'''Intracystic papillary carcinoma'''
*'''Review, 2013:''' (Bahrain) PMID 23304242 -- &quot;Intracystic papillary breast cancer: a clinical update.&quot; (Reefy SA, Ecancermedicalscience. 2013;7:286)


'''Solid papillary carcinoma'''
*'''Review, 2012:''' (U.Florida) PMID 23020734 -- &quot;Solid papillary carcinoma of the breast: a pathologically and clinically distinct breast tumor.&quot; (Saremian J, Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2012 Oct;136(10):1308-11.)

'''''Reviews:'''''
*'''2012''' PMID 22826373 -- &quot;Management of unusual histological types of breast cancer.&quot; (Cadoo KA, Oncologist. 2012;17(9):1135-45.)
**Includes: adenoid cystic carcinoma, apocrine carcinoma, cribriform, metaplastic, squamous cell carcinoma (subtype of metaplastic), papillary cancer, and secretory breast cancer.
**Does not discuss radiotherapy management.

===Tissue microarray (TMA) profiling===
''References'': see PMID 15328174 (Nielsen TO 2004), PMID 10963602 (Perou 2000), PMID 11553815 [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/19/10869 Full text] (Sorlie T 2001), PMID 12829800 [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/14/8418 Full text] (Sorlie T 2003), PMID 12429812 (Korsching E 2002), PMID 14519755 (Foulkes 2003) 

5 groups by tissue microarray:
&lt;br&gt;Typical IHC pattern listed)
*Luminal A - high ER expression, her 2 neu negative, low Ki-67
*Luminal B - high ER expression AND often her 2 neu positive, Ki-67 and grade higher than luminal A
*HER2 overexpressing - ER/PR negative, her 2 neu positive and Ki-67 high
*Normal breast-like
*Basal type (&quot;triple-negative&quot;) - expression of CK 5/6 or 17 but low expression of luminal CK 8/18. Since staining by IHC may be insensitive, can identify these by having CK5/6 and/or HER1 but negative for ER and HER2.  Are often high grade, high frequency of BRCA1 mutation, often EGFR positive
**Heterogenous group, both molecular and clinical (including adenoid cystic, medullary, etc)

luminal keratins (simple epithelial) - cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, and 19
&lt;br&gt;basal epithelial cells (stratified epithelial cytokeratins) - 5, 6, 14, 15, and 17

Prognosis is worst for HER2 overexpressing and the basal type, best for Luminal A, and intermediate for Luminal B.

clinical stratifications of each:
*Luminal A: most common, low grade, responsive to anti-hormonals, not that responsive to chemo
*Luminal B: Variable grade, variable chemo response, usually anti-hormonal responsive
*Her-2-Neu: usually high grade, lymph nodes positive at presentation, chemotherapy responsive, often trastuzamab and lapatinib responsive
*Basal: high grade, premenopausal african american women, BRCA 1 associated, chemo responsive

===Cancer stem cells===
*Growing evidence suggests only small subclass of cancer cell within a given tumor are actually tumorigenic. In breast cancer, these cells carry CD44+/CD24- phenotype
*These cells are self-renewing, and persist in small numbers through passaging
*A gene signature differentiating these cells from normal breast epithelium is able to select patients with poor overall survival and poor mets-free survival. It probably does this by identifying tumors that have a high proportion of cancer cells with invasive phenotype


*'''Marseille, 2007''' PMID 17476019 -- &quot;A gene signature in breast cancer.&quot; (Bertucci F, N Engl J Med. 2007 May 3;356(18):1887-8; author reply 1887-8.)
**Comment on PMID 17229949. Use of IGS profile on basal and luminal samples
**89% of genes overexpressed in cancer stem cells also overexpressed in basal samples
**Conclusion: Basal-cell BCA enriched in tumorigenic BCA cells or have similar tumorigenic capability, which partially explains poor prognosis of basal cell BCA

*'''Michigan, 2007''' PMID 17229949 -- &quot;The prognostic role of a gene signature from tumorigenic breast-cancer cells.&quot; (Liu R, N Engl J Med. 2007 Jan 18;356(3):217-26.)
**Comparison of gene expression profile in tumorigenic (&quot;cancer stem cells&quot;) CD44+/CD24- cells and normal breast epithelium. 186 gene signtaure generated (IGS = invasiveness gene signature). 
**10-year outcome stratification: OS 98% vs. 62%, and mets-free survival (82% vs. 54%)
**Also associated with prognosis in medulloblastoma, lung CA, and prostate CA

*'''Michigan, 2003''' PMID 12629218 -- &quot;Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.&quot; (Al-Hajj M, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Apr 1;100(7):3983-8.)
**BCA model: human breast cancer cells grown in immunocompromised mice.
**Only minority of cells had ability to form new tumors: CD44+/CD24-
**As few as 100 cells could for tumors in mice, while &gt;10,000 cells of other phenotypes couldn't form tumors
**Self renewing; persist through passaging

===Extensive in-situ component (EIC)===
*Invasive tumor in which &gt; 25% is DCIS, &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; DCIS extends beyond edges of tumor.
*Initially seen to have higher rate of LR in pts treated with breast conservation, because role of surgical margin was not clear
*Some institutions could not demonstrate EIC impact on LR, partly due to variability in amount of tissue removed during surgery (thus making SM- more likely)
*Ultimately it was demonstrated that if SM-, EIC status is irrelevant. Thus, EIC serves as a marker for high DCIS burden in the breast and higher rate of local failure, but if margins can be cleared, breast conservation + RT is reasonable


*'''Harvard''' 
**'''1994''' (1982-1985) PMID 8082077 -- &quot;The relationship between microscopic margins of resection and the risk of local recurrence in patients with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy.&quot; (Schnitt SJ, Cancer. 1994 Sep 15;74(6):1746-51.)
***Retrospective. 181 patients with Stage I-II invasive BCA, treated with surgery + RT &gt;=60 Gy. Median F/U 7.2 years
***Recurrence rate EIC-: no difference if SM+ vs. SM- (&lt;10%)
***Recurrence rate EIC+: if SM+ 50% vs. SM- 0%
***Conclusion: BCS reasonable option for EIC+ if SM-; LR very high if EIC+ and SM+

***Retrospective. 783 patients treated with gross excision (margins not routinely assessed) + RT &gt;=60 Gy
***5-year recurrence: EIC+ 24% vs. EIC- 6% (SS)

==Natural History==
===Tumor Size===
*'''New Mexico, 2005''' (1988-1997) PMID 15650642 -- &quot;Modeling the effect of tumor size in early breast cancer.&quot; (Verschraegen, Ann Surg. 2005 Feb;241(2):309-18.)
**Modeling. SEER data from 83,686 women with T1-2, ALND done (58,070 N0 and 25,616 N+), no mets
**Tumor size independent predictor of survival, regardless of LN status. 
***Death rate for N0 patients: 0.3cm 10% vs. 5cm 25%
***Death rate for N+ patients: 0.3cm 20% vs. 5cm 40%
**Conclusion: Both tumor size and lymph node status independently predict for mortality, and probably represent different processes (growth velocity vs. metastatic potential)


===Doubling Time===
*BRCA carriers 45 days, high risk women 84 days
*&lt;50 y/o 80 days, 50-70 y/o 157 days, &gt;70 y/o 188 days


*'''Erasmus Univ''', 2005 (Netherlands) PMID 15978801 -- &quot;Hereditary breast cancer growth rates and its impact on screening policy.&quot; (Tilanus-Linthorst MM, Eur J Cancer. 2005 Jul;41(11):1610-7.)
**80 BRCA1/2 carriers and women at high risk for familial BCA; tumor doubling time (DT) estimated
**Mean DT (BRCA/high risk): carriers 45 days, non-carriers 84 days (SS) 
**Only age correlated with DT: mean DT slowed to 50% in each successive decade-older group (75d premenopausal vs. 153d postmenopausal)
**Conclusion: consider bi-annual screening for high risk women &lt;40 years old

**Newly diagnosed T1-T2 BCA have ~30% chance of axillary LN mets (function of age, size, grade)
**Axillary clinical exam unreliable
***If clinically negative axilla -&gt; ~30% positive on dissection
***If clinically positive axilla -&gt; ~25% negative on dissection

**Population-based study 1984-1997, 7680 patients with invasive BCA, 6663 axillary dissection
**34% positive LN
**Predictors: type, size, location, number of nodes examined


*&lt;u&gt;IM nodes&lt;/u&gt;
**By SLN mapping: &lt;1% localized to IM in NSABP B-32, 14% in Spanish study
**If SLN localized to IM or dissection with medial tumors: ~10% LN+
**Thus, overall &lt;1% positive (10% of 1-14%)
**Possibly outdated info (because of mammography) from surgical series in 1960-80's

**Prospective. 225 patients with SLN mapping for early BCA
**IM nodes: 31/225 (14%) SLN drainage to IM. No biopsy attempted by design in 11 cases. Biopsy performed successfully in 14/20 cases (69%). LN+ in 2/14 (14%). Overall LN+ 2/116 (1.7%)
**RT to IM not recommended unless pathologically proven

**Retrospective. 182 patients biopsied after SLN or because medial tumor
**IMN+ in 9%; of these axilla LN- in 4/14 and LN+ in 10/14
**Conclusion: IMN technically easy, and 10% results in upstaging with modified RT and chemo treatments

**Retrospective. Early BCA. Grouped by low risk/high risk, and systemic chemo/no chemo
**High risk, adjuvant chemo patients: medial location associated with 50% excess risk of systemic relapse (33% vs. 26%, SS) and BCA-death (25% vs. 20%, SS), compared to lateral location
**Low risk, or high risk with no adjuvant chemo: no difference
**Conclusion: 2X risk of relapse and BCA-death possibly due to occult spread to IM nodes

===Bone Marrow Mets===
*While conceptually interesting, in the US it is felt that it may not add addition value in current management with aggressive chemotherapy. Also, QA of testing was extremely difficult

===Distant Mets===
*'''Milan; 2007''' PMID 17952122 -- &quot;Breast cancer metastases are molecularly distinct from their primary tumors.&quot; (Vecchi M, Oncogene. 2007 Oct 22; [Epub ahead of print])
**26 matched primary breast tumors and LN mets to identify 270 discriminating probesets. Further independent 81 breast tumors and 32 distant mets to refine 126 probeset. Verified on independent 57 primary tumors and matched LN mets. 1/3 of differentially expressed genes were from epithelial component. Two of these modified cell motility in vitro
**Conclusion: Breast CA mets are molecularly distinct from their primary tumors

***If no local recurrence (LR), monthly mets rate decreases continuously
***If local recurrence, excess mets seeded after initial treatment (from residual disease)
***Each year, a small proportion of grade 1 residual disease progresses to grade 2, and significantly increases chance of distant mets

***Retrospective. 2648 patients treated 1954-1972 without chemotherapy
***Proportion of patients with distant mets increases with tumor size. This suggests &quot;threshold volume&quot; (median 3.5cm, log-normal distribution) for each tumor, when first remote met is initiated (ie BCA not immediately metastatic, and local cure is possible)
***Threshold volume correlated with grade and number of +LN

*'''Netherlands; 2014''' (1980-2011) PMID 24947112 -- &quot;Improved overall survival after contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with a history of unilateral breast cancer: A prospective analysis.&quot; (A M Heemskerk-Gerritsen B, Int J Cancer. 2014 Jun 20. --  [Epub ahead of print])
**583 pts with BRCA-associated breast cancer. 42% (242 pts) treated with contralat mastectomy; 341 without.
**Median f/u 11.4 yr. Lower incidence of contralat breast cancer (2% vs 19%: mastect vs control). Lower mortality (HR 0.49)
**Conclusion: &quot;We conclude that CRRM is associated with improved overall survival in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with a history of PBC.&quot;

*'''U. Toronto; 2014''' PMID 24519767 -- &quot;Contralateral mastectomy and survival after breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: retrospective analysis.&quot; (Metcalfe K, BMJ. 2014 Feb 11;348:g226.)
**Retrospective. 390 women with Stage I-II BRCA-associated breast cancer, treated with mastectomy. Compared outcomes of those who had mastectomy of the contralateral breast (181 pts) vs those who did not (209 pts).
**Median f/u 14.3 yr. 20-yr survival 88% (contralat mastectomy) vs 66% (without). Ccontralat mastectomy was associated with a 48% reduction in death from breast cancer
**Conclusion: &quot;This study suggests that women who are positive for BRCA mutations and who are treated for stage I or II breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy are less likely to die from breast cancer than women who are treated with unilateral mastectomy. Given the small number of events in this cohort, further research is required to confirm these findings.&quot;

**Prospective screening study. 2,157 women, &gt;15% cumulative lifetime risk of BCA (CLTR). Group 1: BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers, Group 2: high CLTR (30-50%), Group 3: moderate CLTR (15-30%). Biannual clinical breast exam, annual MRI and mammography screening. Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: MRI sensitivity better than mammography for invasive cancer, no difference for DCIS. BRCA1 results worse than BRCA2 results. 6-year OS Group 1 84%, Group 2 93% and Group 3 100%
**Conclusion: Screening results worse in BRCA1 mutation carriers, but 6-year OS high in all groups

**15-yr local failure (as first failure) 23.5% (BCT) vs 5.5% (M). If BCT + chemotherapy, decreased risk of 11.9%. Most were second primary cancers rather than true local recurrences. Contralateral breast cancer risk 40% in all groups, not affected by use of RT. No differences in regional or distant recurrence rates or overall survival. 
**Conclusion: Similar survival whether treated with M or BCT. Women treated with BCT have elevated risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence. Risk of ipsilateral recurrence with BCT reduced by use of chemotherapy. High rate of contralateral cancers.

**Retrospective. 160 BRCA+ breast ca pts matched with controls, all treated with BCS. 
**No significant difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence: 10-yr: 12% (BRCA+) vs 9%; 15-yr 24% vs 17%. BRCA+ pts had a higher risk of contralateral breast cancer: 39% vs 7% at 15 yrs. 
**Conclusion: IBTR risk similar between carriers and controls. Increased risk of contralateral breast cancers.

**131 pts with family history &quot;non-carriers&quot; (including 27 with BRCA1/2 mutations &quot;carriers&quot;; 20.6%) compared with 261 matched controls with breast cancer. Cancers were more likely to be high grade and ER-negative in those with BRCA mutations. Median f/u 8 yrs. 
**No significant differences in breast cancer recurrence as first event seen between BRCA1/2 tumors and controls or non-carriers and controls. Higher rate of contralateral breast cancer in all pts with a family history and in those with BRCA1/2 mutations vs non-carriers. Ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence not higher for BRCA1/2 mutations vs non-carriers
**Conclusion: &quot;These results support the hypothesis that breast tumours in BRCA carriers are more sensitive to radiation. Therefore, breast-conserving treatment can be offered to these patients. However, longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the rate of new primary cancer in the treated breast does not increase in the long-term.&quot;

**Retrospective. 194 patients, T1-2N0, no chemotherapy
**Outcome: high testosterone (&gt;= 0.4 ng/ml) resulted in significantly lower EFS (HR 2.05, SS). 5-year EFS: 83% vs. 76%; 10-year 70% vs. 52%; 15-year 67% vs. 36%
**Conclusion: Testosterone levels should be determined as part of prognostic workup

==Unknown primary with axillary lymphadenopathy==
When there is axillary lymphadenopathy but no known breast primary, mammography discovers an occult breast cancer ~ 25% of the time, and MRI of the breast about 75% of the time.  A breast primary was identified in 61% of mastectomy specimens on combined analysis of nine published series.

A comprehensive discussion of chemotherapy should be reserved for an Oncology textbook, but general principles of chemotherapy and how it's used with radiation therapy can be discussed here.

==Adjuvant Chemo -&gt; RT vs RT -&gt; Chemo==
*'''Harvard''' 
**Randomized. 244 pts. Randomized to RT before chemo vs chemo before RT. Chemo was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, 5-FU, prednisone (CAMFP) x 12 weeks.  5-year local failure according to margin status - positive margins (14% XRT first, 25% chemo first), close margins &lt;1 mm (0% vs 23%), negative margins (16% vs 0%), unknown margin status (0% vs 20%).
**'''1996''' PMID 8614420 &amp;mdash; &quot;The sequencing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.&quot; Recht A et al. N Engl J Med. 1996 May 23;334(21):1356-61. 
**'''2005''' PMID 15774786 &amp;mdash; &quot;Sequencing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer: updated results of a prospective randomized trial.&quot; Bellon JR et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 Mar 20;23(9):1934-40. (Presented in abstract form at ASTRO 2001)
***Median f/u 135 mo. No difference in local or distant failures. Longer time to DM with chemo: 25th percentile reached DF at 56 months (chemo first) vs 37 months (RT first). 
***No difference in any endpoint regardless of sequencing.


==Sequential Chemo -&gt; RT vs. Concurrent Chemo-RT==

==Adjuvant chemotherapy==
*CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU)
*Adriamycin-based
*FEC (5-FU, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide)

===Sequential vs alternating===
*'''NCI Milan''' - CMF + Adriamycin
**403 pts. 4 or more nodes. CMF and Adriamycin q3weeks over 36 weeks. Randomized to sequential chemotherapy (Adriamycin x 4 followed by CMF x 8) vs alternating (2 cycles of CMF alternating with 1 cycle of Adriamycin for 12 total cycles). 
**10-year results: PMID 7837388 &amp;mdash; &quot;Sequential or alternating doxorubicin and CMF regimens in breast cancer with more than three positive nodes. Ten-year results.&quot; Bonadonna G et al.  JAMA. 1995 Feb 15;273(7):542-7.
***Improved relapse free survival (42% vs 28%) and overall survival (58% vs 44%) for sequential chemotherapy.
**Conclusion: benefit for sequential CMF/Adria chemotherapy over alternating chemotherapy. This may be due to giving each chemotherapy drug in a &quot;dose-dense&quot; fashion rather than spreading it out over time.

===Sequential vs. concurrent===
*'''INT-0137''' -- concurrent AC vs. sequential dose-intense AC
**Randomized. 3176 patients s/p surgery, with high-risk N0 or low-risk N+ treated with AC. Randomized to concurrent AC (doxorubicin 54 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1.2 g/m2 Q3W x 6 cycles) vs. sequential AC (doxorubicin 40.5 mg/m2 Q3W x 4 cycles followed by cyclophosphamide 2.4 g/m2 Q2W x 3 cycles). Same dose, but higher intensity in sequential arm
**'''2007''' PMID 17308269 -- &quot;Sequenced compared with simultaneous anthracycline and cyclophosphamide in high-risk stage I and II breast cancer: final analysis from INT-0137 (S9313).&quot; (Linden HM, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 20;25(6):656-61.)
***5-year outcome: OS 88% vs. 89% (NS)
***Toxicity: hematologic grade 4 greater with A -&gt; C, nonhematologic comparable
***Conclusion: Trial does not support dose-intense sequenced therapy

==Neoadjuvant chemotherapy==
*General principles: neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is chemotherapy given before local therapy (surgery or radiation).  
*Advantages: In comparison to chemotherapy given after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy), neoadjuvant chemotherapy has certain theoretical advantages:
**Reduces tumor volume prior to surgery, which may allow for breast conserving surgery rather than mastectomy.
**Early systemic therapy.  Instead of having chemotherapy delayed by several months due to the need for scheduling of surgery and waiting for wound healing, chemotherapy can be given without delay, thus treating micrometastatic disease earlier.
**Allows in vivo assessment of the chemotherapeutic drug's effectiveness.  If the tumor decreases in size after chemotherapy then the oncologist will know the drug is effective.  If the tumor does not decrease in size, then the oncologist can switch to a different drug.  
**Improved tumor vascularity before surgery may allow more of the drug to reach the area around the tumor.
*Several randomized trials suggested benefit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but flaws in design resulted in no difference between arms
*NSABP B-18 trial demonstrated benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on higher rates of breast conservation surgery, without impacting DFS or OS. Unfortunately, only 13% patients reached pathological CR
*NSABP B-27 trial showed the addition of docetaxel to AC did not improve DFS or OS, but improving pCR (10% to 19%) and decreasing local recurrence rate (8% to 5%). Grade 4 toxicity increased (10% to 23%)

**'''NSABP B-31''' (2000-05)
***Operable breast cancer, Her-2 positive with LN+. Required FISH amplification or 3+ by immunohistochemistry. Required axillary dissection.
***Two arms: 1) ACx4 -&gt; Taxol x 4, 2) Same chemo + Herceptin weekly x 1 yr (beginning with first Taxol dose). Taxol was q3w (in 90%). Herceptin 2 mg/kg.
**'''NCCTG N9831''' (2000-05)
***Also enrolled high-risk node-negative disease (as of 2003) - &gt;2 cm and ER+ or PR+, or &gt;1 cm and ER-/PR-. Allowed sentinal lymph node.
***Three arms: 1) ACx4 -&gt; weekly Taxol x 12, 2) ACx4 -&gt; weekly Taxol x 12 -&gt; Herceptin 1 yr, 3) ACx4 -&gt; Taxol + Herceptin (started together)
**The two trials had some minor differences in the sequencing of Taxol, hormonal therapy, and RT, but were quite similar.
**Combined results:
***'''Interim; 2005''' PMID 16236738 [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/16/1673 Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable HER2-positive breast cancer.&quot; Romond EH et al. N Engl J Med. 2005 Oct 20;353(16):1673-84.
****Interim analysis of 2043 pts (of planned 2700) in B-31 and 1633 (of 2000) in NCCTG. 
****3-yr DFS improved by 12% in Herceptin arms. Risk of death decreased by 33%. Up to 4.1% incidence of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure. 8% decrease in DM. Isolated brain metastases more common in herceptin group. Sequential administration of H may be inferior to concurrent administration with chemo.

***Subset analysis of 1503 patients. No RT to IM nodes. Median F/U 3.7 years
***Outcome: No difference for acute skin reaction, pneumonitis, dyspnea, cough, dysphagia, or neutropenia. Worse leukopenia for AC-TH vs AC-T (OR 1.9). No difference of cardiac events, regardless of side (cumulative incidence ~2.5%)
***Conclusion: Concurrent adjuvant RT and herceptin not associated with increased acute adverse effects

*'''Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA)''', 2005 (2001-05) - also called BIG (Breast International Group) 01-01
**5081 pts. LN+ or LN- and &gt;1 cm. Pts randomized ''after'' completing adjuvant therapy. Had to have a minimum of 4 cycles.
***Randomized to 1) observation, 2) 1 year, or 3) 2 years of Herceptin. Herceptin given q3w (at 6 mg/kg).
**Results:

**''Note:'' The her2neu+ randomization was a subset of a larger trial of 1010 women total, randomized to docetaxel vs vinorelbine followed by FEC, as above. 
**Results:
***PMID 16495393, '''2006''' &amp;mdash; &quot;Adjuvant docetaxel or vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab for breast cancer.&quot; Joensuu H et al. N Engl J Med. 2006 Feb 23;354(8):809-20.
****3-year recurrence-free survival better in those who received trastuzumab (89 percent vs. 78 percent; P=0.01). Trastuzumab was not associated with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction or cardiac failure.

==Multigene assays for risk assessment==
*'''Oncogene DX'''
**[http://www.genomichealth.com/oncotype/studies/default.aspx Oncotype studies]
**PMID 15591335, 2004 &amp;mdash; &quot;A multigene assay to predict recurrence of tamoxifen-treated, node-negative breast cancer.&quot; Paik S et al. N Engl J Med. 2004 Dec 30;351(27):2817-26. 
***Likelihood of distant recurrence in women with node-negative, ER-positive tumors. Studied 21 prospectively-identified genes. Cohort of 668 pts from NSABP B-14.
***Conclusion: Positive validation study. Oncotype DX assay accurately predicts risk of DM.

This page is about technical concepts related to Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Information pertaining to clinical results of IMRT should go elsewhere.

==3D-CRT==
*'''U Washington''' PMID 15774592 -- ''Automatic selection of non-coplanar beam directions for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.'' ('''2005 Meyer''' J, Br J Radiol. 2005 Apr;78(928):316-27.)
**Algorithm that automatically searches all permitted beam directions
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;For the clinical cases the plans based on optimized beam directions were simpler and resulted in better sparing of critical structures compared with plans based on manual angle selection. The approach provides a practical alternative to elaborate and time consuming beam angle optimization schemes and is suitable for routine clinical usage.&quot;


==Optimizing leaf sequence==
*Beavis, 2001 - PMID 11580181 &amp;mdash; &quot;Optimization of the step-and-shoot leaf sequence for delivery of intensity modulated radiation therapy using a variable division scheme.&quot;

==Homogeneity==

These are soft pretzels.

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 package [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (1/4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] active dry yeast, 2.25 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] dry yeast, or one 0.6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] yeast cake)
* 1.5 cups warm water
* [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] white (or beaten whole egg)
* coarse [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (margarita or kosher salt)

==Procedure==
#Dissolve the yeast in the water.
#Mix in the salt, sugar, and flour.
#Knead the dough until it is smooth.
#Roll out (do not cut) a blob of dough until it is about 18 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long.
#If a traditional shape is desired: Make a loop with the middle of the dough, crossing the dough over itself at about the 15% and 85% areas. Give this contact point a 180° twist, then flip it (and the ends) over toward the middle of the dough piece so that the ends overlap the more-central part at about the 45% and 55% areas.
#Brush the pretzel with egg.
#Sprinkle coarse salt onto the egg.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|425°F]] for 15 minutes.

2. Prove a set U is open iff it is a neighborhood of all of its points.

If you wish to contact me for some reason, email civman2000@hotmail.com




It would be extra cool if you can include solutions or sketch-solutions to the problems on a seperate page.

plz add one more question in the excercise :

1. Let X be a topological space, let  A be a subset of X .Suppose that for each x in X there is an open set U containing x such that  U is containd in A. Show that A is open set in X.

If you want to contact me my id is pksharma_davc@yahoo.co.in

:Hi and welcome to wiki books.  I will attempt to add these problems when I have some time, but in the mean time you may feel free to do it yourself! :)  Editing the text book is just as easy as editing this page, and we are always glad to have more people.

'''Placenta''' is an [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|organ meat]] expelled soon after a birth. Placenta has a springy texture similar to the [[w:Heart|heart]], but more sponge-like.

Whilst Human placenta has a taste akin to a mild liver, many beef recipes work well with human placenta. A human placenta typically weighs 1/6 of the baby's weight.

To prepare placenta, cut the membranes away with a sharp knife. Wash if desired. Treat the placenta as you would any other meat.

==Warning==
Uncooked human placenta can transmit diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the greatest ways to improvise is to play so called (blind)
For example! you have just finished practicing and now your ready for some of life's happy mistakes. Just close your eyes, and make a few sounds with your mouth and then try to find these same sounds on the guitar, it will be hard at first, but in a few weeks you will have a Santana Nack...Practice is great, but mistakes are where the hidden surprises live. Happy playing Gregg

== Key ==

Should this really say that you are often able to determine key by the first note or chord played? That is a common misconception, and it's just plain unreliable.



One way of determining the key is by using the whole step, half step technique. For instance if two minor chords in the progression are one whole step apart, &quot;Gm &amp; Am&quot;  the key would be &quot;F&quot; or one whole step down from the first minor chord.

The formula is: F  (WS) Gm (WS)  Am (HS) Bb(maj7) (WS) C7 (WS)Dm (WS) E half diminished (HS)F

== Introduction ==
Welcome to the [[w:Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Learning Guide.

There is [[Yiddish for Yeshivah Bachurim|another Wikibook about Yiddish]], aimed at Yeshivah-students who are interested in learning enough Yiddish to understand a lesson taught in Yiddish. It may be used as a substitute until this Wikibook is more developed.

Note that Yiddish is written in the same alphabet as Hebrew, but here the words are also transliterated using the [[w:Yiddish orthography|YIVO]] system.

===To Learn - לערנען זיך / To Teach - לערנען ===

איך לערן זיך אידיש I am learning Yiddish

דו לערנסט זיך אידיש You are learning Yiddish

ער/זי לערנט זיך אידיש He/she is learning Yiddish.

The verbal additive זיך is needed when one is &quot;learning&quot;. In the past tense (I have learnt, you have learnt etc...) the verbal additive
comes directly after the verb:

זי האָט זיך געלערנט the verb being hoben.

To teach is simply לערנען.

דער רב לערנט מיט מיר תּורה Der Rov lernt mit mir Toyre - The Rov is teaching me Toyre.

Another way to say that someone is teaching you is:

דער רב לערנט מיך תּורה Der Rov gelernt mikh Toyre - Der Rov is teaching me Toyre.

So either ער לערנט מיט מיר  ...ער לערנט מיך...
Er lernt mikh... or er lernt mit mir...

===Conjugating verbs with prefixes===
Verbs with prefixes like for example:אַרױסגײן, נאָכגײן, אױפֿמאַכן oyf(of)makhn-to open, nokhgayn-to follow and aroys(arusgayn)to go out. When conjugating these verbs one put the last part of the word first for example makhn oyf, gayn nokh, aroys gayn and so on. Lemoshl:

Ikh gay aroys, di gayst aroys, er gayt aroys...

ikh gay nokh, di gayst nokh, er gayt nokh...

Also an adverb can be place in between the verb and prefix:

Ikh gay shnel aroys, di gayst shnel aroys, un afile er gayt zayer shnel aroys in dos glaykhn...

===Conjugating verbs===
==== Present tense ====
Most verbs are conjugated in the same form in present tense, though there are some exceptions. The subject usually comes before the verb (like in English), but sometimes the order is reversed (like Hebrew) to change the tone (most notably, in questions). Here is an example of a regular verb:
*הערן – hear
*איך הער – I hear
*דו הערסט – you hear
*ער הערט – he hears
*זי הערט – she hears
*עס הערט – it hears
*מיר הערן – we hear
*איר הערט – you (plural or formal) hear
*זיי הערן – they hear
Verbs that come from Hebrew are usually conjugated together with the word זײַן ''to be'', similar to in Yeshivish (they are Modeh; he is Meyasheiv the Stirah; they are Mechaleik between them). Here is an example:
*מסכּים זײַן – agree
*איך בּין מסכּים – I agree
*דו בּיסט מסכּים – you agree
*ער/זי/עס איז מסכּים – he/she/it agrees
*מיר/זיי זײַנען מסכּים – we/they agree
*איר זענט מסכּים – you agree

איך בין מסכּים געװען Ikh bin maskim geveyn

==== Past tense ====
Past tense is conjugated by adding the helping verb האָבּן ''have'', and (usually) adding the letters גע to the verb. This is similar to some past tense words in English (&quot;I have done that.&quot;) For words which come from Hebrew, זײַן becomes געווען. Here are some examples:
*האָבּן געהערט - heard
*איך האָבּ געהערט – I heard
*דו האָסט געהערט – you heard
*ער/זי/עס האָט געהערט – he/she/it heard
*מיר/זיי האָבּן געהערט – we/they heard
*איר האָט געהערט – you heard

*האָבּן מסכּים געווען – agreed
*איך האָבּ מסכּים געווען – I agreed
*דו האָסט מסכּים געווען – you agreed
*ער/זי/עס האָט מסכּים געווען – he/she/it agreed
*מיר/זיי האָבּן מסכּים געווען – we/they agreed
*איר האָט מסכּים געווען – you agreed

==== Future tense ====
Similar to past tense (and future tense in English), future tense is expressed by adding the helping verb װעלן ''will''. Here are the (now familiar) examples:
*וועלן הערן – will hear
*איך װעל הערן – I will hear
*דו װעסט הערן – you will hear
*ער/זי/עס װעט הערן – he/she/it will hear
*מיר/זיי װעלן הערן – we/they will hear
*איר װעט הערן – you will hear

*וועלן מסכּים זײַן – will agree
*איך װעל מסכּים זײַן – I will agree
*דו װעסט מסכּים זײַן – you will agree
*ער/זי/עס װעט מסכּים זײַן – he/she/it will agree
*מיר/זיי װעלן מסכּים זײַן – we/they will agree
*איר װעט מסכּים זײַן – you will agree

== This (Explicit) ==

There are several ways to indicate &quot;this&quot; in Yiddish, each increasing in strength, א שטײגער:

אָט דעם מאַן קען איך

אָט אָ דעם מאַן קען איך

דעם אָ מאַן קען איך

דעם דאָזיקן מאַן  קען איך

אָט  דעם דאָזיקן מאַן קען איך

אָט אָ דעם דאָזיקן מאַן קען איך

== A lot - א סאך ==

This takes the plural verb and does not inflect.

א סאך זענען נאך דא

More people are still here.

א סאך זענען שױן אװעק

Many people have already left.

==Future tense ==

איך װעל  I will

איר װעט You will(formal, plural)

מ'װעט One will

== To want - װיל==

איך װיל א בוך I want a book - Ikh vil a bukh

דוא װילסט א בוך You want a book - Di (rhymes with see) vilst a bukh

ער װיל אַ בוך er (rhymes with air) vil a bukh.

איר װעט אַ בוך

מיר װילן אַ בוך

== האלטן אין ==

האלטן אין In the middle of; in the midst of. Corresponds to the English -ing.

איך האַלט אין שרײבען א בריװ

Ikh halt in shraabn a briv.

I'm in the middle of middle writing a letter.

מיר האַלטן יעצט אין עסן

We're eating now.

== Hasidic grammar project ==

The Holocaust and the widespread linguistic assimilation of Jews throughout the world have together reduced the population of Yiddish-speakers from an estimated 13 million before the Second World War to perhaps 1 million today. About half of the remaining Yiddish-speakers today are aged European Jews, often Holocaust-survivors, while the other half are chareidim, mostly Hasidim, mostly young. Unsurprisingly, most Hasidim speak a southern dialect of Yiddish which was the majority dialect pre-World War II, and is somewhat distant from the Lithuanian dialect that forms the basis for the standard YIVO pronunciation. Although the Hasidim reject some of the reforms made by the YIVO in orthography, morphology, and lexicon, their Yiddish is recognizably the same language.

Though no dictionaries or grammars of Hasidic Yiddish have yet been published, a &quot;Hasidic Standard&quot; has nevertheless developed among the younger generations born in America, and a similar process has occurred in Hasidic communities in other parts of the world. Standardization has been assisted by such factors as geography - Hasidic groups that once lived in separate countries now inhabit the same neighborhoods in Brooklyn - by the schools, and by the Yiddish press. Hasidic Standard has much more room for variation in spelling and pronunciation than YIVO Standard, and it is more difficult for beginning students to learn. Still, the Yiddish language has radically shifted its center of gravity and it is high time to enable students to learn the Yiddish that is most widely spoken today. To that end, the Hasidic Grammar Project has been created to produce an online textbook and grammar.&lt;!--where?--&gt;

== PHONOLOGY ==
== LEXICON ==
=== Loan Words ===
One of the most often remarked features of Hasidic Yiddish in America is the borrowing of English words on a large scale. In fact, this is not any special development on the part of the Hasidim. Yiddish-speaking Jews in America have been mixing in English since the first wave of immigration in the early 1880s. Ab. Cahan and the FORVERTS used loan words on a similar scale for many decades. Why Jews in America have been so open to loan words in comparison to Jews in Europe or Israel is not clear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under standard conditions.

 M+ (g) + X- (g) ----&gt; MX (s)

It is a measure of how strong the ionic lattice is within the compound. Lattice energies are exothermic. The more negative the value, the stronger the bonding.

The keyword '''overriding''' can be used to explicitly declare a procedure or function as an overriding [[Ada Programming/Subprograms|subprogram]]. There are two forms available:

 {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Overriding_Procedure (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} Class_Type);

 {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Overriding_Procedure (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} Class_Type);

The first declares the procedure as overriding the second does not.

== Function overloading in Ada ==

Ada supports all six signature options but if you use the arguments' name as option you will always have to name the parameter when calling the function. i.e.:

 Number_2 : Integer := Generate_Number (MinValue =&gt; 6,
                                        MaxValue =&gt; 10);

Note that you cannot overload a generic procedure or generic function within the same package. The following example will fail to compile:

  {{Ada/kw|package}} myPackage
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Value_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;);  
    {{Ada/--|The first declaration of a generic subprogram}}
    {{Ada/--|with the name &quot;Generic_Subprogram&quot;}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Generic_Subprogram (Value : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Value_Type);
    ...
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Value_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;); 
    {{Ada/--|This subprogram has the same name, but no}}
    {{Ada/--|input or output parameters. A non-generic}}
    {{Ada/--|procedure would be overloaded here.}}
    {{Ada/--|Since this procedure is generic, overloading}}
    {{Ada/--|is not allowed and this package will not compile.}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Generic_Subprogram;
    ...
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Value_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;); 
    {{Ada/--|The same situation.}}
    {{Ada/--|Even though this is a function and not}}
    {{Ada/--|a procedure, generic overloading of}}
    {{Ada/--|the name &quot;Generic_Subprogram&quot; is not allowed.}}
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Generic_Subprogram (Value : Value_Type) {{Ada/kw|return}} Value_Type;
  {{Ada/kw|end}} myPackage;

== Tasks ==

A ''task unit'' is a program unit that is obeyed concurrently with the rest of an Ada program.  The corresponding activity, a new locus of control, is called a ''task'' in Ada terminology, and is similar to a ''thread'', for example in [[Java:Threads|Java Threads]].  The execution of the main program is also a task, the anonymous environment task.  A task unit has both a declaration and a body, which is mandatory.  A task body may be compiled separately as a subunit, but a task may not be a library unit, nor may it be generic.  Every task depends on a ''master'', which is the immediately surrounding declarative region - a block, a subprogram, another task, or a package.  The execution of a master does not complete until all its dependent tasks have terminated.  The environment task is the master of all other tasks; it terminates only when all other tasks have terminated.

Task units are similar to packages in that a task declaration defines entities exported from the task, whereas its body contains local declarations and statements of the task.

A single task is declared as follows:

   {{Ada/kw|task}} Single {{Ada/kw|is}}
      ''declarations of exported identifiers''
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Single;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Single {{Ada/kw|is}}
     '' local declarations and statements''
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Single;

A task declaration can be simplified, if nothing is exported, thus:

   {{Ada/kw|task}} No_Exports;

Ex. 1

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Housekeeping {{Ada/kw|is}}
   
      {{Ada/kw|task}} Check_CPU;
      {{Ada/kw|task}} Backup_Disk;
   
      {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Check_CPU {{Ada/kw|is}}
         ...
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Check_CPU;
   
      {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Backup_Disk {{Ada/kw|is}}
         ...
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Backup_Disk;
      {{Ada/--|the two tasks are automatically created and begin execution}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}} {{Ada/--|Housekeeping}}
      {{Ada/kw|null}};
      {{Ada/--|Housekeeping waits here for them to terminate}}
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Housekeeping;

It is possible to declare task types, thus allowing task units to be  created dynamically, and incorporated in data structures:

   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} T;
   ...
   Task_1, Task_2 : T;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} T {{Ada/kw|is}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} T;

Task types are '''limited''', i.e. they are restricted in the same way as limited private types, so assignment and comparison are not allowed.

=== Rendezvous ===

The only entities that a task may export are entries. An '''entry''' looks much like a procedure. It has an identifier and may have '''in''', '''out''' or '''in out''' parameters. Ada supports communication from task to task by means of the ''entry call''. Information passes between tasks through the actual parameters of the entry call. We can encapsulate data structures within tasks and operate on them by means of entry calls, in a way analogous to the use of packages for encapsulating variables. The main difference is that an entry is executed by the called task, not the calling task, which is suspended until the call completes.  If the called task is not ready to service a call on an entry, the calling task waits in a (FIFO) queue associated with the entry. This interaction between calling task and called task is known as a ''rendezvous''. The calling task requests rendezvous with a specific named task by calling one of its entries. A task accepts rendezvous with any caller of a specific entry by executing an '''accept''' statement for the entry. If no caller is waiting, it is held up. 
Thus entry call and accept statement behave symmetrically. (To be honest, optimized object code may reduce the number of context switches below the number implied by this poor description.)

Ex. 2
The following task type implements a single-slot buffer, i.e. an encapsulated variable that can have values inserted and removed in strict alternation. Note that the buffer task has no need of state variables to implement the buffer protocol: the alternation of insertion and removal operations is directly enforced by the control structure in the body of Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type which is, as is typical, a '''loop'''.

   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type;
   ...
   Buffer_Pool : {{Ada/kw|array}} (0 .. 15) {{Ada/kw|of}} Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type;
   This_Item   : Item;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Datum : Item;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|accept}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
            Datum := An_Item;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
         {{Ada/kw|accept}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
            An_Item := Datum;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} Remove;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Encapsulated_Buffer_Task_Type;
   ...
   Buffer_Pool(1).Remove (This_Item);
   Buffer_Pool(2).Insert (This_Item);

=== Selective Wait ===

To avoid being held up when it could be doing productive work, a server task often needs the freedom to accept a call on any one of a number of alternative entries.  It does this by means of the ''selective wait'' statement, which allows a task to wait for a call on any of two or more entries.

If only one of the alternatives in a selective wait statement has a pending entry call, then that one is accepted.
If two or more alternatives have calls pending, the implementation is free to accept any one of them.  For example, it could choose one at random.  This introduces ''bounded non-determinism'' into the program.  A sound Ada program should not depend on a particular method being used to choose between pending entry calls.
(However, there are facilities to influence the method used, when that is necessary.)

Ex. 3

   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Store (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Fetch (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Datum : Item;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|accept}} Store (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
         Datum := An_Item;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Store;
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}   
            {{Ada/kw|accept}} Store (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
               Datum := An_Item;
            {{Ada/kw|end}} Store;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
            {{Ada/kw|accept}} Fetch (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
               An_Item := Datum;
            {{Ada/kw|end}} Fetch;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type;

   x, y : Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type;

creates two variables of type Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type. They can be used thus:

   it : Item;
   ...
   x.Store(Some_Expression);
   ...
   x.Fetch (it);
   y.Store (it);

Again, note that the control structure of the body ensures that an Encapsulated_Variable_Task_Type must be given an initial value by a first Store operation before any Fetch operation can be accepted.

=== Guards ===

Depending on circumstances, a server task may not be able to accept calls for some of the entries that have accept alternatives in a selective wait statement.  The acceptance of any alternative can be made conditional by using a ''guard'', which is ''[[Ada Programming/Types#Boolean|Boolean]]'' precondition for acceptance.  This makes it easy to write monitor-like server tasks, with no need for an explicit signaling mechanism, nor for mutual exclusion.
An alternative with a True guard is said to be ''open''.  It is an error if no alternative is open when the selective wait statement is executed, and this raises the Program_Error exception.

Ex. 4

   {{Ada/kw|task}} Cyclic_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Cyclic_Buffer_Task_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Cyclic_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Q_Size : {{Ada/kw|constant}} := 100;
      {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Q_Range {{Ada/kw|is}} Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Q_Size;
      Length : Natural {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. Q_Size := 0;
      Head, Tail : Q_Range := 1;
      Data : {{Ada/kw|array}} (Q_Range) {{Ada/kw|of}} Item;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
            {{Ada/kw|when}} Length &lt; Q_Size =&gt;
               {{Ada/kw|accept}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
                  Data(Tail) := An_Item;
               {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
               Tail := Tail {{Ada/kw|mod}} Q_Size + 1;
               Length := Length + 1;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
            {{Ada/kw|when}} Length &gt; 0 =&gt;
               {{Ada/kw|accept}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
                  An_Item := Data(Head);
               {{Ada/kw|end}} Remove;
               Head := Head {{Ada/kw|mod}} Q_Size + 1;
               Length := Length - 1;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Cyclic_Buffer_Task_Type;

== Protected types ==

Tasks allow for encapsulation and safe usage of variable data without the need for any explicit mutual exclusion and signaling mechanisms.  Ex. 4 shows how easy it is to write server tasks that safely manage locally-declared
data on behalf of multiple clients. There is no need for mutual exclusion of access to the managed data, 
''because it is never accessed concurrently''. However, the overhead of creating a task merely to serve up some data may be excessive. For such applications, Ada 95 provides '''protected''' modules, based on the well-known computer science concept of a ''[[w:Monitor_(synchronization)|monitor]]''. A protected module encapsulates a data structure and exports subprograms that operate on it under automatic mutual exclusion.
It also provides automatic, implicit signaling of conditions between client tasks. Again, a protected module can be either a single protected object or a protected type, allowing many protected objects to be created. 

A protected module can export only procedures, functions and entries, and its body may contain only the bodies of procedures, functions and entries. The protected data is declared after '''private''' in its specification, but is accessible only within the protected module's body. Protected procedures and entries may read and/or write its encapsulated data, and automatically exclude each other.  Protected functions may only read the encapsulated data,
so that multiple protected function calls can be concurrently executed in the same protected object, with complete safety; but protected procedure calls and entry calls exclude protected function calls, and vice versa. Exported entries and subprograms of a protected object are executed by its calling task, as a protected object has no independent locus of control.  (To be honest, optimized object code may reduce the number of context switches below the number implied by this naive description.)

Like a task entry, a protected entry can employ a guard to control admission. This provides automatic signaling, and ensures that when a protected entry call is accepted, its guard condition is True, so that a guard provides a reliable precondition for the entry body.

Ex. 5
The following is a simple protected type analogous to the Encapsulated_Buffer task in Ex. 2. 

   {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Protected_Buffer_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|private}}
      Buffer : Item;
      Empty  : Boolean := True;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Protected_Buffer_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Protected_Buffer_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item)
         {{Ada/kw|when}} Empty {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Buffer := An_Item;
         Empty := False;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item)
         {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|not}} Empty {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         An_Item := Buffer;
         Empty := True;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Remove;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Protected_Buffer_Type;

Note how the guards, using the state variable Empty, ensure that messages are alternately inserted and removed, 
and that no attempt can be made to take data from an empty buffer.  All this is achieved without explicit signaling or mutual exclusion constructs, whether in the calling task or in the protected type itself.

The notation for calling a protected entry or procedure is exactly the same as that for calling a task entry.  This makes it easy to replace one implementation of the abstract type by the other, the calling code being unaffected.

Ex. 6
The following task type implements Dijkstra's semaphore ADT, with FIFO scheduling of resumed processes.  The algorithm will accept calls to both Wait and Signal, so long as the semaphore invariant would not be violated.  When that circumstance approaches, calls to Wait are ignored for the time being.

   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Semaphore_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Initialize (N : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Wait;
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Signal;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Semaphore_Task_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Semaphore_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Count : Natural;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|accept}} Initialize (N : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural) {{Ada/kw|do}}
         Count := N;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
            {{Ada/kw|when}} Count &gt; 0 =&gt;
                {{Ada/kw|accept}} Wait {{Ada/kw|do}}
                   Count := Count - 1;
                {{Ada/kw|end}} Wait;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
                {{Ada/kw|accept}} Signal;
                Count := Count + 1;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Semaphore_Task_Type;

This task could be used as follows:

   nr_Full, nr_Free : Semaphore_Task_Type;
   ...
   nr_Full.Initialize (0); nr_Free.Initialize (nr_Slots);
   ...
   nr_Free.Wait; nr_Full.Signal;

Alternatively, semaphore functionality can be provided by a protected object, with major efficiency gains.

The Initialize and Signal operations of this protected type are unconditional, so they are implemented as protected procedures, but the Wait operation must be guarded and is therefore implemented as an entry. 

   {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Semaphore_Protected_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (N : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Wait;
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Signal;
   {{Ada/kw|private}}
      Count : Natural := 0;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Semaphore_Protected_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Semaphore_Protected_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (N : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural) {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Count := N;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Wait
         {{Ada/kw|when}} Count &gt; 0 {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Count := Count - 1;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Wait;
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Signal {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         Count := Count + 1;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Signal;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Semaphore_Protected_Type;

Unlike the task type above, this does not ensure that Initialize is called before Wait or Signal, and Count is given a default initial value instead.  Restoring this defensive feature of the task version is left as an exercise for the reader.

== Entry families ==

Sometimes we need a group of related entries.  Entry ''families'', indexed by a ''[[ada Programming/Types#List of Types|discrete type]]'', meet this need.

Ex. 8
This task provides a pool of several buffers.

   {{Ada/kw|type}} Buffer_Id {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. nr_Bufs;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} Buffer_Pool_Task {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (Buffer_Id) (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (Buffer_Id) (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Buffer_Pool_Task;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Buffer_Pool_Task {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Data   : {{Ada/kw|array}} (Buffer_Id) {{Ada/kw|of}} Item;
      Filled : {{Ada/kw|array}} (Buffer_Id) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean  := (others =&gt; False);
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} Data'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|not}} Filled(I) =&gt;
              {{Ada/kw|accept}} Insert (I) (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
                 Data(I) := An_Item;
              {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
              Filled(I) := True;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Filled(I) =&gt;
              {{Ada/kw|accept}} Remove (I) (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
                     An_Item := Data(I);
              {{Ada/kw|end}} Remove;
              Filled(I) := False;
         {{Ada/kw|else}}
           {{Ada/kw|null}}; {{Ada/--|N.B. &quot;polling&quot; or &quot;busy waiting&quot;}}
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};   
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Buffer_Pool_Task;
   ...
   Buffer_Pool_Task.Remove(K)(This_Item);

Note that the busy wait {{Ada/kw|else}} {{Ada/kw|null}} is necessary here to prevent the task from being suspended on some buffer when there was no call pending for it, because such suspension would delay serving requests for all the other buffers (perhaps indefinitely).

== Termination ==

Server tasks often contain infinite loops to allow them to service an arbitrary number of calls in succession. 
But control cannot leave a task's master until the task terminates, so we need a way for a server to know when it should terminate.  This is done by a ''terminate alternative'' in a selective wait.

Ex. 9

   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Terminating_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Terminating_Buffer_Task_Type;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Terminating_Buffer_Task_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Datum : Item;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
            {{Ada/kw|accept}} Insert (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
               Datum := An_Item;
            {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
            {{Ada/kw|terminate}};
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
            {{Ada/kw|accept}} Remove (An_Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Item) {{Ada/kw|do}}
               An_Item := Datum;
            {{Ada/kw|end}} Remove;
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
            {{Ada/kw|terminate}};
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Terminating_Buffer_Task_Type;

The task terminates when:
# at least one terminate alternative is open, and
# there are no pending calls to its entries, and
# all other tasks of the same master are in the same state (or already terminated), and
# the task's master has completed (i.e. has run out of statements to execute).

Conditions (1) and (2) ensure that the task is in a fit state to stop. 
Conditions (3) and (4) ensure that stopping cannot have an adverse effect on the rest of the program, because no further calls that might change its state are possible.

== Timeout ==

A task may need to avoid being held up by calling to a slow server. A ''timed entry call'' lets a client specify a maximum delay before achieving rendezvous, failing which the attempted entry call is withdrawn and an alternative sequence of statements is executed.

Ex. 10

   {{Ada/kw|task}} Password_Server {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Check (User, Pass : {{Ada/kw|in}} String; Valid : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Set (User, Pass : {{Ada/kw|in}}  String);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Password_Server;
   ...
   User_Name, Password : String (1 .. 8);
   ...
   Put (&quot;Please give your new password:&quot;);
   Get_Line (Password);
   {{Ada/kw|select}}
      Password_Server.Set (User_Name, Password);
      Put_Line (&quot;Done&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|or}}
      {{Ada/kw|delay}} 10.0;
      Put_Line (&quot;The system is busy now, please try again later.&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

To time out the ''functionality'' provided by a task, two distinct entries are needed: one to pass in arguments, and one to collect the result.  Timing out on rendezvous with the latter achieves the desired effect.

Ex. 11

   {{Ada/kw|task}} Process_Data {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Input (D  : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Datum);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Output (D  : {{Ada/kw|out}} Datum);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Process_Data;
   
   Input_Data, Output_Data : Datum;
   
   {{Ada/kw|loop}}
      ''collect'' Input_Data ''from sensors'';
      Process_Data.Input (Input_Data);
      {{Ada/kw|select}}
         Process_Data.Output (Output_Data);
         ''pass'' Output_Data ''to display task'';
      {{Ada/kw|or}}
         {{Ada/kw|delay}} 0.1;
         Log_Error (&quot;Processing did not complete quickly enough.&quot;);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

Symmetrically, a delay alternative in a selective wait statement allows a server task to withdraw an offer to accept calls after a maximum delay in achieving rendezvous with any client.

Ex. 12

   {{Ada/kw|task}} Resource_Lender {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Get_Loan (Period : {{Ada/kw|in}} Duration);
      {{Ada/kw|entry}} Give_Back;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Resource_Lender;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Resource_Lender {{Ada/kw|is}}
      Period_Of_Loan : Duration;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|select}}
            {{Ada/kw|accept}} Get_Loan (Period : {{Ada/kw|in}} Duration) {{Ada/kw|do}}
               Period_Of_Loan := Period;
            {{Ada/kw|end}} Get_Loan;
            {{Ada/kw|select}}
               {{Ada/kw|accept}} Give_Back;
            {{Ada/kw|or}}
               {{Ada/kw|delay}} Period_Of_Loan;
               Log_Error (&quot;Borrower did not give up loan soon enough.&quot;);
            {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
         {{Ada/kw|or}}
            {{Ada/kw|terminate}};
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Resource_Lender;

== Conditional entry calls ==

An entry call can be made conditional, so that it is withdrawn if the rendezvous is not immediately achieved. This uses the select statement notation with an '''else''' part. Thus the constructs

   {{Ada/kw|select}}
     Callee.Rendezvous;
   {{Ada/kw|else}}
     Do_something_else;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

and

   {{Ada/kw|select}}
     Callee.Rendezvous;
   {{Ada/kw|or}}
     {{Ada/kw|delay}} 0.0;
     Do_something_else;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

seem to be conceptually equivalent. However, the attempt to start the rendezvous may take some time, especially if the callee is on another processor, so the ''delay 0.0;'' may expire although the callee would be able to accept the rendezvous, whereas the ''else'' construct is safe.

== Requeue statements ==

A requeue statement allows an accept statement or entry body to be completed while redirecting it to a different or the same entry queue, even to one of another task. The called entry has to share the same parameter list or be parameter-less. The caller of the original entry is not aware of the requeue and the entry call continues although now to possibly another entry of another task.

The requeue statement should normally be used to quickly check some precondition for the work proper. If these are fulfilled, the work proper is delegated to another task, hence the caller should nearly immediately be requeued.

Thus requeuing may have an effect on timed entry calls. To be a bit more specific, say the timed entry call is to T1.E1, the requeue within T1.E1 to T2.E2:

 task body T1 is
   ...
   accept E1 do
     ...  -- Here quick check of preconditions.
     requeue T2.E2;  -- delegation
   end E1;
   ...
 end T1;

Let Delta_T be the timeout of the timed entry call to T1.E1. There are now several possibilities:

1. Delta_T expires before T1.E1 is accepted.
The entry call is aborted, i.e. taken out of the queue.

2. Delta_T expires after T1.E1 is accepted.
T1.E1 is completed and T2.E2 is to be accepted.
For the caller, who is unaware of the requeue, the entry call is still executing; it is completed only with the completion T2.E2.

Thus, although the original entry call may be postponed for a long time while T2.E2 is waiting to be accepted, the call is executing from the caller's point of view.

To avoid this behaviour, a call may be ''requeued with abort''. This changes case 2 above:

2.a The call is requeued to T2.E2 before Delta_T expires.

2.a.1 T2.E2 is accepted before expiration, the call continues until T2.E2 is completed.

2.a.2 Delta_T expires before T2.E2 is accepted: The entry call is aborted, i.e. taken out of the queue of T2.E2.

2.b The call is requeued to T2.E2 after the expiration of Delta_T.

2.b.1 T2.E2 is immediately available (i.e. there is no requeue), T2.E2 continues to completion.

2.b.2 T2.E2 is queued: The entry call is aborted, i.e. taken out of the queue of T2.E2.

In short, for a requeue with abort, the entry call to T1.E1 is completed in cases 1, 2.a.1 and 2.b.1; it is aborted in 2.a.2 and 2.b.2.

So what is the difference between these three entries?

   accept E1 do
     ...  -- Here quick check of preconditions.
     requeue T2.E2 [with abort];  -- delegation
   end E1;

   accept E2 do
     ...  -- Here quick check of preconditions.
     T2.E2;  -- delegation
   end E2;

   accept E3 do
     ...  -- Here quick check of preconditions.
   end E3;
   T2.E2;  -- delegation

E1 has just been discussed. After the requeue, its enclosing task is free for other work, while the caller is still suspended until its call is completed or aborted.

E2 also delegates, however via an entry call. Thus E2 completes only with the completion of T2.E2.

E3 first frees the caller, then delegates to T2.E2, i.e. the entry call is completed with E3.

'''Cream''' is a dairy product that is composed of the higher-[[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] layer skimmed from the top of raw [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] before homogenization. In the raw milk, over time, the lighter fat rises to the top. In many countries cream is sold in several grades depending on total fat content.

Cream produced by cows grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural pigments; this gives the cream a slight yellow tone. Cream from cows fed on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

In the US, cream is usually sold as:
* [[Cookbook:Half and Half|Half-and-half]] (12% fat)
* Whipping cream and [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] (30%)
* Heavy cream, or heavy whipping cream (36%)
* Manufacturer's cream (40%), mostly available from food-services supply wholesalers rather than grocery stores

Also common in the US is [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], which is cream that has been fermented with lactic acid bacteria. This produces a sour taste and thickens the cream.

In the UK, cream is usually sold as:
* Half cream (12%)
* Single cream or Light cream (18%)
* Whipping cream (35%)
* Double cream (48%)

In the UK, '''clotted cream''' is a very high fat (55%) product processed with heat.

[[Cookbook:Crème Fraîche|Crème fraîche]] (a product with a French name and widely available elsewhere) is a heavy cream slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as American sour cream.  Mexican '''crema''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar.

Cream with 30% or more of fat can be turned into '''whipped cream''' by mixing it with air. This roughly doubles the cream's volume as air bubbles are captured in a network of fat droplets. If the whipping is continued, the fat droplets stick together and form [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]; the remaining liquid is [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]. 

Cream is the principal constituent of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]. 

[[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|Ice cream]] is made with milk, milk proteins, cream and flavorings, frozen while stirring to limit the size of the ice crystals.  Premium ice creams usually contain more milk fat.

The term '''cream''' or '''creme''' is also used to refer to a variety of substances of a consistency similar to or thicker than that of cream, such as chocolate cream or coconut cream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spread gives an offset value which is different for each of the voices which are playing the same midi note (Unison).  When only one voice is playing a note, the value is zero.  The offsets are grouped around zero and are multiples of the value at the module's input.

If someone can give ideas of what it is used for that would be most welcome.

I have noticed that the chain rule section comes before the product and quotient rule sections. I think that the quotient and product rule sections should come before the chain rule as the chain rule is more difficult than the other two. [[User:Evan W.|Evan W.]] 00:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)	 
: I agree. [[User:Rmbzz|Rmbzz]] ([[User talk:Rmbzz|talk]]) 01:14, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

==product rule==

is there any simple proofs that could be added to any of this? oh and is there a way to change the color of the font to highlight certin sections of a proof?  good work I like what I've learned so far

one more thing could you explain this step more?

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = \lim_{h \to 0} \left[ g(x+h) \frac{ f(x+h) - f(x) }{h} + f(x) \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
Which, when we take the limit, turns into:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x) \right] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or the mnemonic &quot;one D-two plus two D-one&quot;
Thanks for your time --[[User:Stranger104|Stranger104]] 10:57, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I'm going to reword the discription of the chain Rule.  its a little confusing as it is right now. oh I'm also having a hard time making f ' (X) look like its suposed to without spacing with the font thats being used in the explanation.  any ideas how to fix this?--[[User:65.24.68.237|65.24.68.237]] 03:34, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Implicit Differentiation ==
Does anyone feel that it would be a good idea to implement a section on implicit differentiation after the Chain Rule?

I decided to go ahead and add it. I hope it is clear and makes sense. Should I add more examples? -EbolaPox

==revert vandalism==
Just skimming through and spotted some vandalism so reverted but forgot to log in or leave comment duh?! i really need to go to bed 81.79.60.184 aka

== Reducing answers? ==

Shouldn't the answers to the exercises be reduced to the simplest terms?

For example, #4 answer is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3x^2-6x^2-6x}{9x^4}&lt;/math&gt;

I think it should be reduced:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-3x^2-6x}{9x^4}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-3x(x+2)}{3x(3x^3)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{x+2}{3x^3}&lt;/math&gt;

... but I'm not sure.  I may have missed something.

That is correct.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:42, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Euler's formula.... ==

I don't think that throwing out Euler's formula is good pedagogy. Especially since Taylor series are required to establish that identity. Using the definition of derivative is far more informative for the aspiring student. --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:33, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

Also the symmetric difference and the sinh(x) derivation is iffy. Are we assuming that reader is aware of hyperbolics? I have made quite a few edits, the page is rather different, please take a look.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:43, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

I removed the Euler's and I am going to rm the hyperbolic as well.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:06, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

== Incorrect example ==

In the Quotient and Product Rules section, it gives an example of a function where the product rule is useful. The function contains both the pronumerals x and y, however the function is defined as H(x) and not H(x,y) and hence we differentiate only against x and not both x and y. When there is an unknown pronumeral that we are not differentiating against (y in this case) it is treated as a constant.--''anon''

:I will take care of it--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:57, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

:Done--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:05, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

== Chain rule example error ==

Hey, I'm no math major, but shouldn't this eaxample in the chain rule:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = 2u\cdot 2x = 2(x+5)(2x) = 4x^3 + 20&lt;/math&gt;

be corrected to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = 2u\cdot 2x = 2(x^2+5)(2x) = 4x^3 + 20x&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:ChewyGingerCookies.jpg|thumb|Chewy Ginger Cookies]] 
These '''chewy ginger cookies''' are soft and delicately flavored.

This recipe makes about 4 to 4½ dozen cookies.

==Ingredients==
*¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened 
*2 cup [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*2½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*½ tsp. ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tsp. ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 tsp. ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*extra sugar for coating

==Procedure==
#Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F (200°C)]].
#Cream the butter and the sugar.
#Add the egg and stir in the molasses.
#Combine the baking soda, flour, spices and salt in a separate bowl.
#Combine the wet and dry mixtures.
#Shape into small (2.5 cm/1 inch diameter) balls and roll in granulated sugar.
#Place on greased [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]]. Do not flatten balls.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for about 11 minutes.  One way to tell they are done is when the cookies are cracked but the dough inside the cracks doesn't look quite finished.  Beyond that they will be too done.
