      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Huntington Disease'''

==Contracting==
*What have you been told already about HD and the reason you were referred to see us?
*Wondering what questions or concerns you might like to discuss with us today?
*How has your diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder changed your life the most?
*Since HD is usually passed on by a parent I like to begin by taking a family medical history to see if any other family members may have had symptoms of HD. Sometimes HD can be misdiagnosed as something else like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease because they share some of the same symptoms and other times family members have passed away before symptoms of HD develop
*We can then discuss the cause of HD and details about the genetic testing we have to offer you.
*Dr. ____ will also be in later to perform a short physical examination and further discuss HD

==HD overview==
*An inherited progressive brain disease
*It often causes uncontrolled movements (chorea), problems with coordination, difficulty with memory and mental processing, and emotional or personality changes.

==Incidence==
*A rare disease, occurring in 3-7 people per 100,000 people in populations of western European descent
*About 1 in 10,000 in N. America
*HD is less common in Japan, China, Finland, and African Americans

==Disease Manifestations==
*Presently no effective therapy to halt progression of disease
*Most often symptoms develop between age 30-50
*Approximately 25% of patients with HD exhibit the first symptoms after age 50
*About 10% have juvenile Huntington disease with onset before age 20
*Epileptic seizures are common in early onset cases with 30-50% of juvenile patients being affected
*Chorea is not common in children with juvenile HD
*Early symptoms
*subtle changes in coordination
*involuntary movements (chorea)
*non-repetitive, non-periodic, jerking of limbs, face or torso
*present in over 90% of patients with HD
*continuously present during the waking hours, cannot be suppressed voluntarily and are worsened by stress
*difficulty in mental planning
*depressed or irritable mood
*memory impairments
*As HD progresses there is increased difficulty with voluntary movement
*May have outbursts of aggressive behaviors and social disinhibition
*A global decline in cognitive capabilities occurs in all HD patients
*Personality changes may develop; some develop affective psychosis or schizophrenic psychosis
*Suicide occurs in up to 12% of patients
*Behavioral disturbances such as intermittent explosiveness, apathy, aggression, alcohol abuse, sexual dysfunction and deviations, are frequent
*Delusions, often paranoid, are also common
*Hallucinations are less common
*In the late stages of HD, behavior problems are gradually lessened, but motor disability becomes severe and the patient is often totally dependent, can't speak, and can't control bladder function, weight loss often becomes a concern
*Disease usually progresses slowly over a 15-20 year period after which death occurs

==What Causes Huntington Disease?==
*In order to understand what causes HD and to understand the testing for HD it is helpful to review some genetics
*Review chromosomes, genes, DNA, nucleotides
*Gene IT-15 (discovered in 1993)
**located on chromosome 4
**area in the gene where there are tri-nucleotide repeats
**Most individuals have between 9 and 26 repeats
**Alleles of 27-35 CAG repeats are considered intermediate alleles. A person with an allele in the intermediate range do not develop HD, but they may have children with HD if the number of repeats increases when the gene is passed on
**An allele in the range of 36-41 is associated with reduced penetrance for symptomatic HD (they may or may not develop symptoms of HD)
*The HD gene produces a protein (Huntingtin)
**widely expressed
**function unknown
**CAG expansion causes altered structural and biochemical properties
**The protein has been shown to accumulate in neurons within the brain
**Uncertain if this accumulation is what causes symptoms
*Inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and the age of onset
**Patients with adult onset of symptoms usually have an expansion that ranges from 40-55 CAG repeats
**Patients with juvenile onset of symptoms usually have expansions about 60 repeats
**Repeat length does not correlate with any other clinical feature, exact age of onset, or rate of progression

==Inheritance==
*AD inheritance
**Homozygotes are no more severely affected clinically than heterozygotes
*Offspring of an individual with a mutant allele have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation
*Approximately 3% of individuals with HD have no family history of condition
*Reasons family history may be negative
**Alternate paternity
**Adoption
**Early death of a parent
**Failure to recognize symptoms or misdiagnosis
**Late age of onset in a parent
**Presence of intermediate allele or reduced penetrance allele in a parent
**New mutations are rare
*Genetic anticipation
**Disease severity or decreasing age of onset can occur in successive generations
**Anticipation occurs more commonly in paternal transmission of the mutated allele
**The risk of expansion of intermediate allele into the disease range is about 2.5% when transmitted by the father
**This phenomenon arises from instability of the CAG repeat during spermatogenesis
**Large expansions in CAG repeat size occur almost exclusively through paternal transmission

==Diagnostic Testing==
*Diagnosis of HD rests on a positive family history, characteristic clinical findings, and molecular DNA testing the reveals an expansion of the CAG repeat in the HD gene
*Imaging studies including MRI, CT, SPECT, and PET may provide additional support for the clinical diagnosis. (used mainly to determine whether other conditions are contributing to the neurologic dysfunction)

==Direct DNA testing==
*Blood test
*Measures number of CAG repeats
*98.8% sensitive, 100% specificity
*Sometimes results are uninformative, but if CAG repeat is within the normal range likely that your symptoms are due to a different neurodegenerative disorder
*Cost of testing is approximately $270
*Insurance - already symptomatic

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Probably beyond initial reaction to diagnosis of progressive neurodegenerative disorder
*Encourage to carry on normally as long as possible
*Others with HD have said it helps to try and live in the moment
*Families should expect to deal with a variety of emotions
*Realizing that this may be genetic and if children will inherit it
*Watching things you used to do slowly slip away
*Family members having to watch as loved one slowly looses their motor and cognitive skills
*Moodiness, aggressiveness, emotional outbursts can be difficult for caregiver
*Plans and potential concerns for the future
***How are you coping with the likelihood that you will have to eventually give up work
***Legal, financial, health insurance
***Being dependent on others
***Caregivers having time for themselves (not being selfish)
*What have you told other family members?
*How is the rest of the family reacting?
***Do they know it could be genetic?
***Different family members react differently based on their personalities, fears, and types of coping strategies
*If testing were to come back showing you have HD how do you think you will react?
*Would this be different if it came back showing you don't have HD
*If positive for HD there is a support group
*Don't be too reassuring, but provide hope that a lot of research is ongoing to try and understand the disease better
*HD can provide challenges to family relationships
***Roles and family dynamics may change
***Have you come across any of these challenges
***How have you dealt with problems in the past
***Changes in sexual activity

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Differential diagnosis include other conditions that involve chorea, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances
*Many non-inherited conditions are associated with chorea
*These include tardive dyskinesia, thyrotoxicosis, cerebrovascular disease, cerebral lupus, and polycythemia
*Usually be excluded by other clinical features in a patient with suspected HD
*Neuroancanthocytosis -- considered if muscle wasting, absent lower limb tendon reflexes, and signs of neuropathy are present
*Benign hereditary chorea usually presents with nonprogressive chorea without dementia
*Creutzfeld-Jakob disease progresses more rapidly then HD and has myoclonus as a prominent involuntary movement
*For children, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and other metabolic diseases must be excluded when there is no known family history of HD
*SCA

==Management==
*Limited to symptomatic treatment
**Choreic movements can be partially suppressed by neuroleptics
**Anti-Parkinsonian agents may ameliorate hypokinesia and rigidity
**Psychiatric disturbances such as depression, psychotic symptom, and outbursts of aggression may respond well to psychotropic drugs
*Cognitive impairment is not amenable to treatment
*There is no effective therapy to slow down disease progression

==Reproductive Options==
*There are alternative reproductive options for those not wishing to risk transmitting the disorder to offspring
**Prenatal testing is possible using DNA that has been extracted via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
**Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is also available. This technology uses in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce embryos, which are tested for the HD mutation. Only embryos without the CAG expansion are implanted into the uterus.
***You can have this procedure done without knowing if you actually carry the mutation
***Consider cost per IVF cycle and success rates

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hypoplasia - Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum'''

==Definition== 
*underdevelopment (hypoplasia) complete absence (agenesis) of the CC

==Corpus collosum==
*The area of the brain (large fiber tract) which permits the exchange of information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
*&quot;the seat of the soul&quot;. Used to be that the thickness of its body was related to the level of intelligence.
*Function is uncertain because there is no consistent pattern when it is malformed or absent.
*Embryology: forms between 9-16 weeks of development. anterior to posterior.

==Incidence==
rare; no specific numbers

==Diagnosis==
*ACC is usually diagnosed between 0-2 years (by MRI or CT scan) but may never be dx.
*May occur as severe syndrome, a milder condition, or an asymptomatic finding
*Signs and Symptoms:
**Seizures (infantile spasms)
**Feeding problems
**Delays in holding head erect, sitting, standing and walking
**microcephaly

==Possible clinical impairments==
*Deficit or delay in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination and/or visual and auditory memory
*Could also include: hydrocephaly, seizures, dyskinesia, repetitive speech, headaches

==Etiology==
*Most are isolated/sporadic
*Males and females equally affected
*May be caused by a genetic syndrome such as:
**Aicardi's syndrome: ACC, infantile spasms, severe mental retardation and chorioretinal lacunae
**Grubben syndrome
**Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome: chromosome abnormality
**Opitz-Frias syndrome
**Joubert syndrome
**X-linked syndromes: Bertini, Opitz-Kaveggia, Orofaciodigital, Proud, Pyruvatedehydrogenase
*May be associated with other cerebral anomalies such as Arnold-Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, Andermann syndrome, schizencephaly, holoprosencephaly and migrational anomalies
*Sometimes associated with complex multi-system anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 13 and 18).

==Management==
*No specific treatment. May involve managing treatment of other conditions such as hydrocephaly and seizures if they occur

==Prognosis==
*Excellent in most isolated cases
*Does not cause death in vast majority
*Many will lead normal lives and have average intelligence
*Children w/ ACC and DD and/ or seizures should be screened for metabolic disorders.
*Mental retardation is not progressive

**Congenital -- hypotonia, severe generalized weakness at birth, often have respiratory problems and early death, MR common
**Testing
***DNA analysis is 100% sensitive
****detects an expansion of the CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene (19q13)
***&gt; 37 repeats is abnormal
***&gt; 50 repeats are symptomatic
***&gt; 1000 repeats often seen in congenital type
*Cerebellar Ataxia
**most types have onset in adulthood
**Spinocerebellar Ataxia 7 -- failure to thrive and loss of motor milestones, loss of vision
**Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 -- common initial symptoms are scanning dysarthria with a characteristic drawn-out slowness of speech and gait instability, hyperactive tendon reflexes
***onset can be as early as one year old
***Testing -- CTA/CTG expansion in the SCA8 gene (13q21) can be detected via DNA analysis
*Aicardi syndrome
**X-linked dominant inheritance
**characterized by the partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum (the structure that links the 2 hemispheres of the brain), infantile spasms, mental retardation, and an ocular abnormality called lacunae (lesions) of the retina of the eyes
**may be associated with other brain defects such as microcephaly or porencephalic cysts (cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities or gaps in the brain)
**onset generally begins between the ages of 3 and 5 months
*Myasthenia gravis (familial infantile)
**autosomal recessive
**characterized by respiratory and feeding difficulties in an infant
**absence or weakness of the ocular muscles is also characteristic
*Familial Dysautonomia
**characteristics include lack of tearing, emotional lability, paroxysmal hypertension, increased sweating, cold hands and feet, corneal anesthesia, erythematous blotching of the skin, and drooling
**the absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue is also characteristic
**scoliosis is often severe and neuropathic joints of the Charcot type may develop
**Ashkenazi-Jewish heritage is common

== Differences between Data Connect and MEdia Net ==

* [http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/plans/dataconnect.jsp Data Connect] uses AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles (settings) to provide standard Internet connections with AT&amp;T as the ISP (Internet Service Provider). Connections can be configured with or without [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] (which significantly boosts throughput by means of image compression [which reduces image quality], caching, and transport optimization). Data Connect is more expensive than MEdia (as of this writing).

* [http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/messaging-internet/media-entertainment/media-net.jsp MEdia Net] uses the AT&amp;T WAP profile (settings) to support most types of Internet access (''e.g.,'' HTTP [Web browsing], SMTP/POP3/IMAP Email, FTP, Telnet, SSH, SSL). However, not all protocols seem to be fully supported, so problems may be seen with such things as VPN, and [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] is not available. Note that MEdia will not work with AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles. MEdia is less expensive than Data Connect (as of this writing).

== Handset (Phone) Configuration ==

If WAP isn't already working on the handset, the handset and SIM must first be configured for AT&amp;T WAP:

* This is best accomplished by asking AT&amp;T Support (dial 611) to &quot;push&quot; WAP settings to the handset (normally done automatically by SMS when a WAP package [''e.g.,'' MEdia] is added to the account).
       
* Alternative: [http://onlinecare.cingular.com/device-support/index.do Cingular On-line Phone &amp; Device Support]&lt;br&gt;Select your Network, and handset Manufacturer and Model (or a similar device) to access Device Setup.

* Another alternative (untested), for Sony Ericsson devices, is to use the ''Configurator'' on the [http://www.sonyericsson.com/ Sony Ericsson website]. Select ''Configurators'', Phone model, ''WAP Read more'', and then follow the prompts. (Email and MMS can also be configured this way.)  

This configuration is sufficient for WAP and/or Web browsing with the handset alone. It's also sufficient for Email given an Email client in the handset that has been properly configured (including selection of the WAP profile for connections).

=== Using Windows XP Dial-Up Networking ===

* '''Create a handset modem entry.''' If your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) created a modem entry for your handset (''e.g.,'' Standard Modem over Bluetooth link), then you can skip to next major step (Create DUN connection); otherwise:
** Obtain the latest handset modem driver. 
** Make sure your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) is installed properly, and note the COM port assigned. Make sure the handset is connected and powered on.
** Use ''Control Panel'' &amp;rarr; ''Modem'' to Add the handset modem. Windows should detect the modem, and then search for the best driver. When it does, give Windows the location of the modem driver, and complete the installation. (If auto-detection fails, try to Add the modem manually using the appropriate COM port with the driver.)

Use the Wireless Manager to connect your computer to the Internet.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Email ===

* The usual problem when sending email from a handset with SMTP capability is the outgoing SMTP server. Thanks to spammers, outgoing SMTP servers now generally require some form of '''authentication''' when you're off the provider's network. You should be able to find out what kind(s) of authentication are supported by contacting the email provider (''e.g.,'' your ISP). Finding out what your handset supports may be a bigger challenge -- documentation is often woefully inadequate in this area.

* If the email provider supports '''POP3 before SMTP authentication''', then you need to find a way to have the handset do a POP3 check or download before sending mail.

* Some handsets (''e.g.,'' Sony Ericsson Z600) now have support for SMTP-AUTH (Authenticated SMTP, different from POP3 before SMTP). For this to work, you usually need to configure the handset with a valid mailbox id and password for the email provider.

* On the AT&amp;T network you can use '''cwmx.com''' (preferred, no footer added) or '''photo.mycingular.com''' (adds a photo messaging footer) as an outgoing SMTP server. Since you're authenticated by being on the AT&amp;T network, no further authentication is required.

=== Speed ===

* Handsets and PC Cards do not all have the same data performance -- maximum speeds are limited by GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE Multislot Class (and the carrier). In general, all reasonably recent GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE-capable devices from Ericsson and Sony Ericsson support Class 8 (4+1) and Class 10 (4+2, max of 5), whereas most Nokia devices (as of this writing) are limited to slower Class 4 (3+1) and Class 6 (3+2, max 4). Motorola has both Class 4 and Class 8 devices. (The first number is the maximum number of downlink slots, and the number after the &quot;+&quot; is the maximum number of uplink slots.) This can translate into a substantial difference in throughput -- if supported by the carrier, Class 8 is 33% faster on downlink than Class 4.

* Connections between handsets and &quot;tethered&quot; devices (''e.g.,'' notebook computer, PDA) are typically implemented as a serial port, either real or virtual, and port speed usually defaults to 115 Kbps. (Bluetooth is typically implemented on a computer as a virtual serial port that will go as fast as 921.6 Kbps, but which runs at only 115.2 Kbps by default.) While 115 Kbps is generally fast enough for GPRS, it can be a bottleneck for EGPRS(EDGE) (as well as UMTS/HSDPA). In general, port speed should be at least 230 Kbps for GPRS and 460 Kbps for EGPRS(EDGE) (920 Kbps for UMTS/HSDPA).

=== WAP ===

* WAP as built into many handsets is much more limited than standard HTTP -- much of the Internet (World Wide Web) cannot be accessed through WAP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">JIT (Just in Time) production concepts originated with the Japanese.  JIT is a philosophy focusing on the elimination of waste in and management or production system. This waste can be in any form, waste materials, wasted effort, lost time though inefficient processes, etc.. One area where waste is eliminated is in the movement of work in process in a manufacturing system where material is pulled through by demand from the next step in the process, thus production is limited to the needs of the next step or internal customer in the system. The technique called KANBAN is run by using a series of signals which tell production when to reorder inventory. This historically can be as simple as a product missing from the shelf or an empty container or can be signalled by use of a card or indicator. 

JIT was first developed by Toyota, but is now in used in most manufacturing industry.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font: 2em sans-serif;padding;1em&quot;&gt;Reflexion: Building custom attributes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Annexes: Building custom attributes ==

''Original text for this page authored by [[User:Scott98390|William &quot;Scott&quot; Baker]]''

=== Attributes Summary ===
''Attributes'' are a way to &quot;tag&quot; elements of your code's metadata with descriptive information that can be accessed at runtime using reflection.  Attributes must derive from '''System.Attribute''', either directly or indirectly.  A multitude of attributes exist in the .NET framework; you can also define your own.  There are three aspects to using attributes in your code:
#Defining a custom attribute class, which involves:
##Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to your class. 
##Writing the code to define your custom attribute class.
##Creating the parameters for your class.
#Assigning an attribute to a code member.
#Retrieving attribute information at runtime.

=== Creating a Custom Attribute Class ===
As previously mentioned, there are several predefined attributes in the .NET Framework; you may have already used them in your code.  The XML parser in particular relies heavily on attributes when (de)serializing objects.  You can also define your own custom attributes, as we will show here.  Defining a custom attribute involves three steps:
#Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to your class. 
#Writing the code to define your custom attribute class.
#Creating the parameters for your class.
==== Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;AttributeUsageAttribute&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; To Your Class ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;The &quot;scope&quot; and other characteristics of your attribute should be specified by the use of the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.  &lt;br&gt;'''Note:'''  In Visual Basic, use of the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is ''required'' on all custom attributes.  Applying the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to a class:
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;[&lt;font color=red&gt;AttributeUsage&lt;/font&gt;(AttributeTargets.All, AllowMultiple = true, Inherited = false)]&lt;/font&gt;
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : '''System.Attribute''' 
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
Notice the use of &quot;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsage&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  By convention, all attributes are named with the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Attribute&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; suffix - but the suffix can be omitted when used in code.  This holds true for user defined attributes as well; the &lt;tt&gt;QualityCheckAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute could be referenced as either: 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;[QualityCheck] &lt;font color=green&gt;// or... &lt;/font&gt;
 [QualityCheckAttribute]&lt;/font&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; has three members: &lt;tt&gt;''ValidOn, AllowMultiple''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''Inherited''&lt;/tt&gt;.  

* The &lt;tt&gt;ValidOn&lt;/tt&gt; member accepts &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets&lt;/tt&gt; enum values, and restricts your attribute to the code types you specify. The default value is &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets.All&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can confine your attribute to classes, enums, return values or any of the list below:
 All (''any element'')   Delegate    GenericParameter    Parameter
 Assembly            Enum        Interface           Property
 Class               Event       Method              ReturnValue
 Constructor         Field       Module*             Struct
 
 ''*Module'' refers to a portable executable (''.exe'' or ''.dll''), and not a Visual Basic standard module.
You can also combine target types as a bitwise OR operation to specify multiple acceptable values:
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method)]
* &lt;tt&gt;AllowMultiple&lt;/tt&gt; is a boolean value that determines whether or not an attribute can be applied more than once to a given member.  The default value is &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.  The example below illustrates multiple instances of the same attribute on an element of code:
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Scott Baker&quot;, &quot;02/28/06&quot;, IsApproved = true,
    Comment = &quot;This code follows all established guidelines.  Release approved.&quot;)]
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Matt Kauffman&quot;, &quot;01/15/06&quot;, IsApproved = false,
    Comment = &quot;Code quality much improved. Minor revision required.&quot;)]
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Joe Schmoe&quot;, 01/01/06&quot;, IsApproved = false,
    Comment = &quot;This code is a mess and needs a complete rewrite&quot;)]
 public class MyClass
 {
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
* The &lt;tt&gt;Inherited&lt;/tt&gt; member determines whether attributes set on a class will be inherited by classes further down the inheritance tree.  The default value is '''true''':
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
 public class AttrOneAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// This attribute will not be inherited &lt;/font&gt;
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Inherited = false&lt;/font&gt;)]
 public class AttrTwoAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 [AttrOne]
 [AttrTwo]
 public class ClassOne 
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// This class inherits AttrOne from ClassOne, 
 // but not AttrTwo &lt;/font&gt;
 public class ClassTwo : ClassOne
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Defining A Custom Attribute Class ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;
* Attributes are classes that inherit from &lt;tt&gt;System.Attribute&lt;/tt&gt;, either directly or indirectly:
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : '''System.Attribute''' &lt;font color=green&gt;// direct &lt;/font&gt;
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 public Class FinalCheck : QualityCheckAttribute  &lt;font color=green&gt;// indirect &lt;/font&gt;
 {
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
* Attribute classes have the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute:
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;[AttributeUsage(AllowMultiple = true, Inherited = false)]&lt;/font&gt;
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : System.Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
''As previously mentioned, the use of &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; is required in VB.  In C#, it is automatically applied with the default values if not declared.''
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Creating Parameters For An Attribute ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Attributes accept two types of parameters:  ''positional'' and ''named''.  Positional parameters are defined by public constructors in your class, must be in the order defined and are ''required''; named parameters are defined by public properties, can be in any order and are optional.

===== Positional Parameters =====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Positional parameters for an attribute are defined by the constructors in the class.  As with any class, constructors can be overloaded and a default constructor that takes no parameters can be defined.  As with any other class, the signature of the positional parameters must match the signature of a constructor in the attribute class:
 public class QualityCheckAttribute : Attribute
 {
   public QualityCheckAttribute(string Name, string Date)
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
&lt;/div&gt;
===== Named Parameters =====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Named parameters for an attribute are defined by public properties defined in the class.  Named parameters are optional and are declared ''after'' any positional parameters.  The &lt;tt&gt;IsApproved&lt;/tt&gt; property demonstrates a named parameter:
 public class QualityCheckAttribute : Attribute
 {
   private string _name;
   private string _date;
   private bool isApproved;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;public bool IsApproved
   {
     get {return isApproved;}
     set {isApproved = value;}
   }&lt;/font&gt;
   public QualityCheckAttribute(string Name, string Date)
   {
     &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
   }
 }

Keep in mind that a variable in your code can be ''both'' a positional parameter ''and'' a named parameter.  If we were to add public properties for the &lt;code&gt;_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_date&lt;/code&gt; fields we could use them either as named parameters or positional parameters.  Of course, this is not a recommended practice:  required parameters should be positional and optional parameters should be named.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Assigning An Attribute To A Code Member ===
You have already seen examples of assigning an attribute to a code member.  However, there are some points that must be clarified.  
*''Disambiguation'' is the clarification of the use of an attribute on a code member.  
*''Syntax'' - there is more than one way to apply multiple attributes.

==== Disambiguation ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;The code below isn't clear as to whether &lt;tt&gt;SomeAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; applies to the method &lt;tt&gt;MyMethod&lt;/tt&gt; or to its &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; value:
 public class MyAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;[SomeAttribute(&quot;Hello&quot;)]&lt;/font&gt;
   public string MyMethod(aString)
   {
     return aString;
   }
 }
Disambiguation resolves these issues.  By specifying the code type the attribute is applied to, we are able to resolve the confusion.  The code below shows that the attribute applies to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; value:
 public class MyAttribute : Attribute
 {
   [&lt;font color=blue&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; : SomeAttribute]
   public string MyMethod(aString)
   {
     return aString;
   }
 }
The table below lists all declarations where attributes are allowed; for each declaration, the possible targets for attributes on the declaration are listed in the second column. Targets in bold are the defaults.
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Declaration               Possible targets'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
 assembly                  '''assembly'''
 module                    '''module'''
 class                     '''type'''
 struct                    '''type'''
 interface                 '''type'''
 enum                      '''type'''
 delegate                  '''type''', return
 method                    '''method''', return
 parameter                 '''param'''
 field                     '''field'''
 property — indexer        '''property'''
 property — get accessor   '''method''', return
 property — set accessor   '''method''', param, return
 event — field             '''event''', field, method
 event — property          '''event''', property
 event — add               '''method''', param
 event — remove            '''method''', param
 
 *''Reference: [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3787ac0(VS.80).aspx Disambiguating Attribute Targets (C# Programming Guide)]''
One would think that the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute's AttributeTargets&lt;/tt&gt; in an attribute's definition would help to prevent this confusion:  one would be wrong.  The compiler does not use the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; information when resolving conflicts.  Even if you define an attribute to apply only to a specific type, for instance &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets.Return&lt;/tt&gt;, you must still clarify that it applies to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; type when applying the attribute or the compiler will use the default target &lt;tt&gt;method&lt;/tt&gt; type, and throw an error.
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Syntax: Applying Multiple Attributes ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;When applying more than one attribute to a member, there are two ways to do so:
 [AttrOne(...), AttrTwo(...)]  
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// or...&lt;/font&gt;
 [AttrOne(...)]
 [AttrTwo(...)]
The two are equivalent.  Keep in mind that if you are going to specify more than one attribute in a single brace, they must apply to the same target type.  If not, you must give each type a separate declaration:
 [return : AttrOne(...), method : AttrTwo(...)]  &lt;font color=red&gt;// &lt;-- invalid!&lt;/font&gt;
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// instead, you must...&lt;/font&gt;
 [return : AttrOne(...)]
 [method : AttrTwo(...)]
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Retrieving Attribute Information At Runtime ===
Being able to declare and apply attributes is not very helpful unless we can retrieve that data and do something with it.  Fortunately, its a straightforward process.  There are three basic scenarios that will be addressed:
#Retrieve a single attribute from a member.
#Retrieve multiple attributes from a member.
#Retrieve attributes of a single type from multiple members.
==== Retrieving A Single Attribute From A Member ====
To access attribute information:
#Declare an instance of the attribute type.
#Use the &lt;tt&gt;Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(''type'', ''typeof'') method to read the attribute into the instance.
#Use the properties of the instance to read the values.
The example code below declares a class &lt;tt&gt;ExampleClass&lt;/tt&gt; with a &lt;tt&gt;QualityCheck&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. The &lt;tt&gt;GetSingleAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method accepts a target member type and the type of attribute you're looking for. The &lt;tt&gt;Attribute.GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method retrieves the attribute information into the &lt;tt&gt;attr&lt;/tt&gt; object, from which we can read the all-important &lt;tt&gt;IsApproved&lt;/tt&gt; property:
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Scott Baker&quot;, &quot;02/04/2006&quot;, IsApproved = false)]
 public class ExampleClass
 {
 
   public static void Main()
   {
     GetSingleAttribute(typeof(ExampleClass), typeof(QualityCheck))
   }
  
   public static void GetSingleAttribute(Type targetType, Type attrType)
   {
     typeof(attrType) attr = (attrType)Attribute.&lt;font color=blue&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/font&gt;(targetType, typeof(attrType));
   
     if (attr == null)
     { &lt;font color=green&gt;//...&lt;/font&gt; }
     else
     {
       Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
     }
   }

An important factor to keep in mind is that the &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method is designed to read '''one and only one''' attribute.  &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; actually checks to see if more than one attribute matches - if there is no match it returns &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, but if there is more than one match it will throw an &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AmbiguousMatchException&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. When checking for attributes the only time it is safe to use &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; is when the attribute's definition states &lt;tt&gt;[AttributeUsage(AllowMultiple=&lt;font color=blue&gt;false&lt;/font&gt;)]&lt;/tt&gt;.
==== Retrieving Multiple Attributes From A Member ====
Reading multiple instances of an attribute on a member isn't much different than reading one; to read multiple attributes use the plural &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttributes&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns an array of attributes.  You can then iterate through the resultant array and read the values:

 QualityCheck[] attrArray = (QualityCheck[])Attribute.GetCustomAttributes(t, typeof(QualityCheck));
 
 foreach (QualityCheck attr in attrArray)
 {
   Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
 }
==== Retrieving A Single Attribute Type From Multiple Members ====
What if you want to do something a little more complex, like checking each method in a class for a QualityCheck attribute?  Thanks to the &lt;tt&gt;System.Reflection&lt;/tt&gt; namespace, we don't have to even break a sweat.  Simply read all the members (methods, in this instance) into a &lt;tt&gt;MemberInfo&lt;/tt&gt; array and iterate through them:
 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;using System.Reflection&lt;/font&gt;
 
 public class ExampleClass
 {
   public static void Main()
   {
     RetrieveAttributes(typeof(ExampleClass));
   }
 
   public void RetrieveAttributes(Type t)
   {
     MemberInfo[] methodList = t.GetMethods();
     foreach (MemberInfo m in methodList)
     {
       QualityCheck[] attrArray = (QualityCheck[])Attribute.GetCustomAttributes(m, typeof(QualityCheck));
       foreach (QualityCheck attr in attrArray)
       {
         Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
       }
     }
   }
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by C. S. Lewis. They present the adventures of children who play central roles in the unfolding history of the realm of Narnia, a place where some animals talk, magic is common, and good is fighting evil. The stories illustrate aspects of Christianity in a way that is accessible to younger children.

Pauline Baynes illustrated the original books in the series.

This page will try to discuss some of the different, important terminology, and it may even contain a listing of some of the acronyms used in this book.

== Types of Chips ==

There are a number of different types of chips that we will discuss here.

;Microprocessors: These chips contain a processing core, and occasionally a few integrated peripherals. In a different sense, Microprocessors are simply CPUs found in desktops.
;Microcontrollers: These chips are all-in-one computer chips. They contain a processing core, memory, and integrated peripherals. In a broader sense, a microcontroller is a CPU that is used in an embedded system.
;Digital Signal Processor (DSP): DSPs are the &quot;best of the best&quot; when it comes to processing signals. DSPs frequently run very quickly, and have immense processing power (for an embedded chip). Digital Signal Processors, and the field of Digital Signal Processing is so large and involved, that it warrants its own book -- [[Digital Signal Processing]].

== Grades of Microcontrollers ==

Microcontrollers can be divided up into different categories, depending on several parameters such as bus-width (8 bit, 16 bit, etc...), amount of memory, speed, and the number of I/O pins:

;Low-end: Low-end chips are frequently used in simple situations, where speed and power are not a factor. Low-end chips are the cheapest of the bunch, and can usually cost ''less than a dollar'', depending on the quantity in which they are purchased. Low-end chips rarely have many I/O pins (4 or 8, total), and rarely have any special capabilities. Almost all low-end chips are 8 bits or smaller.
;Mid-level chips:mid-level chips are the &quot;basic&quot; microcontroller units. They don't suffer from the drawbacks of the low-end chips, but at the same time they are more expensive and larger. Mid-level chips are 8 bits or 16 bits wide, and frequently have a number of available I/O pins to play with. Mid-level chips may come with ADC, voltage regulators, OpAmps, etc... Mid-level chips can cost anywhere between $1 and $10 for reasonable chips.
;High-end chips:High end chips are used in situations where power and speed are a must, but a conventional microprocessor board (think a computer motherboard) is too large or expensive. High-end chips will have a number of fancy features, more available memory, and a larger addressable memory range. High end chips can come in 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit or even 64 bit, and can cost anywhere between $10 to $100 each.

== Acronyms ==

This will be a functional list of most of the acronyms used in this book

;ADC: ADC stands for '''Analog to Digital Converter'''. ADCs are also written as &quot;A/D&quot; or &quot;A2D&quot; in other literature.
;DAC: The exact opposite of an ADC, a DAC stands for '''Digital to Analog Converter'''. May also be called &quot;D/A&quot; or &quot;D2A&quot;
;RAM: '''Random-Access Memory'''. RAM is the memory that a microcontroller uses to store information when the power is on. When the power goes off, RAM is erased.
;ROM: '''Read-Only Memory''', ROM is memory that can be read, but it can't be written or erased. ROM is cheaper than RAM, and it doesnt lose its information when the power is turned off.
;OTP: OTP means '''One-Time Programmable'''. OTP chips can be programmed once, and only once, usually by a physical process or burning extra wires inside the chip. If an OTP chip is programmed incorrectly, it can't be fixed, so be careful with them.

== Downloading ==

In this book, the terms &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;flashing&quot;, &quot;installing&quot;, or &quot;downloading&quot; all mean the same thing -- the (semi-)automated process of putting the executable image into the non-volatile memory of the embedded system.

After a person tweaks the source code and compiles a new executable image on the PC, that person connects a downloader between the PC and the embedded system, and clicks the &quot;go&quot; button. Then the PC streams the image into the downloader, and the downloader burns the image into the embedded system.

A downloader is variously called a &quot;downloader&quot;, &quot;burner&quot;, &quot;flasher&quot;, &quot;flash downloader&quot;, &quot;programming interface&quot;, or -- confusingly -- a &quot;programmer&quot;.

* [[Embedded_Systems/PIC_Microcontroller#downloaders]]
* [[Embedded_Systems/Atmel_AVR#Programming_Interfaces]]

== Programming ==

There are many similarities between a desktop PC and an embedded system, including the terminology used. Unfortunately some terms have wildly different meanings when used in each of these domains. The word &quot;programming&quot; is one such term. 

In the desktop PC world, &quot;programming&quot; means the overall process of a person writing software on a PC, going through many edit-compile-test cycles, to create an executable image. The ''person'' accomplishing this task is called the &quot;programmer&quot;. 


For embedded systems the word &quot;programming&quot; usually means the specific steps for transferring the executable image to the device ('installing' in PC terms). The &quot;programmer&quot; is a ''device'' for burning the compiled code into the chip. 
The ''person'' that writes the code for the device is generally called the ''developer''.

In this book, we use the term &quot;programming&quot; to describe what a human being does to create and test software source code.

Be aware that other texts may use the term &quot;programming&quot; -- such as when talking about &quot;high-voltage programming&quot;, &quot;gang programming&quot;, etc. -- to describe what we would call &quot;installing&quot;.

Texts that talk about &quot;C++ programming&quot;, &quot;assembly programming&quot;, &quot;pair programming&quot; etc. -- use &quot;programming&quot; the same way we do.
&quot;C++ programmer&quot;, &quot;Python programmer&quot;, &quot;pair programmer&quot;, etc. refer to human beings that do the programming.

== Further reading ==

* We mentioned [[Electronics/Op-Amps | op amps]]. A long time ago, &quot;analog computers&quot; were once built entirely out of such operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. Today most embedded systems have few, if any op-amps -- they are still useful for some sensor signal amplifiers, anti-aliasing filters before the ADC, anti-aliasing filters after the DAC, and a few op-amps embedded in power supply circuits.</text>

I'm guessing the answer would be &quot;kind of.&quot; The queen's English doesn't have an infix, but I have seen that in US vernacular (see the article on expletive infixation; linguistics is concerned with descriptive grammar as well as prescriptive grammar). 
Other languages do have it in their prescriptive form; Tagalog is commonly cited as an example (see [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryofLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInfix.htm this SIL site]).--[[User:RMann|RMann]] 22:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Da404lewzer. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Da404lewzer~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:Hello World|Hello World]] was seen as early as 1974 in [[wikipedia:Bell Labs|Bell Laboratorie's]] internal memorandum by Kernighan &amp;mdash;''Programming in C: A Tutorial''&amp;mdash; which shows the first known version of the program:
 main( ) {
     printf(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 }

In this tutorial we will use one [[wikipedia:variable|variable]] named '''message''' to display a [[wikipedia:String_literal|string]] of text.

== Putting it Together ==
These files should always be created using a program that doesn't include formating, and saves to a non-rich text format such as  '''notepad.exe (Win32)''', '''Pico (Command line)''', '''Kedit (KDE)''', or '''Gedit (GNOME)'''.

'''PHP:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 &lt;?php
  $message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
  echo $message;
 ?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ColdFusion:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 
  &lt;cfset message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cfoutput&gt;#message#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
 

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Line Breakdown ==
This is a very simple example because they both do the same thing, in the same amount of code. Not too hard so far eh? Lets see what actually makes them tick...

'''PHP:'''
 '''07''' &lt;?php
 '''08'''  $message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
 '''09'''  echo $message;
 '''10''' ?&gt;

 '''Line#07 &lt;?php''' Starts allowing php code to be parsed
 '''Line#08''' Stores '''$message''' with the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#09 echo''' Dumps the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#10 ?&gt;''' Ends php

'''ColdFusion:'''
 '''07''' &lt;cfoutput&gt;
 '''08'''   &lt;cfset message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;
 '''09'''   #message#
 '''10'''  &lt;/cfoutput&gt;

 '''Line#07 &lt;cfoutput&gt;''' Starts the ability to output to the browser
 '''Line#08 &lt;cfset''' Stores '''#message#''' with the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#09 #message#''' Dumps the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#10 &lt;/cfoutput&gt;''' End the ability to output to the browser

== What the Browser Sees ==
Either way, these two scripts produce the '''same exact''' page, the only thing different are the [[wikipedia:HTTP#Sample|server headers]].
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

Hello World!

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
== Displayed in Browser ==
 Hello World!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Inserting Variables ==
Both languages allow you to insert variables at any point. This is very useful if you have many lines of HTML, but only need to insert something simple. We will use the variable we created above.

'''PHP:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Message holds: &lt;?=$message; ?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
(Note: This will ''not'' work in php if [http://www.php.net/ini.core#ini.short-open-tag short open tags] are disabled. This was enabled by default as of php 4.0.0)

'''ColdFusion:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Message holds: &lt;cfoutput&gt;#message#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
(Note: It is considered poor form in CFML to place &lt;cfoutput&gt; tags at the beginning and end of a page, as the parser must evaluate every word for variables).

Both examples will print: ''Message holds: Hello World!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">When it comes to web design, many languages exist to create the structure for web-based applications. We will be comparing the languages [[wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] and [[wikipedia:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]].

PHP and ColdFusion are both created to help design web pages scripted in [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]]. Alone, HTML cannot create dynamic content, connect to databases to perform queries, manipulate files or handle form data. This is where PHP and ColdFusion come in. The code between these languages may be completely different, however both have thousands of different functions that let you do everything from data encryption to image editing. We will be showing code examples between the two.

This section will guide you through the formatting techniques of the text. ''Formatting'' tends to refer to most things to do with appearance, so it makes the list of possible topics quite eclectic: text style, spacing, etc. If ''formatting'' may also refer to paragraphs and to the page layout, we will focus on the customization of words and sentences for now.

A lot of formatting techniques are required to differentiate certain elements from the rest of the text. It is often necessary to add emphasis to key words or phrases. ''Footnotes'' are useful for providing extra information or clarification without interrupting the main flow of text. So, for these reasons, formatting is very important. However, it is also very easy to abuse, and a document that has been over-done can look and read worse than one with none at all.

LaTeX is so flexible that we will actually only skim the surface, as you can have much more control over the presentation of your document if you wish. Having said that, one of the purposes of LaTeX is to take away the stress of having to deal with the physical presentation yourself, so you need not get too carried away!

==Spacing==

===Line Spacing===

If you want to use larger inter-line spacing in a document, you can change its value by putting the
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\linespread{factor}
}}

command into the preamble of your document. Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linespread{1.3}&lt;!----&gt;}} for &quot;one and a half&quot; line spacing, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linespread{1.6}&lt;!----&gt;}} for &quot;double&quot; line spacing. Normally the lines are not spread, so the default line spread factor is 1. This may not be ideal in all situations: see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/30073/why-is-the-linespread-factor-as-it-is .

The {{LaTeX/Package|setspace}} package allows more fine-grained control over line spacing. To set &quot;one and a half&quot; line spacing document-wide, but not where it is usually unnecessary (e.g. footnotes, captions):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing
%\setstretch{1.1}
}}

To change line spacing within the document, the &lt;tt&gt;setspace&lt;/tt&gt; package provides the environments &lt;tt&gt;singlespace&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;onehalfspace&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;doublespace&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;spacing&lt;/tt&gt;:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
This paragraph has \\ default \\ line spacing.
 
\begin{doublespace}
  This paragraph has \\ double \\ line spacing.
\end{doublespace}
 
\begin{spacing}{2.5}
  This paragraph has \\ huge gaps \\ between lines.
\end{spacing}
}}

{{Warning|The line spacing value is contained in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\baselineskip&lt;!----&gt;}} [[LaTeX/Lengths|length]], but it is not recommended to change its value since it will have an impact on other types of content than paragraphs, which will result in an undesired effect.}}

===Non-breaking spaces===

This ''essential'' feature is a bit unknown to newcomers, although it is available on most WYSIWYG document processors. A non-breaking space between two tokens (e.g. words, punctuation marks) prevents the processors from inserting a line break between them. Besides a non-breaking space cannot be enlarged. It is very important for a consistent reading.

LaTeX uses the '~' symbol as a non-breaking space.
You would  usually use non-breaking spaces for punctuation marks in some languages, for units and currencies, for initials, etc.
In French typography, you would put a non-breaking space before all two-parts punctuation marks.

Examples:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
D.~\textsc{Knuth}
50~€
}}

===Space between words and sentences ===

To get a straight right margin in the output, LaTeX inserts varying amounts of space between the words. By default, it also inserts slightly more space at the end of a sentence. However, the extra space added at the end of sentences is generally considered typographically old-fashioned in English language printing. (The practice is found in nineteenth century design and in twentieth century typewriter styles.) Most modern typesetters treat the end of sentence space the same as the interword space. (See for example, Bringhurst's ''Elements of Typographic Style''.) The additional space after periods can be disabled with the command

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\frenchspacing
}}

which tells LaTeX not to insert more space after a period than after ordinary character. Frenchspacing can be turned off later in your document via the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nonfrenchspacing&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

If an author wishes to use the wider end-of-sentence spacing, care must be exercised so that punctuation marks are not misinterpreted as ends of sentences. TeX assumes that sentences end with periods, question marks or exclamation marks. Although if a period follows an uppercase letter, this is not taken as a sentence ending, since periods after uppercase letters normally occur in abbreviations. Any exception from these assumptions has to be specified by the author. A backslash in front of a space generates a space that will not be enlarged. A tilde ‘{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=~&lt;!----&gt;}}’ character generates a non-breaking space. The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\@&lt;!----&gt;}} in front of a period specifies that this period terminates a sentence even when it follows an uppercase letter. (If you are using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frenchspacing&lt;!----&gt;}}, then none of these exceptions need be specified.)

===Stretched spaces===

You can insert a horizontal stretched space with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hfill&lt;!----&gt;}} in a line so that the rest gets &quot;pushed&quot; toward the right margin.
For instance this may be useful in the header.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Author Name \hfill \today
}}

Similarly you can insert vertical stretched space with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vfill&lt;!----&gt;}}. It may be useful for special pages.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\maketitle
\vfill
\tableofcontents
\clearpage

\section{My first section}
% ...
}}

See [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] for more details.

===Manual spacing===

The spaces between words and sentences, between paragraphs, sections, subsections, etc. is determined automatically by LaTeX. It is against LaTeX philosophy to insert spaces manually and will usually lead to bad formatting.
Manual spacing is a matter of macro writing and package creation.

See [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] for more details.

==Hyphenation==

LaTeX hyphenates words whenever necessary. Hyphenation rules will vary for different languages. LaTeX only supports English by default, so if you want to have correct hyphenation rules for your desired language, see [[LaTeX/Internationalization|Internationalization]].

If the hyphenation algorithm does not find the correct hyphenation points, you can remedy the situation
by using the following commands to tell TeX about the exception. The command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\hyphenation{word list} }}
causes the words listed in the argument to be hyphenated only at the points marked by “-”. The argument of the command should only contain words built from normal letters, or rather characters that are considered to be normal letters by LaTeX. It is known that the hyphenation algorithm does not find all correct American English hyphenation points for several words. A log of known exceptions is published periodically in the ''TUGboat'' journal. (2012 list: https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103hyf.pdf)

The hyphenation hints are stored for the language that is active when the hyphenation command occurs. This means that if you place a hyphenation command into the preamble of your document it will influence the English language hyphenation. If you place the command after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} and you are using some package for national language support like babel, then the hyphenation hints will be active in the language activated through babel. The example below will allow “hyphenation” to be hyphenated as well as “Hyphenation”, and it prevents “FORTRAN”, “Fortran” and “fortran” from being hyphenated at all. No special characters or symbols are allowed in the argument. Example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\hyphenation{FORTRAN Hy-phen-a-tion}
}}

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\-}} inserts a discretionary hyphen into a word.  This also becomes the only point where hyphenation is allowed in this word.  This command is especially useful for words containing special characters (e.g., accented characters), because LaTeX does not automatically hyphenate words containing special characters.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{minipage}{2in}
I think this is: su\-per\-cal\-%
i\-frag\-i\-lis\-tic\-ex\-pi\-%
al\-i\-do\-cious
\end{minipage}
|render=&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}\mbox{I think this is: supercalifragi-}\\
\mbox{listicexpialidocious}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

LaTeX does not hyphenate compound words that contain a dash&lt;ref&gt;{{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package documentation, p3&lt;/ref&gt;. There are two packages that can add back flexibility. The {{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package supplies the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyp}} command. This command typesets the dash and then subjects the constituent words to automatic hyphenation.  After loading the package:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{hyphenat}
}}

one should write, instead of electromagnetic-endioscopy:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
electromagnetic\hyp{}endioscopy
}}

The {{LaTeX/Package|extdash}} package also offers features for controlling the hyphenation of compound words containing dashes &amp;mdash; as opposed to the words themselves which it leaves to LaTeX.  The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=shortcuts}} option enables a more compressed syntax:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[shortcuts]{extdash}
}}

Typical usage is as follows, assuming the compressed syntax.  In both cases, LaTeX can break and hyphenate the constituent words, but in the latter case, it will not break after the L:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
electromagnetic\-/endioscopy
L\=/approximation
}}

One or more words can be kept together on the '''one line''' with the standard LaTeX command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\mbox{text}
}}

This prevents hyphenation and causes its argument to be kept together under all circumstances.  For example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
My phone number will change soon. It will be \mbox{0116 291 2319}.
}}

{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fbox}} is similar to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mbox}}, but in addition there will be a visible box drawn around the content.

To avoid hyphenation altogether, the penalty for hyphenation can be set to an extreme value:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\hyphenpenalty=100000
}}

You can change the degree to which LaTeX will hyphenate by changing the value of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tolerance=1000}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyphenpenalty=1000}}.
You'll have to experiment with the values to achieve the desired effect. A document which has a low tolerance value will cause LaTeX not to tolerate uneven spacing between words, hyphenating words more frequently than in documents with higher tolerances.
Also note that using a higher text width will decrease the probability of encountering badly hyphenated word. For example adding
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{geometry}
}}
will widen the text width and reduce the amount of margin overruns.

== Quote-marks ==

LaTeX treats left and right quotes as different entities. For single quotes, a grave accent, &lt;tt&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt; (on American keyboards, this symbol is found on the tilde key; adjacent to the number 1 key on most keyboards) gives a left quote mark, and an apostrophe, &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; gives a right. For double quotes, simply double the symbols, and LaTeX will interpret them accordingly. (Don't use the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for right double quotes: when the &lt;tt&gt;babel&lt;/tt&gt; package is used for some languages (e.g. German), the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is redefined to produce an umlaut accent; using &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for right double quotes will either lead to bad spacing or it being used to produce an umlaut). On British keyboards, ' &lt;tt&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt; ' is left of the ' 1 ' key and shares the key with ' ¬ ', and sometimes ' ¦ ' or ' | '. The apostrophe (') key is to the right of the colon/semicolon key and shares it with the ' @ ' symbol.

[[Image:Latex_quote_4.png]]
|}

The right quote is also used for apostrophe in LaTeX without trouble.

For left bottom quote and European quoting style you need to use T1 font encoding enabled by:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
}}

See [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]] for more details on font encoding.

The package {{LaTeX/Package|csquotes}} offers a multilingual solution to quotations, with integration to citation mechanisms offered by BibTeX. This package allows one for example to switch languages and quotation styles according to babel language selections.

== Diacritics and accents ==

Most accents and diacritics may be inserted with direct keyboard input by configuring the preamble properly. For symbols unavailable on your keyboard,
diacritics may be added to letters by placing special escaped metacharacters before the letter that requires the diacritic.

See [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]].

==Margin misalignment and interword spacing==

Some very long words, numbers or URLs may not be hyphenated properly and move far beyond the side margin. One solution for this problem is to use {{LaTeX/Environment|sloppypar}} environment, which tells LaTeX to adjust word spacing less strictly. As a result, some spaces between words may be a bit too large, but long words will be placed properly.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This is a paragraph with
a very long word ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRST;
then we have another bad thing
--- a long number 1234567890123456789.

\begin{sloppypar}
This is a paragraph with
a very long word ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRST;
then we have an another bad thing
--- a long number 1234567890123456789.
\end{sloppypar}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX sloppypar.png|450px|border]]
}}

Another solution is to edit the text to avoid long words, numbers or URLs approaching the side margin.

==Ligatures==
Some letter combinations are typeset not just by setting the different letters one after the other, but by actually using special symbols (like &quot;ﬀ&quot;), called [[wikipedia:Typographical ligature|ligatures]].
Ligatures can be prohibited by inserting {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}&lt;!----&gt;}} or, if this does not work, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={\kern0pt}&lt;!----&gt;}} between the two letters in question. This might be necessary with words built from two words. Here is an example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\Large Not shelfful\\
but shelf{}ful
|render=
[[Image:Latex example ligatures.png|200px]]
}}

Ligatures can interfere with some text-search tools (a search for &lt;code&gt;&quot;'''fi'''nally&quot;&lt;/code&gt; wouldn't find the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;'''ﬁ'''nally&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DisableLigatures&lt;!----&gt;}} from the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/microtype/ microtype package] can disable ligatures in the whole document to increase accessibility.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{microtype}
\DisableLigatures{encoding = *, family = *}
}}

Note that this will also disable ligatures such as &quot;--&quot; to &quot;–&quot;, &quot;---&quot; to &quot;—&quot;, etc.

If you are using XeLaTeX and OpenType fonts, the fontspec package allows for standard ligatures to be turned off as well as fancy swash ligatures to be turned on.

Another solution is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|cmap}} package, which will help the reader to interpret the ligatures:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[resetfonts]{cmap}
}}

==Slash marks==
The normal typesetting of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} character in LaTeX does not allow following characters to be &quot;broken&quot; onto new lines, which often create &quot;overfull&quot; errors in output (where letters push off the margin). Words that use slash marks, such as &quot;input/output&quot; should be typeset as &quot;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=input\slash output&lt;!----&gt;}}&quot;, which allow the line to &quot;break&quot; after the slash mark (if needed). The use of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} character in LaTeX should be restricted to units, such as &quot;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=mm/year&lt;!----&gt;}}&quot;, which should not be broken over multiple lines.

A word after {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\slash&lt;!----&gt;}} is not automatically hyphenated. This is a similar problem to non-hyphenation of words with a dash described under [[#Hyphenation|Hyphenation]]. One way to have both a line break and automatic hyphenation in both words is
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
input\slash\hspace{0pt}output
}}
Both {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\slash&lt;!----&gt;}} can be used with a zero {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hspace&lt;!----&gt;}} like this.  {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\slash&lt;!----&gt;}} includes a penalty to make a line break there less desirable.  This combination can be made into a new slash macro if desired.  The {{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package includes an {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fshyp&lt;!----&gt;}} which will add a hyphen after the slash like &quot;input/- output&quot; if the line breaks there.

== Fonts ==

To change the font family, emphasize text, and other font-related issues, see [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]].

== Formatting macros ==

Even if you can easily change the output of your fonts using those commands, you're better off not using explicit commands like this, because they work in opposition to the basic idea of LaTeX, which is to separate the logical and visual markup of your document. This means that if you use the same font changing command in several places in order to typeset a special kind of information, you should use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} to define a &quot;logical wrapper command&quot; for the font changing command.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newcommand{\oops}[1]{\textit{#1}&lt;!----&gt;}

Do not \oops{enter} this room,
it’s occupied by \oops{machines}
of unknown origin and purpose.
|render=
Do not ''enter'' this room, it’s occupied by ''machines'' of unknown origin and purpose.
}}

This approach has the advantage that you can decide at some later stage that you want to use some visual representation of danger other than {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit&lt;!----&gt;}}, without having to wade through your document, identifying all the occurrences of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit&lt;!----&gt;}} and then figuring out for each one whether it was used for pointing out danger or for some other reason.

See [[LaTeX/Macros|Macros]] for more details.

==Text mode superscript and subscript==

Sub and superscripting can be done quite easily using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textsubscript{}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textsuperscript{}&lt;!----&gt;}}. 

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Wombat\textsubscript{walzing}

Michelangelo was born on March 6\textsuperscript{th}, 1475.
\end{document}
}}

[[File:LaTeXSubSuperscript.png]]

Note: A current LaTeX version is needed to use subscripts that way.

==Text figures (&quot;old style&quot; numerals)==

Many typographers prefer to use titling figures, sometimes called lining figures, when numerals are interspersed with full caps, when they appear in tables, and when they appear in equations, using [[w:Text figures|text figures]] elsewhere.  LaTeX allows this usage through the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldstylenums{}&lt;!----&gt;}} command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\oldstylenums{1234567890}
}}

Some fonts do not have text figures built in; the {{LaTeX/Environment|textcomp}} package attempts to remedy this by effectively generating text figures from the currently-selected font.  Put {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{textcomp}&lt;!----&gt;}} in your preamble.  {{LaTeX/Environment|textcomp}} also allows you to use decimal points, properly formatted dollar signs, etc. within {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldstylenums{}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

One common use for text figures is in section, paragraph, and page numbers.  These can be set to use text figures by placing some code in your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{textcomp}

% Enclose everything in an \AtBeginDocument{}
\AtBeginDocument{%
  % Make \section{} use text figures
  \let\myTheSection\thesection
  \renewcommand{\thesection}{ \oldstylenums{\myTheSection} }

  % Make \paragraph{} use text figures
  \let\myTheParagraph\theparagraph
  \renewcommand{\theparagraph}{ \oldstylenums{\myTheParagraph} }

  % Make the page numbers in text figures
  \let\myThePage\thepage
  \renewcommand{\thepage}{ \oldstylenums{\myThePage} }
}
}}

Should you use additional sectioning or paragraphing commands, you may adapt the previous code listing to include them as well.

;Note
A subsequent use of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering&lt;!----&gt;}} command, e.g., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering{arabic}&lt;!----&gt;}}, will reset the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thepage&lt;!----&gt;}} command back to the original. Thus, if you use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering&lt;!----&gt;}} command in your document, be sure to reinstate your {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\myThePage definition&lt;!----&gt;}} from the code above:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
...
\tableofcontents
\pagenumbering{roman}
\chapter{Preface}
...
\chapter{Introduction}
...
\pagenumbering{arabic}
% without this, the \thepage command will not be in oldstyle (e.g., in your Table of Contents}
\renewcommand{\thepage}{ \oldstylenums{\myThePage} }
\Chapter{Foo}
...
}}

==Dashes and hyphens==
LaTeX knows four kinds of dashes: a [[w:hyphen|hyphen]] (-), [[w:Dash#En dash|en dash]] (–), [[w:Dash#Em dash|em dash]] (—), or a [[w:Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|minus sign]] (−). You can access three of them with different numbers of consecutive dashes. The fourth sign is actually not a dash at all—it is the mathematical minus sign:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Hyphen: daughter-in-law, X-rated\\
En dash: pages 13--67\\
Em dash: yes---or no? \\
Minus sign: $0$, $1$ and $-1$
|render=
[[Image:Latex dashes example.png|200px]]
}}

The names for these dashes are: ‘-’(-) hyphen , ‘--’(&amp;ndash;) en-dash , ‘---’(&amp;mdash;) em-dash  and ‘&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;’(&amp;minus;) minus sign. They have different purposes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Input
! Output
! Purpose

|-
| -
| -
| inter-word

|-
| --
| &amp;ndash;
| page range, 1&amp;ndash;10

|-
| ---
| &amp;mdash;
| punctuation dash&amp;mdash;like this

|-
| $-$
| &amp;minus;
| minus sign
|}

Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyp{}&lt;!----&gt;}} macro from {{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package instead of hyphen if you want LaTeX to break compound words between lines.

The commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textendash}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textemdash}} are also used to produce en-dash (&amp;ndash;), and em-dash (&amp;mdash;), respectively.

== Ellipsis (…) ==

A sequence of three dots is known as an ''[[wikipedia:Ellipsis|ellipsis]]'', which is commonly used to indicate omitted text. On a typewriter, a comma or a period takes the same amount of space as any other letter. In book printing, these characters occupy only a little space and are set very close to the preceding letter. Therefore, you cannot enter ‘ellipsis’ by just typing three dots, as the spacing would be wrong. Instead, there is a special command for these dots. It is called {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots&lt;!----&gt;}}:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Not like this ... but like this:\\
New York, Tokyo, Budapest, \ldots
|render=
[[Image:Latex example text dots.png|200px]]
}}

Alternatively, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textellipsis&lt;!----&gt;}} command which allows the spacing between the dots to vary.

==Ready-made strings==

There are some very simple LaTeX commands for typesetting special text strings:
[[Image:Latex ready-made strings.png|center|300px]]

{{-}}
{{TODO|Describe &lt;tt&gt;microtype&lt;/tt&gt; package -- hanging punctuation, font expansion, additional kerning.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up until the 19th century, '''atoms''' were once thought to be the smallest building blocks of matter, and that matter could not be broken down any further. We now know that atoms are made up of smaller, sub-atomic, particles. This has also helped us to understand the nuclear processes such as '''fission''' and '''fusion'''.

==Structure of the atom==
[[Image:Plum_pudding_atom.svg|100px|thumb|right|Plum pudding atom]]
Near the end of the 19th century, it was widely accepted that the atom was neutral as a whole, and had areas of concentrated negative lumps within a larger positive structure. This model of the atom was called the '''plum pudding model''', where the pudding was positive, and the plums were the negative electrons. This is also called the '''chocolate chip cookie model'''.

===Discovery of the nucleus===

In 1906, [[w:Ernest Rutherford|Ernest Rutherford]] was investigating the passage of α particles through gold foil. What he found was that most of the α particles passed straight through the foil, and there was some that were deflected by an angle of greater than 90°. It was known that α particles were smaller than atoms and had a positive charge, and from this Rutherford concluded that the atom is mostly empty space and has a positively charged '''nucleus''' at the center, which was repelling the α particles. This experiment disproved the plum pudding model, and the new '''nuclear model''' was now the widely accepted model. He also calculated that the nucleus had a diameter of around &lt;math&gt;10^{-14} m&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, the negative &quot;lumps&quot; that originally led to the plum pudding model were found to actually be electrons orbiting the nucleus with a relatively large radius of about &lt;math&gt;10^{-10} m&lt;/math&gt;, also confirming that an atom is mostly empty space.

===Discovery of the proton===

The next step was to find out what the nucleus was made up of. The '''proton''' was discovered, again by Rutherford, in 1919. To find the protons, he placed a source of α radiation inside a cylinder of nitrogen gas. The cylinder had an opening at one end, which was covered by a sheet of aluminium foil. A screen was placed outside the opening, and flashes of light were observed on the screen. The flashes of light were caused by particles hitting the screen, but since it was known that aluminium foil prevents α particles from passing through, another, smaller, particle must have been hitting the screen. Rutherford asked two of his research students, Geiger and Marsden, to take measurements of the deflection angles of the particles, and he found by calculations that the proton was smaller than most nuclei, and had a positive charge which was the same magnitude of an electron. The distribution of the deflected alpha particles is different for different forces (for example, magnetic, hard sphere etc.). Rutherford was able to be sure that the nucleus was positively charged.

===Discovery of the neutron===

In 1932, [[w:James_Chadwick|James Chadwick]] discovered a particle that was slightly greater in mass than the proton and had no electric charge, which he called the '''neutron'''. He used α radiation from polonium, and directed it towards some beryllium. The beryllium emitted neutrons when it was bombarded with the α radiation, but since they have no charge, they were hard to detect. Chadwick placed some paraffin wax in the path of the neutrons, and the paraffin wax emitted high energy protons (paraffin wax contains a large amount of hydrogen). This showed that there were particles hitting the atoms of the paraffin wax without being slowed down by the positively charged nucleus of the atoms, and that they collide elastically with atoms.

===Evidence of crystal structure===

A beam of X-rays can be directed at a piece of crystalline material, and the resulting dots on the screen behind it are a regularly spaced pattern. The regularly spaced dots are evidence that the atoms in the material have a crystal structure. If the atoms weren't in a crystal structure, the resulting pattern would be smeared rings.

X-rays are used because the wavelength of X-rays are roughly the same as the spacing between atoms, and therefore the diffraction is greatest. An electron beam can also be used to provide the same evidence.

===Evidence of the size of nuclei===

A beam of '''high-energy electrons''' can be used to find the radius of nuclei. High-energy electrons are electrons that have been accelerated to high velocities, so that their [[A-level Physics/Electrons and Photons/Quantum physics|de Broglie wavelength]] could be changed to match the spacings of nuclei. The electrons are diffracted around different nuclei and calculations are done to find the radius of a nucleus from the angle of diffraction.

===Relative sizes===

The size of various particles were found from the above experiments as:

*'''radius of proton''' ≈ '''radius of neutron''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of nucleus''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m to &lt;math&gt;10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of atom''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of molecule''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;m to &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;m

==Nuclear processes==

===Nuclear equations===
[[Image:Atom.png|right|100px|thumb|A helium atom]]
If we look at a helium nucleus, we can see that it has two neutrons and two protons. It can be represented like this:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^4 _2He&lt;/math&gt;

The 4 at the top represents the number of nucleons in the nucleus, and is therefore called the '''nucleon number''', and sometimes the '''mass number'''. It is sometimes denoted by the letter A.

The 2 at the bottom represents the number of protons, and is therefore called the '''proton number''', or '''atomic number''', and is sometimes denoted by the letter Z. To be more precise, however, the proton number represents the charge of the nucleus, so that an electron is represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^0 _{-1}e&lt;/math&gt;

In all nuclear processes, there is always a balance. The number of neutrons and protons are always the same before and after a process, and so the nucleon and proton numbers must stay the same. Consider the reaction:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^2 _1H + \ ^2 _1H = \ ^4 _2He&lt;/math&gt;

Here 2 hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus. You can add the nucleon numbers together, to give &lt;math&gt;2+2=4&lt;/math&gt;, and you can add the proton numbers together, to give &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;. As you can see, both sides of the equals sign are balanced.

===Nuclear fission===
The splitting up of nucleus into two approximately equal fragments.

===Nuclear fusion===
It is when smaller nuclei combines to form larger stable nuclei.

==Isotopes==
Isotopes have same number of protons but different number of neutrons.

| Sample position for K+Q vs. K mate
}}

This book is an exact analysis of the KQK endgame, where one player has a King and a Queen and the other player has only a King.  It is relatively easy to generate a computer database, called a [[wikipedia:Tablebase|tablebase]], which has all the possible positions and the number of moves to checkmate for each position.  Although this tablebase provides a complete solution to the KQK endgame, it is in a format that can only be used by a computer.  This book shows the optimum method for forcing checkmate in a human-understandable format.

In normal play, there is no need to follow an optimal algorithm.  A much simpler algorithm like the one in the [[Chess/The_Endgame#King_and_Queen_vs._King|Chess Wikibook]] will deliver checkmate only a few moves later than the optimal algorithm, but easily within the [[wikipedia:Fifty move rule|50-move limit]].

In all the positions given, by convention the stronger side is White.  The number of moves to checkmate is the number of moves required by White, including the checkmating move.  For example, in the sample position given, &quot;White to play mates in 5&quot; means that White's fifth move is the checkmating move, e.g. 1.Kb5 Kc7 2.Qe6 Kd8 3.Qf7 Kc8 4.Kc6 Kd8 5.Qd7#.  If it is Black's move, &quot;Black to play loses in 5&quot; means that White's fifth move (which is numbered 6) is the checkmating move, e.g. 1... Kc6 2.Qd3 Kb7 3.Qd7+ Kb8 4.Kb5 Ka8 5.Kb6 Kb8 6.Qd8#.  The results are for optimal play by both sides.  If Black plays less than optimally, he could get checkmated sooner, and if White plays less than optimally, it could take longer to checkmate.

| Stalemate position D
}}
There are a total of 23,048 drawn positions in the KQK endgame.  The drawn positions consist of only positions where Black is [[wikipedia:Stalemate|stalemated]] or the white queen is [[wikipedia:Chess terminology#E|en prise]].

There are four stalemate configurations, which are shown in the diagrams.  If the black king is in the corner, the three flight squares can be covered by the queen as shown in stalemate position A.  The white king can be on any of the remaining 59 squares, so considering rotations and reflections, there are 59 x 8 = 472 positions of this type.  If the white king covers two of the flight squares (stalemate position B), the queen only needs to cover one square.  If the white king is on b6, the queen has to attack along the diagonal, so there are five possible squares, while if the white king is on a6, it can also attack along the file, so there are ten squares.  Considering rotations and reflections, there are 15 x 8 = 120 positions of this type.

With the black king on the side of the board, there are also two types of stalemate.  In Stalemate position C, the queen covers four of the five flight squares, and the white king covers the fifth square, which it can do from five possible squares.  The same thing happens with the position shifted 1, 2, 3, or 4 files to the right.  When shifted 5 files to the right there are only two places for the white king.  Thus, with rotations and reflections, there are 27 x 8 = 216 positions of this type.  Stalemate position D shows a fourth type of stalemate.  The queen covers four of the five flight squares again, but the fifth square is now next to the black king instead of diagonal from it.  There are two squares the white king can be on, and the position can be shifted 1, 2, or 3 positions to the right.  So with rotations and reflections, there are 8 x 8 = 64 positions of this type.

Next, we need to calculate the number of positions with the queen en prise.  There are 64 possible positions for the black king.  The white queen must be next to the black king, so there are three possibilities if the black king is in the corner, five possibilities if it is on the side, and eight possibilities if it is in the middle.  The white king can not be next to the black king, as that would create an illegal position, and it can not be next to the queen, as it would then be protecting the queen from capture.  The following table shows the number of possibilities for the white king for each configuration of white queen and black king.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

The 22,176 positions with queen en prise plus the 872 stalemate positions account for the 23,048 drawn positions.

With the black king in the middle of the board, there are two cases: the queen sitting next to the black king and the queen at least two squares away.  If the queen sits next to the black king, it must be protected by the white king.  As a result, the white king does not cover any squares not already covered by the queen, and the queen can not cover all the squares.  If the queen is at least two squares away, it can only cover four squares in addition to giving check, and the white king can only cover three.

The checkmate positions fall into three major categories.  In positions of type A, the kings are in [[Chess/The_Endgame#The_Opposition|opposition]], with the queen checking from the side.  The queen needs to be at least two squares from the black king, so there are six positions with the king on a8 and five each with the king on b8, c8, or d8.  When the black king is on a8, the white king can be on b6 as well as a6, so there are six additional positions for a total of 27, so including rotations and reflections there are 27 x 8 = 216.

In positions of type B, the queen stands next to the black king, protected by the white king.  There are two positions with the king on a8 and three each with the king on b8, c8, or d8.  With the king on a8, the queen can also be on b7, so there are three more positions for a total of 14.  Since one of the positions has all three pieces on the diagonal, rotations and reflections give (1 x 4) + (13 x 8) = 108 positions.

In positions of type C, the white king is on the file adjacent to the black king, and the queen checks from the side, two squares away.  The square left uncovered by moving the king to the side is covered by the queen.  There is one position with the black king on b8, and two each with the black king on c8 and d8 for a total of five, or 40 with rotations and reflections.

That gives a total of 216 + 108 + 40 = 364 positions, which are all the checkmating positions.

Positions of type C only make an evaluation difference for themselves and positions one ply previous.  For example, going back from the diagram position, the queen must have moved last, and it could only have come from one of the following squares: a4, b5, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e7, f7, g6, or h5, since it could not have been giving check.  If it was on e7 or f7, White could have chosen to checkmate on c7 instead of e8.

If the white queen was on one of the other squares and Black moved from b8, White would have missed a (Type A) checkmate.  If Black moved from either d7 or d8, he could have moved to one of e7, d7, or d8 instead of c8, escaping checkmate for a while.  The analysis is similar for the position moved one file to the right or one, two, or three files to the left, which are all the Type C positions.  Thus, Type C positions can be safely ignored unless White has an immediate checkmate.

{{-}}
==White mates in 1==

There are 2,448 positions where White mates in 1.  With the black king in the corner, there are 744 positions.  If the position is rotated and reflected to put the black king on a8, the white king will be on either a6 (376 positions), b6 (320 positions), or c6 (48 positions).  With the black king on the side of the board, there are 968 positions with the kings in opposition and 736 with White's king one square to the side.

==The longest position==

| White to move, mate in 10
}}

There is only one position (8 with rotations and reflections) that is mate in 10 with White to play.  Since there are 8 squares the black king might have come from, there are 8 positions that are lost in 10 with Black to move.  Since two of these have all the pieces on the same long diagonal, there are 56 total positions including rotations and reflections.

From the diagram, any move except 1.Qd5+?? and 1.Qc6+?? will work.

==General algorithm==

The next logical step in this process is to provide a general algorithm that can be used for all positions.  I have not completed this analysis yet.  I am having difficulty generating a list of possible moves from a given position (yeah - it seems really simple, but there are thousands of positions).  I need to verify that all the moves that fit the pattern are actually optimal.

The general outline of the algorithm is:

1. Restrict the black king to either:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a. the rank or file at the edge of the board

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b. the two ranks or two files at the edge of the board

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;c. the same half of the board as the white king, or

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d. the same quarter of the board as the white king

2. Bring the white king near the black king

3. Force the black king to the edge of the board

4. Deliver checkmate

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==

; Apostrophes are used to indicate possession and in contractions.
: Add an 's when the noun does not end in an &quot;s&quot; (driver's) or when the noun is singular and ends in an &quot;s&quot; (Lois's).
:: However, if the pronunciation of a word would be awkward with the &quot;s&quot; added, it is acceptable not to use the extra &quot;s&quot;.
: If the noun is plural and ends in &quot;s&quot;, you don't need to add an apostrophe (diplomas' instead of diploma's).

; Joint Possession
: If there is a compound noun, add the possessive apostrophe to the last noun.  
:: Example: ''I went to see Anthony and George's new apartment.''  (The apartment belongs to both Anthony and George.)
: If the compound noun indicates individual possession, add the apostrophe to both nouns. 
:: Example:  ''Mary's and Brian's sense of style was quite different.'' (Mary and Brian have individual senses of style.)   

; Compound Nouns
: If a compound noun uses dashes, place the apostrophe after the last nouns. 
:: Example:  ''My brother-in-law's house''

==Common Misuses==
* Do not use apostrophes in nouns that are not possessive.  Example:  Some parent's are more strict than mine.  (Apostrophe is not necessary)
* Do not use an apostrophe in possessive pronouns such as its, whose, his, hers, ours, yours, and theirs.

==Various==
A laundry list of primitives is not very useful on the first page of this doc. Useful maybe in an appendix or separate pages.

== Turing complete ==

&quot;Turing complete&quot; in &quot;TeX is Turing complete&quot; is a poor expression to use to address a general audience.

== Naming policy violation ==

This book ''does'' violate Wikibooks naming policy, so I don't understand why template informing about it is constantly being removed from its main page. Backslash is not slash and pages like [[TeX\bye]] appear as separate books in statistics like &quot;Random book&quot; or [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm].

I see no reason why subpages in this book couldn't be named [[TeX/bye]] instead of [[TeX\bye]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:22, 5 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
Quotation marks are used to mark direct quotations. This is to give the original writer or speaker credit for their work. If you are paraphrasing, you do not need quotation marks.  

* If you are using a long quotation (long is constituted by 4 or more typed lines), instead of quotation marks, you should indent the quotation.  If the quote is two or more paragraphs, indent the first line of the paragraphs an additional five spaces (plus the indent of the rest of the quote).  When indenting to quote, you do not need to use quotation marks.
* If your quote has a quote within it, the inner quote needs one quotation mark and the outer quote needs two quotation marks.  
* Use quotation marks around the titles of short works such as newspapers and magazine articles, poems, short stories, songs and chapters.
* Periods and commas should be placed inside the quotation marks.  Colons and semicolons should be placed outside the quotation marks.  Question marks and exclamation points should be placed inside the quotation marks, unless the punctuation applies to the whole sentence (not just the quote).
* You can set off words by using quotation marks instead of italicizing or underlining them.

==Using quoted material within your own writing==

* If a quotation is introduced formally, use a colon.
* If a quotation is being used with &quot;he said&quot; or &quot;she said,&quot; use a comma.
* If a quotation is blended into the writer's sentence, you can use a comma, although no punctuation may be more appropriate.
* If a quotation is used at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after the quote unless the quote ends in a question mark or exclamation point.
* If you choose to break up the quotation with your own words, use commas to offset the quotation from your explanation.

==What is IgA Nephropathy?==
*the most common non-diabetic kidney disease
*IgA, a normal component of the blood, collects in the kidney as damaging deposits
*due to either increased production or reduced clearance of the immune protein IgA and associated antigen complexes
*deposits collect in small blood vessels in the glomeruli (the filtering structure of the kidney)
*20%- 30% of patients will suffer eventual kidney failure within 10-20 years
*more likely if they have high levels of creatinine in blood at time of diagnosis
*will require life saving dialysis and/or a kidney transplant
*a large proportion of patients who present with symptoms have a mild form of the disease
*most people probably never know they have the disease or discover it at a late stage

==Warning Signs of Kidney Disease==
*tea colored urine (hematuria - blood in the urine)
*very foamy urine (proteinuria - protein in the urine)
*puffiness around the eyes, hands, or feet (edema - fluid retention)
*high blood pressure
*pain in the small of the back just below the ribs not aggravated by motion.
*frequent urge to urinate especially at night, and/or reduced amount of urine produced

==Treatment==
*no medical treatments except in the latest stages of the disease
*transplant success rate is good (symptoms mild, though deposits will appear in the transplanted kidney after one year)
*some therapies can delay the deterioration of kidney function for many years
*ACE inhibitors, fish oil, steroid treatment, tonsillectomy
*control of associated hypertension is important

==Diagnosis==
*the presence of blood and/or protein in the urine
*some nephrologists may microscopically examination urine and red blood cell casts
*to confirm a diagnosis, it is necessary to perform a renal biopsy and examine kidney tissue microscopically for the presence of the characteristic IgA deposits in the glomeruli
*no genetic testing available

==Causes==
*unknown (recurrence risk also unknown)
*genetic influences may play a role in the development of the disease
*seems to cluster in certain families and in certain areas of the world
*associated with major histocompatibility HLA and certain other genetic markers
*HLA-DR4 is detectable in about 50% of patients

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Incontinence'''

==General Information==
*Refers to inability to retain urine in bladder
*Due to neurologic or mechanical disorder
*Normal bladder function
**Detrusor muscle provides propulsive force for emptying bladder
***Smooth muscle under parasympathetic autonomic control
***Involves pelvic nerves from sacral spinal cord
**Layer of smooth muscle of trigonal part of bladder acts as involuntary internal sphincter
***Helps prevent incontinence even if no voluntary control
***Innervated by motor fibers from T11 to L2
**External sphincter and perineal muscles under voluntary control of pudendal nerves
**Sensory tracts of pain, temperature, and distention pass from bladder to pelvic nerves to sacral spine to medulla of brain to cortical centers
*Infants and adults with spinal damage above S2 urinate spontaneously when bladder fills

==Causes of Incontinence==
*Detrusor instability
**Bladder prone to uncontrollable contractions
**Caused by damage to inhibitory neural pathways (70% of incontinence among elderly)
***Cerbrovascualr accidents
***Alzheimer's disease
***Neoplasia
***Hydrocephalus (?maybe?)
**Could also be caused by bladder or pelvic infection or tumor, fecal impaction, uterine prolapse, and prostate hypertrophy
**May be treated with Imipramine or calcium channel blockers
*Stress incontinence
**Common in postmenopausal parous women
**Structures of female urethra atrophy when deprived of estrogen
***Pass urine under increased abdominal pressure during coughing, sneezing, climbing stairs
***Physical activity may result in small amount of urine escaping
*Mechanical incontinence
**Congenital anomalies, extrophy of bladder, patent urachus, and ectopic ureteral openings
**Correctable by surgery only
**May also be caused by prostate surgery, pelvic surgery, or irradiation of uterus or rectum
*Overflow or paradoxical incontinence
**Large residual volumes of urine
**Secondary to obstruction at bladder neck or urethra, or neurologic damage
**May occur in diseases that produce autonomic peripheral neuropathy
***Diabetes mellitus, uremia, hypothyroidism, chronic alcoholism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, collagen vascular diseases, and toxic neuropathy caused by carcinomas
***Also may be due to prolonged distension of bladder
**May be treated surgically if obstruction or with bethanechol chloride
*Psychogenic and funnctional incontinence
**Occurs in children and some adults
**May be to draw attention to themselves
**May have psychological cause from abuse or other traumatic experiences
*Enuresis
**Involuntary passage of urine at night during sleep
**Considered normal under age of 2 years as neurological controls are still developing
***Approximately 10% of children have some degree of enuresis beyond age of three
****May be due to delay in maturation of bladder control
****May be familial
***Usually ceases by age of puberty unless disease interferes
****Urinary tract infections, obstructive lesions, neurovesical dysfunction, and polyuric conditions that overload the bladder
****Usually incontinent during the day also if one of these conditions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Infertility'''

==Much more than &quot;just a female problem&quot;==
*Infertility is a condition of the reproductive system. It refers to actively trying to conceive for one year without achieving a pregnancy.
*Infertility includes difficulty conceiving, as well as the inability to carry a pregnancy to term that results in a live birth.
*There are two types of infertility. Primary infertility refers to cases where there has never been any evidence of pregnancy. Secondary infertility refers to cases of miscarriage (where a pregnancy has previously been indicated).
*Infertility may have one or several causes and is diagnosed with a series of tests comprising an &quot;infertility work-up&quot;.
*Approximately 40% of infertility is due to a female factor and 40% is due to a male factor. In 10% of the remaining cases, the infertility results from problems due to the combination of factors in both partners. The other 10% of cases cannot be explained.
*Infertility affects 14-20% of married couples in the United States.

==Common Causes of Infertility==
*Female:
**advanced maternal age (past 35, it becomes harder for the pituitary to stimulate the ovaries)
**history of pelvic inflammatory disease
**history of miscarriage
**tubal factors (blockage from infection or adhesions)
**peritoneal factors (endometriosis)
**inability to ovulate (polycystic ovarian disease, premature ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactemia)
**uterine factors (fibroids, polyps, septum or other abnormality)
**cervical factors (hostile environment, anti-sperm antibodies, too little or too much mucus, surgery/biopsy scars)
*Male:
**low semen volume (producing less than 1 or 2 cc)
**low sperm count (less than 20 million per cc)
**inappropriate sperm morphology
**poor sperm motility
**inability of the sperm to progress or move forward

==Infertility Testing: What can we do?==
*physical examination of both partners - determine their general state of health and to evaluate physical disorders that may be causing infertility. Usually both partners are interviewed about their sexual habits in order to determine whether intercourse is taking place properly for conception.
*If no cause can be determined at this point, more specific tests may be recommended. For women, these include an analysis of body temperature and ovulation, x-ray of the fallopian tubes and uterus, and laparoscopy. For men, initial tests focus on semen analysis.
*karyotyping - check the couple's chromosomes for aneuploidy, rearrangements, or balanced translocations

==Infertility Treatments: What are the options?==
*Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is a collective term which refers to a variety of medical procedures used to achieve a pregnancy
*in vitro fertilization (IVF) - sidesteps tubal factors by bypassing the fallopian tubes
*hormone treatments - eliminates ovulation problems by using medication (such as Clomid) to stimulate the ovaries
*intrauterine insemination - bypasses cervix factors
*surgery - eliminates uterine factors by removing a septum or treating endometriosis
*Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) - uses IVF (which only requires one sperm) to avoid male sperm factors
*donor eggs, donor sperm, surrogate carriers
**Please keep in mind. . .Infertility often creates one of the most distressing life crises that a couple has ever experienced together. The long term inability to conceive a child can evoke significant feelings of loss. Coping with the multitude of medical decisions and the uncertainties that infertility brings can create great emotional upheaval for most couples. Couples often feel anxious, depressed, out of control, and isolated.**

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Value Types==

An iterator is a section of code that enables one to tranverse a data structure and return each element of the same type in turn.

The iterator code uses the yield return statement to return each element in turn. When the yield return statement is reached, the current location is stored. Execution is restarted from this location the next time the iterator is called.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Keratoconus'''

==Assess Knowledge==
*What do you already know about Keratoconus?
*What are your concerns today? What issues to you wish to discuss?

==Intake and Family History==
*Discuss prepared pedigree to confirm the known cases of keratoconus

==Etiology==
*the underlying reason for its development remains obscure; currently the topic of much research
*usually an inherited corneal disorder, often in an autosomal recessive fashion
*family members may have it, but it also can be random with no other family members affected (sporadic)
*most likely that the cause is due to more than one factor
**the path that leads to the thinning of the cornea may start with a &quot;trigger&quot;, followed by a cascade of events in the eye tissues
**the primary trigger is not known.
***possible options include hormonal changes in the patient, genetic predisposition to altered cytokines and/or their receptors in the patient's cornea, or a pattern of eye-rubbing that could release factors
**abnormal levels of degradative protease activity may then lead to a slow, progressive dissolution of Bowman's layer and the epithelial basement membrane
**the epithelium then comes into contact with the stroma, cytokines/growth factors are released, and as a result, the cells begin to produce scar tissue and proteases
*a disorder with local micro-environmental changes rather than a situation where the entire cornea is involved
**within a single keratoconus cornea there are areas of increased protease activity (thinning) and other areas of ongoing wound healing (scar tissue buildup)
*recent advances in molecular techniques make it possible to examine the molecular components in wounded or diseased corneas
**CD45 (leukocyte common antigen or T200), a transmembrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase (normally found associated with blood cells), has been found to be present in more cells within keratoconus corneas than normal
***these cells may represent the source of some of the proteolytic enzymes reported to be associated with keratoconus
**a gene product referred to as glucose regulated protein (GRP78) has been found in greater quantity in normal corneas
***a protein that aids or &quot;chaperones&quot; the folding and secretion of other proteins produced in cells
***the reduction in GRP78 could affect the secretion and folding of the major structural proteins of the cornea which are reduced in the keratoconus cornea.

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*some cases have a hereditary component and studies indicate that about 8% of patients have affected relatives
*most cases appear to be sporadic
*the actual incidence is uncertain, large studies estimate 50 to 230 per 100,000
*according to one study, the estimated prevalence in first-degree relatives is 3.34%, which is 15 to 67 times higher than that in the general population (0.23-0.05%). (Am J Med Genet 2000 Aug 28;93(5):403-9 )
*occurs in all ethnic groups
*has a slight female preponderance
*is more common in contact lens wearers and nearsighted eyes
*some researchers believe allergy may play a role

==Clinical Features==
*non-inflammatory eye condition in which the normally round dome-shaped cornea progressively thins causing a cone-like bulge to develop
**results in significant visual impairment
*a degenerative condition where the cornea thins in affected areas and scar tissue develops
**can lead to astigmatism - often regular at first but becoming increasingly irregular as the disease progresses
*surface thinning can create several optical zones that individually focus the same image to different areas of the retina, thus creating multiple perceived images
*has been associated with other medical disorders including atopic disease, Down's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, craniofacial dysostosis and osteogenesis imperfecta
*not a blinding disorder, but does result in increasing near-sightedness (things far away are out of focus) and irregular astigmatism (things look tilted)
*is almost always bilateral (90% of cases)

==Natural History==
*in the earliest stages, slight blurring, distortion of vision, and increased sensitivity to glare and light occur
**symptoms usually first appear in the late teens and early twenties
**mean age of onset is 16; onset as young as 6 yrs has been recorded
**rarely develops after age 30
*may progress for 10-20 years and then slow in its progression
**may halt at any stage from mild to severe
*each eye may be affected differently
**disease develops asymmetrically: diagnosis of the disease in the second eye generally occurs about five years after diagnosis in the first
*patients may endure discomfort and reduced vision over a long period of time

==Testing==
*can usually be diagnosed with slit lamp examination of the cornea
*early cases may require corneal topography, a test that makes a stereo image which gives a topographic map of the corneal curvature
*when advanced, the cornea will be thinner in areas and this can be measured by pachymetry
*the biomicroscope is the only tool which allows a clinician to observe many classical signs of keratoconus: Fleischer's ring, stress lines of Vogt, corneal thinning and scarring, various types of staining with and without lens wear, increased visibility of corneal nerves, and corneal hydrops.

==Management and treatment==
*eyeglasses or soft contact lenses may be used to correct the mild nearsightedness and astigmatism of early stages
*as the disorder progresses and the cornea continues to thin and change shape, rigid gas permeable contact lenses can be prescribed to correct vision
**contact lenses must be carefully fitted, and frequent checkups and lens changes may be needed to achieve and maintain good vision
**rigid contact lenses aid in flattening the corneal surface and provide optimal visual correction
*in severe cases, a corneal transplant may be needed due to scarring, extreme thinning or contact lens intolerance
**a surgical procedure that replaces the keratoconus cornea with healthy donor tissue
**20-25% of those with keratoconus ultimately require corneal transplant surgery
***success rate of greater than 90%
**corneal transplant is warranted when the cornea becomes dangerously thin or when sufficient visual acuity to meet the individual's needs can no longer be achieved by contact lenses due to steepening of the cornea, scaring or lens intolerance
**the more severe the keratoconus is, the more likely it is to see a dramatic improvement immediately after surgery
**the majority of keratoconus patients have their sutures removed 6-12 months after surgery (depends on healing rate)
**a small percentage of transplant patients do obtain uncorrected vision good enough that neither glasses nor contacts are needed after surgery, but in the majority of cases, some form of vision correction is needed after surgery

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Klinefelter Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*The most common sex chromosome abnormality
*The most common cause of male hypogonadism and infertility
*Characterized by the addition of at least one extra X chromosome to a 46,XY male karyotype
**Most descriptions refer to 47,XXY karyotype
**Over 50% of males with Klinefelter syndrome have 47,XXY karyotype
**Those with mosaicism or other chromosome complements may have different prognosis
*Presentation and prognosis are quite variable
*In 1942, Dr. Klinefelter described testicular dysgenesis (defective development), elevated urinary gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the gonads) microorchidism (small testes), eunuchoidism (deficient hormone production by the testes), azoospermia (no spermatozoa in the semen), and gynecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue)
*The clinical features are not present until mid to late adolescence, so it is technically correct to refer to fetuses, newborns, and children as having 47,XXY
**Reserve the term Klinefelter syndrome for affected adolescents and adults

==Diagnosis==
*Most are identified by a karyotype as part of a work-up for infertility or by prenatal diagnosis detected by amniocentesis performed for other indications

==Incidence==
*Estimated to be 1/500 to 1/1000 male births
*But many are probably never diagnosed

==Clinical Manifestations==
*Lifespan is normal
*Development
**By adolescence, most boys are at or above the 80th percentile for height
**There is a tendency toward slightly delayed motor and language milestones
**2/3 of boys with 47,XXY are delayed in walking
**Key language milestones may be delayed in up to 50% affected but are often within normal limits
**Sensorimotor integration problems may arise by age 6-7 years
***May include hypotonia, apraxia, primitive reflex tension, and problems with bilateral coordination and visual perceptual motor integration
**On average, intellectual skills are slightly diminished and learning problems are increased, but this varies widely
**Cognitive difficulties are largely limited to the area of verbal skills
**Reading skills are the area of academic progress that can be most problematic for boys with 47,XXY
**Often boys are unable to demonstrate success in physical achievements as compared to male peers
*Behavior
**Tend to be shy, nonassertive, and immature
**Language difficulties contribute to the reluctance for interpersonal interactions
**Aggressive behavior can occur due to prolonged frustration but are not characteristic of this group
**Some investigators have reported an increased occurrence of ADHD but others have not
**Adolescent males are often reluctant to speak freely and lack confidence
**Some may experience serious psychological distress due to limited athletic and academic success and continued learning difficulties
**There are few reports on the adult adaptation of men with 47,XXY
**Sexual functioning is typically normal, although sexual drive is often low if supplemental testosterone therapy is not utilized
**There is no evidence for increased aberrant sexual behavior
**There is normal gender orientation
*Endocrine
**Sexual development is normal in infancy and during childhood
**There is an adolescent elevation of testosterone that begins to plateau around age 14 years, then serum levels remain in the low to low normal adult range
**By mid-puberty, boys have FSH and LH levels 5-10 times the normal range
**Due to endocrine changes, testicular growth is arrested
***Testicular volume and size is decreased
***The number of Leydig cells (testosterone-secreting cells) is decreased
**Gynecomastia is seen in about 15% of cases
***Increased breast tissue is common in adolescent males, but it may not always regress in some adolescents with 47,XXY
***Supplemental testosterone does not usually prevent or diminish gynecomastia but simple mastectomy can be performed
**Facial hair, axillary hair, and pubic hair all increase during puberty, but this may occur to a lesser degree than in 46,XY males
***Hair pattern is male
**Older literature described fat distribution as being female, but this is not true
*Infertility
**Sexual function is normal, but ejaculate contains no sperm
**A few cases of fertility have been reported in the literature, but it is thought that cryptic mosaicism may be present in some of the men
**Men on testosterone therapy will not attain fertility
**Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
***Some men with 47,XXY have been shown to have a few sperm in their testes, even when no sperm are present in ejaculate
***After testosterone therapy and testicular biopsy, sperm have been recovered and utilized in the ICSI procedure to achieve pregnancy and birth
***Preimplantation/prenatal diagnosis is necessary to rule out chromosomal aneuploidy
***The process of testicular sperm extraction, ICSI, and preimplantation diagnosis is not routinely offered at this time
***For most 47,XXY males, the most realistic prospects for fatherhood are by utilization of artificial insemination by donor or adoption
*Neoplasia
**There is a 1% lifetime risk for developing extragonadal germ cell tumors, usually in the mediastinum
***For unknown reasons, Klinefelter syndrome is a predisposing factor to the aberrant migration of primordial germ cells
***Affected males may present with respiratory symptoms due to the mass size
***Some cases of precocious puberty in boys with 47,XXY have been caused by germ cell tumors that secrete hCG.
***The ages of susceptibility are early adolescence to age 30
**Increased risk of breast cancer, probably up to 3% lifetime risk
***This is a 20-fold increase over the normal male population
***This risk does not warrant routine screening
*Immunologic
**Adults are at a slightly increased risk for certain autoimmune disorders
***Such as systemic lupus erythematosis, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disorders
**It has been suggested that sex hormones may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases
*Cardiovascular
**Mitral valve prolapse has been reported but a baseline cardiac echo is NOT warranted
**There is a risk for cardiovascular disease associated with elevated cholesterol levels
**Chronic leg ulcers are seen in approximately 6-13% of patients

==Management==
*Adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to produce normal quantities of testosterone, so supplemental testosterone can maintain levels in the normal range
**This enables them to stimulate and maintain androgen-dependent processes
**In many cases, it promotes increased sense of well-being
**Helps to maintain secondary sex characteristics including facial and body hair
**Can increase and maintain muscle mass and promote weight gain
**Can increase energy and sex drive and lower cholesterol levels
**Can stimulate bone mineralization and prevent loss of bone mass which can lead to osteoporosis
*Testosterone therapy is usually considered in mid to late adolescence because serum testosterone levels do not plateau until about age 14 years in most affected males
**Therapy can begin as early as age 12 however
*Serum testosterone levels should be carefully monitored during the initiation process
**Excess testosterone can lead to inappropriate sexual behavior
**There are some reports of aggressiveness when higher concentrations are administered
*Intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate or cypionate have been the most common method of testosterone replacement
**The standard adult dose is 200mg every 10-14 days
**In an adolescent, the initial dose is considerable lower, usually 100mg every 4 weeks
**Because this method does not mimic normal physiologic production, there may be fluctuations in mood and physical functioning
**Usually injected into deep muscle in the thighs or buttocks
**Because testosterone ether is dissolved in an oil base, the injections can be slow and painful
*Transdermal testosterone patches can provide a more normal physiological availability of testosterone
**Patches are replaced every 24 hours
**Scrotal patch is effective in postpubertal males, but adolescents in one study were resistant to daily application to their genitalia
**A nonscrotal patch can be worn on the thighs, abdomen, trunk, or upper arm
**Side effects are rare but include: acne, leg edema, breast tenderness, and local skin reactions
*Oral testosterone is not generally available in the U.S.
*New formulations of testosterone currently being investigated include implantable pellets, sublingual tablets, and long-lasting injections

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Karyotype analysis may be indicated with the following features:
**Learning disabilities, language difficulties, attention deficits, psychosocial problems, small testes, infertility
*Kallman syndrome
**Characterized by hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell)

==Etiology==
*Nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes during the first or second meiotic division of gametogenesis in either parent causes chromosomal aneuploidy
*The extra X chromosome is contributed only slightly more frequently by the mother than the father
**There are no apparent differences in phenotype or imprinting effects
*AMA is slightly associated with the extra X chromosome; there is no paternal age effect
*There are no predisposing or preventative factors
**This is important for parents to understand

==Other Male X Chromosome Aneuploidy==
*Few cases of variants of 47,XXY have been followed prospectively so the natural history is not known
**Most information is from case reports of abnormal individuals
**This ascertainment bias could mean that individuals with a variation of the 47,XXY karyotype are actually more mildly affected than reported here
*Mosaicism
**46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism is the most common form of 47,XXY mosaicism
**The normal cell line modifies the risk for developmental delay
**Fertility may be possible
**Testosterone supplementation is probably not indicated
*48,XXYY
**The most common variant of Klinefelter syndrome
**Similar physical phenotype to 47,XXY, but males are taller and have disproportionately longer lower extremities
**IQ is typically reduced and ranges from 60 to 80; however, at least 10% of reported cases had IQs ranging from 80 to 111
**Speech and motor delays are common, and behavior may be shy or impulsive and aggressive
**Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism is similar to that in males with 47,XXY and testosterone treatment is the same
**Genitalia may be small
*48,XXXY (3 X chromosomes)
**Results from the addition of an extra X to a 47,XXY karyotype
**A more abnormal phenotype including facial anomalies such as hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, simplified ears, and mild prognathism (projection of the jaw beyond the forehead)
**Tall stature is common
**May be skeletal anomalies such as clinodactyly, elbow abnormalities, and radioulnar synostosis
**Generally, there is mild to moderate mental retardation (IQ=40-60)
**Behavior is usually passive and cooperative
**Genitalia may be small, and gynecomastia is frequently reported
*49,XXXXY (4 X chromosomes)
**This is the most severe variant of Klinefelter syndrome
**Abnormal facial features include hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, broad nasal bridge, low-set and malformed ears and prognathism
**Cardiac defects, usually patent ductus arteriosus, are present in 15-20% of cases
**Males have short stature, short, broad neck, narrow thorax, radioulnar synostosis, and hyperextensible joints
**Genitalia are hypoplastic
**Cryptorchidism (failure of testes to descend) is often present at birth
**Range of mental retardation is broad (IQ is generally 20 to 70)
**Speech and motor sills are severely impaired
**Behavior ranges from placid to aggressive
*46,XX males
**Males who have clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome but normal female karyotype
**Occurs in about 1 in 20,000 male births
**Clinical features
***Shorter than males with 47,XXY, and extremities are not disproportionately long
***Genitalia are usually normal male, but there is an increased risk for hypospadias or ambiguous genitalia
***Testes are small and azoospermia is present
***IQ is generally higher than with 47,XXY males, and the risk for learning disabilities and behavior problems is lower
**Over 90% have a portion of Yp containing the SRY gene translocated to the paternally derived X chromosome
***This material is no always cytogenetically visible, but can be detected by FISH
**The remaining 10% are thought to be the result of an autosomal or X chromosome mutation
***These males are more likely to have genital abnormalities

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lupron Exposure'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring physician
*Assess understanding of the reason for the referral to genetics
*What concerns or questions do you have that you would like to discuss today?
*Outline session agenda
**Medical and family history questions
**Some of the possible effects that lupron can have on the pregnancy
**Options available to you
**Discussion of concerns and questions

==Elicit Medical History==
*Confirm LMP: __________
*EDC: __________
*Today's gestational age: __________
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*Date of ultrasound: __________
*Results of ultrasound: __________
*How has the pregnancy been going so far?
*When did you first find out you were pregnant
*What medications are you taking?
**Amount and frequency of each.
**When did you start taking each?
*Do you have any other medical problems?
*Any complications with the pregnancy

==Elicit Family History==
(3 generations)
*Anyone had: multiple SAB, SB, early deaths or babies that required surgery as infants?
*Anyone born with birth defects such as cleft lip or palate, spina bifida, or heart problems
*MR/LD
*Has anyone in family had cancer (dx. &lt;50) or chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes)
*Anyone with muscle weakness or muscular dystrophy
*Anyone with bleeding disorders
*Anyone with any other genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, PKU, etc.

==Discuss possible side effects of taking lupron at time of conceptions==
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of birth defects or mental retardation
*There may be an increase in risks to the fetus when a woman is on lupron at conception.
*HOWEVER, this doesn't mean that the baby will be born with a problem, it just means that we know that based on your special circumstances, your pregnancy may be at an increased risk for miscarriage or maybe even a birth defect
*The reasons we believe there might be an increased risk are based on a small number of women who were exposed to lupron during pregnancy as well as animal studies
*We can tell you what has been reported, but the numbers are too small to make any real conclusions
*125 women who were exposed to lupron at the time of pregnancy have been identified and reported as of Feb 2002
**35 of them miscarried (28%), one was terminated for trisomy 18, three were ectopic pregnancies (2.4%)
**2 of the 125 infants had congenital anomalies which included bilateral inguinal hernia and other atretic kidney (positive family history for atretic kidney)
**14 were still ongoing pregnancies and 71 had babies with no malformations or health problems
*6 children (around age 7) who were exposed to lupron or a similar medication (GnRH agonist).
**1 had a cleft palate
**1 had a seizure disorder
**3 had ADHD
**HOWEVER this is a very small number of children and is not enough to base any conclusions on
**Also, it was unclear how they were defining ADHD because they all had normal psychological tests
*Most of the studies regarding the risks that lupron poses for a pregnancy have been done on rabbits and rats.
**These studies are often not directly related to effects and risks for humans because these animals are different enough that drugs can have a different effect on them when compared to a human fetus.
**Increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights in rabbits when given 1/30th and 1/3rd the human dose and for rats at 1/3rd the human dose
**Although not all agree with the interpretation, studies on rabbits suggest that there may be an increase in some birth defects, which include hydrocephalus or vertebral anomalies (dose related at 1/300th, 1/30th and 1/3rd the human dose)
**Rats showed no increase in birth defects
*We therefore don't really have a lot of conclusive information, but the main concern would seem to be an increased risk for pregnancy loss.
*This increase in fetal mortality is likely due to alterations in hormonal levels brought about by the drug (estrogen and progestin levels reduced to levels within the menopausal range)

==Options==
*Level II ultrasound -- performed at 18 -20 weeks
**Done by an experienced technician
**Can detect many birth defects
**Developing organs will be looked at in detail
**Can often detect abnormalities in the formation of the limbs, spine, heart, and brain
**U/S is good to make us suspicious of some birth defects but it can't tell us everything
**We won't know if there is mental deficiency by u/s
**Also, u/s is dependent upon cooperation of the baby. Sometimes we just can't get a great view and may not be able to see everything we are looking for
**But it can usually provide some reassurance to see that organs and body parts have formed properly

==Maternal Serum Marker Screening==
(Unrelated to any risks due to exposure there is a blood test that is routinely offered to all pregnant women)
**MSAFP at about 16-18 weeks
**Screening performed on a sample of your blood
**Can provide an indication that a fetus may be at a higher or lower risk than the general population to have an ONTD, but it will not tell us for certain if there is a neural tube defect
**Detects about 80-90% of ONTD's (so it can miss some)
**Will also tell if fetus is at an increased risk above your age-related risk for a chromosome abnormality
**Blood test can also look at other markers in the blood and determine if there may be an increased risk for two chromosomal abnormalities (for which you are not at an increased risk for based on your history of seizures and medications)

==Discuss CF carrier screening==

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Guilt over doing something that may cause birth defects
*Anxiety because we don't know what to expect
*Was this a planned pregnancy and is she excited to be pregnant or was this unexpected
*Any other health concerns or circumstances that would make this a difficult pregnancy
*Assess support system and coping strategies

==Follow-up==
*Questions?
*Schedule level II ultrasound

==Lupron Facts==
*GnRH - agonist - mimicks GnRH, but is more potent
*Considered category X drug (meaning benefits to women don't outweigh potential risk to fetus and it is contraindicated for women who could potentially get pregnant)
*Not known if transfers to human milk, but structure makes this unlikely
*No breast feeding data are available
*Triggers release of LH and FSH (hormones that stimulate ovary in preparation for ovulation)
*First taken then any LH and FSH stored in pituitary is released, but further production and release is blocked
*When LH and FSH blocked, ovarian follicle and egg don't grow and less estrogen produced by ovary
*Initial release of FSH and LH may cause one last cycle before suppressing ovarian activity
*Should therefore use backup protection during the first month of treatment
*Lupron is used in preparation for infertility treatments and when it is used in this fashion before conception there has been no increased risk of fetal anomalies reported to be associated with the infertility treatment.

*Mode of inheritance: Autosomal recessive with non-allelic heterogeneity.
*Chromosome location: 2p15, 1q22, 12p13.3, 7q21-q22, 6q23-q24
*Molecular genetics: Phenotype caused by mutation in any of several genes involved: in peroxisome biogenesis (peroxi-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, or -12).
*Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles that play a role in lipid metabolism--these are absent

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Incidence is 1 in 40,000. Males and females are affected equally.

==Clinical Features==
*Craniofacial Features
**Flat occiput and face
**Anteverted nares
**Epicanthal folds
**Brushfield spots
**High forehead
**Large fontanels
**Shallow orbits
*Ocular Features
**Cataracts
**Hypoplastic optic disk
*Auditory Features
**Abnormal helices
**Deafness
*Neurological Features
**Early developmental delay
**Seizures
**Brain migrational abnormalities
**MR in survivors
**Brain malformations including microgyria, heteropias, subependymal cysts, astrocytosis and gliosis, hypoplastic corpus callosum, hypoplastic olfactory lobes

==Age of Onset, Natural History, Life Span==
*Most babies are born breech and exhibit failure to thrive. Some developed icterus and bloody stool.
*Vast majority of children die within the first year of life. Those who survive have profound mental retardation. Average life span is 12-13 weeks.

==Testing==
*Diagnosis is made through DNA testing.
*Increase in plasma and fibroblasts of very-long-chain fatty acids and lack of dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) are biochemical markers for this syndrome

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*Multidisciplinary early intervention
*Oral administration of plasmalogens
*Restricted phytanic acid intake
*OT, PT, hearing aids, nutrition
*Skeletal surveys (X-rays, CT and MRI)
*Renal and abdominal ultrasounds

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Down syndrome is the most common

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''XXX Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Greet family and acknowledge prior contact.

==Contracting==
*Discuss the reason for referral - amniocentesis results.
*Express empathy over what a surprise the diagnosis was for the family.
*Assess their main questions and concerns and find out what they hope to gain from the session.
*Find out how much reading/research they have done on XXX Syndrome and assess the degree of their knowledge about heredity and genetics.
*Explain our intent to address their concerns and questions about Triple X. Explain that we will share information about the syndrome, discuss the test results, how the syndrome is caused, recurrence risks, problems associated with Triple X, and medical management.

==Elicit Medical History==
*Maternal and paternal age
*Ethnicity
*Consanguinity
*Chronic illnesses

==Elicit Family History==
*Construct pedigree
*Identify possible risks

==Pregnancy History==
*Review information from intake.
*G (# of pregnancies), P (# of live births), SAb, EAb
*Exposures/medical complications (infection, fever, rash, medication, smoking, alcohol, recreational drugs, x-rays, bleeding)

==Genetics of XXX Syndrome==
*47, XXX karyotype
*Inheritance pattern: chromosomal abnormality caused by non-disjunction (possible correlation to advanced maternal age)
*Prevalence: 1 in 1,000 females
*Recurrence risk: less than 1%

==Natural History and Clinical Features of XXX Syndrome==
*At birth, girls with Triple X show no physical stigmata and are normally developed. The infants may have a lower than normal birth weight.
*These girls are described as being quiet and passive babies with a lower assertive age during childhood.
*They are usually delayed in motor, speech, and psychosocial development with delayed emotional maturation.
*Tall stature (at the 80th percentile by adolescence, with an average adult height of 172 cm).
*Comparatively low weight in comparison to height.
*Lower head circumference (25th - 35th percentile)
*Back problems may develop due to weak musculature.
*Lower IQ (average is approximately 90) - however, mental retardation is very rare. May have learning difficulties in school that require outside help.
*Normal puberty and average onset of menstruation.
*Fertile, with the possibility of early menopause.
*No increased risk of disease or mental illness.

==Diagnosis and Testing of XXX Syndrome==
*Diagnosis by amniocentesis, CVS, or chromosome testing.
*Recurrence risk of less than 1%.
*There is a theoretical increased risk of X aneuploidy for the children of women with Triple X, however, this has not been shown in practice. A less than 1% risk figure is quoted, but genetic counseling is suggested to explain the possibility of prenatal diagnosis if desired.

==Management==
*Early intervention programs with mental, social, and motor stimulation are suggested to help prevent possible developmental delay.
*Speech therapy is recommended to counteract speech delays.
*Participation in team sports and group activities is suggested to improve motor skills and psychosocial adaptation.
*Schools should provide special education or resource help for learning difficulties.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Self-fulfilling prophecy leading to a behavior problem
*Should they tell their pediatrician?
*Should they tell their daughter's teachers?
*Should they tell their daughter?

*Type I
**variable phenotype
**sesorineural hearing loss
***congenital, non-progressive, uni- or bilateral
***most common type is profound bilateral
**white forelock
***may be present at birth or appear later
***may become normally pigmented over time
**eyebrows and eyelashes may also be hypopigmented
**leukoderma
***white skin patches, frequently on the face, trunk, or limbs
***often have hyperpigmented borders
**spina bifida and cleft lip and palate have been described in multiple families
*Type 2
**if the average W index across a family is less than 1.95, the diagnosis is WS2
**sensorineural hearing loss and heterochromia iridum are the two most characteristic features of WS2
*Type 3 (Klein-Waardenburg Syndrome)
**individuals have a combination of typical WS1 features and hypoplasia or contractures of the limb muscles or joints, carpal bone fusion, or syndactyly
*Type 4
**Individuals having a rare combination of pigmentary abnormalities, hearing loss, and Hirschsprung disease

==Natural History==
*does not affect lifespan or intelligence

==Testing==
*Clinical Diagnosis
** An individual must have two major or one major plus two minor criteria to be considered affected by WT1**
**Major Criteria
***Congenital sensorineural hearing loss
***White forelock, hair hypopigmentation
***Pigmentation abnormality of the iris
***Complete heterochromia iridum (eyes of different color)
***Partial/segmental heterochromia (two different colors in same iris, typically brown and blue)
***Hypoplastic blue irides, or brilliant blue irides
***Dystopia canthorum, W index &gt;1.95*
***Affected first-degree relative
**Minor Criteria
***Skin hypopigmentation (congenital leukoderma)
***Synophyrys/medial eyebrow flare
***Broad/high nasal root, prominent columella
***Hypoplastic alae nasi
***Premature gray hair (before age 30 years)
*W index: The measurements necessary to calculate the W index (in mm) are as follows:
**inner canthal distance (a), interpupillary distance (b), and outer canthal distance (c).
***Calculate X = 2a - (0.2119c + 3.909)/c
***Calculate Y = 2a - (0.2479b + 3.909)/b
***Calculate W = X + Y + a/b
**An abnormal W index result is &gt;1.95.

* When ICD (a) and OCD (c) are the only measurements available, IPD (b) can be calculated according to the formula: [(c - a)/2] + a.  This can be used when IPD (b) is already known to compare measured and calculated values.

*Molecular genetic testing
**available by sequencing the PAX3 gene (chromosomal locus 2q35)
**can be used to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases
**primarily used for genetic counseling of at-risk family members
**detects over 90% of disease-causing mutations
***most mutations are unique
**available clinically
*Prenatal testing
**available for pregnancies at 50% risk in which a parent has been identified as having a PAX3 mutation
**performed on fetal cells obtained by CVS or amniocentesis
**can determine whether or not the fetus has inherited the PAX3 mutation, but it cannot determine the clinical manifestations nor their severity
**not available for families who have not had molecular genetic testing of the PAX3 gene or do not have a PAX3 gene mutation

==Management and Treatment==
*folic acid supplementation in pregnancy is recommended for women at increased risk of having a child with WS1, given the possibly increased risk of neural tube defects in association with WS1
*congenital hearing loss can be identified through universal screening of newborns
*management of hearing loss
**as a minimum, all children with a risk for hereditary hearing loss should receive screening audiometry
**the team evaluating and treating the deaf individual should consist of an otolaryngologist with expertise in the management of early childhood otologic disorders, an audiologist experienced in the assessment of hearing loss in children, a clinical geneticist, and a pediatrician
**the expertise of an educator of the Deaf, a neurologist, and a pediatric ophthalmologist may also be required
**sequential audiologic examinations are essential to document the stability or progression of the hearing loss and to identify and treat superimposed hearing losses, such as middle ear effusion
***an important part of the evaluation is determining the appropriate habilitation option
****possibilities include hearing aids, vibrotactile devices, and cochlear implantation
****cochlear implantation can be considered in children over 12 months of age with severe-to-profound hearing loss

The use of soy protein in this recipe increases the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]'s natural flavor. This bread is very easy to prepare.

==Ingredients==

* 30g (1oz) of fresh yeast
* 2 Eggs
* 1 cup of oil
* 3 cups of warm milk
* 1 table spoon of sugar
* 1 table spoon of salt
* 1 cup of TSP (texturized soy protein)
* 8 cups of flour

==Procedure==

# Heat the milk until it is about to boil, then add the salt and the soy protein. Mix it for the salt to be well dissolved. Let it rest until is warm again.
# Put on the blender the milk and the rest of the ingredients, including the yeast. Mix it for a few seconds until it is homogeneous.
# Pour the mixture on a bowl and start adding the flour while mixing to keep the bread homogeneous all the time.
# Work the bread with your hands all the time, always keeping it smooth. You may have to add some extra flour while you work with it. Keep doing this until the bread stops being sticky.
# Let it rest for about 25 minutes at a warm place, with approximate constant temperature.
# Separate several small balls of bread of about 1 inches (2.5 cm) in diameter and half of it in height.
# Put the breads on a oven tray with some distance between them and leave them for other 15 minutes.
# Pre heat the oven at about 200°C and put the tray in a medium position inside the oven.
# Let them cook for about 20 minutes.

==Variations==

* You may increase the amount of oil by half a cup to make it more moist and increase its lifetime.
* You may add minced provolone into the mixture (not filling) to give it a delicious subtle taste of cheese. 
* You may of course fill it as well.
* You may cook it in different shapes that the small bread

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Manilow. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Manilow~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

==Overview==
*Liver is the second most frequently metastatic organ, after lymph nodes
**Rich dual vascular supply and cell-promoting humoral factors
*In US/Europe, liver mets are much more frequent than primary liver tumors
*Primaries most commonly going to liver:
**Adults: the eye, colon, stomach, pancreas, breast, and lung 
**Children: neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and leukemia
*Seeding: 77% both lobes, 10% single lesions. Multiple mets often vary in size, suggesting seeding from primary in waves
*Imaging: With an equivalent specificity, PET is the most sensitive (vs. U/S, CT, MRI)
*Treatment options:
**Surgery
**Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)
**Ablation (Cryoablation, Microwave ablation, EtOH ablation, RF ablation, Laser ablation
**RT historically not used due to low median liver tolerance, but now increasing interest with conformal therapy and stereotactic radiotherapy
*Survival:
**Colorectal primary: resection can offer cure, 5-year survival 20-40%
**Breast, lung, pancreas primary: poor due to usually widespread metastatic disease outside of liver



==Treatment==
Most studies include both mets and primary liver cancer; for now they are kept together. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Liver/Treatment|Liver/Treatment]] page'''.


===Surgery===
*'''MSKCC; 2007''' (1985-1994) PMID 17925551 -- &quot;Actual 10-year survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases defines cure.&quot; (Tomlinson JS, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4575-80.)
**Retrospective. 612 consecutive patients, 102 10-year survivors 
**Outcome: If survive 10 years, 97% DSS; if survive 5 years, 66% DSS
**Initial factors: 50% N+, 39% &gt;1 met, 35% tumor size &gt;5cm, 25% bilobar mets, 7% synchronous disease
**Conclusion: Almost 20% cure in well-selected patients with CRC liver mets</text>

'''Hepatocellular carcinoma'''
==Epidemiology==
*6th most common cancer in the world.  14.7 per 100,000 men and 4.9 per 100,000 women.  3 to 1 ratio male to female.  Highest risk areas are East and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
*In North America, only 1-3 per 100,000 people.  Incidence is increasing due to hepatitis virus.
*Death rate equal to (or exceeds!) the incidence.  There are more deaths than new cases because of the poor outcome and because metastatic disease to the liver is mistakenly attributed to liver cancer in statistics.

==Risk==
*Roughly 80% of HCC is attributable to either HBV or HCV, of which HBV accounts for ~55% and HCV 25% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16879891]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Persistent HBV infection: 100x-250x risk
*Chronic HCV and cirrhosis: 100x
*Ethanol is carcinogenic. Higher risk of HCC than in non-alcohol-drinkers with HCV.
*Other chemicals: alfatoxin B, nitrites, hydrocarbons, solvents, organochlorine pesticides, primary metals, polychlorinated biphenyls

==Prevention==
*Treatment of HCV with interferon alpha decreases risk of developing HCC

==Clinical presentation==
Asymptomatic in early stages.  Detected with AFP and ultrasound in patients with liver disease.  Many patients are asymptomatic even in advanced stages.  The majority of symptoms are from liver disease itself.  Tumor-related symptoms are palpable mass in abdomen, acute onset pain from hemorrhage, dull pain, abdominal fullness, low grade fever, obstructive jaundice, and splenomegaly.  

==Biology==
*Rapid doubling time of 41 days

==Workup==
*Triphasic CT scan is most sensitive imaging modality (more than MRI). Since AFP has a 10-15% false positive rate and may be elevated in HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), or some colon metastases, since 2005, the AASLD has recommended the triphasic CT scan as the distinguishing test of choice for radiologic diagnosis of HCC. 
*Metastases are rare at presentation
*Indocyanine green (IDG) 15-minute retention rate for determining eligibility for resection

==Staging==
===Current staging===
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
Note: Staging applies only to hepatocellular carcinoma (no longer includes intrahepatic bile ducts)

''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - Solitary tumor without vascular invasion
*T2 - Solitary tumor with vascular invasion or multiple tumors none more than 5 cm
*T3
**T3a - Multiple tumors more than 5 cm
**T3b - Tumor of any size involving a major branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein
*T4 - Tumor with direct invasion of adjacent organs, other than the gallbladder, or with perforation of visceral periteonum

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes
:Regional nodes include: hepatic artery, portal vein, hilar, hepatoduodenal ligament, inferior phrenic, caval lymph nodes

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping:''
*Stage I: T1 N0 M0
*Stage II: T2 N0 M0
*Stage IIIA: T3a N0 M0
*Stage IIIB: T3b N0 M0
*Stage IIIC: T4 N0 M0
*Stage IVA: N1
*Stage IVB: M1

===Older staging editions===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
Note: staging was also used for intrahepatic bile ducts

*T1 - Solitary, &lt;= 2cm, without vascular invasion
*T2 - Solitary &lt;= 2cm with vascular invasion; multiple, limited to one lobe, &lt;= 2cm, without vascular invasion; solitary, &gt;2 cm, without vascular invasion
*T3 - Solitary, &gt;2cm, with vascular invasion; multiple, one lobe, &lt;= 2cm, with vascular invasion; multiple, one lobe, any more than 2cm
*T4 - Multiple tumors, involving more than one lobe; invasion of a major branch of portal or hepatic veins; invasion of adjacent organs other than gallbladder; perforation of visceral peritoneum

*Stage I: T1 N0 M0
*Stage II: T2 N0 M0
*Stage IIIA: T3 N0 M0
*Stage IIIB: T1-3 N0 M0
*Stage IVA: T4
*Stage IVB: M1

==Prognosis==
*Fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis

==Treatment==
Most studies include both mets and primary liver cancer; for now they are kept together. Please see the main [[Radiation_Oncology/Liver|Liver]] page.


*HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) tumors can be classified as resectable (can be removed by an operation) and unresectable (cannot be removed by an operation).  Only 10-15% of cases can be effectively treated with surgical resection.
*Surgical resection with 2-cm margin of liver for T1-3 N0.  Minimum of 1-cm is recommended but literature is mixed on the exact margin required.  
*For unresectable, chemoembolization, intraarterial infusional chemo, cryosurgery, ethanol injection, radioimmunotherapy, conformal radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation. 
*For stage IV, chemotherapy, but low response rates.

*The radionuclide 131-Lipiodol treatment is believed to offer a significant reduction in recurrence rate for resectable HCC.  A 1999 Lancet study by WY Lau et al (PMID 10459961) report an improvement in the 3-year survival rate from 46.3% (control group) to 86.4% (treatment group).  This treatment is not yet approved in the United States, but it is in Phase III clinical trials in Singapore and can be administered in Hong Kong.


===SBRT===

== Cauchy-Schwartz inequality ==

The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality states that the magnitude of the inner product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of the vector norms, or:
&lt;math&gt;| \langle x,y \rangle |  \le  \| x \| \| y \| &lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

For any vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in an inner product space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and denote it by &lt;math&gt;x \bot y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Orthogonal complement and matrix transpose ==

== Applications ==

=== Linear least squares ===

=== How to orthogonalize a basis ===
Suppose to be on a vector space V with a scalar product (not necessarily positive-definite), 
&lt;br&gt;
'''Problem:''' Construct an orthonormal basis of ''V'' starting by a random basis ''{'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''}''.
&lt;br&gt;
Solution: Gram-Schidt for non isotropic vectors, otherwise choose v_i + v_j and reiterate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PHP==
PHP, which stands for 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor', is an open source scripting language.  It can be embedded in html, similar to how JSP.  Here's the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php wikipedia page].
===Type===
PHP is a little hard to classify. The creators declare that it's a web development scripting language and, well, it is.  Though it's largely proceedural and has slowly gone towards being an object oriented language (PHP 5).  So, really PHP can be what you want it to be.  Though note, it's an interpreted language, which can be compiled down some. 
[http://us2.php.net/manual/en/introduction.php PHP.net's introduction pages]
===Execution Entry Point===
PHP is generally accessed from a webserver processing an html page with some php in it, or a php file.

In an html file: 

 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 Hello World! &lt;br&gt;
 Today is 
 &lt;?
    $date = date('D M dS');
    echo $date;
 ?&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
   
Or you can create an entire php file by enclosing the entire thing in the &lt;? and ?&gt;.  The general trend is to call these files .php files for files that render something like html and .inc files for library files.

===General Syntax===

Variables contain a '$' in front of them and do not need to be declared.  Lines end with a semicolon, like in C. As with most web development scripting languages, there are a few global variables, like $_SESSION and $_POST, $_GET, and $_REQUEST.

A general assignment goes like this: 
 $a = 'bar';
 $b = 4;

===Comments===

 // this is an inline comment.  Everything after the // is a comment.
Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */

Php contains phpdoc - where you can create an html manual from comments before the function declaration.  They look like this:

 /**
  * Function description
  *
  * @param  &lt;datatype&gt;   &lt;$name of var&gt;   &lt;description of var&gt;
  * 
  * @return &lt;datatype&gt;
  */

There's a few other @ types you can use here.  Sources of how to generate phpdocs are needed.  More to come. 

===Variable Declarations===

declare i as an integer 
 $i = 1;

Or:
 $str = 'string';

There's no datatype declaration required, so you can change a variables datatype though assigning it to something else:

 $foo = 1;
 $foo = 'string';

One stumbling block with this is that you need to know how to concat strings versus adding values. 

For concating strings you can use the &quot;.&quot; or &quot;.=&quot;.  If you want to add values use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;+=&quot;.  

If you do this: 
 $foo = 'string';
 $foo += ' is cool';

You'll end up with some number verus &quot;string is cool&quot;, as you've added strings and not concatinated them. 

===Method Declaration/Implementation===

Function declaration: 
 function foo( $param1, $param2 ) {
     return 'hello';
 }

You can default parameters like this:
 function foo( $param1, $param2=100 ) {
     return 'hello';
 }

You don't need to declare any return value.

When you declare a function to use with in a class, it looks just the same as the one shown above, with the only difference is with it being physically located inside a class boundary. 

 class Foo { 
  function bar () {
      return 'something';
  }
 }

===Scope===

All variables have a single scope in PHP.  If it's in a function, then it has local scope. If it's outside a function, then it has global scope.  

You can create a global variable in two ways.  The first way is by putting it outside a function.  The second way is to declare it this way:

 global $foo;

This makes it available from anywhere. 

To access a global value from inside a function you need to declare that you're using it, otherwise php thinks it's completely different from the global variable. 

YES: 
 $foo = 2;
 function foo() {
     global $foo;
     $bar = 1;
     return $foo + $bar;
 }

NO:
 $foo = 3;
 function foo() {
     $bar = 1;
     return $foo + $bar;
 }

PHP will create the $foo inside of the function and not associate it with the global $foo. The two $foo's are completely different entities in the &quot;NO&quot; example. 

$bar is local and it's scope is limited to the function. 

PHP has excellent [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php documentation] on scoping available. 

===Conditional Statements===
There's the typical if/else statements:

 if( $a == $b ) {
     $c = $d;
     // can put more statements here
 } else if ( $b == $c ) {
     $c = $e;
     // can put more statements here
 } else {
     $c = $f;
     // can put more statements here
 }

Braces can be removed as long as there's only a single statement after the condition:
 if( $a == $b ) 
     $c = $d; // only one statement allowed
 else 
     $c = $f; // only one statement allowed

Another valid way to write an if statement is like this: 

 $bar = (($foo == true) ? 'test' : 'not test');

The first two are a bit easier to read. 

There's also a case/switch conditional:

 switch ($foo) {
     case 'foo':
        echo 'bar';
        break;// breaks out of the switch case, to prevent us from running 
              // the stuff below this. 
     case 'bar':
        echo 'foo';
        break; // breaks out of the switch case, to prevent us from running 
               // the stuff below this. 
     default: 
        echo 'empty';
 }

Please visit [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php php's structure page] for more information and alternate ways conditions can be written. 

===Looping Statements===
PHP includes the tradional loops - a for loop, while and do while. There's a foreach loop as well.

For: 
 // prints out the numbers from 0 to 4, as soon as $i equals 5 it stops. 
 for(
     echo $i;
 } 

PHP has a special foreach loop that's useful for dealing with arrays:

 foreach( $fooArray as $key=&gt;$value ) {
     // starting at the begining of the array it will give the key (index) 
     // and value for each item.
 }

 // you can also just say:
 foreach( $fooArray as $value ) {
     // you don't need to use $key
 }

While: 
 
 // this counts backwards from 100 printing out each number like this 
 // &quot;100...99...98...&quot; and so on until it reaches 0, then stops
 $i = 100;
 while( $i &gt; 0 ) {
     echo &quot;$i...&quot;;
     $i--;
 }

 or

 // keeps checking the $cond variable and stops when it equals false
 // if $cond == false from the start, the stuff in the loop will never execute. 
 while( $cond != true ) {
     // do something
 }


Do while: 

 // this does the same thing as the above &quot;for&quot; loop, only it always executes 
 // at least once before it checks if the condition ($i &lt;5) has been met, 
 // or is still good. 
 $i = 0;
 do {
     $i++
     echo &quot;$i...&quot;;
 while( $i &lt; 5 );

Please visit [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php php's loop page] for more information on loops and alternative ways of writing them.

===Output Statements===


Here's how to print out 'Hello World!' in PHP. 

 echo 'Hello World!';

When you want to include a PHP variable inside the string you need to use double quotes, as PHP will not parse the data between single quotes, it will just print it out. 

 $foo = 'bar';
 echo &quot;foo$foo&quot;; 

 // prints out foobar;

It's good to use single quotes when there's no variables in the string as it saves processing time.

===Error Handling/Recovery===
&lt;Describe error handling and recovery.  Give examples as appropriate.&gt;

===Containers===
PHP has an array as a native data type. To use: 

 // example 1
 $ages = array();
 $ages['Bobby'] = 12;
 $ages['Rob'] = 12;

 // example 2
 $foo = array();
 $foo[0] = 8;
 $foo[1] = 9;
 $foo[] = 10; // puts 10 in $foo[2]

 // example 3
 $bar[0] = 12; // don't need to specifically declare $bar, it's just nice to. 
 $bar['total'] = 3;
 $bar[] = 13; // put's 13 in $bar[1]

Arrays in PHP are very powerful and useful.  They can be used like a hash, as in the first and third example - you can use index's and strings into the arrays.  You don't necessarily need to declare the array, though it's a good practice.  Also, you can just write two brackets, as in $foo[], to signify that you want the data to go into the next index, as in example 2.   

===Algorithms===
&lt;List algorithms or references to lists of algorithms available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate algorithms if they are not native to the language.  Or, if not available, describe that.&gt;
===Garbage collection===
&lt;Describe whether the garbage collection is automatic or manual.&gt;
===Physical Structure===
&lt;Describe how the files, libararies, and parts are typically divided and arranged.&gt;
===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;
===Web References===
There's a great PHP library at [http://www.php.net php.net].  This has the manual there as well as library pages - so it's probably appropriate for any user who's famililar with programming to some degree.  You'll definitely need this page as a reference for the libaries.

===Books and Articles===
&lt;List additional books and articles that may be helpful. Please include for what level reader the references are appropriate. (beginner/intermediate/advanced)&gt;

Please do not perform copy and paste moves.  Use the [[Help:Renaming (moving) a page|page move]] tab to rename pages.  That's what it is for.  I've done a history merge to clean up the mess.  But I leave it to you to check that the current version of the article is the latest version (which is sometimes not the case after history merges) and revert to the correct version if it is not. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
:Unfortunately, your cleaning has made &quot;Climate Change&quot; and &quot;Climate change&quot; both be redirect pages, which lead no where. I will use the revert method that I found in the help section to revert &quot;Climate Change&quot; back to it's previous form. Thanks for the advice though. I wanted to use move, but there was some trouble because &quot;Climate Change&quot; was already a page (empty though, and possibly made by me). Probably there is a simple way to deal with that situation, but I thought cutting and pasting was the most straight forward way, especially considering the very small number of pages linking to Climate C/change right now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Picking the right editor is essential for web designers. Here we will cover some of the pros and cons of working with certain editors.

==Studio 8==
[[wikipedia:Studio|Studio]] is a software suite from Adobe Systems that includes Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks 8, in addition to Contribute 3 and FlashPaper 2.

Cost: $900 US

'''Pros'''
:'''Easy to Use:''' Simple, some more complicated functions in Flash, but no coding necessary.
:'''Standards Compliant:''' Complies with W3C

== Frontpage 2003 ==
[[wikipedia:Frontpage|Frontpage]] is a very neat and handy utility. It offers people to create websites who know zero [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]].

Cost: $199 US

'''Pros'''
:'''Easy to use:''' Anyone who can use word, can use Frontpage.
:'''Projects:''' You can create projects and Frontpage will automatically re-link documents when filesystem changes occur.

'''Cons'''
:'''Doesn't play nice:''' Frontpage has a tendency to re-write your document to structure code. This usually wipes out PHP code in the document.
:'''Overly Re-writes:''' I dont know how many times i've looked at code by Frontpage to only see a plethora of CSS styles. Can get annoying if you are used to a certain way of coding.
:'''Poor Design:''' Code is non-W3C complient and hard to use.
:'''Lack of Support:''' No longer supported by Microsoft.

== Notepad ==
[[wikipedia:Notepad|Notepad]] requires you to know pretty much every aspect of HTML, however a wise choice for people who dont like to be told how to code.

Cost: Free

'''Pros'''
:'''Runs fast:''' No matter what the system (Windows), notepad always preforms.
:'''No Re-writes:''' Notepad doesn't re-write anything, because it can't.

'''Cons'''
:'''No Projects:''' No way to manage your documents without external applications or by manually re-writing.
:'''No Indent Holding:''' Notepad does not keep your indents, making you tab in over and over.

{{TODO|Should also list at least Zend, ActiveState Komodo, emacs, vi, Expression Web PHP vs ColdFusion, PHPStorm, Notepad++}}

[[Biochemistry/Enzymes|&lt;&lt; Enzymes]] | [[Biochemistry/DNA and RNA|DNA and RNA &gt;&gt;]]
----
What is life? What makes life work? Life is not static; it is defined by activity. A cell has to perform certain tasks to stay alive. This activity has to be powered by fuel; the fuel is converted into energy, to keep the cell running, building blocks for new biomolecules, and waste products. This process is called '''metabolism'''.

== ATP as an intermediate energy carrier ==
We have [[Biochemistry/Metabolism and energy|already seen]] how ATP is a universal &quot;energy currency&quot; in the cell, and how its high-energy phosphate can store and release this energy efficiently. But ATP is only a short-term energy storage; a hard-working human can use up to one pound of ATP per minute. How can that be?

The answer lies in the medium- and long-term energy storage molecules, notably ''phosphoenol pyruvate'' (PEP), ''acetyl phosphate'', and ''creatine phosphate''. Each of these molecules carries a phosphate group with an ever higher transfer potential than that of ATP. ATP is continuously regenerated by transferring phosphate groups from these molecules to ADP. For example, the reaction of creatine phosphate is
&lt;center&gt;Creatine phosphate + ADP + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ⇋ ATP + creatine&lt;/center&gt;
a reaction which is catalyzed by the creatine kinase, and highly in favor of the &quot;ATP side&quot; of the equation.

== Electron carriers ==
Most of the energy of eucaryotic lifeforms derives from oxidating fuel molecules, that is, the transfer of electrons from fuel molecules to oxygen. The fuel molecules are oxidized, while the oxygen is reduced. A rather radical form of oxidation is fire, which oxidizes its fuel directly with oxygen. As spontaneous combustion one ones cells is rather unpleasant, the electrons are carried through several steps from the fuel molecules to the final electron acceptor, oxygen. The flow of electrons causes a proton gradient in the mitochondrial membranes, which in turn is used by the enzyme ''ATPase'' (or ''proton pump'') to generate ATP. This process, utilizing an''[[Biochemistry/Electron Transport Chain|electron transport chain]]'', is called ''oxidative phosphorylation''.

The electron carrier molecules of choice are ''NADH'' and ''FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. They are ''pyridine nucleotides'' (also called ''flavions'').
{|
!
!Reduced form!!Oxidized form
|-
!NADH
|align=center|NADH||align=center|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
!FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=center|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||align=center|FAD
|}

Both molecules are also for biosyntheses that require reducing power. Especially a variant of NADH, ''NAD'''P'''H'', is used for this purpose.

With all these high-energy bonds and electron-carrying molecules around, one would expect to see wild, uncontrolled chemical reactions occurring in the cell. However, the opposite is the case: ''Without a catalyst'', ATP is quite slow to hydrolize and give its phosphate group to water. Also, all three electron-carrying molecules, NADH, NADPH, and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are slow to react with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''without a catalyst''.

==Cancer Cell Metabolism==
'''Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer'''

The Warburg observation that cancer cells use up an unusually high level of glucose and produce more lactic acid has been around since the 1920’s.  It wasn’t noted till 1955 by Eagle, that cancer cells also use up a high level of the amino acid glutamine.  In the article, Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer, Wise and Thompson highlight the role glutamine plays in cancer cell growth, protein translation, anaplerosis, and macromolecular synthesis.

Glutamine is the chief donor of nitrogen to cancer cells for the cells to multiply.  When glutamine gives up its amide, it is converted into glutamic acid, which is the main nitrogen donor for nonessential amino acid synthesis.  This amino acid biosynthesis makes glutamine a main ingredient for the cancer cells’ need for protein translation.  Stemming off of biosynthesis is Myc, a basic protein that binds 11 of the genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis.  Myc activation is a commonly observed in cancer and is identified as the driving force behind the spread of lymphomas and small cell lung cancer.  Myc facilitates glutamine consumption and supports the change of glutamine into glutamic acid, and finally into lactic acid.  This satisfies the Warburg observation of the unusual lactic acid production of cancer cells. 

The target of rapamycine (TOR) controls many cell functions such as cell growth, reproduction, motility, and protein synthesis.  The “master regulator of protein translation, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (TOR), is responsive to glutamine levels” (Wise and Thompson, 2010).  This was initially discovered in yeast, where TOR activation was found to be dependent on glutamine levels. 

The article also describes how glutamine adds to macromolecular (DNA, RNA, and proteins) synthesis by producing NADPH (nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide phosphate, a reducing agent in anabolic reactions) and providing the cancer cell with a substrate source which refills the mitochondrial carbon pool (anaplerosis).  This refilling of the carbon pool is necessary for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides.  

All of these facts relating glutamine importance to cancer cells may be a potential target in altering cancer cell metabolism.  However, it is still unknown if this is a viable target for the treatment of cancer.  Ideas include suppressing the glutamine uptake, TOR activation, or the anaplerosis of the cancer cells.  Using an enzyme to lower blood glutamine levels is another possible method.

Thank's for the welcome, he who must not be named. I still haven't been welcomed on Wikipedia yet for some reason, probably because I already had people talking on my talk page, but it's nice to be recognized. I've been working on some of the game guides here, and a lot of the articles on wikipedia itself.--[[User:BigCow|BigCow]] 17:55, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

:Your own personalised welcome is awaiting you at WP. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:39, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called BigCow. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name BigCow~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hello ==

&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;stub&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cef2e0;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sim man. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sim man~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Marfan Syndrome'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*What is your understanding of why you were referred to genetics
*What are your main concerns
*Explain that they are there to determine if they might have a genetic condition called Marfan syndrome and give overview of Marfan

==Outline session==
*I will begin by taking a family history
*Our resident _____ will take a medical history
*She and Dr. Doktour will perform a physical examination
*We will then discuss whether or not we believe a diagnosis can be made or if there are other tests that need to be performed
*If a diagnosis is made we will discuss Marfan syndrome in more detail
*We will also answer any questions you have

==Overview of Marfan syndrome==
*A heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects many organ systems, including the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart and blood vessels.
*The condition affects both men and women of any race or ethnic group
*occurs in 1-2 people per every 10, 000

==Symptoms of Marfan syndrome==
*high degree of clinical variability
*ocular findings: myopia, displacement of the lens, retinal detachment, glaucoma, early cataract formation
*skeletal findings: bone overgrowth, joint laxity, long extremities, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis, high arched palate, positive wrist and thumb signs, reduced upper to lower segment, arm span to height ratio &gt;1.05, flat feet
*cardiovascular findings: dilatation of the aorta, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, triscupsid valve prolapse, enlargement of the pulmonary artery
*other systems involved: pulmonary, skin, nervous

==Diagnosis of Marfan==
*Diagnosis is made clinically (see diagnostic criteria below for details)
*based on family history and the observation of characteristic findings in multiple organ systems
*no family history? 2 major criteria and 1 minor (3 systems)
*with a family history? 1 major and 1 minor (2 systems)
*sometimes we're very confident in the diagnosis (and sometimes sure of a negative diagnosis), sometimes we're just not sure and we may follow a person for a while, sometimes we think there may be another diagnosis
*What will a diagnosis mean
*predisposition for aortic rupture and other heart problems so must have cardiology exams for echocardiograms (monitor aortic root growth - beta-blockers may be prescribed)
*orthopedist exams (for early detection of scoliosis and pectus)
*yearly ophthalmology exams (due to various eye problems that can often be treated with corrective lenses, but sometimes require surgery)
*potential for complications during pregnancy (rapid progression of aortic root enlargement) must be closely monitored
*50% chance that future children will inherit Marfan syndrome

==Age of Onset, natural history, and life span==
*Some signs of the syndrome are present at birth
*The serious vascular complications may develop at any time from fetal life through old age and are the chief cause of death in these individuals
*The use of b-adrenergic blockers has been associated with a decrease in aortic dilatation and thus increased life
*The mean age for survival for men = 43 and women = 46
*However, with appropriate management, individuals are reportedly living until their 70's.

==Genetics==
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*75% have an affected parent
*25% due to new mutations
*The disrupted gene is FBN1 - codes for Fibrillin (a protein constituent of connective tissue).
*Located at 15p21
*Molecular genetics
**&gt;100 mutations leading to abnormal splicing of the mRNA have been reported
**The gene is &gt;110 kb and is composed of 65 exons
***A common motif is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) like domain. This domain occurs 47 times
***Each EGF domain contains 6 conserved cysteine residues that from 3 disulfide bonds
***43 of the EGF domains contain a consensus sequence for calcium binding which facilitates inter and intramolecular interactions
***Mutations in any of the conserved calcium binding sequences or the conserved cysteine residues lead to classical Marfan syndrome
*The syndrome is fully penetrant, although the manifestations can vary considerably

==Recurrance Risks==
*If parent affected 50% chance future children will also be affected
*If parent of affected child is not affected then they have a much smaller chance of having another affected child (rare cases of germline and somatic mosaicism)

==Genetic Testing==
(available, but often not used)
*Because FBN1 mutations have been detected in individuals with other fibrillinopathies, the presence of a mutation doesn't by itself confirm the diagnosis.
*Mutations have not been detected in at least 25% of subjects with Marfan syndrome.
*There exists the possibility that the Marfan syndrome phenotype may be produced by mutations in at least one other gene, for this reason, a definitive DNA-based test is not available
*molecular genetic testing for mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene on chromosome locus 15q21.1
*direct mutation screen cumbersome and inefficient due to large size
*up to 70% show positive results
*mutation is not identified in large number of individuals with Marfan syndrome
*If a specific mutation is known within a family, that specific mutation can be tested individuals suspected to be affected
*many mutations in FBN1 cause phenotype different from Marfan syndrome
*mutational screening available on research basis
*Linkage analysis
**Markers are highly informative and are within the FBN1 gene
**Nearly completely informative
**Not available if only one affected individual in family
**Although usually informative caution needed because locus heterogeneity not definitively excluded
*Protein based methods
**Being explored
**Further research needed to determine specificity
**Immunofluorescence studies of extracellular microfibrils with fibrillin antibodies are available as diagnostic aids

==Prenatal Testing==
*Available using linkage analysis if linkage has been established in affected family members
*Or using mutational analysis when disease-causing mutation has been identified
*Ultrasound exam in first two trimesters cannot detect manifestations of Marfan

==Geneotype-Phenotype Correlations==
*Few and none are definitive
*Those with most severe and rapid termed &quot;neonatal Marfan syndrome&quot; have alterations in center of gene exons 24-32 (but not all with severe form have identified mutations and others with mutations in this region have classic or mild variants of Marfan)
*In general mutations causing in-frame gain or loss of coding sequence associated with more severe disease
*Premature termination result in rapid degradation of transcripts associated with mild conditions that fail to meet diagnostic criteria
*Individuals with mutation preventing C-terminal propeptide processing had only skeletal manifestations
*Amino acid substitution may have functional or not have functional importance

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*Diganosis can be made clinically if: 2 organ systems are involved in the presence of an affected first degree relative
*Or, involvement of the skeleton and two or more organ systems is required, as well as the presence of at least one major criterion
*Note: skeletal system qualifies as a major criterion only if at least four major manifestations are present

==Clinical Features (major and minor criteria)==
**Skeletal (can develop in young children and progress during periods of rapid growth)
*Major criteria for diagnosis:
**Pectus carinatum (protruding sternum in convex shape)
**Pectus excavatum requiring surgery (congenital condition in which the sternum is abnormally depressed caused by overgrowth of ribs pushing the sternum in)
**Scoliosis (mild to severe and progressive may require bracing or surgery)
**Reduced extension at the elbows (&lt;170°)
**Pes planus (flatfoot)
**Protrusio acetabuli (pertaining to the hip bone socket where acetabulum abnormally deep and shows accelerated erosion)
**Reduced upper to lower segment ratio
**Wrist sign: thumb overlaps the distal phalanx of the fifth digit when grasping the contralateral wrist (due to bone overgrowth and joint laxity)
**Thumb sign: entire nail of the thumb projects beyond the ulnar border of the hand when the hand is clenched without assistance.
*Minor criteria:
**Pectus excavatum of moderate severity
**Joint hypermobility
**High arched palate with crowded teeth
**Specific facies: dolicocephaly, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia, down slanting palpebral fissures, deep set eyes, palate can be highly arched
**Dolichostenomelia (extremities are disproportionately long for the size of the trunk)
**Arachnodactyly (spider fingers long and thin)
*Major criteria:
**Ectopia lentis (displacement of the lens of the eye in 60% of affected and it is a hallmark feature)
*Minor critieria:
**Flat cornea
**Increased axial length of globe
**Hypoplastic iris or hypoplastic ciliary muscle
*Major Criteria:
**Dilitation of the ascending aorta w/ or w/o aortic regurgitation, involving the sinuses of Valsalva
**Dissection of the ascending aorta
*Minor criteria:
**Mitral valve prolapse w/ or w/o mitral valve regurgitation
**Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, in the absence of valvular or peripheral pulmonic stenosis before the age of 40
**Calcification of the mital annulus before age 40
**Dilatation or dissection of the descending thoracis or abdominal aorta before age 50.
*Minor criteria:
**Spontaneous pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity)
**Apical blebs
*Minor criteria:
**Striae atrophicae (stretch marks)
**Recurrent or incisional hernia
*Major criteria:
**Lumbosacral dural ectasia by CT or MRI

==Management/Treatment==
*Growth
**All individuals should be measured periodically
**Prepubertal girls can have height reduction by taking high-dose estrogen therapy combined with progesterone to prevent endometrial hyperplasia
*Development
**Physical therapy is of value in promoting motor skill development
**Psychosocial family counseling
*Musculoskeletal
**Delays in gross motor development caused by joint hypermobility can be ameliorated with PT and orthopedic braces (as needed)
**Treatment of scoliosis and kyphosis depending on the severity of the curvature
**Pectus excavatum or carinatum may need to be repaired to prevent cardiac or pulmonary compromise
*Cardiovascular
**Follow with a cardiologist
**Echocardiogram required at frequent intervals
**b-Adrenergic blaockade has been demonstrated to slow progression of the aortic root dilatation by decreasing the stress on the aortic wall and the tunica media.
**Graft replacement surgery if necessary
**Most adults with Marfan syndrome will eventually need replacement of the dilated aortic root (5% operative risk) and leaking aortic valve.
**If mitral valve prolapse is diagnosed, standard prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis is recommended for all dental procedures.
**Limit physical activities such as contact sports (football, basketball, hockey, volleyball, boxing, wrestling, etc.)
*Ophthalmologic:
**Myopia most common treated with corrective lenses
**Adequate optical correction must be prescribed and worn
**Assessments of refraction must be performed
**Amblyopia must be treated aggressively
**Lens removal for optical reasons is not recommended (the cataract of Marfan syndrome is a true indication for lens extraction)
**When ectopia lentis is progressive and leads to complications such as iritis, glaucoma etc. the lens may need to be removed.
**Because individuals are prone to retinal detachment, they should avoid contact sports
*Neurologic
**Orthostatic headache resulting from cerebrospinal fluid leakage is often transient. Treat with bed rest or corticosteroids
*Respiratory
**Spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by evacuation of the intrapleural air and restoration of the negative pleural pressure by insertion of a drainage test tube.

==Differential==
*Many of the skeletal features common in general population
*Other disorders caused by FBN1 mutations
**MASS phenotype - mitral valve prolapse, borderline and nonprogressive aortic enlargement, nonspecific skin and skeletal features
**Mitral valve prolapse syndrome - MVP with or without skeletal features
**Predominant aortic aneurysm with other subdiagnostic features of Marfan
**Predominant or isolated skeletal features of Marfan
**Dominant ectopia lentis - lens dislocation with skeletal features
**Familial ectopia lentis - associates eye and skeletal features (prolonged follow-up to differentiate it from Marfan)
**Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome - skeletal and heart findings with craniosynostosis and neurodevelopmental abnormalities (this is likely a genetically heterogeneous condition)
*Other connective tissue disorders share some overlap (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fragile X, Stickler syndrome) Should be easily distinguished by other features though

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior contact
*Ask them what they know already about why they are here and what they hope to get out of the session
*Address any immediate concerns or indicate that they will be addressed later during the discussion
*Reassure them that this is not a diagnostic test so it can't tell us if there is a problem with the fetus or not. A triple screen is performed to pick out a smaller group of pregnancies that are at an increased risk for specific birth defects and to offer diagnostic testing.
*The majority of women with a positive screen will have babies without birth defects
*This does not mean the test was wrong because all it was supposed to do is pick out fetuses at higher risk and allow us to offer diagnostic testing.

==Obtain Medical and Family History==
*It is helpful for me to know some information about your medical history as well as your family history to determine if there are any health problems that may run in the family. (Make sure all the following information was correct on the test report before the visit or while taking the history because it can change the results drastically.)
*Gestational age - marker levels change throughout pregnancy and inaccurate dates are a common reason for a false positive
*Maternal weight - with increased blood volume, the markers will be diluted in the serum and lower their concentrations
*Maternal race - African American women typically have a 10-15% higher [AFP], but a lower incidence of NTD's
*Maternal age - the detection rate and false positive rate for Down syndrome will both be higher in women over age 35
*Diabetic status - Insulin-dependent diabetics have an increased risk of NTD's, but lower [AFP]
*number of fetuses - increases marker levels

==General Information about Triple Screen==
*A triple screen is a blood test that is routinely offered to women under age 35 where amniocentesis is not recommended.
*It is performed between 14-22 weeks gestation (It is most accurate when performed between 16-18 weeks)
*A negative or normal screening result does not ensure that a child will not have a birth defect
*As mentioned before, a positive result is not a diagnosis of an abnormality. It only indicates that a person has a high enough risk to warrant further testing.
*It is easy to get confused when discussing the triple screen because there is a lot of information so please interrupt me and ask questions as they come up or let me know if something is unclear.

==What a Positive Test Means==
*A positive test can tell whether you are at an increased risk for any of 3 disorders, but it can't tell you whether or not the fetus is actually affected
**Open Neural Tube Defects
***Give spina bifida as an example (where the spinal cord didn't form properly and nervous tissue is exposed)
***Can cause motor impairments along with other health concerns
***Does not detect all types of NTDs
***If at high risk mention anencephaly so they can be prepared (where the brain is not formed properly and it is exposed) They may survive to term but die shortly after.
***Explain whether their test showed that they were at increased risk or reassure them that their risk is not increased above the general population risk
**Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 21
***Explain chromosomes
***When there is an extra chromosome it is called trisomy
***Extra genetic material can cause problems in growth and development
***There are a few relatively common trisomies, but the triple screen can detect only two of these
***Explain the features and prognosis of trisomy 18 and Down syndrome
***Explain whether or not their test showed they are at an increased risk for these

==How Does Screening Work==
*Products made by the fetus and placenta can be detected in the mother's blood during pregnancy.
*Levels of these products, referred to as markers, change throughout pregnancy
*Increased or decreased levels of these markers can be correlated to an increased risk of any of the three types of problems that were discussed previously.
*Triple screen measures three markers
**AFP (alpha-fetoprotein --made in the liver and GI tract of the fetus) It is excreted into fetal urine, thus amniotic fluid, then transferred across placenta into maternal blood it increases during 2nd trimester
**hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin - made by the placenta peaks at 10 weeks and falls from there) Pregnancy hormone tested for in pregnancy tests. Important marker for Down syndrome (increased)
**uE3 (unconjugated estriol) - made by the fetus, placenta, and mother it increases throughout pregnancy-- found in both pregnant and nonpregnant women, but at different levels)

==Risk Assessment==
*When the levels of the three markers are determined they are compared to the general population of pregnant women
*The computer takes all factors into account, such as age of the mother and gestational age, to calculate a number (MoM - multiple of the median) that allows us to readily see if the levels are higher or lower than expected
*A value that is 1 means that particular marker is present at expected levels
*However most women do not receive 1's for all three markers and a little variation is common
*It is not bad for the fetus to make different amounts of these proteins, but it is concerning if there are particular patterns to the levels of these three markers.
*A value of 2 indicates that the levels are twice the average expected amount
*A value of ½ indicates that the levels are half the average expected amount
*When risks are determined, all three numbers are looked at together to look for a pattern that may indicate an increased risk for the three specific abnormalities we mentioned already

|}


*screen positive tests for singletons of non-diabetic mothers

===ONTD===
*Only one marker is used to screen for ONTDs.
*Positive screen if MSAFP is greater than or equal to 2.5 MoM
*This indicates an unspecified increased risk of having a child with an ONTD
*(The population incidence is 1 or 2 per every 1000 fetuses)

===Trisomy 18===
*All three markers tend to be lower than expected, but uE3 is the most sensitive marker for trisomy 18.
*The computer program takes your age related risks of having a child with trisomy 18 and calculates a new risk based on all the information
*Your age related risk is _______________________
*Your calculated new risk is _____________________ which means that the chance your fetus does not have trisomy 18 is ____________
*The test is considered to be a positive screen if your new risk is greater than or equal to 1 in 100

===Down syndrome===
*Markers tend to show the pattern in the chart above, but the most important predictive marker is hCG and it tends to be present in higher levels when the fetus has Down syndrome (reason unknown)
*The computer program takes your age related risks of having a child with Down syndrome and calculates a new risk based on all the information
*Your age related risk is ______30_________________
*Your calculated new risk is _____________________ which means that the chance your fetus does not have Down syndrome is ____________
*The test is considered to be a positive screen if your new risk is greater than or equal to 1 in 270 (approximate risk in women age 35 of having a fetus with Down syndrome at time of amnio)

==Reasons for a Screen Positive Result==
*ONTD -- Other conditions can be associated with an elevated MSAFP

===ONTD===
*Normal variant
*Underestimated gestational age
*Multiple pregnancy
*Abdominal wall defect (gastroschisis or omphalocele)
*Feto-maternal bleeding
*Fetal demise
*Other birth defects
*Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications

===Trisomy 18===
*Trisomy 18
*Normal variant
*Inaccurate dating (uE3 levels most predictive)
*Another chromosome abnormality
*Fetal demise
*Steroid sulfatase deficiency (X-liked icthyosis) common reason if estriol is undetectable

===Down Syndrome===
*Down Syndrome
*Normal Variant
*Gestational age (if GA off by more than 10 days should recalculate)
*Multiple pregnancy
*Another chromosomal abnormality
*Triploidy
*Increased risk of third trimester complications (if hCG &gt; 2.5 she should be monitored more closely)

==Follow-Up Options==

===ONTDs===
*Offer ultrasound -
*confirm gestational age (MSAFP increases throughout this time in pregnancy and the g.a. may just be underestimated)
*rule out anencephaly, ONTD, fetal demise, multiple gestation
*If nothing is found on ultrasound and dates are correct
*2.0-2.9 MoM, g.a. &lt;18 wks repeat serum AFP
*&gt;3 MoM, or g.a. &gt; 18 wks offer amnio (measures AFP 90-96% accurate and can also measure Acetylcholinesterase level which detects 99% of ONTD) also detects chromosomal abnormalities
*If the cause of the elevation is still not identified and AFP was greater than 3.0 MoM, serial ultrasounds and antenatal testing should be considered (watch for pre-eclampsia)

===Trisomy 18===
*Offer ultrasound
*Confirm gestational age - off by &gt;10 days call and get a recalculation (uE3 most important increases with gestational age)
*Explain what they look for that might provide clues as to whether the fetus is affected (not diagnostic though so it cannot tell us for sure whether or not the fetus has trisomy 18)
*Offer amniocentesis
*diagnostic testing that will accurately determine if the fetus has trisomy 18 with greater than 99% accuracy
*risks of miscarriage 0.5 % above baseline
*also detects various other chromosomal abnormalities
*If hCG is &lt;2.5 MoM and cause is not identified, a third trimester ultrasound for growth should be considered and patient monitored for pre-eclampsia

===Down syndrome===
*Offer ultrasound
*Confirm gestational age
*if off by 10 days or more and drawn before 15 weeks than repeat at 15-18 wks
*if off by 10 days of more and drawn at or after 15 wks than recalculate the DS risk using corrected age
*Explain other things they will look for on the ultrasound that may be signs of Down syndrome
*Signs are found on ultrasound in about 2/3 of fetuses with Down syndrome
*Whether or not signs are found ultrasound cannot confirm for certain whether or not the fetus is affected.
*Offer amniocentesis (diagnostic testing that will tell us whether the fetus has Down syndrome with &gt;99% accuracy and also detects other chromosomal abnormalities
*If hCG is &lt;2.5 MoM and cause is not identified, a third trimester ultrasound for growth should be considered and patient monitored for pre-eclampsia

==Triple Screen Sensitivity==
*Focus on their results
*These statistics are for the population and don't really affect their results
*They may be confused about this though so address it if there are questions
*Detection rate
*Given the fetus is affected detection rate is the chance that it will be picked up and have a positive screen.
*NOT ALL AFFECTED FETUSES ARE PICKED UP ON TRIPLE SCREEN
*False positive
*Chance of having an unaffected fetus and obtaining a positive screen out of all unaffected pregnancies
*Since there are more unaffected pregnancies than affected pregnancies it may seem like there is a large absolute # of false positives
*If their fetus is unaffected it doesn't meant that the triple screen was wrong because all it is supposed to do is pick out women at increased risk for NTDs, Down syndrome, and trisomy 18.

===ONTDs===
*85% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has an ONTD 85 of them are picked up by this screening (it does not pick up closed neural tube defects)
*80% of cases of open spina bifida
*90% of cases of anencephaly

===Trisomy 18===
*60-80% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has trisomy 18, 60 or 80 of them will be picked up as a positive screen
*.5% false positive rate - means that out of 200 women who are not carrying a fetus with trisomy 18 1 of those 200 would receive a positive screen

===Down Syndrome===

====UNDER 35====
*60-65% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome about 65 will be picked out by this screening
*5% false positive rate - means that out of 100 women that do not have a child with Down syndrome 5 of them will receive a positive screen

====OVER 35====
*85-90% detection rate
*25% false positive rate

==Review==
*Assess if there are any questions or if there is anything that she would like me to explain again
*Assess how she feels about further testing options
*Check for understanding by having her explain how she feels about her risk

(Triple Screen)

==Contracting==
*What do you know about why you have been referred for genetic counseling?
*What have you been told about the triple screen? What is your understanding of your test results?
*What questions or concerns would you like to address?

==Overview of maternal serum screening==
*Background
**Screening test
***Not a diagnostic test
***Used to identify women who are at increased risk for certain birth defects
****These women then offered diagnostic testing
****Negative or &quot;normal&quot; result does not mean that a child will not have a birth defect
****Positive result is not a diagnosis of an abnormality
***Can identify women at increased risk for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, or open neural tube defects
**Blood test
***Fetal and placental products can be detected in mother's blood serum during pregnancy
***Can be offered from 14-22 weeks but most accurate at 16-18 weeks
**Indirect measure of levels of three substances in mother's blood
***Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
****Produced by liver of fetus and excreted into amniotic fluid
****Passes into mother's bloodstream and concentration rises gradually throughout pregnancy
***Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
****Pregnancy hormone made by the placenta
****Level peaks at 10 weeks and declines throughout pregnancy
***Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
****Pregnancy hormone made by fetus and placenta
****Level increases throughout pregnancy
***Some laboratories also measure levels of inhibin-A
****Product of placenta
****Quadruple-marker screening may increase detection rate for Down Syndrome
**Risk assessment
***Markers are expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) in report
****MoM determined by examining results from a large number of women and establishing an &quot;average&quot;
****The median for all markers is 1.0 MoM
****An individual's values expressed as marker level in patient/median marker level
***Laboratory calculates a woman's risks based on levels of three substance plus other factors
****Multiple gestations would cause levels to be elevated
****Gestational age
*****Marker levels change throughout pregnancy
*****Inaccurate dates are common reason for false positive
*****Gestational age can be confirmed by ultrasound
****Maternal weight
*****Increased weight means increased blood volume
*****Markers will be diluted in serum and their concentration lower
****Maternal race
****Maternal age
*****Increased risk for having child with chromosomal abnormality as maternal age increases
*****Women over age 35 have higher detection rate and false positive rate
****Diabetic status
*****Insulin-dependant diabetics have increased risk for neural tube defects
*****Tend to have lower AFP levels, so use lower AFP cutoff
***Evaluation of screening performance
****Up to 100 of every 1,000 women who take test will have abnormal result
*****Only 3 of those 100 women will have a baby with a birth defect
*****Most abnormal test results indicate dates are wrong or another factor above has not been accurately accounted for
*****Abnormal result could also be normal variation
****Pattern of variation in levels may indicate that a woman is at increased risk for a particular birth defect
*Evaluation of abnormal results
**Elevated MSAFP
***Greater than 2.5 MoM
***Conditions possibly causing elevated MSAFP
****Normal variant
****Underestimation of gestational age
****Multiple pregnancies
****Open neural tube defects
****Abdominal wall defects
****Feto-maternal bleeding
****Fetal demise
****Finnish nephrosis
****Some other birth defects
***Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***Follow-up strategies:
****Repeat MSAFP
*****If patient's gestational age is within testable range
*****If only mild elevation (2.5-3.0 MoM)
****Confirm gestational age by ultrasound
****Offer ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Serial ultrasounds and antenatal testing
*****If AFP greater than 3.0 MoM
*****When cause of elevation is not identified
***Neural tube defects
****Includes spina bifida, anencephaly most commonly
****Also includes such conditions as encephalocele and hydrocephalus
****Neural tube is part of developing embryo that brain and spine develop from
*****Neural tube defects due to failure of this tube to close properly
*****About 2,500 babies born each year in US with neural tube defect
****Spina bifida
*****Backbone does not form properly
*****Often spinal cord is malformed and protrudes from back
*****Can cause leg paralysis and bladder and bowel problems
****Anencephaly
*****Upper end of neural tube fails to close
*****Brain and skull severely malformed
*****Babies usually don't survive
****Multifactorial inheritance
*****Both genetic and environmental factors interact to cause this condition
*****About 90-95% of babies with NTDs born into families with no prior history
**Screen positive for Down Syndrome
***Positive if calculated risk is greater than 1 in 270
***Occurs when AFP is decreased, hCG elevated, and uE3 decreased
***Conditions possibly associated with screen positive for Down Syndrome
****Normal variant
****Overestimation of gestational age
****Multiple pregnancies (uncommon)
****Down syndrome
****Another chromosome abnormality
****Triploidy
***Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***Follow-up recommendations
****Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
****Repeat test only if patient was at too early a gestational age for the screen to be performed
****Offer diagnostic ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Ultrasound for growth and monitoring for preeclampsia in 3rd trimester if hCG greater than 2.5 MoM for unknown reason
***Down Syndrome
****Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
****Discuss age-related risk and adjusted risk for Down syndrome
****Clinical features and prognosis
*****Due to extra copy of chromosome 21
*****May cause characteristic facial features, mental retardation, heart defects, and other health problems
*****Cannot predict severity
**Screen positive for Trisomy 18
***When calculated risk is greater than 1 in 100
***Occurs when AFP, hCG, and uE3 are all decreased
***Conditions associated with positive screen
****Normal variant
****Gestational age inaccurate
****Trisomy 18
****Another chromosome abnormality
****Fetal demise
****Steroid sulfatase deficiency (X-linked ichthyosis)
***Follow-up recommendations
****Confirm gestational age by ultrasound
****Repeat only is gestational age at time of screen found to be too early
****Offer diagnostic ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Monitor for preeclampsia and offer ultrasound in 3rd trimester if hCG above 2.5 MoM and no cause identified
***Trisomy 18
****Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
****Discuss age related and adjusted rates for trisomy 18
****Clinical features and prognosis
*****Caused by extra copy of chromosome 18
*****Causes severe mental retardation and health problems
*****Usually fatal within first year of life
*Capabilities and limitations of screening
**Benefits
***May provide reassurance that fetus does not appear to have certain birth defects
***Can help woman manage pregnancy better
****When problems detected, woman can prepare for delivery or treatment needed right after birth
****Prepare mentally, emotionally, and socially for birth of child with birth defect
***May help women over age 35 determine whether to have more invasive procedure
****Negative screen may actually lower risk for chromosome abnormality
****Women with negative screen may choose to avoid more risky procedure
***Monitoring of women with abnormal test result may prevent 3rd trimester complications
**Limitations
***Not diagnostic test
****False positive may produce unnecessary anxiety
****Negative test does not mean fetus does not have birth defect, only that not at increased risk for conditions mentioned
***May be no explanation for abnormal result
****Abnormal results may be associated with pregnancy problems like placental abruption, preterm labor, and low birth weight
****May cause maternal anxiety
***Can't identify all birth defects
****Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 are only chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected with this test
****Amniocentesis is only way to diagnose or rule out chromosome problems

==Other testing options==
*Ultrasound
**May be offered to confirm gestational age or identify multiple fetuses to help interpret triple screen results
**Can detect many major birth defects
**Can rule out 95% of NTDs if visualization is not limited
**Can't diagnose chromosomal abnormalities
*Amniocentesis
**Performed after 15 weeks
**Risks/Benefits
***99.7% accuracy for fetal chromosome analysis
***Detects 96% of open neural tube defects by testing AFAFP
***Cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***Risk of miscarriage due to procedure is 0.5%

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''McCune Albright Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Establish rapport with small talk and introduce myself
*Briefly discuss the topics to be covered during the appointment
*Assess the concerns of the family and ask if they have any questions today

==Elicit Medical History - Clinical Progress Sheet==

==Elicit Family History Update==
*Any changes in family history?
*Any new births or plans for pregnancy?

==Definition==
*McCune Albright syndrome is a disorder characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia accompanied by café au lait spots and endocrine disorders esp. precocious puberty in girls. The patient is fracture prone, and deformity and shortening of the bones may develop.

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance:
**Thought to be sporadic although there have been a few familial occurrences.
**Believed to be a somatic mutation disorder
*Molecular Genetics:
**Identification of activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene
*G proteins are involved in signal transduction pathways that affect the production of cAMP
*An overactive cAMP pathway stimulates growth and function of the gonads, adrenal cortex, specific pituitary cells, osteoblasts, and melanocytes
**Mutations in the gene render it functionally constitutive.
**Proposal that this a disorder of mosacicism (nonmocaicism is thought to be a lethal condition)
*Chromosome location
**Chromosome 20

==Incidence==
*Described in 1936-1937 by McCune and Albright respectively- since then &gt;100 cases have been reported
*The frequency of diagnosis in females vs. males is 3:2

==Clinical Features==
*Endocrine Abnormalities:
**Precocious puberty occurs in over 50% of the female cases and has been reported for males as well
***Menstruation, breast development, and pubic hair growth can occur during the first months of life
***Usually caused by ovarian cysts that secrete estrogen into the blood stream
***Many women with MAS are fertile in adulthood
**Hyperthyroidism:
***50% of patients with MAS have thyroid gland abnormalities
***Enlargement=goiter
***Pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are low in these patients, while thyroid hormone levels may be normal or elevated
***Excessive secretion of growth hormone has been seen in a few patients
*Most develop course facies, enlarged hands/feet, and arthritis characteristic of acromegaly
*Associated with gigantism and gynecomastia
**Adrenal Enlargement:
***Rarely seen
***Excessive secretion of the adrenal hormone cortisol caused by the hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary
***Results in cushing syndrome
*Weight gain, obesity of the face and trunk, skin fragility and cessation of growth in children
*Treatment: removal of adrenal glands or use of drugs that block cortisol synthesis
*Bone Disease (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia):
**Abnormal fibrous tissue growth in many bones
**In affected areas, normal bone is replaced by irregular masses of fibroblast cells leads to deformity and/or thickening of the bones
***When this occurs in weight bearing bones such as the femur, limping, deformity, and fractures can result
***Many children have unequal arm/leg length even in the absence of fractures
**Regions of fibrous dysplasia are also common in the skull and jaw bones
***May result in facial asymmetry
**Severity of bone involvement varies
**Know known hormonal or medical treatment has been proven effective.
**Some surgical procedures such as grafting, pinning, and casting have been used to correct fracture and deformity (skull and jaw changes are often corrected surgically to improve appearance)
*Skin abnormalities:
**Flat areas of increased pigment may be found = café au lait spots
**These spots are usually present at birth, and they usually do not become more extensive
**The pattern of pigmentation is unique
***Starts or ends abruptly at the midline on the abdomen in front or at the spine in the back
***A few have spots confined to small areas such as the nape of the neck or crease of the buttocks

==Natural history==
*Pigmentation is usually evident in infancy
*Bone dysplasia may progress throughout childhood
*The sexual precocity is often unusual, with menstruation occurring before breast and pubic hair development.
*Precocious puberty may lead to short stature

==Testing==
*Currently, testing for a mutation in the GNAS1 gene is done for research purposes.
*It is not a routine test that can be ordered.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Hemihypertrophy, a sporadic condition, has as its most significant feature- limb length asymmetry and sometimes, facial asymmetry. Between 5-8% of these children will develop an intra-abdominal tumor, either Wilms tumor of the kidney or hepatoblastoma.

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*How are things at home?
*Does mom work outside of the home?
*Financial concerns?
*How is the family adjusting?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase Deficiency'''

==Overview==
*Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) is an enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation (FAO). Fatty acid oxidation provides energy for peripheral tissues when glycogen is depleted through hepatic ketogenesis. A defect in the MCAD enzyme causes accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids, metabolized to glycine- and carnitine-esters and dicarboxylic acids, and hypoketonia.

==Genetics==
*MCAD deficiency is caused by a mutation in the ACADM gene
*Chromosomal locus 1p31
*31 known disease causing mutations
*1 common mutation, K304E, accounts for 76% of alleles

==Incidence==
*Common in Caucasians, especially with Northern European ancestry
*Disease incidence 1:4,900 to 1:17,000
*Carrier frequency 1:40 to 1:100
*Less common among Hispanics
*Rare in African-American, and Native-American populations

==Diagnosis==
*Metabolic testing
*Symptomatic individuals should have plasma acylcarnitines, plasma fatty acids, urine organic acids, and urine acylclycines analyzed and interpreted.
*Enzymatic testing
*MCAD enzyme activity should be measured in fibroblasts or other tissues to confirm diagnosis
*Molecular testing
*Molecular genetic testing by mutation analysis (for K204E) or sequence analysis of the ACADM gene can confirm diagnosis
*Newborn screening
*MCAD is part of the newborn screening panel in 9 states (IA, ME, MA, NC, OH, SC, SD, WI, WY).
*Prenatal testing
*Enzymatic or molecular testing can be performed prenatally; however, there is limited benefit to prenatal vs. newborn testing.
*Carrier testing
*Only molecular testing can determine carrier status.

==Clinical Features==
*Typical presentation includes hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy,
seizures, and coma precipitated by prolonged fasting or common illness.
*Hepatomegaly and acute liver disease may also be present.
*Sudden, unexplained death may be first symptom (18%).

==Natural History==
*Typically normal at birth following uneventful pregnancy
*Most present with symptoms between 3 and 24 months in response to prolonged fasting or infection
*Initial presentation in adulthood also possible
*Affected individuals may lose developmental milestones or acquire aphasia or ADD as a result of acute metabolic event
*Individuals identified as newborns typically develop normally under treatment

==Inheritance==
*MCAD deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.

==Testing==
*Enzymatic and Molecular testing can confirm diagnosis.
*Both mutation and sequence analysis are available on a clinical basis.

==Management &amp; Treatment==
*MCAD is a highly treatable condition- good prognosis when managed
*Avoidance of fasting is key-
*Infants should be fed frequently
*Toddlers should be given 2 g/kg uncooked cornstarch before bed
*Low-fat diet and carnitine supplementation may be beneficial

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Other disorders of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) gene family
*Other disorders of fatty acid b-oxidation

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parental guilt over allowing too long of time between feedings which triggered onset of symptoms
*Parental guilt over passing gene to child
*When presenting symptom is sudden death, loss of seemingly healthy child can be devastating
*Parent or sibling may be identified as a homozygote during carrier testing
*Family planning- risk for future offspring/siblings of affected individual

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mosaic trisomy 21 - Transient Myeloproliferative Syndrome'''

==Introduction/Contracting==
*How has everything been going since your last visit in April?
*Do you have any concerns or questions at this time?
*We wanted to follow T in genetics because there is such a wide variability in characteristics, cognitive abilities and health concerns in children with mosaic trisomy 21 and we want to make certain that any special services or health care needs are being met.
*I am going to first ask questions about his medical and developmental hx. since his last visit in April.
*Dr. Doktour will want to take a look at him
*We can answer questions you might have and discuss what our impression is now at this time.

==Medical History==
*Any new medical problems?
*How is he eating? What does he eat? How much?
*Is he still being followed by oncology? What are their expectations for T?
*Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
*Medications
*Review systems briefly to check if any concerns with heart, hearing, eyes, bowel movements or stool, bladder problems, muscle or bone problems (broken bones, muscle weakness), seizures, breathing difficulties or snoring loudly at night, any birth marks or unusual skin findings, allergies.

==Developmental History==
*I noted that you feel his development is appropriate for his age.
*I just want to get documentation of when he achieved certain milestones
*Ask about milestones
*Ask what he is currently doing?
*Typical two-year old can
*Put on clothes, but not button
*Use spoon little spilling
*How does he pick up small objects can he use fingers in pincer grasp
*About how many words is he saying
*Is he combining words, how many?
*Following two step directions
*Does he have a tricycle? How does he do on that?
*Is he still receiving services through Baby Watch?

==Psychosocial Considerations and Counseling==
*Are you considering having more children?
*I know Counselor1 and Dr. Doktour have gone over this, but do you have any questions about recurrence risks or how mosaic trisomy 21 occurs.
*Acknowledge that it has been a lot to go through
*Childhood illness may increase parents worry and/or overprotective behavior concerning their child
*Assess how their support has been and whether they are getting all the help they need
*Assess whether they are worried about cancer recurrence risks

==Mosaic Trisomy 21==
*Occurs in 1-2% of liveborn infants with Down syndrome
*Wide variability in (characteristics) phenotype (ranging from completely normal to full DS phenotype)
*Intellectual develompent varies also (near normal to severe mental retardation)
*How affected an individual is depends on the tissues involved and the proportion of trisomic cells
*Children with DS have 10-20 fold increase in incidence of leukemia
*Most common is a transient leukemia known as transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD)
*7 of 8 families with mosaic trisomy 21 studied it appeared that nondisjunction occurred after fertilization then the cell line with extra copy developed and in 1 there was the presence of a third type of chromosome 21 suggesting it was trisomic embryo that lost one copy in one of cell lines subsequently

==TMD (Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder)==
*Clinically indistinguishable from congenital leukemia
*Unique due to spontaneous remission (no chemo)
*Complete clinical recovery in many cases
*often associated with trisomy 21 cell line, but not always associated with clinical signs of Down syndrome
*case report of newborn boy (Bhatt, ''et al.'', 1995)
*high white blood count, undifferentiated
*initially thought to be congenital leukemia a form that is usually fatal
*14 other cases with no phenotypic evidence of trisomy 21
*clinical course ranged from relatively benign to serious ending up in death
*all survivors showed complete resolution without chemo
*extent of mosaicism variable, but there was at least a decrease in percent of trisomy 21 cells and some had complete resolution
*some had constitutional presence of trisomy 21 (4/15) others only 10 had analysis of skin fibroblasts and they showed normal karyotype

==Recurrence Risks Mosaic Trisomy 21==
*Parents not likely to be at any higher risk than general population because nondisjunction probably occurred in the developing embryo and not the egg or sperm.
*Their risk may be as high as 1% based on empiric risks for parents with a child with full trisomy 21 (this includes risks for other chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomies 18 and 13 and Klinefelter)
*Uncertainty about whether there will be increased risks to the offspring of individuals with TMD. It is possible for them to have germ cell mosaicism for trisomy 21, which would increase risks for their offspring.

==Risks of Recurrence in Cancer==
*Although complete resolution of TMD occurs in most patients with DS, 25% end up developing AMKL within 3 years
*No patient with normal phenotype and trisomy 21 cell line has been described to develop AMKL
*Those with constitutional mosaicism speculated to be at higher risk than those without

==Resources==
*Bhatt, S. et al. Transient Leukemia With Trisomy 21: Description of a Case and review of the Literature. Amer. Journal of Med. Gen. 58:310-314 (1995).
*Pangalos, C; Avramopoulos, D; Blouin, J L; Raoul, O; deBlois, M C; Prieur, M; Schinzel, A A; Gika, M; Abazis, D; Antonarakis, S E. Understanding the mechanism(s) of mosaic trisomy 21 by using DNA polymorphism analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mucopolysacharidosis (MPS)'''

==Contracting==
*Can you explain to me your main purpose in visiting genetics?
*What are your main concerns about the diagnosis?
*Outline session
*First I will update the medical and family history
*Doctor will then probably want to perform physical exam
*Then we will address any concerns or questions

==Medical history==
*Follow interim history form and focus on potential health problems/ symptoms described later in outline

==Update Pedigree==
*Any other brothers or sisters
*Full biological?
*Any other family members with:
*Genetic conditions
*Multiple miscarriages
*Birth defects
*Chronic illnesses
*MR learning difficulties
*Any chance that you and his father related by blood
*Country where relatives are from originally

==Overview==
*Group of inherited metabolic disorders
*Caused by a deficiency of the specific lysosomal enzymes needed to break down mucopolysaccharides
*Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used to build connective tissues and organs in the body
*When mutations occur in the genes for the enzymes that break down mucopolysaccharides, excess amounts of them are stored in the body
*This causes progressive damage to organs and tissues
*Eight clinical types and numerous subtypes have been identified
*Although each type differs clinically, generally, people with mucopolysaccharidoses experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function
*Some of the excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted through the urine and diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests

==Incidence==
*Estimated 1 in 25,000 births in U.S. have some form of MPS:

==Treatment==
*No simple cure for the mucopolysaccharidoses
*Treatment is symptomatic and supportive
*In several individuals, bone marrow transplants have been attempted with varying degrees of success
*Enzyme replacement trials (ERT) are under investigation for MPS I and MPS II
**Kakkis et al. (2001) treated 10 patients with MPS I (aged 5 to 22 years) with recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase at a dose of 125,000 U per kg of body weight given intravenously once weekly for 52 weeks.
**Hepatosplenomegaly decreased significantly in all patients, and the size of the liver was normal for body weight and age in 8 patients by 26 weeks.
**The rate of growth in height and weight increased by a mean of 85 and 131%, respectively, at 52 weeks in the 6 prepubertal patients.
**The mean maximum range of motion of shoulder flexion and elbow extension increased significantly.
**The number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep decreased by 61%.
**New York Heart Association functional class improved by 1 or 2 classes in all patients.
**Urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion decreased after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment; the mean reduction at 52 weeks was 63% of baseline values.
**Five patients had transient urticaria during infusions. Serum antibodies to alpha-L-iduronidase were detected in 4 patients

==ERT==
*treatment consists of a modified form of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme given intravenously
*takes approximately two hours for a person to receive the treatment, and the treatment is usually given every two weeks
*Enzyme replacement therapy can stop and often reverse the symptoms of the disorder
*Disadvantages of the enzyme replacement therapy are its high cost and the fact that it is a lifelong process
*Potential adverse reactions including &quot;allergic type reaction&quot;
*Initial evidence of potential treatment for Hurler syndrome (Keeling KM ''et al.'', 2001)
*Gentamicin-mediated suppression of Hurler syndrome stop mutations restored a low level of alpha-L-iduronidase activity and reduced lysosomal glycosaminoglycan accumulation
*results suggest that the suppression of premature stop mutations may provide an effective treatment for Hurler syndrome patients with premature stop mutations in the IDUA gene

==Types of MPS==
*MPS type I
**Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler/Sheie syndromes also known respectively as MPS-IH, MPS-IS, and MPS-IH/S
**Hurler syndrome takes its name from Gertrud Hurler, the doctor who described a boy and girl with the condition in 1919
**In 1962, Dr. Scheie, a consultant ophthalmologist, wrote about some of his patients who were more mildly affected
**Patients who seem not to fit clearly in either the severe or the mild end of the disorder are said to have *Hurler/Scheie syndrome
**All are caused by missing enzyme - alpha-L-iduronidase
**Alpha-L-iduronidase breaks down (mucopolysaccharides) heparan sulfate and dermatan
**Found at locus 4p16.3
**No reliable way of telling from biochemical tests how severe the disorder will be
**residual alpha-L-iduronidase activity in Hurler fibroblasts is heat-stable whereas that in Scheie fibroblasts is heat-labile
**Progression and severity of disease are highly variable within the spectrum of MPS)

==General symptoms==
*multiple organ and tissue involvement
*Joint stiffness
*Skeletal deformities
*Enlarged liver
*Obstructive airway disease; respiratory infection and cardiac complications are the most common direct causes of death
*Ophthalmologic manifestations and hearing disorders

==Three subgroups of MPSI according to severity==
*Sheie syndrome
*corneal opacities
*aortic valve disease
*normal stature
*mild or absent intellectual impairment
*nearly normal life span
*seldom recognized during infancy or early childhood
*No neurologic involvement
*Joint stiffness, carpet tunnel syndrome
*Mild hepatosplenomegaly
*Hurler/Sheie
**Onset of symptoms between 3 and 8 years of age
**death in 2nd or 3rd decade normal or near normal intelligence
**more severe physical symptoms than those with Scheie syndrome
**short stature
**dysostosis multiplex
**hepatosplenomegaly
**corneal clouding
**umbilical or inguinal hernia
**psychotic symptoms may appear later in life
*Hurler syndrome
**Most severe form
**Occurs in infancy
**Macrocephaly (*may appear early in infancy while complete clinical picture develops during second year of life)
**Respiratory infections*
**Limited hip abduction*
**Apnea or difficulty breathing
**Coarse (gargyloid) facies
**accelerated growth from infancy followed by progressive decline in the rate of development
**progressive physical disability
**progressive mental retardation
**dysostosis multiplex
**corneal clouding
**death usually before the age of 10 years usually result of pneumonia and heart failure

==Inheritance and risks==
*AR inheritance, panethnic
*Parents of affected child have ¼ chance of each pregnancy being affected
*Unaffected sibs of patient have 2/3 chance of being carrier
*Combined frequency: approximately 1 in 50,000
**Hurler: 1 in 100,000
**Hurler-Scheie: 1 in 115,000
**Scheie: 1 in 500,000

==Diagnosis==
*can be diagnosed with a blood looking at levels of alpha-L-iduronidase
*low level of this enzyme in a person's white blood cells is characteristic of the disease
*confirmed by this absence of alpha-L-iduronidase in the white blood cells, the excretion of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate in the urine, and by physical appearance
*Molecular (DNA) analysis can also be used to verify the diagnosis

==Genetic Testing==
*Prenatal diagnosis
*possible once a diagnosis has been made in the family and a genetic alteration identified (CVS and
*amount of alpha-L-iduronidase can be measured in the amniotic cells or chorionic villi Molecular (DNA) analysis can be used to verify the diagnosis prenatally, by looking for the same genetic alteration that is present in the family member
*Carrier testing
*Enzyme analysis using white blood cells is not effective or reliable in identifying carriers of these disorders
*However, a study in 2002 (Mandelli J ''et al.'') showed that leukocyte IDUA from MPS I heterozygotes differed from the normal enzyme in terms of optimum pH, Km, and Vmax of the reaction and thermostability at 50 degrees C. They claimed these parameters provide a simple and reliable tool for the detection of carriers for MPS I.
*molecular (DNA) analysis is used to identify carriers
*first test someone in the family who has already been diagnosed with the disorder, so that the laboratory can identify the genetic alteration present in that individual and look for that same alteration in at-risk family members

==MPS II (Hunter syndrome -differential diagnosis)==

==Overview==
*named after Charles Hunter, the professor of medicine in Manitoba, Canada, who first described two brothers with the disorder in 1917
*Hunter syndrome is less common than MPS I and has no corneal clouding and pursues a slower course than MPS I
*Some think there are two distinct types of the condition, the mild and the severe
*Others believe there is just one disorder with a wide range in the severity of the problems it causes

==Risks and inheritance==
*X-linked recessive
*Rarely girls have been diagnosed
*Mother of affected boy is carrier
*50% risk to future boys
*maternal aunts and sisters at risk of being carrier
*carrier testing available

==Description of symptoms==
*Severe form:
**Joint stiffness
**Mental deterioration
**Dwarfing
**Progressive deafness
**Death by age 15
*Mild form:
**Short stature
**Limitation of motion
**Enlarged forehead, tongue and lips
**Life span may be normal

==Other Differentials==
*MPS III,or Sanfilippo syndrome
**experience progressive dementia and mental deterioration in childhood
**Death usually occurs in the late teens
*MPS IV,or Morquio syndrome
**Symptoms usually appear in infancy and may include severe dwarfing and corneal clouding
**Intelligence is normal
**Cardiac or respiratory disease may cause death in the third or fourth decade of life
*MPS VI,or Maroteauz-Lamy syndrome
**resembles Hurler syndrome
**Onset is in infancy
**intelligence is normal
**Individuals may live into the second or third decade
*MPS VII, Sly disease
**experience corneal clouding, skeletal irregularities, and enlargement of the liver and spleen
**Intellectual impairments vary for this type of MPS

==Drug-induced lysosomal storage disease==
*example of phenocopy
*thought that drugs of widely differing pharmacologic activity can interact with polar lipids within the lysosomes to yield lipid-drug complexes resistant to enzymatic digestion

==Psychosocial considerations==
*Assess how this disease is viewed by patient and family members
*Probably difficult to watch progression of disease may feel helpless
*May seek out every possible therapy (including alternative med. tx)
*Difficulty accepting that life-span may be shortened
*May have been overprotected by parents
*May struggle with feelings of dependence on others
*Discuss support group

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multiple Pregnancy Loss'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*Acknowledge prior phone contact
*Did you come up with any questions you would like us to discuss?
*What do you hope to get from the visit?
*What is your main concern?
*Explain that we will be taking a detailed pregnancy and family history to try to help us provide some answers concerning your pregnancy losses
*We will then have Dr. _________, one of our medical geneticists, come in and we will talk to you and try to answer your questions and explain what we know

==Medical History==
*Why were you referred to genetic counseling?
*Who referred you?
*Who is your current doctor?
*How many pregnancies have you had?
*Confirm when the losses were and what the suspected causes are
*What were you told you about the pregnancy losses?
*What types of testing have they done to try to find a reason for the miscarriages?
*Were you sick at all during the pregnancies?
*Did you drink, smoke or use drugs?
*Any medications during the pregnancies
*Did you take prenatal vitamins?
*Any concerns about anything you might have been exposed to during any of your pregnancies?
*Why do you believe you have had the miscarriages?
*Have you had problems with infertility?
*What type of infertility work up have you had?
*What is the next step in the process for you?

==Family History==
*Take a family history to see if there are any hereditary diseases that may run in your family that may or may not be related to your history of pregnancy losses
*Pedigree (ask specifically about)
*Miscarriages in other family members
*Infertility
*Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Consanguinity
*Country where your ancestors came from

==Psychosocial assessment==
*How are you handling the pregnancy losses?
*Have family members or friends been supportive?
*What do your plans for the future look like?
*Are you currently working outside the home?
*What is your occupation?
*Your husband's occupation?
*Do you have a religious preference?
*Are you in touch with a perinatal loss support group?
*Would you like to be in touch with a support group?
*Is your insurance covering the testing that has been performed?
*Are there any other concerns or questions?

==Trisomy 16==
*one of most common chromosomal abnormalities
*affected embryos or fetuses never survive past first trimester
*is the cause of may first trimester losses
*explain chromosomes
*explain nondisjunction
*reassure her that it is not do to anything she did or did not do
*once a woman has a child with an identified trisomy the risk of having another child with a trisomy is about 1% (is this what you would quote here) this is usually quoted for Down syndrome and trisomy 18 or 13 because they are viable??????

==AMA counseling==
*as women get older their risk of having a fetus or child with a trisomy increases gradually
*there is no magic age at which the risks become high, but at age 35 the risks of having a child with a chromosomal abnormality become high enough that it makes sense to offer diagnostic testing such as amnio (after 15 wks and CVS 10-12 wks)

==Early Pregnancy Loss==
*establishing pregnancy is more difficult than many people realize
*clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in ~15% of pregnancies
*40-60% of all conceptions may be lost, but most of these (3/4) are estimated to be lost before it is recognized clinically
*most miscarriages occur between 6-8 weeks and expulsion between 10-12 weeks
*after 3 consecutive clinical abortions the risk of aborting next pregnancy is 20-55%

==Causes of pregnancy losses==
(only chromosome abnormalities and uterine abnormalities are definitively implicated in pregnancy loss)
*chromosomal abnormalities (most common 70% of first trimester loss)
**balanced translocation carrier (2.7-4.8% of couples with recurrent losses)
**trisomies and other chromosomal anomalies
*Hormonal causes
**Inadequate luteal phase
**Deficient progesterone
*Endometrial factors (endometrial protein expression)
*Uterine abnormalities
**septate uterus
**bicornate uterus
**uterine myomas or fibroids
**DES exposure in utero
*Environmental exposures
**Alcohol (women who drink 2X's week had sig. higher SA than other women but drinkers also tend to smoke also - possible confounding?)
**tobacco ( if ½ pack a day or greater and appears to be dose dependent)
**heavy caffeine intake (moderate intake is not associated with SA)
**chemical solvent exposure in either sex may increase risk
*Immune Causes
**autoimmune problems -- estimated to be cause of multiple SA's in up to 30% of women (woman makes antibodies that will attack her own proteins and those that she has in common with the fetus)
***anticardiolipin antibodies -- type of a group of antiphospholipid antibodies that may be associated with miscarriage
***circulating antibodies to cardiolipin and/or inappropriate coagulation parameters, plus poor reproductive outcome, SLE, or spontaneous thrombosis (the antibodies can react with phospholipids that are required for coagulation)
***SLE - an autoimmune disease thought to be related to SA's (Antichromatin IgG is useful in diagnosing SLE antinuclear antibody testing can indicate many at risk for SLE or some other autoimmune diseases)
**alloimmune causes -- (response to tissues from another individual of the same species)
***theory that must recognize fetus as foreign by the HLA and produce blocking antibodies for pregnancy to progress
***only one of four studies found benefit to leukocyte immunization via paternal leukocyte transfusions
*Diabetes (controlled or unsuspected is not thought to cause SA)
*Infection
**chlamydia trachomatous causes acute and chronic infection of the endometrium which could interfere with implantation (more chlamydia antibodies in women with recurrent SA's but not all studies confirmed this)
**Mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum (controversy over importance in losses)
**CMV but suggests this is rare and causation not proven
**Herpes simplex virus (importance in SA's debated)
**HIV does not increase rates of loss in asymptomatic women
*Psychological factors-two studies showed significant reduction in SA among women who have 3 or more SA's when undergoing counseling once per week during pregnancy

==1. Be able to identify the following terms: ==
# '''Foredge:''' the fore edge of a book, that is, the edge opposite the spine.  
# '''Gutter:''' the inner margin of a pair of facing pages.  This would be the right margin of an even-numbered page (which is always found on the left side) and the left margin of an odd-numbered page (which is always found on the right).
# '''Endsheet:''' a piece of often decorative paper glued to the inside cover of a book.  Its purpose is to hide the raw edge of the cloth covering.
# '''Flysheet:''' the pages at the beginning and end of a book, not glued to the covers.
# '''Signature:''' a large sheet printed with several pages, intended to form four or more leaves in the finished book. The pages are arranged on the sheet so that all of the pages orient the same way and are in proper sequence after the sheet is folded.
# '''Mull:''' a coarse fabric used for lining the spine of a book.
# '''Backbone:''' the spine of a book.  This is the edge of a book that shows when a book is placed on a shelf.
# '''Head:''' the top margin of a page.
# '''Foot:''' the bottom margin of a page.
# '''Deckle edge:''' the uncut and slightly irregular edge of a piece of paper.  
# '''Guarding sheets:''' pieces of paper placed in a book in front of a plate (picture) to prevent ink from the picture from bleeding onto the facing page.
# '''Headbanding:''' a strip of material between a book's spine and the pages.  It usually protrudes slightly above the top edge of the spine.
# '''Casing-in:''' the process of attaching the bound pages of a book to the cover by gluing the endsheets to the inside covers.
# '''Buchram:''' the cloth used on the outside of a book cover.

==2. Describe the difference between the following binding methods: ==
# '''Perfect binding''' A paperback or soft cover book consists of a number of signatures or individual leaves between covers of much heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong flexible glue; this is sometimes called perfect binding. Mass market paperbacks and pulp paperbacks are small (16mo size), cheaply made and often fall apart after much handling or several years.
# '''Hard bound''' A hardbound or hard cover book has rigid covers and is stitched in the spine. Looking from the top of the spine, the book can be seen to consist of a number of signatures bound together. When the book is opened in the middle of a signature, the binding threads are visible. Modern hardcover books are typically of octavo size, though they are often smaller or larger.
# '''Single signature''' A single signature binding is one in which only one signature and the cover are sewn together at the spine.
# '''Spiral (metal and plastic)''' A spiral-bound book is made of individual sheets, each with a line of holes punched near the bound edge. A metal or plastic spiral wire is fed through the holes to hold the sheets together. Spiral binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage.
# '''Saddle stitch''' Stapling through the center fold, also called saddle-stitching, joins a set of nested folios into a single magazine issue.  Most American comic books fall into this category.

==3. Perform the following==
===a. Bind a single signature hand binding &quot;manuscript&quot;.===
A '''manuscript''' is an original copy of an author's work.  Manuscripts are often submitted in the form of typewritten (or computer printed) sheets of paper.  Sometimes the manuscripts are two-sided, and sometimes they are single-sided.

In order to bind a manuscript, it must be converted into a form suitable for folio binding - that is, the binder needs at least two leaves per sheet.  So instead of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper, the binder needs 11&quot; x 17&quot; sheets.  This is accomplished by pasting the sheets together in what will form the ''gutter''.  Once the sheets are pasted together, they can be sewn though the overlapping section and bound normally.

In binding a 16-sheet single-sided manuscript, the right edge of sheet 1 is pasted to the left edge of sheet 16.  Similarly, sheets 2 and 15 are pasted together, 3 and 14, 4 and 13, etc.  An even sheet number is always pasted to an odd so that the middle sheet is not left standing alone.  If there are an odd number of sheets, the first sheet should be pasted to a blank sheet.

When a book is opened, the page on the left side always has an even page number, and the page on the right has an odd page number.  Care should be taken to observe this convention when pasting double-sided sheet together.  Again, for a 16-sheet, 32-page manuscript, page 1 should be laid on the table face down.  Page 32 should be laid face down to the right of it, and the bookbinder should then see pages 2 and 31.  These are then pasted together.

Once the paste has dried, each sheet is carefully folded along the center of the overlapping sections.  The manuscript will resist folding at this seam because the paper is double-thick there.  Nonetheless, this is where the fold should be made.  A bone folder makes this task easier.  The folded sheets are then nested together to form a ''signature'', and the signature is then ready to sew to a cover made of a single sheet of heavier paper.

===b. Bind a blank book using at least four signatures and a permanent cloth hard board binding, using a &quot;case&quot; method. ===
Follow the steps outlined and illustrated in requirement 7, using four signatures of blank pages.

===c. The proper way to &quot;break-in&quot; a new binding.===
A new book should be opened first a few pages from the front cover and the pages should be pressed down.  Then it should be opened near the back cover and again, the pages should be pressed down.  Finally, it should be opened in a few places near the center.  If it is opened near the center first, the book's spine may be broken, and if this happens, the book will always want to open to that page.

===d. Make a &quot;slip case&quot; for your blank book of at least four signatures.===
A slip case can be made from a piece of poster board.  The first step is to measure the book and then draw the layout on the poster board as shown in the illustration:

[[image:Slipcase.jpg|thumb|600px|left|Layout of Slipcase]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
You will want to make the slip case slightly larger than the book's dimensions so that it can be easily inserted and removed.  Once the layout has been drawn on the poster board, cut it as shown in the drawing.  Then carefully make creases where the dotted lines are drawn.  You may use a bone folder to help in doing this, or you may use a ruler.  The folds must be crisp and accurate.

The design shown here calls for an extra fold-in which makes the slipcase walls double thick.  Apply a thin coat of glue to the inside surface of the fold-in, then fold it on top of the slipcase wall.  You may wish to let the glue dry at this point.  

Next, apply a light coat of white glue to the back side of tab 1, and another thin layer of glue to the back side of tab 3.  Do the same for the bottom tabs.  Then assemble the slip case by gluing tab 3 to tab 1, and then gluing tabs 1 and 3 to tab 2.  Clamp the tabs with clothes pins while the glue drys.  Do not insert your book into the slip case until the glue is completely dry, or you may transfer glue to your book!

Once the glue dries, the slip case is finished.  You may decorate the slip case using decoupage (see the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Decoupage|decoupage chapter]] for instructions) if you like, or some other method as you see fit.

==4. Identify and describe the uses for the following binder's tools:==
# A '''Bone folder''' is a tool for folding and creasing paper.  They are traditionally made from the leg bone of a cow or deer, but synthetic bone folders are also available.  Bone folders resemble letter openers.
# '''Kick press:''' a foot operated device used for tightly holding and compressing objects upon which work is being performed.  Presses have many uses in bookbinding.  A text block (that is, the bound pages that have yet to be attached to a cover), is held in a press when the spine is glued up.  It is returned to the press when the cover is attached, and the spine is shaped.
# '''Folding needle:''' a steel needle with a wooden handle sometimes used for working in tight spaces on book covers, such as on decorative corners made of metal (miters).  It is sometimes also used for scoring.
# '''Awls''' are tools with a sharp point at the end of a long shaft mounted in a handle.  They are used for making holes in various materials such as leather (used for book covers) and multiple layers of paper (as in a signature).
# '''Sewing frame:''' a structure upon which books are held while they are being hand-sewn.
# '''Squared card:''' a sheet of heavy stock with two cut edges which together make a 90° angle.  These are used in the same way a carpenter's square is used, that is, in making right angles.
# '''Punch:''' a device for punching holes in material.  These are like sharp tubes driven into the material and removing a usually circular portion.  The waste material goes inside the tube and is sometimes ejected out the top when completely filled.

==5. Define the difference of paper weight in relationship to a ream of paper.==
In countries that use United States paper sizes, a less direct measure known as '''basis weight''' is used in addition to or instead of grammage. The basis weight of paper is the density of paper expressed in terms of the mass of a ream of given dimensions and a sheet count. In the US system, the weight is specified in avoirdupois pounds and the sheet count of a paper ream is usually 500 sheets.  However, the mass specified is not the mass of the ream that is sold to the customer.  Instead, it is the mass of the uncut &quot;basis ream&quot; in which the sheets have some larger size. Often, this is a size used during the manufacturing process before the paper was cut to the dimensions in which it is sold. So, to compute the mass per area, one must know

* the mass of the basis ream,
* the number of sheets in that ream, and
* the dimensions of an &quot;uncut&quot; sheet in that ream.

The standard dimensions and sheet count of a ream vary according to the type of paper.  These &quot;uncut&quot; basis sizes are not normally labeled on the product, are not formally standardized, and therefore have to be guessed or inferred somehow from trading practice.  Historically, this convention is the product of pragmatic considerations such as the size of a sheet mold.

By using the same basis sheet size for the same type of paper, consumers can easily compare papers of differing brands. 20 pound bond paper is always lighter and thinner than 32 pound bond, no matter what its cut size. And 20 pound bond ''letter size'' and 20 pound bond ''legal size'' papers are the same weight paper having different cut size.

However, a sheet of common copy paper that has a basis weight of 20 pounds does not have the same mass as the same size sheet of coarse paper (newsprint).  In the former case, the standard ream is 500 sheets of 17 by 22 inch paper, and in the latter, 500 sheets of 24 by 36 inch paper.  Here are some basic ream sizes for various types of paper.  Units are inches except where noted.

?--&gt;

Sheets 17 by 22 inches can be cut into four 8½ by 11 inch sheets, a standard for business stationery known conventionally as ''letter sized paper''. So, the 17 by 22 inch ream became commonly used.  The 25 by 38 inch book-paper ream developed because such a size can easily be cut into sixteen 6 by 9 inch book-sized sheets without significant waste.

Early newsprint presses printed sheets 2 by 3 feet in size, and so the ream dimensions for newsprint became 24 by 36 inches, with 500 sheets to a ream. Newsprint was made from ground wood pulp, and ground wood hanging paper (wallpaper) was made on newsprint machines. Newsprint was used as wrapping paper, and the first paper bags were made from newsprint.  The newsprint ream standard also became the standard for packaging papers, even though in packaging papers kraft pulp rather than ground wood was used for greater strength.

Paper weight is sometimes stated using the &quot;#&quot; symbol.  For example, &quot;20#&quot; means &quot;20 pounds per basis ream of 500 sheets&quot;. 

When the density of a ream of paper is given in pounds, it is often accompanied by its &quot;M weight&quot;.  The M weight is the weight (in pounds) of 1000 cut sheets.  Paper suppliers will often charge by M weight, since it is always consistent within a specific paper size, and because it allows a simple weight calculation for shipping charges.

For example, a 500-sheet ream of 20# copy paper may specify &quot;10 M&quot;.  Therefore, 1000 sheets (or two reams) will weigh 10 lb (≈4.54 kg).

==6. Describe the color and properties of three types of adhesives using in the binding process and where they are used:==
# '''Hot melt animal glue''' has a brown to amber color range.  It is made from animal hide or bones and is often sold as crystallized flakes.  These flakes must be dissolved in hot water before they can be used.  The mixture must be heated to about 140°F, and will cool quickly.  Once the glue is removed from the heat source, it will become unworkable in about one minute.  However, animal glue can be reheated even years after its initial application and it will return to a workable state.  Thus, a book bound with animal glue can be repaired or rebound years later, as is often done with antique books.  Animal glues are often used in gluing up a book's spine.
# '''Casing-in paste''' is also known as PVA, white glue (such as Elmers), or carpenters glue (which is yellow).  These glues have a much longer working time than animal glues, but they also have disadvantages as well.  If a surface needs to be reglued, PVA must be completely removed from the surface first, because this type of glue will not stick to itself.  This type of glue is used to bond a text block to its cover.
# '''Resin glues''' also range from dark brown to amber, and are more commonly known as epoxies.  Epoxy is a two-part glue consisting of a resin and a hardener.  When mixed together in the proper proportions, the two compounds react chemically to form an incredibly strong bond.  This bond is often stronger than the materials being glued, and thus the saying, &quot;an epoxy joint is forever.&quot;  Resin glues can be used to finish the grain side of leather or impregnated in buckram covering materials.

==7. Know and list the five principal stages of hand binding: ==
===Preparing the Signatures===
To begin, make up the signatures.  This is done by folding the pages into halves, quarters, eighths, or sixteenths.  Folding standard 8.5&quot;x11&quot; pages into quarters works well, as does folding 11&quot;x17&quot; into eighths.  

If making a non-blank book, you need to print the pages in a certain way so that they appear in the proper order and right-side up.  Folding a sheet of paper into quarters will produce eight pages.  Try this on a blank sheet of paper first, number the pages, unfold, and look at how the pages orient themselves on the unfolded paper.  When making a blank book, this step can obviously be skipped.  You can also use the pictures below as a guide.  Note that with the quarto folding scheme, some of the pages need to be printed upside-down.
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-quarto.png‎|&lt;center&gt;Quarto (one sheet, 8 pages)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio4.png‎|&lt;center&gt;Folio (four sheets, 16 pages)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio1.png|&lt;center&gt;Folio (one sheet, four pages)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Once the folding is done, the bone folder or a knife can be used to cut the folds apart at the top, bottom, and outer edge of the pages.  Do not cut the fold along the spine!  The signatures are then ready to be sewn, and the sewing will bind them to a cloth ''tape''.  An even number of signatures will place the final stitch on the same end of the book as the initial stitch, and this will help when it comes to tying it off.

[[image:Bookbinding_fold_signatures.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Folding the Signatures]]
[[image:Bookbinding_cut_folds.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Cut the Folds]]

===Sewing up the Signatures===
====Prepare the ''Tapes''====
Make three to five cloth strips about a half inch wide.  The length of these cloth strips should be a bit less than twice the width of the pages.  The cloth itself should be a fine cotton or linen.  An old pillowcase has been suggested, but any thin cloth will work.  These strips of cloth are called ''tapes''.  Fewer tapes will make the sewing process go faster, but more tapes will yield a better book.

====Stitching====
Mark one of the outside signatures to indicate where the tapes will lie as shown in the photograph.


[[image:Bookbinding_mark_signatures.jpg|300px|thumb|Mark the Signatures]]

Note that the photographs show a very dark thread being used.  This was done to make the thread easier to see for the purpose of illustrating the techniques.  When binding ''your'' book, you will want to use white thread so that it ''won't'' be easy to see in the finished book.  
Begin stitching by passing the needle and thread through the fold from the outside to the inside.  It will be easier to make the hole from the inside of the fold with either an awl or the needle, but the thread should pass from the outside to the inside.  This stitch should be made near the edge of the page, but not ''too'' near the edge.  Leave a couple of inches of thread so you can tie it off when all the sewing is done.  Then pass the needle back through the fold so that it comes out on the other side of the cloth tape.  Do not run the thread through the tape.  Pass the thread over the tape and back into the fold again.  Repeat this process until all the tapes are sewn to the signature.  Then slip the next signature between the tape and the first signature.  Catch the previous stitch as shown in the photograph, and begin stitching the second signature.  

[[image:Bookbinding_initial_stitch.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Making pilot holes in the signature]]
[[image:Bookbinding_catch_stitch.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Catching the Previous Stitch]]

Use the same technique for it as for the first signature.  Stitch in the rest of the signatures, tighten the thread, and tie it off.

===Gluing up the Back===
Once the signatures have been sewn together, pull the tapes tight and apply a thin layer of glue to the spine.  You can use a small artist's paint brush for this.  Work the glue into the cracks between the signatures, but do not let it go too deep or the pages will stick together when you try to open the finished book.  The book is then placed in a press, but you can use a heavy weight, two wooden boards and a few C-clamps, or a shop vise to get the same effect.  

If you use weights to compress the signatures, be careful not to glue the weights to the book's pages.  The idea is to squeeze the pages together as tight as possible while the glue sets.  

If you use wooden boards and C-clamps, sandwich the pages between the two boards and clamp them together with the C-clamps.

If using a shop vise, be sure to pad the vise's jaws so you do not damage the pages.  The glue will strengthen the spine and adhere the threads to the pages.  

[[image:Bookbinding_glue_spine.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Glue-up the Spine]]
[[image:Bookbinding_press_text_block.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Pressing the Text Block]]

The finished product from this stage is called a ''text block''.

===Attaching the Boards===
====Make the Boards====
The &quot;boards&quot; are the book's covers.  Use either a very stiff non-corrugated cardboard or eighth-inch mason board (available at most lumber yards).  [http://guidemagazine.org Guide Magazine] is usually shipped with cardboard liners, so if your church subscribes to it, ask your Junior Sabbath School teacher to save them for you.  Cut the boards such that they are slightly larger (about an eighth inch) than the text block on three sides.  Make sure the boards are square.

Next, get some heavy cloth or heavy paper - whatever you want to use as the outside surface of the book cover.  The remainder of this discussion assumes a cloth cover.  Lay the boards on the cloth with a gap between them.  The width of this gap should be equal to the width of the text block's spine plus triple the thickness of the boards (three eighths of an inch).  Mark the cloth around the boards leaving about a one-inch border.  Cut the cloth, and then clip the corners to within a quarter inch of the corners of the boards:

[[image:Bookbinding_cover_layout.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Laying out the cover]]

Coat the outside surface of the boards with a ''thin'', even layer of glue, lay them on the cloth, and stretch the cloth smooth.  Be sure the gap between the boards is as wide as the text block's spine plus three times the thickness of the boards.  Glue a strip of cloth across the spine, bridging the two boards.  You may also glue a piece of card stock on top of this strip of cloth to further strengthen the spine.  If you do not have card stock, a manila folder or an index card can be pressed into service instead.  This strip of card stock should be as long as the text block's spine.  Be careful not to glue the cover to your worktable.  Ideally, you do not want any of the glue to penetrate the cloth cover, but just in case, you may wish to place a large piece of plastic beneath the cloth when doing this (use the lid from a large plastic storage tub, a plastic bag, or cellophane wrap).  Now place as much weight on the boards as you can muster and leave it there until the glue dries.

====Attach the Covers====
When the glue dries from the previous step, remove it from the press (or remove the weights from the cover) and apply another thin layer of glue to the inside of the book cover.  Then fold the top of the cloth cover over and glue it in place.  Do the same for the bottom, and then fold over the left and right sides.  

Get some wax paper or some plastic and insert two layers of it beneath the first page of the text block.  Apply a thin layer of glue around the edge of the paper using a small paint brush.  It's OK to brush the glue onto the wax paper.  Cover all four edges of the text block, and then add a little more glue to hold down the tapes.  Spread out some more wax paper and turn the text block over onto it.  Repeat the processes for the back of the book, adding glue to the edges of the page.  When you have coated the edges of the back page with glue, remove the layer of waxpaper that the glue was brushed onto, but leave the first layer of waxpaper in place.  This layer will prevent the glue from bonding to the next page and keep moisture out of the rest of the book.

Now carefully lift the text block and place it on the back cover.  Be sure to center it well.  If you misalign it, carefully lift it off and make another attempt.  Now fold the front cover closed onto the front page and make sure the text block is well centered.  Finally, place the book back in the press again (or under a heavy weight) and shape the spine as best you can.  Then let the glue dry.  Don't be impatient at this point.  If the book still smells like glue when you're ready to remove it, it is still too soon, and removing it will cause the pages to wrinkle and curl.

===Finishing===
The &quot;finishing&quot; step in bookbinding pertains to books with leather covers.  The first step in finishing a leather-bound book is to go over the covers with a polishing tool to smooth out any irregularities.  The book can then be placed in a finishing press with a set of embossing plates which will embed a pattern in the cover.  (Alternately, the cover can be tooled by hand in the same way that a leather worker decorates leather.)  When the book comes out of the finishing press, it may be gilded - that is, have a design tooled into it with gold leaf.  Finally, the leather may be varnished.

==Historical Notes==
The Bookbinding honor was introduced in 1935, and discontinued in 1951.  It was reintroduced as an ''Antique Honor'' in 1986.  It was revised and returned to the Vocational category in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acrofacial Dysostosis Syndrome'''

==Definition==
*A condition resulting from problems in the development of the first &amp; second branchial arches. The first arches produce the nerves and muscles for chewing, the lower jaw, 2 middle ear bones, and a small part of the ears. The second arches produce the nerves &amp; muscles of facial expression, 1 middle ear bone, most of the external ears, and parts of the bone above the larynx.

==Characteristics==
*underdevelopment of the cheek and jaw area (micrognathnia and malar hypoplasia)
*feeding and breathing problems in infancy
*down-sloping palpebral fissures
*absence of the lower eyelashes
*lack of development of the internal &amp; external ear with temporary or long-term hearing loss
*possible cleft palate
*underdevelopment or absence of the thumb
*shortened forearms &amp; poor movement in the elbow/limited range of arm motion
*stomach &amp; kidney reflux
*normal intellect
*possible missing, overlapping, or webbing of the toes, clubfeet, hip dislocation, or underdeveloped ribs may occur

==Incidence==
*very rare

==Etiology==
*Unknown - may represent new mutations of an autosomal dominant trait or variable expression
*Genetic testing is highly recommended

==Genetics==
*located on chromosome 9q32

==Prognosis==
*may be lethal is there is lung hypoplasia

==Management==
*Possible need for a tracheostomy to help with breathing
*Possible need for a gastrostomy tube to assure proper nutrition
*craniofacial surgery to the jaw, cleft palate, &amp; ears
*plastic surgery for eye, jaw, ears
*orthopedic surgery for arms, hands, feet, or toes

==What are Neural Tube Defects?==
*NTDs are serious birth defects that involve incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or protective coverings for these organs
*The cause of NTDs is not completely understood, but involves both environmental and genetic factors (multifactorial inheritance)
*Sometimes NTDs can occur as part of a larger chromosomal or malformation syndrome (like Meckel syndrome where other malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, polydactyly, renal cystic disease and eye defects may be seen)
*There are three types of NTDs:
**Anencephaly
***Infants born with anencephaly have underdeveloped brains, incomplete skulls, and usually survive only a few hours after birth
**Encephalocele
***Infants have a hole in the skull through which brain tissue protrudes; most affected infants do not survive or are severely mentally retarded.
**Spina bifida
***This is the most common NTD affecting approximately 1/1000 newborns in the U.S.
***It results from the failure of the spine to close properly during the first month of pregnancy. The precise cause of this defect is not completely understood.
***There are three types of spina bifida. In order of increasing severity, they are:
****Spina bifida occulta
*****Includes individuals with a spinal defect associated with a pigmented or hairy patch of skin as well as individuals with absence of one or two vertebral arches.
*****The first group shows an increased incidence of NTDs in offspring and siblings, but the second group (which is about 5% of the population) shows no evidence of any increased risk.
*****This form of spina bifida usually has no symptoms.
****Meningocele
*****This is the rarest form of spina bifida in which a cyst or lump consisting of membranes surrounding the spinal cord pokes through the open part of the spine.
*****The cyst can be removed by surgery, allowing for normal development.
****Myelomenigocele
*****This is the most severe form of spina bifida where the protruding cyst contains membranes surrounding the spinal canal, nerve roots of the spinal cord, and often the spinal cord itself.
*****Or there may be no cyst, but a fully exposed section of the spinal cord and nerves.
*****Surgery to close the back is generally performed within 24 hours after birth to reduce the risk for infection and to preserve the existing function in the spinal cord.
*****Individuals with more severe spina bifida usually have paralysis and need surgeries and other extensive medical care.
*****The severity of the paralysis is determined by the spinal nerves that are involved. In general, the higher the cyst on the back, the more severe the paralysis.
*****Often, children need to use crutches, braces, or wheelchairs due to mobility deficits.
*****The condition can also cause bowel and bladder complications.
***Some children with spina bifida have learning problems. They may have difficulty paying attention, expressing or understanding language, organizing, and grasping reading and mathematical concepts.
***Hydrocephalus can accompany severe spina bifida
****This is an accumulation of fluid in the brain
****Is it controlled by a surgical procedure called &quot;shunting&quot; where the fluid that builds up in the brain is redirected into the abdominal cavity
***Children with spina bifida may be more prone to developing latex allergies
*Recent studies show that folic acid, a water-soluble B vitamin, is one factor that may reduce the risk of having a baby with a NTD.
**A vitamin with 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day is recommended for most women. This is the same as 0.4 milligrams (mg).
**If a woman is at an increased risk of having a baby with a NTD, it is recommended that she take a higher dose of folic acid. This should be 4000 mcg of folic acid for 1-3 months before becoming pregnant. This is the same as 4.0 mg.
**Taking folic acid will not guarantee a healthy baby.
*Birth defects such as NTDs can occur in any family.
*Be aware that the patient may feel guilty if she did not take folic acid before her pregnancy.

==Quote Risks==
*Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect.
**95% of babies with NTDs are born to parents with no family history of the disorder.
**The incidence of a NTD in the population is 1/200 - 1/1000 (This is 0.1% - 0.5%).
*When NTDs do appear to run in the family, it does not follow any particular pattern of inheritance.
*Women with certain chronic health problems like diabetes and seizure disorders (treated with certain anticonvulsant medications have an increased risk of having a baby with a NTD. This risk is approximately 1/100 (MOD)
*If one sibling is affected, the recurrence risk is approximately 2-5% based on the population incidence (Harper).
*State the risk in both ways (2% risk of abnormality = 98% chance of healthy baby)

==Discuss the Screening Options for NTDs==
*Maternal Serum Screening, level II ultrasound, &amp; amniocentesis are three testing options that may tell you if your baby is at an increased risk for a NTD.

==Maternal Serum Screening==
*What is it?
**A blood test that measures three different substances in the mother's blood
***Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
***Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
***Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
**It is routinely offered between 14 and 22 weeks of pregnancy
***Most accurate when done between 16-18 weeks
**It is NOT a diagnostic test; it is a screening test
**It is a way to identify pregnancies at increased risk of certain abnormalities
***It is NOT an absolute diagnosis of a problem
**Women who are shown to be at a higher risk are then offered diagnostic testing
***Level II Ultrasound
***Amniocentesis
*What can it tell me?
**Triple screen suggests an increased risk for certain abnormalities in the fetus such as ONTDs.
***It also can indicate if there's an increase risk for Down Syndrome or Trisomy 18
***We have no reasons to suspect these may be an issue in the pregnancy, but the test will provide this information.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Triple screen cannot confirm that your baby has a NTD or other defect
**It also cannot predict an increased risk for all birth defects
***Other trisomies, mental retardation, cleft lip, etc. are not included in screen.
*What does the procedure involve?
**The screening test is done with a routine maternal blood draw.
*How do the markers work?
**Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP):
***This is the marker primarily used to detect ONTDs
***It is a protein made by the fetal liver
***AFP is excreted into the fetal urine and amniotic fluid from where it is transferred across the placenta into the maternal blood.
***It is not known what AFP does
***It is present in higher concentrations when there is an ONTD because more AFP leads out into the amniotic fluid
***It is present in lower concentrations with Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG):
***This is the &quot;pregnancy hormone&quot; used in pregnancy tests
***Is it produced by the placenta
***The concentration is higher in Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**Unconjugated estriol (uE3):
***UE3 is the most sensitive marker for Trisomy 18 (lower with Trisomy 18)
***It is a steroid produced by the fetus and placenta
***May be lower in Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**MoM (Multiple of the Median):
***This is the ratio of the marker level in the client to the median marker level
***It allows us to compare your marker levels to the general population of pregnant women
***A computer program takes into account all of your specific circumstances and calculates your MoM
***1.0 MoM is the expected value
***If 2.0 MoM, then your concentrations are twice as high as expected
***No one has a perfect 1.0 MoM
*What does a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; test result mean?
**The test results are analyzed for patterns
**There are specific patterns of the three marker levels associated with an ONTD, Down Syndrome, or Trisomy 18
***ONTD = High AFP
***Down Syndrome = Low AFP, High hCG, Low uE3
***Trisomy 18 = Low AFP, Low hCG, Low uE3
**5-10% of women who undergo Triple Screen get abnormal results
**Only 3-5% of them will have an affected baby
**For ONTDs:
***Only the AFP marker is used
***If the concentration is &gt;2.5 MoM, the result is screen positive for ONTD
***The incidence of ONTD is 1-2 in 1000 fetuses
**For Down syndrome:
***If the risk figure is over 1 in 270, the result is screen positive for DS
***HCG is the most sensitive marker for DS
***The incidence of DS is 1 in 660 newborns
**For Trisomy 18:
***If the risk figure is over 1 in 100, the result is screen positive for TRI 18
***UE3 is the most sensitive marker for Trisomy 18
***The incidence of Trisomy 18 is 3 in 1,000 newborns
*Why might I have a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; result?
**The fetus has either an ONTD, DS, or Trisomy 18
**The fetus has a different chromosome abnormality or birth defect
**The variation in the level of the marker or markers is normal
**The gestational age is incorrect
***Underestimated in ONTDs (She is farther than she thought)
***Overestimated in DS (She is not as far along as she thought)
**There are multiple pregnancies (affects NTDs and DS results)
**Fetal demise (for NTD and Tri 18)
**Other causes of (+) for NTD:
***Abdominal wall defect
***Feto-maternal bleeding
***Finnish nephrosis (kidney disease)
**Other causes of (+) for Trisomy 18:
***X-linked icthyosis (scale-like skin due to steroid sulfatase deficiency)
*What does a &quot;Screen Negative&quot; test result mean?
**The pregnancy does not appear to be at an increased risk for ONTD, DS, or TRI 18
**This does NOT guarantee that the child will not have a birth defect
*How Accurate is this test?
**The detection rate is a measure of how sensitive the test is
***This is the chance of getting a screen (+) when the fetus is actually affected
***There is a 60% overall detection rate
***This means that 60 out of 100 affected pregnancies will be found by this test
**The false (+) rate is the chance of getting a (+) when the pregnancy is unaffected
***There is a 5% overall false (+) rate
***5 out of 100 unaffected pregnancies will screen (+)
***Of 100 women with normal babies, 5 will screen (+)
**More specifically:
***For ONTD:
****Detection rate is 85%
****False (+) rate is 1-3%
***For DS:
****Detection rate is 60-65%
****False (+) rate is 5%
****Higher detection rate and false (+) rate for women over age 35
***For Trisomy 18:
****Detection rate is 60-80%
****False (+) rate is ~0.5%
*How do I follow up on a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; result?
**For NTD:
***Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
***Offer genetic counseling, ultrasound, and amniocentesis (to measure AFP)
***If AFP is &lt;3.0 MoM and client is &lt;22 weeks, may repeat triple screen
***If AFP is &gt;3.0 MoM or client is &gt;22 weeks, offer level II ultrasound and/or amniocentesis
**For Down Syndrome or Trisomy 18:
***Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
***Offer genetic counseling, ultrasound, and amniocentesis
***DO NOT repeat screen unless initial screen was done before 14 weeks
**Unexplained screen (+) results may be associated with an increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***These pregnancies should be monitored more closely

==Level II Ultrasound==
*At 18-20 weeks, a high resolution, targeted ultrasound examination can be done to carefully and specifically examine the baby's spine.
*This is noninvasive and may provide reassurance but cannot be used as a diagnostic tool.
**If no evidence of a NTD is seen, it cannot be guaranteed that the baby does not have a NTD.

==Amniocentesis==
*If the triple screen results indicate an increased risk for a NTD, one may choose to have an amniocentesis, which is a more invasive, but more diagnostic test.
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*What can it tell me?
**Amnio can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus.
***Chromosome abnormalities
***NTDs (Spina Bifida)
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Amnio cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation.
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from amnio.
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**The first few cc's of fluid will be discarded because they probably contain contamination from your cells.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
**There is a small possibility of lab error or lack of cell growth
***In this case, the procedure would have to be done again.
*What will it feel like?
**If an anesthetic is used, you may not feel the needle enter the skin, but you will still feel it enter the uterus.
**This is described as a sharp pain, like a menstrual cramp that usually lasts a few seconds.
**You may also feel some cramping after the procedure.
**You should avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours after the procedure.
**Call your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal pain or cramps, vaginal bleeding, leakage of clear fluid from the vagina, fever, or anything else unusual.
***Approximately 2% of women experience light bleeding or spotting.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

==Contracting/Introduction==
*What is your understanding about why you were referred to genetics?
*What are your main concerns or questions?
*Outline session
**I will first ask you some questions about your family history and _____'s medical history
**Then Dr. _____ will examine ______
**We will discuss what we know at that point about whether or not a diagnosis can be made and we will answer any questions you might have.

==Elicit Family History==
*Family history can be helpful in determining if there is something in the family that might be inherited
*Some of the things I'm looking for in your family history include:
**Birth defects
**History of pregnancy losses
**learning difficulties or MR
**chronic health problems
**unusual skin findings or birth marks
**hearing loss
**underarm freckling
**scoliosis
**seizures
**vision loss
**anyone who died at a young age or unexpectedly
**Anything else that you think might be running in your family

==Incidence of NF1==
*NF1 is estimated to affect 1/3,500 people in the population
*Affects both sexes and all racial and ethnic groups equally

==Clinical Features==
*Clinical features are extremely variable both between and within families
*Not all of the features are present in individuals with NF1
*Skin:
**Café-au-lait spots in ~94% of patients
**Axillary or inguinal freckling- common after 3 years of age
**Xanthogranulomas (2-5%)
**Hemangiomas (5-10%)
*Eye:
**Optic glioma (often present at birth; occurs in 10-15% of patients)
**Lisch nodules- pigmented iris hamartomas (100% after the age of 20)
*Tumors
**Neurofibromas- benign tumors arising from nerve cells that can occur anywhere in the body and are often associated with the skin.
**Plexiform neurofibromas- tumors along nerve bundle tracts, can be large and usually appear at birth or early in childhood (occur in ~25%)
**Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise in ~2-4% of individuals
**Pheocromocytoma, rhabdomyoma, neuroblastoma (rare)
**Myelogenous leukemia (rare)
*Neurological:
**Headaches occur in &gt;10% of patients
**Seizures and/or EEG abnormalities occur in ~20%
**Seizures 6-7%
**Hydrocephalus occurs in ~5% of individuals
**Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in ~5% of patients
**Precocious puberty (2-5%)
*Orthopedic:
**Scoliosis
**Hypoplastic bowing of lower legs, with pseudoarthrosis at birth
**Short stature
**Macrocephaly
*Cardiovascular:
**Hypertension (2-5%)
**Congenital heart defect (2%)
*Cognitive:
**Developmental delay
**Learning disabilities- hyperactivity and/or speech problems occur in 50%
**Mental retardation (8% of patients)
*Other-occasional:
**Syndactyly
**Glaucoma
**Ptosis
**Pruritis

==Diagnostic Criteria==
(clinical diagnosis based on a number of clinical findings)
*NF1 is present in an individual who has two or more of the following signs:
**Six or more café au lait macules &gt;5 mm in prepubertal individuals or &gt;15 mm after puberty
**Two or more neurofibromas of any type, or one+ plexiform neurofibromas
**Freckling in the axilla or inguinal regions
**A tumor of the optic pathway (optic glioma)
**Two or more Lisch nodules
**Long bone bowing (w/ or w/o pseudarthrosis)
**A first-degree relative with NF1 by the above criteria

==Natural History and Life Span: NF1==
*Although the medical literature and the internet tend to show the most severe cases, approximately 2/3 have only mild or moderate involvement throughout their lifespan
*Lifespan is dependent on severity and types of symptoms, but it has been shown in one study that the average life expectancy of patients with NF1 can be reduced by at least 15 years overall
*Decreased lifespan has been associated with the following features:
**Malignant peripheral sheath tumors
**Acute hydrocephalus
**Severe seizure
**Progressive spinal plexiform neurofibromas
*Frequency of more serious complications increases with age
*Various manifestations of NF1 have different characteristic times of appearance
*Since characteristic features often develop with age, if NF1 is suspected it is often necessary to continue to follow them for a while before the diagnosis can be ruled out completely
*Infancy:
**Café-au-lait spots
**Long bone bowing
**Developmental delay
**Optic glioma
**Plexiform neurofibroma
*Childhood:
**Neurofibromas
**Freckling patterns
**Learning disabilities
**Scoliosis
**Hypertension
*Adolescence:
**Worsening of existing condition
**Rarely malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors develop
*Adulthood:
**Increase in neurofibromas
**Hypertension
**If other symptoms have not developed, they may do so at this time
*Pregnancy:
**most pregnancies in women with NF1 are normal but serious complications can occur
**Many women with NF1 experience a rapid increase in the number and size of neurofibromas during pregnancy
**Hypertension may first become symptomatic or, if pre-existing, may become worse
**Large pelvic or genital neurofibromas can complicate delivery
**cesarean section appears to be necessary more often in pregnant women with NF1 than in other women.

==Counseling==
**NF1 gene located on long arm of chromosome 17q11.2
**NF1 gene is classified as a tumor suppressor gene, however the gene has other functions that are not as well defined
**In about 50% of individuals with NF 1 it was inherited from an affected parent and the other half are due to a new mutation not already present in the family
**If a person has this gene they will almost certainly show some signs or characteristics, but these may not be obvious and it is possible for a person to go undiagnosed (nearly 100% penetrant, but variable expressivity)
**The gene is very large which is consistent with the number of patients with NF1 that were due to a new mutation
**Gene encodes for a protein called neurofibromin (believed to act as tumor suppressor, but probably also has other functions)
*Autosomal Dominant inheritance
**Autosomal means it is on a chromosome other than sex chromosome
**Dominant means only one altered copy of this gene is necessary to develop symptoms and characteristics
*Risk assessment:
**For affected individuals 50% risk for each pregnancy to be affected, although clinical expression is variable
**For unaffected parents the recurrence risk is (&lt;1%) (germline mosaicism in one man reported)

==Provide patient literature==

==Testing==
*Families with two or more affected individuals can use linkage analysis to identify carriers of the disease causing NF1 gene
*Sporadic cases require direct mutational analysis of the gene, if presymptomatic testing is desired
*DNA testing by protein truncation is available but rarely used for diagnosis (reported to detect 70% of mutations, but not firmly established)
*Mutation may be missed due to large size of gene and many mutations possible
*FISH can be used to detect microdeletions of chromosome 17q11.2
*Individuals with large deletions tend to have mental retardation and an increased tumor burden (approximately 5% of individuals with NF1 have whole gene deletions)

==Prenatal testing==
*Possible if there is a known mutation or via linkage studies if enough affected family members
*It is not often used

==Genotype/phenotype correlation==
*Differences seen even in members of same family suggest some randomness to some of features.
*Two-hit hypothesis supports these findings
*However, there are some similarities of phenotype seen in

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Individuals should be placed on surveillance programs
**Annual physical examination by a physician who is familiar with NF1
**Annual ophthalmological examination in childhood, less frequent examination in adults
**Regular developmental assessment by screening questionnaire
**Regular blood pressure monitoring
**Other studies only as indicated on the basis of clinically apparent signs or symptoms (HOWEVER, some centers do MRI on newly diagnosed patients though)
*Treatment includes treating the symptoms as they occur
**Learning difficulties: appropriate school placement, IEP
**Dermal neurofibromas: surgically remove if they are symptomatic
**Early recognition of long bone bowing can be accompanied with braces (which may help prevent fractures)
**MRI's should be scheduled to screen for optic gliomas
**Ophthalmologic exam to look for Lisch nodules
**Bracing for scoliosis
**Meds for seizures and headaches

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Overlap primarily lies in cutaneous features, especially café-au-lait spots
*Neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic neuromas, tumors of cranial nerves and spinal roots, skin manifestations less frequent than in NF1)
*Multiple café-au-lait spots (an autosomal dominant trait without other features of neurofibromatosis)
*LEOPARD syndrome (multiple lentigines, ocular hypertelorism, deafness, congenital heart disease)
*McCune-Albright syndrome (large café-au-lait spots with irregular margins, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia)
*Noonan syndrome (short stature, unusual facies, pulmonic stenosis)
**A Noonan syndrome phenotype occurs in about 12% of patients with NF1 and features may include ocular hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, webbed neck, and pulmonic stenosis
*Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (mucosal neuromas, conjunctival neuromas, pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, marfanoid habitus)
*Multiple lipomatosis (multiple cutaneous lipomas)
*Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome (multiple lipomas and hemangiomas, macrocephaly, spotted pigmentation of the glans penis).
*Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (multiple subcutaneous tumors, gingival fibromatosis)
*Congenital generalized fibromatosis (multiple tumors of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, skeletal muscle, bones, and viscera) Multiple intradermal nevi (multiple cutaneous tumors)
*Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, aterio-venous fistulas, and hemi-hypertrophy
*Proteus syndrome (regional overgrowth, hyperpigmentation, multiple lipomas)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Niemann-Pick Disease'''

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior phone contact
*Assess their knowledge and understanding about Niemann-Pick disease
*Assess their concerns and ask what they want to discuss today

==Intake==
*Elicit medical history
*Elicit family history
*Construct pedigree

==Natural History==

===What is Niemann-Pick disease?===
*A group of rare inherited disorders of fat metabolism (three main types with subdivisions)
*Type A (acute infantile form) and Type B (chronic, non-neurological form): caused by excessive amounts of a fatty substance (sphingomyelin) that accumulates in the brain, central nervous system, and several visceral organs (liver, spleen, lungs). This is due to a deficiency of the enzyme sphingomyelinase, which breaks down the fat from the cell membrane products created by the normal turnover of cell death.
*Type C (biochemical form): is a lipid storage disorder that results in the accumulation of excessive amounts of cholesterol within the cells of the liver, spleen, and brain. This is due to the cell's inability to transport the cholesterol properly during esterification reactions. It causes progressive deterioration of the nervous system.

===What are the symptoms?===
*Type A: this is the most common form of the disease (80%). Most of the infants appear normal at birth, and then develop symptoms by 6-12 months. There is a gradual decline of motor and intellectual function resulting in a degenerative muscle weakness and floppiness. The severity of the symptoms increases rapidly and life-threatening complications may occur early in childhood. The fat accumulation is so severe that it may represent 2-5% of the body weight.
*the fat accumulation in various parts of the body occurs in the developing fetus
*hepatosplenomegaly
*lymphadenopathy
*abnormalities of the nervous system (profound MR)
*poor feeding
*edema and distention - abdominal swelling
*vomiting and diarrhea
*failure to thrive
*pyrexia - fever
*macula - bright red spots in the eyes (50%)
*jaundice
*Type B: begins in infancy or early childhood. These symptoms progress more slowly and there is minimal nervous system *involvement
*hepatosplenomegaly
*bright red spots in the eyes
*increased susceptibility to lung infections
*slow growth rate
*Type C: the disease may strike anytime from early infancy to adulthood, but usually affects school-age children
*fetal ascites or neonatal liver disease
*jaundice at birth
*infantile hypotonia
*developmental delay
*hepatosplenomegaly
*vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP) - difficulty with upward or downward eye movements
*ataxia - unsteady gait, clumsiness, difficulty walking
*dystonia - difficulty in the posturing of limbs
*dysarthria - slurred, irregular speech {these two eventually become disabling,
*dysphagia - difficulty swallowing making oral feeding impossible}
*dementia - learning disorders and progressive intellectual decline
*cataplexy - sudden loss of muscle tone, causing abrupt falls
*seizures and tremors accompanying movement

===What is the prognosis?===
*Type A: death usually occurs by 4 years of age
*Type B: the earliest diagnosed patients are now middle-aged without neurological impairment
*Type C: death usually occurs in the late 2nd or 3rd decade (aspiration pneumonia is often the cause)

==Genetic Etiology==

===Mode of Inheritance===
*autosomal recessive
*both parents carriers: ¼ affected, 2/4 carriers, ¼ unaffected
*males and females affected in equal numbers
*this means that no family history of the disease is the norm

===Chromosome location===
*Type A and Type B: SMPD1 (ASM) gene on locus 11p15.1-15.4
*Type C: NPC1 gene is on locus 18q11-q12
*NPC2 gene is on locus 14q24.333

===Molecular genetics===
*Type A: in non-Jewish populations, many different mutations have been detected in Jewish populations, 1/3 of the people have a R496L point mutation
*Type B: in non-Jewish populations, many different mutations have been detected in Jewish populations, a 3 base pair deletion &amp;#916;R608 is either homozygous or heterozygous with R496L
*it's not possible to predict the severity by enzyme testing
*Type C: 95% of patients have mutations in the NPC1 gene (clinical tests available)
*5% of patients have mutations in the NPC2 gene (research basis only)
*the exact gene defect is not known, as mutation scanning has identified most patients as compound heterozygotes with mutations unique to their family (over 100 mutations so far)
*the individuals with Nova Scotia ancestry (Type D) almost uniformly have a G992W mutation on NPC1

===Expression===
*The phenotype (age of onset and severity of symptoms) usually runs true in families
*Type C: &quot;classic&quot; patients have zero or very low esterification levels with a positive staining pattern, while &quot;variant&quot; patients (about 15%) have intermediate levels of cholesterol esterification and a less distinctive staining pattern

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Type A: identified in people of all races
*higher incidence in: Ashkenazi Jew ancestry (between 1:20,000 and 1:30,000)
*carrier frequency: 1:90 to 1:100
*Type C: rare, with 300 reported cases in the United States and 1 in a million worldwide
*affects all populations with a prevalence 1:150,000 (est. in western Europe)
*no accurate info. on true incidence or carrier frequency
*higher incidence in: French Canadians in Nova Scotia (Type D)
*Hispanic ancestry in NM and CO (Rio Grande River)
*Bedouin group in Israel {Founder Effect}

==Testing==

===Diagnostic===
*Type A and Type B: blood testing - enzyme assay confirms a deficiency of the enzyme sphingomyelinase in the leukocytes (and a biopsy of the bone marrow will show abnormal foam cells)
*Type C: biochemical test - skin biopsy taken and the fibroblasts are tested for their ability to handle cholesterol (esterification studies to test impaired cell transport and filipin fluorescent staining studies to test cell storage)
biochemical testing is used to diagnose; molecular genetic testing is primarily used to confirm diagnosis in &quot;variant&quot; patients
*{Note: The diagnosis of often delayed because many clinicians do not realize that the absence of organomegaly doesn't rule out storage diseases and because &quot;routine&quot; tests for metabolic disease, such as urine screens and lysosomal enzyme panels, are normal in NPC.}

===Carrier===
*Type A: partial deficiency in sphingomyelinase activity in cultured fibroblasts indicates the heterozygote state
*Type C: carrier detection is not yet reliable using standard biochemical tests molecular analysis of the NPC1 gene may be used if proband mutations have been identified

===Prenatal===
*Type A and Type B: available by amnio or CVS to measure the enzyme activity
*Type C: prenatal diagnosis available through amniocentesis or CVS for pregnancies at 25% risk
*biochemical testing is the proband has a &quot;classical&quot; biochemical phenotype, but not if the proband has a &quot;variant&quot; *biochemical phenotype

===Laboratories===
*Type A: Genzyme Genetics: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/niemann-pick-disease-type-a-testing.aspx
*Carrier testing for Ashkenazi Jewish individuals
*Prenatal diagnosis for carrier couples with identified mutations
*Genzyme's Niemann-Pick disease type A mutation analysis tests for 3 mutations for a 95% carrier detection rate in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
*Specimen Requirements:
**1. Blood: ACD-A (yellow-top) or EDTA (lavender-top) tube. Adult: 10 ml whole blood; 30 ml whole blood if ordering multiple tests. Turnaround Time: 10-14 days.
**2. Mouthwash: Please Note: Patient should not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum for at least one hour prior to collection. (See specimen kit for detailed instructions). Mouthwash samples can be sent when ordering up to two tests. When ordering more than two tests, blood samples are required. 10 ml of Scope® mouthwash that has been swished vigorously for at least 1 minute. Collect in orange-top 50 ml polypropylene tube. Turnaround Time: 10-14 days.
**3. Prenatal: Please Note: Call a laboratory genetic coordinator prior to obtaining any prenatal specimens. Prenatal testing is recommended only for carrier couples with identified mutations. In some circumstances, specimens from other family members may be required. All prenatal specimens (including cord blood) must be accompanied by a maternal blood or mouthwash specimen for analysis of possible maternal cell contamination. Discard first 2 ml; then 10 ml amniotic fluid in 15 ml orange-top polypropylene tube, 10-15 mg chorionic villi in laboratory-provided screw-top tubes with sterile transport medium or one T-25 flask of confluent fetal cells. Additional specimen must be obtained for back-up culture at one of our cytogenetics laboratories or another facility. If additional testing is desired, more amniotic fluid is needed. For example, chromosome analysis requires an additional 15-25 ml ('''see Cytogenetics – Amniotic Fluid Chromosome Analysis test page''': http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/amniotic-fluid-testing.aspx) and AFAFP requires an additional 2 ml ('''see Amniotic Fluid Alpha-Fetoprotein - AFAFP test page''': http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/afafp-test.aspx). Turnaround Time: 10-14 days (when cell culture required, add ~2 weeks).

(Type A)

==Background==
*Niemann-Pick disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a lysosomal storage disorder. A deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin.

==Genetics==
*Caused by mutation in ASM gene
*Chromosomal location 11p15.1-p15.4
*18 causal mutations mapped

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Noonan Syndrome'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*What is your primary concern
*Do you have any questions for us today
*What are your expectations for your visit today

==Outline the session==
*We will be taking medical history information
*Dr. ___ will come in to perform a physical examination
*We will be discussing if we think there is a diagnosis that can be made at this time
*If a diagnosis is made we will explain the inheritance and information we know about the cause

==Medical history==
(follow form)

==Overview of Noonan Syndrome==
*Common autosomal dominant, single gene
*Mistakenly called male Turner syndrome due to similar characteristics
*Occurs in both males and females equally

==Characteristics of Noonan Syndrome==
*Short stature
*Congenital heart defects
*Broad or webbed neck
*Unusual chest shape (low set nipples, superior pectus carinatum, inferior pectus excavatum)
*Developmental delay
*Cryptorchidism
*Characteristic physical appearance changes over time

==Features irrespective of age==
*Low set posteriorly rotated ears with thick helix (90%)
*Vivid blue or blue-green eyes (lighter than expected for background)
*thickened or ptotic eyelids
*hypertelorism

==Neonate and Infancy==
(age features are most striking)
*tall forehead
*hypertelorism with downslant palpebral fissures (95%)
*prominent eyes
*Nose has depressed root, wide base, bulbous tip
*Deeply grooved philtrum
*High wide peaks to vermillion border of upper lip
*Excess nuchal skin and low posterior hairline

==Children==
*Facial appearance lacks expression (resembles individual with myopathy)

==Adolescence==
*Facial shape inverted triangle, wide forehead tapered chin
*Pinched nasal root and thin bridge
*Neck lengthens accentuates skin webbing or trapezius muscle
*Eyes less prominent
*Curly or wooly hair in older child

==Adult==
*Nasolabial folds prominent
*Skin appears transparent and wrinkled
**Genetics of Noonan syndrome
***missense mutations in gene PTPN11 at 12q24.1 identified in 50% of patients
***gene identified in 2001 (normal gene encodes protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 seems to be essential in several intracellular signal transduction pathways controlling diverse developmental processes
***absence of this mutation in some families suggests heterogeneity
***AD single gene
***50% chance to pass on if affected
***if parents not affected chance is low &lt;1% (gene clinics)
***direct transmission reported 30-75% of time rest are de novo
***predominantly mothers not fathers transmit gene (3:1 ratio) (likely due to cryptorchidism and reduced fertility in males)

==Prevalence==
*1/1000-1/2,500

==Diagnostic testing==
*Testing for PTPN11 mutations available on research basis
*Diagnosis based on clinical findings though
*High-resolution ultrasound only prenatal test available

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Turner syndrome in females should be ruled out through karyotype
*Trisomy 8p, trisomy 22 mosaicism, sex chromosome rearrangement, in utero exposure to alcohol or primidone
*Williams, Aarskog, Baraitser-Winter, Costello syndromes share some features
*Multiple lentigines/LEOPARD syndrome can also have pulmonary valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, short stature, hypertelorism, pectus deformity, hearing loss, developmental delay
*Watson syndrome shares pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, mild intellectual handicap, café-au-lait patches
*Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome lot of overlap and debate about whether same condition, but MR more severe, skin findings hyperkeratosis, ichthyosis, absent eyebrows, sparse hair, gastrointestinal problems more severe, eyes rarely characteristically light blue/ blue-green

==Cause of characteristics==
*Hypothesized to be consequences of lymphatic obstruction

==Growth and feeding==
*B.W. usually normal
*15% have poor suck, 38% poor suck and vomiting, 24% require tube feeding 2 weeks or more
*length at birth normal usually then follows 3% ile
*final height lower end of normal in adults
*some endocrinologists choose to treat with growth hormone even if deficiency not seen

==Development and behavior==
*Delayed milestones
*Mean age sitting 10 mth, walking 21 mth, two-word sentence 31 mth
*10-15 % require special ed
*IQ usually within normal range, but mild MR seen in 1/3
*Verbal lower than nonverbal performance
*Usually good peer, social interactions and self-esteem, but one study suggests that less socially competent and more behavior problems than sibs (not clinically significant)

==Ears and hearing==
*May cause delayed speech
*Reported in &gt;1/3 usually secondary to ottitis media
*Sensorineural loss in 3%

==Cardiovascular==
*Potential bias in frequency due to requirement for diagnosis by many (50-80%)

*should avoid aspirin

==various lymphatic abnormalities described==

==Genitourinary==

(a.k.a. Goldenhar Syndrome, Oculoauriculovertebral Dysplasia, OAV Syndrome, Facio-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum, First &amp; Second Branchial Arch Syndrome)

==Overview==
*a condition that affects the growth of the face
*predominantly unilateral and involves the ear, mouth, and mandible (jaw)
*about 15% have bilateral involvement though
*extremely variable with many transitional forms affecting different systems
*term Goldenhar syndrome used when the spine and the eye (epibulbar dermoids which are benign tumors located just inside the opening of the eye or the eyeballs and can cause vision problems) are involved

==Etiology==
*unknown etiology, but is usually sporadic
*However, a few cases have had a positive family history suggesting autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or multifactorial inheritance
*thought to be caused by abnormal changes in blood vessels and the disruption of the blood supply during embryonic development (early vascular disruption) at about 30-45 days of gestation
*results in the destruction of differentiating tissue in the first and second branchial arches, from which certain ligaments and bones of the face, parts of the skull, and the middle ear develop
*amount of damage depends on timing of vascular disruption and degree of tissue destruction
*No DNA abnormality has been identified
*However, it has also been noted that certain teratogens (Thalidomide, Primidone, and Accutane) have produced birth defect patterns that are similar to the HFM spectrum.
*rate of Goldenhar Syndrome found in the children of Gulf War veterans was 4 X's as high as in general population (ABDC collected data) 15 cases when 4 were expected (http://www.widesmiles.org/syndrom/hmsgold/gulfwar.html)

==Recurrance Risks==
(Unless autosomal dominant pattern found which can be in Goldenhar)
*chances of having another child with Hemifacial Microsomia or Goldenhar are less than 1%
*affected person has an approximately 3% chance of passing it on to their children

==Incidence==
*The frequency of occurrence is estimated to be 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000, and there is a slight male predominance (3:2).

==Clinical Features==
*Key features:
**Facial - asymmetry (90%). . .right side predominance (62%)
**hypoplasia of malar, maxillary, and/or mandibular region
**macrostomia (lateral cleft-like extension of the corner of the mouth)
**hypoplasia of the facial musculature
**frontal bossing
**Ear - microtia (malformation of the external ear from complete aplasia to a crumpled, distorted
**pinna which is displaced anteriorly and inferiorly) (65%)
**accessory preauricular tags and/or pits
**middle ear anomaly with variable deafness
**Eye - palpebral fissure is somewhat lowered on the affected side
**Oral - diminished to absent parotid secretion
**anomalies in function or structure of the tongue
**malfunction of the soft palate
*Associated findings: 
**prenatal growth deficiency, feeding difficulties
**Vertebral - hemivertebrae or hypoplasia of vertebrae, usually cervical (40-60%)
**Eye - epibulbar dermoid and/or lipodermoid
**strabismus
**unilateral coloboma of the superior lid
**microphthalmia
**Oral - cleft lip, cleft palate (7%)
**Cardiac - various forms of heart disease (45-55%)
**ventricular septal defect
**patent ductus arteriosus
**tetralogy of Fallot
**coarctation of the descending aorta
**Lung - pulmonary agenesis or hypoplasia of the lung
**Renal - ectopic and/or fused kidneys
**renal agenesis
**double ureter
**Nervous - mental retardation (10%)
**occipital encephalocele
**hydrocephalus
**agensis of corpus callosum

==Natural History==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is congenital and most of the physical characteristics are apparent at birth.
*However, the facial asymmetry may not become apparent until the child grows (usually by four years of age).

==Potential Medical Concerns==
*lack of the development of the upper and lower jaws can cause breathing problems as well as a dental malocclusion which will need to be addressed surgically and orthodontically

==Testing==
*Diagnosis is clinical due to lack of understanding exact cause and probably usually more due to environmental factors
*Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound may be possible if there is severe hypoplasia of the mandible or severe abnormality of the ear

==Development and Learning==
*Most of these patients have normal intelligence

==Management==
*Deafness should be tested for at an early age, and speech therapy is often necessary
*Help may be required for feeding problems and encouraging weight gain in early infancy
*Any congenital heart defects may require surgery
*Plastic surgery may be used to reconstruct the ear, and bone distraction techniques are available to artificially lengthen the jaw bone to improve growth on the face.
*Children may also need ongoing orthodontic treatment.

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Treacher-Collins Syndrome-AD inheritance characterized by facial cleft, hypoplasia of the cheeks and mandible bilaterally, colobomas (or congenital scar) of the eyelids, downward-sloping palpebral fissures, poorly developed supraorbital rims and cheek, receding chin, malformation of the ear
*CHARGE Association
*VACTERL Association
*Townes-Brocks Syndrome
*Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) Syndrome
*Chromosomal disorders (including Trisomy 9 Mosaicism, Trisomy 18, Ring 21 Chromosome, and Trisomy 22)
*Teratogen exposure

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Assess development.
*Feeding problems?
*Are they seeking a diagnosis?
*Why would a diagnosis be helpful to them?
*How do other people react is there any teasing by others?
*How do they feel about the public's response to the facial abnormalities?
*Would they like to talk with other families going through the same thing?
*How can we be helpful to them?

(a.k.a. Goldenhar Syndrome, Oculoauriculovertebral Dysplasia, OAV Syndrome, Facio-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum, First &amp; Second Branchial Arch Syndrome)

==Introduction==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is a condition that affects the growth of the face. It is predominantly unilateral and involves the ear, mouth, and mandible. This disorder is extremely variable with many transitional forms affecting different systems (for example, Goldenhar Syndrome is used when there is ocular and vertebral involvement), which suggests that this disorder is a range along a continuous spectrum.

==Genetic Etiology==
*HFM has an unknown etiology, but is usually sporadic. However, a few cases have had a positive family history suggesting autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or multifactorial. The estimated recurrence in first-degree relatives is about 2%, but the minor features of the disorder may be more commonly noted in relatives. The chances of having another child with Hemifacial Microsomia are less than 1%. An affected person has an approximately 3% chance of passing it on to their children.
*HFM is thought to be caused by abnormal changes in blood vessels and the disruption of the blood supply during embryonic development (early vascular disruption) at about 30-45 days of gestation. This results in the destruction of differentiating tissue in the first and second branchial arches, from which certain ligaments and bones of the face, parts of the skull, and the middle ear develop.
*No DNA abnormality has been identified. However, it has also been noted that certain teratogens (Thalidomide, Primidone, and Accutane) have produced birth defect patterns that are similar to the HFM spectrum. Also, a research study is being done to determine if there is a higher rate of Goldenhar Syndrome found in the children of Gulf War veterans.

==Incidence==
*The frequency of occurrence is estimated to be 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000, and there is a slight male predominance (3:2).

==Clinical Features==
*Key features:
**Facial - asymmetry (90%). . .right side predominance (62%)
**hypoplasia of malar, maxillary, and/or mandibular region
**macrostomia (lateral cleft-like extension of the corner of the mouth)

==Natural History==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is congenital and most of the physical characteristics are apparent at birth. However, the facial asymmetry may not become apparent until the child grows (usually by four years of age).

==Testing==
*Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound may be possible if there is severe hypoplasia of the mandible or severe abnormality of the auricle.

==Management==
*Most of these patients have normal intelligence. Deafness should be tested for at an early age, and speech therapy is often necessary. Help may be required for feeding problems and encouraging weight gain in early infancy. Any congenital heart defects may require surgery. Plastic surgery may be used to reconstruct the ear, and bone distraction techniques are available to artificially lengthen the jaw bone to improve growth on the face. Children may also need ongoing orthodontic treatment.

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Treacher-Collins Syndrome
*CHARGE Association
*VACTERL Association
*Townes-Brocks Syndrome
*Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) Syndrome
*Chromosomal disorders (including Trisomy 9 Mosaicism, Trisomy 18, Ring 21 Chromosome, and Trisomy 22)
*Teratogen exposure

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Assess development.
*Feeding problems?
*Cleft lip or other surgical repair?
*How are they dealing with the diagnosis?
*Have they shared with the family? What were their reactions?
*Have they taken the baby out of the house?
*How do they feel about the public's response to the facial abnormalities?
*Would they like to talk with other families going through the same thing?
*How can we be helpful to them?

(Opitz Oculo-Geito-Laryngeal Syndrome, Hypertelorism-Hypospadias Syndrome, Opitz-Frias Syndrome)

==Contracting==
*Acknowledge prior phone contact
*What have you been told about why your were referred to genetics?
*What questions or concerns would you like us to address today?
*Set agenda for session

==Genetic Etiology==
*Genetic heterogeneity
**X-linked loci mapping to Xp22.3 and possibly Xq22
***Only males affected
***Sons of affected males can't be affected, daughters must be carriers
***Women have 50% chance for each pregnancy to inherit the mutation
***Sons of carrier women have 25% chance of being affected
**Autosomal dominant inheritance at 22q11.2
*Molecular genetics
**Xp22.3 form is caused by mutation in MID1 gene
***Gene product is midin
***Midin is associated with microtubules throughout cell cycle
**Xq22 form is caused by mutation in MID2 gene (recently identified)
***Gene structure and protein product almost identical to MID1
***Expressed in heart, but MID1 is not
***Unsure of clinical implications at this point
**Gene on chromosome 22 has not been determined yet
*Spontaneous mutations are rare
*Almost 100% penetrance

==Incidence==
*Over 50 families reported in literature since 1965
*Many families have not been reported

==Clinical Features==
*Hypospadias (93%)

==Natural History==
**Great variation in range of severity
***Males tend to be more severely affected than females
***Women usually only mildly affected
**Rarely symptoms are sever enough to cause death in infancy
**Usually normal growth and normal life span

==Testing==
**Usually clinical diagnosis is most reliable
**Research testing for genes on X chromosome and chromosome 22
***Mutations have been identified in some families with X-linked Opitz
***If mutation is identified, other at risk relatives can be tested
***Dr. Maximilian Muenke lab offers blood test for changes in MID1
****Have found changes in 10 of 40 families studied
****Working to find gene on Xq22
**Prenatal diagnosis can be offered once change in MID1 identified
***Polyhydramnios may be sign of affected fetus
***Some features may be observed on level II ultrasound after 22 weeks

'Born August 7th, 1979 in Grand Junction, Colorado-USA'

'Composer/Artist/Musician--And here an active 

'Reader,  Writer, and Believer' 

The value of the GNU Free Documentation License, and the people that choose to dontate a bit of their soul where they deem important, will soon amaze the world in ways we cannot yet imagine.  The power in knowledge is set by the rule of its distribution, and through sharing and collaborative and encouragment of peer propogation, we will one day understand the value in fellow respect, and love, for others.&quot;

About Me
My name is Johnathan J. Stegeman/MidiMacMan, and I am a composer, webmaster, photographer, graphic artist, and freelance writer from Denver, Colorado.

I am have been playing the piano since age five, and while I have had no classical or &quot;formal&quot; piano training, my self taught technique has been shaped mostly by ear, and my love for improvisational styles mixed in with fundamental theories about chord structures and harmonies.

I have faced great criticism for my approach to piano playing, and for particularly for the music I compose. Perhaps it is just rubbish, and will one day make a mockery out of my name-my Mother's name as I had no father growing up, and have grown up with the German half of my heritage knowning little of my my other roots, Mexican-or I may just be onto something that is ahead of the time. The later scenario at least maintains hope, and without that little bit of reassurance, I could not hardly keep writing music. Without writing music, I wouldn't feel but maybe a fraction of the person I am.

For you see music is my greatest passion, and therefore greatest source of sorrow, despair and frusration at times. It has occured to me that my songs may be loved by even just a few other souls, after I have passed through this human existence.......sadly this happens to many more artists that you may have ever imagined.

However, they never give up their motivation, as if forced by a etheral force to continue their artistic expression. Almost a curse it can feel at times, but I don't think that any artist, wether successfful, or not, would trade in this unseen force for anything in the world. I know for example: I would not trade my sense of hearing in for my sense of sight. But what a foolish bargain most people would agree............I cannot help the fact that my music is so much of me.

Only in the last two years, and after great rejection by the music world, despite rigorous study through high school, and three years of study at the University of Colorado at Denver, have Itaken up other artistic expressions. Web Design, Graphic Design, Freelance writing, and even advertising and product development are skills that I had no real training with, even through college. These skills have been fashioned through my own quest for knowledge, and are quite immature in development stages. Yet I am proud of where I have come, especially for the skills I have learned on my own.

What it has taught me, is that the world is anyones oyster........and you can harvest whatever riches you may admire...........with work and with the simplest desire.

Thanks for noticing perhaps something in my work. It all adds up to make all my effort have some final worth.

Sincerely,
Johnathan J. Stegeman
MidiMacMan.
January, 2006.
Age 26.

Always Yours, 
Johnathan J. Stegeman-MidiMacMan

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome - Type 1'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*What is your understanding about why Dr. wanted to follow up with ____in our genetics clinic?
*What do you already know about OFD syndrome?
*Do you have any questions you would like us to address today?
*What is your main concern?
*Outline the visit
*I have a little family history info from when Dr. visited ____ in the hospital, but I will take a more detailed family history.
*I will also obtain a little more information about _______'s medical history
*Dr. will come in to examine _____ and he will probably want to take a look at some of the features that you (her mother) share with ________.
*We will then discuss the diagnosis of OFD1 including the inheritance, and issues regarding the medical management.

==Diagnosis==
*The diagnosis of OFD1 is established by clinical findings
*Established at birth in some infants due to combination of oral, facial, and digital anomalies
*In others it is suspected only after polycystic kidney disease is identified (usually in later childhood or adulthood)
*In some it is only suggested after a woman has an affected child.

==Characteristic Features==

===Oral===
*tongue is lobed (bifid or trifid)
*tongue nodules (usually hamartomas or lipomas) occur in at least a third of those with OFD1
*ankyloglossia is common (partial or complete fusion of the tongue to the bottom of the mouth) attributable to a short lingual frenulum
*Cleft hard or soft palate, submucous cleft palate, or highly arched palate occur in over half of patients
*Trifurcation of the soft palate has been reported
*Alveolar clefts and accessory gingival frenulae are common (these fibrous bands are hyperplastic frenulae extending from the buccal mucous membrane to the alveolar ridge, resulting in notching of the alveolar ridges)
*Dental abnormalities include missing teeth (most common), extra teeth, enamel dysplasia, and malocclusion

===Facial===
*Ocular hypertelorism or telecanthus occurs in at least 33%
*Hypoplasia of the alae nasi, median cleft lip or pseudocleft upper lip, and micrognathia are common (exact frequencies unknown )

===Digital===
*brachydactyly (short digits), syndactyly (fused digits) of varying degrees, and clinodactyly (inward curvature) of the fifth finger are all common
*other fingers, particularly the third (i.e., middle finger) may show variable radial or ulnar deviation
*duplicated hallux (great toe) occurs in less than half of patients and is usually unilateral
*preaxial or postaxial polydactyly of the hands (1-2% of patients)
*Radiographs of the hands often demonstrate fine reticular radiolucencies, described as irregular mineralization of the bone, with or without spicule formation of the phalanges

===Brain===
*Structural brain abnormalities occur in 10-15% (may be an underestimate)
*most common include
**intracerebral cysts
**agenesis of the corpus callosum
**cerebellar agenesis with or without Dandy-Walker malformation
*Other reported anomalies have each been described in a few patients
**type 2 porencephaly (schizencephalic porencephaly)
**pachygyria (abnormally large convolutions of cerebral cortex) and heterotopias (displacement of gray matter typically into the white matter)
**hydrocephalus
**cerebral or cerebellar atrophy

===Kidney===
*polycystic kidney disease (unknown frequency) fewer than 50%
*age of onset most often adulthood (but have been described in children)

===Intellect===
*As many as half of the individuals with OFD1 have some degree of mental retardation, which is usually mild
*Depends in part on brain abnormalities, but not always consistent
*Severe mental retardation in the absence of brain malformations appears to be rare

===Other===
*Rare manifestations include choanal atresia, tibial pseudarthrosis, and berry aneurysms
*Hair is often described as dry, coarse, and brittle
*Alopecia (absence of hair), usually partial, is an occasional finding
*Milia, small keratinizing cysts, occur in at least 10% (but likely more) occur most often on the scalp, ear pinnae, face, and dorsa of the hands
*milia are usually present in infancy and then resolve, but can then leave pitting scars

==Incidence==
*Estimates range from 1/50,000 to 1/250,000

==Inheritance==
*OFD1 is inherted in an X-linked dominant manner
*Almost all affected individuals are female
*reports of males with OFD1
**some males are described as malformed fetuses born to women with OFD1
**in most cases the diagnosis is uncertain because the mother is unaffected
*Approximately 75% of cases are sporadic (should examine mother and take family history to determine this)

==Caveats of inheritance==
*One family with a peculiar inheritance pattern has been described. In this pedigree, a woman with OFDI had four unaffected sons, three of whom then had daughters all affected with OFDI
*Often, mildly affected female relatives are diagnosed only after the identification of a severely affected individual

==Recurrance risks==
*If there is no family history of OFD1, the risk that an unaffected mother of an affected female will have another female with OFD1 is less than 1% due to the possibility of
**1) a new mutation in a second child
**2) germline mosaicism in a parent (more likely than new mutation)
***Germline mosaicism is when a person unaffected by OFD1 has multiple copies of the OFD1 mutation in their gametes
***Theoretically, germline mosaicism can occur in either parent of a female with OFD1
*At conception, the risk to the offspring of females with OFD1 of inheriting the mutant OFD1 is 50% (most male conceptuses with the mutant OFD1 allele miscarry)
*At delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males


Recurrance is a misspelling. This should instead be 'Recurrence'

==Genetic Testing==
*OFD1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome type I
*chromosomal locus Xp22.3-p22.2
*Molecular genetic testing of the OFD1 gene is available on a research basis only
*Tested in a limited number of patients
*A variety of mutations have been identified, the majority result in premature protein truncation
*Detection rate unknown

==Molecular genetics==
*Normal allelic variants:
**OFD1 has 23 exons
**OFD1 is on the portion of the X chromosome that escapes inactivation
**OFD1 was expressed in all adult tissues that were examined. However, during early development, expression is exclusively in the genital ridges, soon followed by expression in craniofacial structures and nervous system
**Homologous genes include Cyorf1 (Y chromosomes) and C5orf1 (chromosome 5)
*Pathologic allelic variants:
**Exonic and intronic mutations have both been described
**Mutations in exons include single base pair changes, frameshifts, and deletions
**These changes have occurred to date in exons 3, 11, 13, and 16 only
**Abnormal splicing has also been reported in introns 4 and 5

==Normal gene product==
**The protein OFD1 occurs in two forms, Cxorf5-1 and Cxorf5-2, which are differentiated by the use of an alternative splice site
**Cxorf5-1 is a 1011 amino acid protein, whereas Cxorf5-2 is a 367 amino acid protein
**The two proteins share the first 351 amino acids; Cxorf5-2 then has a C-terminal region of 16 amino acids
**The function of the protein is unknown, but thought to be related to a protein-protein interaction mechanism during development

==Abnormal gene product==
*Most of the mutations lead to the premature truncation of the protein and are therefore thought to result in a loss of function
*Since this gene is on the portion of the X chromosome that escapes inactivation, the truncated protein may interact with the wildtype product to produce a dominant-negative effect
*No genotype-phenotype correlation exists to date.

==Prenatal testing==
*Prenatal testing using molecular genetic techniques is not clinically available
*Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect structural brain malformations and duplicated hallux

==Differential diagnosis==
(includes the other oral-facial-digital syndromes and disorders including cystic renal disease)
*OFD II (Mohr syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**primarily distinguished by polydactyly (bilateral postaxial polydactyly of hands, bilateral polysyndactly of feet)
**other manifestations include broad (sometimes bifid) nasal tip
**midline partial cleft of lip
**these individuals do not have milia or polycystic kidney disease
*OFD III (Sugarman syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**characterized by see-saw winking and polydactyly only postaxial
**myoclonic jerks (also occur)
**bulbous nose (may also occur)
**apparently low set ears (also occur)
*OFD IV (Buru-Baraister syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**tibial involvement (short tibia) and pre and or postaxial polydactyly (primary manifestations)
**Other findings include pectus excavatum and short stature
*OFD V (Thurston syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**includes polydactyly and median cleft lip only
**Only one affected individual has had hyperplastic frenula
*OFD VI (Varadi-Papp syndrome)
**distinguished by polydactyly (particularly central) and cerebellar malformations
**Renal agenesis and dysplasia have been described
*OFD VII (Whelan syndrome)
**includes unilateral cleft lip and hydronephrosis
**only been described in one mother-daughter pair
**congenital hydronephrosis, coarse hair, facial asymmetry, facial weakness, preauricular tags
**Inheritance either autosomal or X-linked dominant
**may be allelic to OFD1 if X-linked dominant
*OFD VIII
**apparently inherited as an X-linked recessive trait
**combination of polydactyly, tibial and radial defects, and epiglottal abnormalities
**pre and postaxial polydactyly of hans and bilateral duplication of halluces, short stature, bypoplasia of the epiglottis, absent/abnormal central incisors, broad/bifid nasal tip
**may be allelic to OFD1
*OFD IX
**includes retinal abnormalities and nonmedian cleft lip
**reported in three males
*Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
**In ADPKD cysts develop from tubules, whereas in OFD1 cysts develop from both tubules and glomeruli
**however, imaging studies cannot always distinguish the renal cystic disease of OFD1 from that of ADPKD and other cystic renal disorders
**cysts are said to be smaller and more uniform in size in OFD1 than in ADPKD, and the kidneys are not as enlarged or deformed in OFD1
**hepatic cysts and berry aneurysms have been observed in OFD1
**Other distinguishing features are mode of inheritance and the lack of oral, facial, digital, or brain abnormalities in ADPKD
*Meckel-Gruber syndrome
**autosomal recessive condition characterized by the combination of encephalocele, polydactyly, and polycystic kidney disease
**Other common findings include microphthalmia (small eyes) or anophthalmia (no eyes), cleft lip/palate, hepatic fibrosis and cysts, and congenital cardiac defects

==Health concerns and management==
*Treatment for OFD1 is supportive
*Removal of accessory teeth; orthodontia for malocculsion; and cosmetic or reconstructive surgery for clefts of the lip and/or palate, tongue nodules, accessory frenula, and syndactyly
*Hearing loss from recurrent otitis media, usually associated with cleft palate, has been reported
*End stage renal disease (ESRD) has been reported in affected girls and women ranging in age from 11 years to age 70 years
*Management of renal disease may require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation.
*Recently it has been emphasized that the risk for significant renal disease may be greater than previously reported
*Liver and pancreatic cysts may be observed
*Laboratory investigations such as creatinine levels and blood pressure determination to monitor renal function should be done
*if appropriate, imaging studies of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas should be performed

==Patient Resources==
(I found no patient literature that I felt was good or appropriate)
*http://www.netnet.net/mums/ -- Website where parents are matched up according to the condition that their child has. There are currently at least 4 people registered with OFD syndrome type I and 15 just listed under OFD syndrome.

I must suggest a change in the plan for the list of instructions.  Having a whole module for each one does not seem appropriate to me.  I like the content so far, and there is some more detail and an example or two that could be added.  But even with that, a lot of them would consist only of two or three paragraphs - - a little small for a module.

Having a module for the CTL instructions and having the link to IF be [[TI-Basic:Instructions:CTL#If]] makes more sense (especially for those that are really small like Stop.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
Cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world. It is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops. The most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops (buds) which may be either smoked or eaten; It also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish, and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil. There are three distinct genera of cannabis: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. Most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types. The term 'hemp' is generally used to describe low-thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses.

==Health and safety==
===Effects on the Brain===
Scientists have learned a great deal about how THC acts in the brain to produce its many effects. When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs throughout the body.

THC acts upon specific sites in the brain, called cannabinoid receptors, kicking off a series of cellular reactions that ultimately lead to the “high” that users experience when they smoke marijuana. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors; others have few or none. The highest density of cannabinoid receptors are found in parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thoughts, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement.&lt;ref&gt;Herkenham M, Lynn A, Little MD, et al. Cannabinoid receptor localization in the brain. Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 87(5):1932–1936, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not surprisingly, marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Research has shown that marijuana’s adverse impact on learning and memory can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off.&lt;ref&gt;Pope HG, Gruber AJ, Hudson JI, Huestis MA, Yurgelun-Todd D. Neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users. Arch Gen Psychiatry 58(10):909–915, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.

Research on the long-term effects of marijuana abuse indicates some changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term abuse of other major drugs. For example, cannabinoid withdrawal in chronically exposed animals leads to an increase in the activation of the stress-response system&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez de Fonseca F, Carrera MRA, Navarro M, Koob GF, Weiss F. Activation of corticotropin-releasing factor in the limbic system during cannabinoid withdrawal. Science 276(5321):2050–2054, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in the activity of nerve cells containing dopamine.&lt;ref&gt;Diana M, Melis M, Muntoni AL, Gessa GL. Mesolimbic dopaminergic decline after cannabinoid withdrawal. Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 95(17):10269–10273, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine neurons are involved in the regulation of motivation and reward, and are directly or indirectly affected by all drugs of abuse.

===Effects on the Lungs===
Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;&lt;ref&gt;Tashkin DP. Smoked marijuana as a cause of lung injury. Monaldi Arch Chest Dis 63(2):92–100, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.&lt;ref&gt;Hashibe M, Morgenstern H, Cui Y, et al. Marijuana use and the risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers: Results of a population-based case-control study. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 15(10):1829–1834, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.

Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.&lt;ref&gt; Polen MR, Sidney S, Tekawa IS, Sadler M, Friedman GD. Health care use by frequent marijuana smokers who do not smoke tobacco. West J Med 158(6):596–601, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses. 

===Effects on the Heart===
Marijuana increases heart rate by 20–100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Mittleman MA, Lewis RA, Maclure M, Sherwood JB, Muller JE. Triggering myocardial infarction by marijuana. Circulation 103(23):2805–2809, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the increased heart rate as well as effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias. This risk may be greater in aging populations or those with cardiac vulnerabilities.

===Effects on Mental Health===
A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia. Some of these studies have shown age at first use to be a factor, where early use is a marker of vulnerability to later problems. However, at this time, it is not clear whether marijuana use causes mental problems, exacerbates them, or is used in attempt to self-medicate symptoms already in existence. Chronic marijuana use, especially in a very young person, may also be a marker of risk for mental illnesses, including addiction, stemming from genetic or environmental vulnerabilities, such as early exposure to stress or violence. At the present time, the strongest evidence links marijuana use and schizophrenia and/or related disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Moore TH, Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, et al. Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: A systematic review. Lancet 370 (9584):319–328, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of marijuana can produce an acute psychotic reaction; in addition, use of the drug may trigger the onset or relapse of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.

===Other Effects===
Other effects include dry mouth (&quot;pasties&quot; or &quot;cotton mouth&quot;), increased appetite (&quot;munchies&quot;), and &quot;red-eye&quot;.
The first is a common effect from smoking anything. THC activates parts of the brain (Cannabinoid receptors) which are linked to appetite. (It is believed that cannabinoid receptors are activated after birth to make an infant hungry until they can learn the daily routine of eating). THC also causes dilation of blood vessels which can lead to the &quot;red-eye&quot;. THC can also lower intra-ocular (eye) pressure making it useful as a treatment for [[glaucoma]].

Cannabis has an anti-nauseante property. However, like most antiemetics, this effect is seemingly reversed with higher doses.

==Addictive Potential==
Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit. These withdrawal symptoms begin within about 1 day following abstinence, peak at 2–3 days, and subside within 1 or 2 weeks following drug cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Budney AJ, Vandrey RG, Hughes JR, Thostenson JD, Bursac Z. Comparison of cannabis and tobacco withdrawal: Severity and contribution to relapse. J Subst Abuse Treat, e-publication ahead of print, March 12, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and Appeal==
Cannabis is one of the most commonly abused drugs. Effects include relaxation, fatigue, increased emotional reaction (e.g., laughter), and muscle relaxation.{{fact}}

The effects typically subside between 1 and 4 hours after smoking, depending on the users body build.{{fact}}

===Effects on Daily Life===
Research clearly demonstrates that marijuana has the potential to cause problems in daily life or make a person’s existing problems worse. In one study, heavy marijuana abusers reported that the drug impaired several important measures of life achievement including physical and mental health, cognitive abilities, social life, and career status.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber AJ, Pope HG, Hudson JI, Yurgelun-Todd D. Attributes of long-term heavy cannabis users: A case control study. Psychological Med 33(8):1415–1422, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies associate workers’ marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers’ compensation claims, and job turnover.

==Non-Recreational Usage==
Hemp can be used to make paper, textiles (clothing, furniture upholstery, sails, etc.), fuel, and food. It can be grown rather easily and harvested several times annually.{{fact}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''LD/50''' of any substance is the lethal dose amount - typically given in a milligrams of the substance per kilogram of the users weight (mg/Kg) - needed to cause death to 50% of users.

This of course is never tested on humans. Instead a drug is administered intravenously to rats.

The number is not very reliable for two major reasons:
First of all, there is quite a difference between humans and rats. Humans have a completely different metabolism compared to our furry friends. This can either mean it takes more or less of a substance to reach LD/50, depending on the drug.

Secondly, many drugs are ingested orally. When something is absorbed by the GI track, it makes a pass through the liver. The liver breaks down a certain amount of the substance, usually into inactive chemicals (Although sometimes the liver breaks down an inactive chemical into an active one, such as with [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Codeine|Codeine]].

Wherever possible, this book includes the known human overdose threshold (Which is often a good deal below the LD/50), and/or a safe dosage range to stay clear of any dangers.

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Cuisine of Poland]]

'''Pierogi''' are Polish dumplings that are typically filled with potatoes, cheese, meat, sauerkraut and mushrooms or wild fruits (strawberries, blueberries, etc.).

== Ingredients ==
*  1 tbs. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*  ½ cup cold water
*  1-2 eggs large  [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
*  3½ cups  [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]], plus extra for rolling dough
*  ~1 cups water
*  1½ tbs. unsalted  [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Saurkraut Filling|sauerkraut filling]] or [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Cheese Filling|cheese filling]].

== Procedure ==
=== Dough ===
# Place flour in a large bowl.
# In a measuring cup, combine the salt, eggs, and the ½ cup cold water, and beat well with a fork.  Add those ingredients to flour and mix with your hands until blended.  Slowly mix in the remaining water (you do not have to add the entire cup, just keep adding until the dough feels wet).  Add the butter and knead until there are no lumps and it feels very smooth. This should take 15 minutes.  
# Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour, but for best results let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.

=== Assembly ===

# Divide the dough into thirds and roll out each on a lightly floured surface until the dough is approximately ⅛ inch thick.
# With a cup or glass, cut as many circles as possible out of the dough, but do not lift them off the work surface.
# Carefully lift each circle of dough from the table (a spatula helps) and put between 1 tsp. and 1 tbs. of filling in its center.  The amount would vary depending on the size of the glass that was used to cut the dough.  For each circle, fold dough over to form a half-moon shape, and pinch edges closed, making sure there are no air pockets.
# Repeat for the remaining dough.

=== Boiling ===
# Place no more than ⅓ of the pierogi at a time in boiling salted water for 5-10 minutes.  
# Drain in colander and lightly rinse with cold water-- this will prevent them from sticking together. 
# Serve immediately or fry in butter.  

== Notes ==
{{Wikipedia|Pierogi}}
* These will freeze well for up to 6 weeks. Prior to boiling them, place each pieróg on a sheet of parchment paper or a floured sheet of wax paper, being careful not to have them touching. Stack sheets on top of each other and place in an airtight freezer bag.
* A standard recipe for mashed potatoes can also be used as filling.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 oz. farmer's cheese (a soft, NOT a hard cheese) (if unsalted add 1 tsp. salt)
* 4 oz. [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 2 tbs. flour

== Procedure ==
Mash together all of the ingredients until well mixed.

== Notes ==
Farmer's cheese is similar to a dry-curd [[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|cottage cheese]] and is unavailable outside predominately Eastern European and Jewish areas. Dry-curd cottage cheese is a sub-par substitution, and must be drained of all excess liquid if it is to be used.

== Ingredients ==
Filling:
* 1 large can (~28 oz.) sauerkraut
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 stick butter  
* Salt and pepper
Dough:
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 egg (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* water

== Procedure ==
#Place sauerkraut and liquid in a pot filled with just enough water to cover the sauerkraut. When it begins to boil, remove from stove and place in a collander then drain and rinse well with cold water to prevent further cooking. With your hands, squeeze as much liquid from the kraut as you can to prevent the pierogi from being too soggy. Place the sauerkraut on a large cutting board and chop fine with a large flat-bladed knife.
#Fry the onion until it is translucent and then add the drained sauerkraut. Salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer for 15 minutes and let it cool before using. For best results, refrigerate a few hours before filling in pierogi.
#For the dough, sift and measure flour with salt into a large bowl. Slightly beat egg with fork and add egg to flour, then add enough water to make a pastry dough soft enough to roll out with a rolling pin but not too dry that it spits and cracks. Roll out dough on a floured bread board until about the thickness of a cracker. Use a large rimmed glass or a big biscuit cutter to cut rounds approximately 3&quot;-4&quot; in diameter. Fill each round with a generous spoonful of kraut mixture and fold dough in half. Pinch and seal the edge of the dough with fingers then gently fold and pinch edge to make a ruffled edge with about 1/4&quot; folds. Drop each pierogi dumpling into a large pot of boiling salt water and boil until they float to the top. Remove each carefully with a slotted spoon. Fry the pierogi in a skillet with melted butter until golden brown. 
#Serve warm or cold.

== Notes ==
The boiling step may be omitted if you like really strong sauerkraut.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Authentication keys can improve efficiency, if done properly.  As a bonus advantage, the passphrase and private key never leave the client&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC4252§7&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252#section-7 |title=The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol |publisher=IETF |year=2006| accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  They are generally recommended for outward facing systems so password authentication can be turned off.  

==Verify a Host Key by Fingerprint==

The first time connecting to a remote host, the key itself should be verified.  Usually this is done by comparing the fingerprint or the ASCII art visual host key, metadata about the key, rather than trying to compare the whole key itself.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org
The authenticity of host 'server.example.org (192.0.32.10)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:LPFiMYrrCYQVsVUPzjOHv+ZjyxCHlVYJMBVFerVCP7k.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fingerprint can be forced to display as an MD5 hash in hexadecimal instead by passing '''FingerprintHash''' configuration directive as a runtime argument or in '''ssh_config'''.  But the default is now SHA256 in base64.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 host.example.org
The authenticity of host 'host.example.org (192.0.32.203)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:10:4a:ec:d2:f1:38:f7:ea:0a:a0:0f:17:57:ea:a6:16.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
&lt;/pre&gt;

In OpenSSH 6.7 and earlier this fingerprint was a hexadecimal MD5 checksum instead a of the base64-encoded SHA256 checksum currently used:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org
The authenticity of host 'server.example.org (192.0.32.10)' can't be established. 
RSA key fingerprint is 4a:11:ef:d3:f2:48:f8:ea:1a:a2:0d:17:57:ea:a6:16. 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Downloading keys===

Usually a host’s key is displayed the first time the SSH client tries to connect.  The remote host’s public keys can also be fetched on demand using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)]:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan host.example.org  
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2
host.example.org ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBLC2PpBnFrbXh2YoK030Y5JdglqCWfozNiSMjsbWQt1QS09TcINqWK1aLOsNLByBE2WBymtLJEppiUVOFFPze+I=
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2
host.example.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC9iViojCZkcpdLju7/3+OaxKs/11TAU4SuvIPTvVYvQO32o4KOdw54fQmd8f4qUWU59EUks9VQNdqf1uT1LXZN+3zXU51mCwzMzIsJuEH0nXECtUrlpEOMlhqYh5UVkOvm0pqx1jbBV0QaTyDBOhvZsNmzp2o8ZKRSLCt9kMsEgzJmexM0Ho7v3/zHeHSD7elP7TKOJOATwqi4f6R5nNWaR6v/oNdGDtFYJnQfKUn2pdD30VtOKgUl2Wz9xDNMKrIkiM8Vsg8ly35WEuFQ1xLKjVlWSS6Frl5wLqmU1oIgowwWv+3kJS2/CRlopECy726oBgKzNoYfDOBAAbahSK8R

host.example.org ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDDOmBOknpyJ61Qnaeq2s+pHOH6rdMn09iREz2A/yO2m
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once the key is acquired, its fingerprint can be shown using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)].  This can be done directly with a pipe.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan host.example.org | ssh-keygen -lf - 
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2
256 SHA256:sxh5i6KjXZd8c34mVTBfWk6/q5cC6BzR6Qxep5nBMVo host.example.org (ECDSA)
2048 SHA256:hlPei3IXhkZmo+GBLamiiIaWbeGZMqeTXg15R42yCC0 host.example.org (RSA)
256 SHA256:ZmS+IoHh31CmQZ4NJjv3z58Pfa0zMaOgxu8yAcpuwuw host.example.org (ED25519)
&lt;/pre&gt;

If there is more than one public key type is available from the server on the port polled, then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] will fetch them.  If there is more than one key fed via '''stdin''' or a file, then [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)] will process them.  Prior to OpenSSH 7.2 manual fingerprinting was a two step process, the key was read to a file and then processed for its fingerprint.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 host.example.org &gt; key.pub
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.8
$ ssh-keygen -lf key.pub                       
256 SHA256:ZmS+IoHh31CmQZ4NJjv3z58Pfa0zMaOgxu8yAcpuwuw host.example.org (ED25519)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that some output from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] is sent to '''stderr''' instead of '''stdout'''.  

The hash can be generated manually with [http://linux.die.net/man/1/awk awk(1)], [http://linux.die.net/man/1/sed sed(1)] and [http://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd xxd(1)], on systems where they are found.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ awk '{print $2}' key.pub | base64 -d | md5sum -b | sed 's/../&amp;:/g; s/: .*$//'
$ awk '{print $2}' key.pub | base64 -d | sha256sum -b | sed 's/ .*$//' | xxd -r -p | base64 
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to find all hosts from a file which have new or different keys from those in '''known_hosts''', if the host names are in clear text and not stored as hashes.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa -f ssh_hosts | \
  sort -u - ~/.ssh/known_hosts | \
  diff ~/.ssh/known_hosts -
&lt;/pre&gt;

===ASCII Art Visual Host Key===

An ASCII art representation of the key can be supplied along with the SHA256 base64 fingerprint: 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lvf key 
256 SHA256:BClQBFAGuz55+tgHM1aazI8FUo8eJiwmMcqg2U3UgWU www.example.org (ED25519)

|+o .+.o.         |
|B=.oo.  .        |
|*B.=.o .         |
|= B *   S        |
|. .@ .           |
| +..B            |
|  *. o           |
| o.o.            |
+----[SHA256]-----+
&lt;/pre&gt;

In OpenSSH 6.7 and earlier the fingerprint is in MD5 hexadecimal form.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lvf key 
2048 37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0 www.example.net (RSA)

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Key-based authentication==

OpenSSH can use public key cryptography for authentication.  In public key cryptography, encryption and decryption are asymmetric.  The keys are used in pairs, a public key to encrypt and a hidden key to decrypt.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] can make RSA, DSA, Ed25519, or ECDSA keys for authenticating.  DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits in size.  RSA keys are allowed to vary from 768 bits on up.  Ed25519 keys have a fixed length.  ECDSA can be one of 256, 384 or 521 bits.  Shorter keys are faster, but less secure.  Longer keys are much slower to work with but provide better protection.  

The key files can be named anything, so it is possible to have many keys each for different services or tasks.  The comment field at the end of the public key can be useful in helping to keep the keys sorted, if you have many of them or use them infrequently.  

With key-based authentication, a copy of the public key is stored on the server and the private key is kept on the client.  When the client first contacts the server, the server responds by using the client's public key to encrypt a random number and return that encrypted random number as a challenge to the client.  The client uses the matching private key to decrypt the challenge and extract the random number.  The client then makes an MD5 hash of the session ID and the random number from the challenge and returns that hash to the server.  The server then makes its own hash of the session ID and the random number and compares that to the hash returned by the client.  If there is a match, the login is allowed.  If there is not a match, then the next public key on the server is tried until either a match is found or all the keys have been tried. &lt;ref name=&quot;How Key Challenges Work&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html#chal | title=An Illustrated Guide to SSH Agent Forwarding | author=Steve Friedl | date=2006-02-22 | accessdate=2013-04-27 | publisher=Unixwiz.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If an agent is used on the client side to manage authentication, the process is similar.  It only differs in that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] passes the challenge off to the agent which then calculates the response and passes it back to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] which then passes the agent's response back to the server.  

===Basics of Public Key Authentication===

For public key authentication, a key pair is needed.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] is used to make the key pair.  From that pair the public key must be properly stored on the remote host and the private key stored safely on the client.  The public key is added to the designated '''authorized_keys''' file for the remote user account.  Once the keys have been prepared they can be used again and again without needing to do anything else.  

Preparation of the keys:

0) If either the '''authorized_keys''' file or '''.ssh''' directory do not exist on either the client machine or the remote machine, create them and set the permissions correctly:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir ~/.ssh/
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 0700 ~/.ssh/
$ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

1) Create a key pair.  The example here creates a 4096-bit RSA key pair in the directory '''~/.ssh'''.  As a result, the public key will be seen named '''mykey_rsa.pub''' and and the private key will be called '''mykey_rsa'''.  Be sure to enter a sound passphrase.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since 6.5 a new private key format is available using a bcrypt KDF to better protect keys at rest.  This new format is always used for Ed25519 keys, and sometime in the future will be the default for all keys.  But for right now it may be requested when generating or saving existing keys of other types via the '''-o''' option in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)].  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -o -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

Details of the new format are found in the source code in the file '''PROTOCOL.key'''.

2) Transfer both the public and private keys to the client machine, if not already there from the step above.  It is usually best to store both the public and private keys in the directory '''~/.ssh/''' together.  

3) Transfer only the public key to remote machine.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa.pub fred@remotehost.example.org:.
&lt;/pre&gt;

4) Log in to the remote machine and add the new public key to the '''authorized_keys''' file, whether in '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''', the default, or somewhere else as designated by the server's configuration.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat mykey_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ nano -w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Any editor that does not wrap long lines can be used.  In the example above, [http://linux.die.net/man/1/nano nano(1)] is started with the '''-w''' option to prevent wrapping of long lines.  The same can also be accomplished permanently by editing [http://linux.die.net/man/5/nanorc nanorc(5)]   However it is done, the key must be in the file whole and unbroken, on a single  line. 

Usage of the keys: 
Authenticate to the remote machine from the client using the private key.  The option '''-i''' tells [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] which private key to try.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa -l fred remotehost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

➥ '''Troubleshooting of key-based authentication''':

If the server refuses to accept the key and fails over to the next authentication method (eg: &quot;Server refused our key&quot;), then there are several possible mistakes to look for on the server side.  

A common error, if a key doesn't work, is that the file permissions are wrong.  The authorized key file must be owned by the user in question and not be group writable.  Nor may the key file's directory be group or world writable.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~/.ssh
$ chmod u=rw,g=,o=  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another mistake that can happen is if the key is broken by line breaks or has other white space in the middle.  That can be fixed by joining up the lines and removing the spaces or by recopying the key more carefully.  

And, though it should go without saying, the halves of the key pair needs to match.  The public key on the server needs to match the private key held on the client.  If many keys are in use, it might be a good idea to add comments to them.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa -C &quot;web server mirror&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or the comment can be added to the authorized key file in the last column.  Again, the format of the file is given in the manual page for [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man8/sshd.8?query=sshd sshd(8)] in the section &quot;AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT&quot;.  

====Associating Keys Permanently with a Server====

The '''host''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] can apply specific settings to a target host.  That includes using specific keys with certain hosts.  So by changing '''~/.ssh/config''' it is possible to assign keys to be tried automatically whenever making a connection to that host.  Here, all that's needed is to type ''ssh web1'' to connect with the key for that server.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host web1
	Hostname 198.51.100.32
	IdentitiesOnly=yes
	IdentityFile=/home/fred/.ssh/web_key_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

Below  '''~/.ssh/config''' uses different keys for ''server'' versus ''server.example.org'',  regardless whether they resolve to the same machine.   This is possible because the host name argument given to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is not converted to a canonicalized host name before matching.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
	IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/key_a_rsa

Host server.example.org
	IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/key_b_rsa  
&lt;/pre&gt;

The parser is first-match, so the shorter name is tried first.  Of course less ambiguous shortcuts can also be made.  

====Encrypted Home Directories====

With encrypted home directories, the keys must be stored in an unencrypted directory and  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] configured appropriately to find the keys in that special location.  Sometimes it is also necessary to add a script or call a program from '''/etc/ssh/sshrc''' to decrypt the directory after authentication.

One symptom of having an encrypted home directory is that key-based authentication only works when you are already logged into the same account, but fails when trying to make the first connection and log in for the first time.

Here is one method for solving the access problem.  Each user is given a subdirectory under '''/etc/ssh/keys/''' which they can then use for storing their '''authorized_keys''' file.  This is set in the server's configuration file '''/etc/ssh/sshd_config'''

&lt;pre&gt;
AuthorizedKeysFile      /etc/ssh/keys/%u/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Multiple key file locations can be specified if they are separated by whitespace.  The user needs read access to the directory and keys, but write access is not needed.  That opens up more possibilities as to how the keys can be managed.

====Passwordless login====

One way of allowing passwordless logins is to follow the steps above, but do not enter a passphrase.  Note that this is very risky, so the key files should be very well protected and kept track of.  That includes that they only be used as single-purpose keys as described below.  Timely key rotation becomes especially important.  In general, it is not a good idea to make a key without a passphrase.  A better solution is to work with an authentication agent in conjunction with a single-purpose key.

====Requiring Both Keys and a Password====

While users should have strong passphrases for their keys, there is no way to enforce or verify that.  Indeed, the passphrase for any given key never leaves the client machine so it is nothing that the server can have any influence over.  Starting with OpenSSH 6.2, it is possible for the server to require multiple authentication methods for login using the '''AuthenticationMethods''' directive.   

&lt;pre&gt;
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example requires that users first authenticate using a key and only queries for a password if that succeeds.  It is not possible to get to the system password prompt without first authenticating with a valid key.  Changing the order of the arguments changes the order of the authentication methods.  

====Requiring Two or More Keys====

Since OpenSSH 6.8, the server now remembers which public keys have been used for authentication and refuses to accept previously-used keys.  This allows a set up requiring that users authenticate using two different public keys. 

&lt;pre&gt;
AuthenticationMethods publickey,publickey
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''AuthenticationMethods''' directive, whether for keys or passwords, can also be set on the server under a '''Match''' directive to apply only to certain groups or situations.

====Requiring Certain Key Types====

Also since OpenSSH 6.8, the '''PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes''' directive can specify that certain key types are accepted.  Those not in the comma-separated pattern list are not allowed.  

&lt;pre&gt;
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-ed25519*,ssh-rsa*,ecdsa-sha2*
&lt;/pre&gt;

The actual key types or a pattern can be in the list.  Spaces are not allowed in the pattern list.  The exact list of supported key types can be found by the '''-Q''' option on the client.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -Q key
&lt;/pre&gt;

For host-based authentication, it is the '''HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes''' directive that determines which key types are allowed for authentication.

===Key-based authentication using an Agent===

The authentication agent, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent ssh-agent(1)], should be started at the beginning of the session and used to launch the login session or X-session so that the environment variables are passed to each subsequent shell pointing to the agent process and its unix-domain socket.  Many distros do this automatically upon login or startup.  Starting the agent sets a pair of environment variables:

* SSH_AGENT_PID : the process id of the agent
* SSH_AUTH_SOCK : the filename and full path to the unix-domain socket

The various SSH and SFTP clients find these variables automatically and use them to contact the agent if they are set and if one or more keys are loaded.   If the shell or desktop session  was launched using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent ssh-agent(1)], then these variables are already set and available.  If not, then it is necessary to set them manually inside each shell or for each application in order to use the agent.  

Once the agent is available, a private key only needs to be loaded once and then can be used many times.   Private keys are loaded into the agent with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-add ssh-add(1)].

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-add /home/fred/.ssh/mykey_ed25519
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to list the identities currently in the agent.  The option '''-l''' will list all the fingerprints of the identities in the agent.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-add -l                                    
256 SHA256:77mfUupj364g1WQ+O8NM1ELj0G1QRx/pHtvzvDvDlOk mykey_ed25519 (ED25519)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to remove individual identities from the agent using '''-d''' which will remove them one at a time by name, but only if the name is given.  Without the name of a private key, it will fail silently.  Using '''-D''' will remove all of them at once without needing to specify any by name.  

====Agent forwarding====

In agent forwarding, intermediate machines forward challenges and responses back and forth between the client and the final destination.  This eliminates the need for passwords or keys on any of these intermediate machines.  In other words, an advantage of agent forwarding is that the private key itself is not needed on any remote machine, thus hindering unwanted access to it. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH key management, Part 3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc3/ | title=Common threads: OpenSSH key management, Part 3 | author=Daniel Robbins | publisher=IBM | date=2002-02-01 | accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another advantage is that the actual agent to which the user has authenticated does not go anywhere and is thus less susceptible to analysis.  

The default configuration files for the server enable authentication agent forwarding, so to use it, nothing needs to be done there.  On the client side it is disabled by default and so it must be enabled explicitly.  Put the following line in  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] to enable agent forwarding for a particular server:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host gateway.example.org
	ForwardAgent yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

One risk with agents is that they can be re-used to tailgate in if the permissions allow it.  Keys cannot be copied this way, but authentication is possible when there are incorrect permissions.  Note that disabling agent forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own forwarders.

The risks of agent forwarding can be mitigated by confirming each use of a key by adding the '''-c''' option when adding the key to the agent.  This requires the SSH_ASKPASS variable be set and available to the agent process, but will generate a prompt on the host running the agent upon each use of the key by a remote system.

==Single-purpose keys==

Tailored single-purpose keys can eliminate use of remote root logins for administrative activities.  A  finely tailored sudoers is needed along with a user account.  When done right, it gives just enough access to get the job done, following the security principle of Least Privilege.  Single-purpose keys are accompanied by use of either the '''ForceCommand''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] or the '''Command=''' directive inside the '''authorized_keys''' file.  Further, neither the '''authorized_keys''' file nor the home directory should be writable.  
&lt;code&gt;ssh -v&lt;/code&gt; can show exactly what is being passed to the server so that sudoers can be set up correctly when setting up encrypted remote backups using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync rsync(1)], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/tar.1 tar(1)], [http://linux.die.net/man/1/mysqldump mysqldump(1)], etc.  For example, here is what &lt;code&gt;ssh -v&lt;/code&gt; show from one particular usage of [http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync rsync(1)]:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --server -vlHogDtprz --delete --delete-after \
	--ignore-errors . /org/backup
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Key-based authentication, with limitations on activity===
The '''authorized_keys''' file can force a particular program to run whenever the key is used.  This is useful for automating various tasks.  The following launches firefox automatically and exits the connection when it is finished.

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/bin/firefox&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following further restricts the connection to coming from a single domain.

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/bin/firefox&quot;,from=&quot;*.example.net&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3...FLoJk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The manual page [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] has the full list of options for the '''authorized_keys''' file.

The following key will only echo some text and then exit, unless used non-interactively with the '''-N''' option.  No matter what the user tries, it will echo the text.  The '''-N''' option will disable running the remote program, allowing the connection to stay open. 

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/bin/echo do-not-send-commands&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3...99ptc=
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is very useful for keys that are only used for tunnels.

===Read-only access to keys===

In some cases it is necessary to prevent the users from changing their own authentication keys.  This can be done by putting the key file in an external directory where the user has read-only access to the key file and no write permissions to either the file or the directory.  The '''AuthorizedKeysFile''' directive sets where [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man8/sshd.8 sshd(8)] looks for the keys and can point to the secured location for the keys instead of the default location.

The default location for keys on most systems is usually '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys'''.  A good alternate location could be to create the directory '''/etc/ssh/authorized_keys''' and store the selected users' key files there.  The change can be made to apply to only a group of users by putting it under a '''Match''' directive.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group sftpusers
	AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u
&lt;/pre&gt;

This works even within a chrooted environment.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group sftpusers
	ChrootDirectory /home
	ForceCommand internal-sftp -d %u
	AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course it could be set to affect all users by putting the directive in the main part of the server configuration file.

==Mark public keys as revoked==

Keys that have been revoked can be stored in '''/etc/ssh/revoked_keys''', a file specified in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)]  using the directive '''RevokedKeys''', so that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will prevent attempts to log in with them.  No warning or error on the client side will be given if a revoked key is tried.  Authentication will simply progress to the next key or method.

The revoked keys file should contain a list of public keys, one per line, that have been revoked and can no longer be used to connect to the server.  The key cannot contain any extras, such as [[OpenSSH/Client_Configuration_Files#Available_key_login_options | login options]] or it will be ignored. If one of the revoked keys is tried during a login attempt, the server will simply ignore it and move on to the next authentication method.  An entry will be made in the logs of the attempt, including the key's fingerprint.  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging | logging]] for a little more on that.  

&lt;pre&gt;
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''RevokedKeys''' configuration directive is not set in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] by default.  It must be set explicitly if it is to be used.  

===Key Revocation Lists===

A compact, binary form of representing revoked keys and certificates is available as a Key Revocation List (KRL).  KRLs are generated with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] and can be created fresh or an existing one updated.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -kf  /etc/ssh/revoked_keys -z 1 ~/.ssh/old_key_rsa.pub
$ ssh-keygen -ukf /etc/ssh/revoked_keys -z 2 ~/.ssh/old_key_dsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to test if a specific key or certificate is in the revocation list.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -Qf  /etc/ssh/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/old_key_rsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

Only public keys and certificates will be loaded into the KRL.  Corrupt or broken keys will not be loaded and will produce an error message if tried.  Like with the regular '''RevokedKeys''' list, the public key destined for the KRL cannot contain any extras like login options or it will produce an error when an attempt is made to load it into the KRL or search the KRL for it.

==More on Verifying SSH Keys==

Reliable verification of a host key must be done when first connecting.  To know the key fingerprint in advance, it can be necessary to contact the system administrator who can provide it out of band.  Use '''ssh-keygen''' on the local console to be absolutely sure.  

Here the server's RSA key is read and its fingerprint shown as SHA256 base64:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub     
2048 SHA256:hlPei3IXhkZmo+GBLamiiIaWbeGZMqeTXg15R42yCC0 root@server.example.net (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here the corresponding ECDSA key is read, but shown as an MD5 hexadecimal hash:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub                                                 &lt;
256 MD5:ed:d2:34:b4:93:fd:0e:eb:08:ee:b3:c4:b3:4f:28:e4 root@server.example.net (ECDSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Prior to 6.8, the fingerprint was expressed as an MD5 hexadecimal hash:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub 
2048 MD5:e4:a0:f4:19:46:d7:a4:cc:be:ea:9b:65:a7:62:db:2c root@server.example.net (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] to get keys from an active SSH server.  However, the fingerprint still needs to be verified out of band then.  

===Warning: Remote Host Identification Has Changed!===

If the server's key does not match what has been recorded in either the system's or the local user's '''authorized_keys''' files, then the SSH client will issue a warning.  Two main reasons for the warning exist.  One is when the server's key has been changed, maybe the server was reinstalled without backing up the old keys.  Another situation is when the connection is made to the wrong machine, one such case would be the during an attempted man in the middle attack or when contacting a server that changes addresses because of dynamic address allocation.  

In cases where the key has changed there is only one thing to do: contact the system administrator and verify the key.  The system administrator may be you yourself in some cases.  If so, was OpenSSH-server recently reinstalled, or was the machine restored from an old backup?  The new key fingerprint can be sent out by some method where it is possible to verify the integrity and origin of the message, for example via PGP-signed e-mail.

Then go over to the client machine where you got the error and remove the old key from '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -R host.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then try logging in, but enter the password if and '''only''' if the key fingerprint matches what you got on the server console.  If the key fingerprint matches, then go through with the login process and the key will be automatically added.  If the key finger print does not match, stop immediately and it would be a good idea to get on the phone (a real phone, no computer phones) to the remote machine's system administrator or the network administrator.

===Multiple keys for a host, multiple hosts for a key in known_hosts===
Using pattern matching in known_hosts, it is possible to assign multiple host names or ip addresses to the same key.  That goes for both those global keys in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' and those local user-specific key lists in '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''.  They should provide you with an up-to-date set to add to your known hosts file. Otherwise, you must verify the keys by hand.  
&lt;pre&gt;
server1,server2,server3 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvl...jhvlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can use globbing to a limited extent in either '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' or '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
172.19.40.* ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvl...jhvlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
However, to get the effect you want, multiple keys for the same address, make multiple entries in either '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' or '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''', one for each key.
&lt;pre&gt;
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...vlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerf1dcw16twc61c6cw1ryer4t...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rdfcvbhu865rfgbvcfrt65...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
To get a pool of servers to share a pool of keys, each server-key combination must be added manually to the '''known_hosts''' file. 
&lt;pre&gt; 
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...07t8mmniKjug...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerfw1ryer4t...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rvcfrt65...==

server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...07t8mmniKjug...==
server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerfw1ryer4t...==
server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rvcfrt65...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
I'm not quite sure how to get that to work with hashed host names. 

This will get the rsa key for ''server1'', put the rsa key in file (e.g. '''z.key''') and give a fingerprint for the key in that file:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa server1 
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa server1 &gt; z.key 
$ ssh-keygen -l -f z.key
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Another way of Dealing with Dynamic (roaming) IP Addresses===
It is possible to manually point to the right key using '''HostKeyAlias''' either as part of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)]  or as a runtime parameter.  Here the key for machine Foobar is used to connect to host 192.168.11.15

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o CheckIP=no -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
      -o HostKeyAlias=foobar   192.168.11.15
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is useful when DHCP is not configured to try to keep the same addresses for the same machines over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cryptography is a Greek word which means &quot;Secret Writing&quot;''

'''Important Uses of Cryptography'''
1. Protect confidentiality of message (Achieved with Encryption Algorithms)
2. Provide identity for authentication (Achieved with Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms, digital signature algorithms)
3. Verify information to check message integrity (Achieved with hash functions)

To Validate information cryptographic function are used.

Cryptographic functions are called as '''hash functions'''

'''e.g. of Hash Functions'''
1. MD5 (Message Digest 5)
2. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

'''Types of Cryptography'''
1. Secret key cryptography (Both parties know the same secret key. Uses '''symmetric encryption''')
2. Public key cryptography (Both parties have 2 different keys,'''Public key for encryption''' and '''Private key for decryption'''. 
In Reversible public key algorithms, Data encrypted with private key can be decrypted with public key.Uses '''asymmetric encryption''')

Encryption algorithms are called '''Ciphers'''
Information in encrypted form is called '''Ciphertext'''

'''2 Types of Ciphers'''
1. Stream Ciphers (Process data byte at a time)
2. Block Ciphers (Process data in blocks 8 bytes at a time. Pad packets smaller than block)

'''e.g. of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms'''

1. DES (Data Encryption Standard - Block)
2. 3DES (Triple strength Data Encryption Standard - Block)
3. RC2 (Rivest Cipher 2 - Block)
4. RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4 - Stream)

'''e.g. of Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms'''

1. RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman
2. DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm - Can only be used for digital signatures.

== Deletion of Page ==

Please don't blank pages that you want to delete.  It causes us no end of grief here and with other Wikimedia projects.  If you can, please use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' markup template on the page if you want to delete something from here.  We will find the page sooner and be able to deal with the deletion without having to fight through other pages first.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ddp. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ddp~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

===''substr function''===
Uses
 1. get subset of string
 2. Replace subset of string with new string.

Syntax
 $value = substr($string, $offset, $count);
 $value = substr($string, $offset);

 substr($string, $offset, $count) = $newstring;
 substr($string, $offset, $count, $newstring);  # same as previous
 substr($string, $offset)         = $newtail;

E.g.

 $string = 'abcd1234';
 $subs = substr($string,4);
 print $subs;
 
 Output: 1234

 $string = 'abcd1234';
 substr($string,0,4)=&quot;pqrs&quot;;
 print $string;

 Output: pqrs1234

 # substitute &quot;at&quot; for &quot;is&quot;, restricted to first five characters
 substr($string, 0, 5) =~ s/is/at/g;

===''unpack'' function===

For positioning, use lowercase &quot;x&quot; with a count to skip forward some number of bytes, an uppercase &quot;X&quot; with a count to skip backward some number of bytes, and an &quot;@&quot; to skip to an absolute byte offset within the record.

 # extract column with unpack
 $a = &quot;To be or not to be&quot;;
 $b = unpack(&quot;x6 A6&quot;, $a);  # skip 6, grab 6
 print $b;
 or not


 ($b, $c) = unpack(&quot;x6 A2 X5 A2&quot;, $a); # forward 6, grab 2; backward 5, grab 2
 print &quot;$b\n$c\n&quot;;

'''RTOG 84-05 ([[Radiation Oncology/Liver|LIVER]])'''  
*''Title:'' Phase I/II Dose-Escalating Trial of Accelerated Fractionation in the Palliative Irradiation of Hepatic Metastases from Primary Cancer of the GI Tract 
*''Objective:'' 
**I. Assess the feasibility and efficacy of a twice-daily schedule of radiation treatments in the palliation of patients with liver metastases from cancer of the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, biliary tree, colon, or rectum.
**II. Determine whether greater doses of hepatic irradiation in a selected population of prognostically favorable patients can result in a decreasing frequency of progressive liver metastases as a direct cause of death.
**III. Help define the tolerance of the liver to fractionated irradiation delivered in dose fractions that may ultimately be clinically useful in the elective or adjuvant irradiation of the liver in high-risk patients with primary cancers draining via the portal circulation.
*''[http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=72100&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;protocolsearchid=1985862 Protocol]:'' Whole liver dose escalation 27 Gy -&gt; 36 Gy given in 1.5 Gy/fx BID
*''Eligibility:'' Measurable hepatic metastases (as documented by CT scan) from histologically verified primary cancers arising in the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, biliary tree, colon, or rectum.  All cell types are permissible except leukemia, plasmacytoma, and lymphoma. 
*''Enrolled:'' 173 patients
*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 8365932 -- ''Accelerated hyperfractionated hepatic irradiation in the management of patients with liver metastases: results of the RTOG dose escalating protocol.'' (Russel AH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 1;27(1):117-23.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation, however, it did succeed in determining that 33 Gy in fractions of 1.5 Gy is unsafe, carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury. The absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 Gy and 30 Gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose (21 Gy) to fully test the question.&quot;

*''Title:'' Phase I/II evaluation of I-131 Antiferritin after RT/CT induction
*''Objective:''
**I. Provide the necessary data to determine the maximum safe dose of adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil that can be combined with I-131 antiferritin IgG (given 30 mCi on day 0 and 20 mCi on day 5).

== Who is This Book For? ==

This is designed for a first course in Circuit Analysis which is usually accompanied by a set of labs. It is assumed that students are in a Differential Equations class at the same time. Phasors are used to avoid the Laplace transform of driving functions while maintaining a complex impedance transform of the physical circuit that is identical in both. 1st and 2nd order differential equations can be solved using phasors and calculus if the driving functions are sinusoidal. The 
sinusoidal is then replaced by the more simple step function and then the convolution integral is used to find an analytical solution to any driving function. This leaves time for a more intuitive understanding of poles, zeros, transfer functions, and Bode plot interpretation.

For those who have already had differential equations, the Laplace transform equivalent will be presented as an alternative while focusing on phasors and calculus. 

This book will expect the reader to have a firm understanding of Calculus specifically, and will not stop to explain the fundamental topics in Calculus. 

For information on Calculus, see the wikibook: [[Calculus]].

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will cover linear circuits, and linear circuit elements. The goal is to emphasize Kirchhoff and symbolic algebra systems such as matLab mupad or mathematica at the expense of node, mesh, Norton, etc. A phasor/calculus based approach starts at the very beginning and ends with the convolution integral to handle all the various types of forcing functions. 

The result is a linear analysis experience that is general in nature but skips Laplace and Fourier transforms.

Krichhoff's laws receive normal focus, but the other circuit analysis/simplification techniques receive less than a normal attention.

The class ends with application of these concepts in Power Analysis, Filters, Control systems. 

The goal is set the ground work for a transition to the digital version of these concepts from a firm basis in the physical world. The next course would be one focused on modeling linear systems and analyzing them digitally in preparation for a digital signal ([[:w:Digital_signal_processing|DSP]]) processing course.

== Where to Go From Here ==

*For a technician version of this course which focuses on the real rather than the idea, expertise rather than theory, on algebra rather than calculus, see the '''[[Electronics]]''' wikibook 
*Take '''[[Ordinary_Differential_Equations]]''' now that you have a practical reason to. The math class should ideally feel like an &quot;art&quot; class and be enjoyable.
*To begin a course of study in Computer Engineering, see the '''[[Digital Circuits]]''' wikibook.
*For a traditional &quot;next&quot; course see the '''[[Signals and Systems]]''' wikibook. There should be an overlap with this one.
*The intended next course would have a name such as '''[http://www.ece.umd.edu/~adrian/enee222/textbook/enee241text0708.pdf A New Sequence in Signals and Linear Systems]''' or '''[http://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-using-MATLAB-Chaparro/dp/0123747163 Elements of Discrete Signal Analysis]'''.</text>

Well this is good new and can be a good way to make this book neutral. I just want to caution against turning this into an anti-drug book, since that is not any more neutral than a pro-drug book. A thought I had on how we might maintain a neutral point of view is by importing and adopting some work that already has been done on Wikipedia for use in this book. Most of [[w:Recreational drug use]] could probably be adopted for use in the Introduction chapter for example. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:36, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

:I disagree about the usefulness of [[w:Recreational drug use]], the material at the wikipedia is not very good and in many places is tagged as such.  I will try a bit harder to be neutral in my own writing and I have been careful to try to only bring in factual information that is properly sited from the websites controlled by NIDA. There will undoubtedly be some clean up necessary in the end to make sure we maintain NPOV. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:00, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

==Oy! What happend!==
Can we discuss renaming the entire book, I have been actively editing this and it is a bit annoying to work hard for an hour on a page click save and find a message saying the page has been deleted. For reasons I don't have time just at the moment to explain I would perfer to keep it under the previous title. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:06, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
:I like the current title as I forsee this book as potential reference during &quot;NIDA National Drug Facts Week - Shatter the Myths&quot; for which the mantra of fact vs fiction fits in quite well. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:02, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
:: My reasoning/thought is that the book should attempt to honor/stick with the original aim/scope of the book, which is about recreational drug use. However the book's title suggests a scope that is broader than the reality.
:: I think in the context of recreational drug use a NPOV can include the benefits from the perspective of those that use the drugs, and the dangers from a medical perspective. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:20, 9 July 2010 (UTC)
::: It is my intention rewrite the book in part to take care of the POV problems that we collectively recommended for clean up in multiple RfD's but were never implemented by anyone.  Unfortunately after I returned last evening I discovered my laptop was not plugged in and I could no longer copy and paste work elsewhere.  Which is a bit disappointing. If you plan any major restructuring of the book, particularly one that involves moving many pages, could please leave a note here to give me a heads up it would be appreciated.

:::: Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be specific suggestions of what clean up needed to be done. I think you are already aware of the name I think this book should have so I doubt I need to mention that. Other than the name the only other structural changes I had in mind right now was to include a full table of contents, add navigational aids, and try to get this book to have an actual order for pages to be read. I had in mind to import and use work from Wikipedia to fill in a lot of missing details, not necessarily keeping everything from the Wikipedia pages, but the import would be done to preserve history and provide proper acknowledgments. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:47, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

'''What are Labels?'''

Labels are a feature found exclusively in Gmail. It's more or less the same as the Folder feature found in other web mails like Yahoo! Mail &amp; Hotmail, but definitely simpler &amp; quicker to use.

It is a simple way to set up links to find your emails quickly, and this system is used in conjunction with their Archiving system. 

[[Image:Gmail-Labels.png|thumb|left|150px|frame| Gmail Labels]]

'''How do I setup a label?'''

To set up a label, check the box next to the mail you want to label. Then go to the drop-down menu and click &quot;Add New Label&quot;. Type the label name into the pop-up. Now you will see a green box on your lower  left listing all the labels you have made. Click on it to find all emails with a given label.

'''Operator'''

You can use the operator '''label:''' in your filters or searchings.

For example, ''label:saved shows'' the email that you marked with a tag called ''saved''.

===Model MS degree in water resources planning===

The [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ US Army Corps of Engineers-IWR] and the Universities Council on Water Resources developed a [http://www.water-resources.us/Advanced/docs/curriculum.pdf model curriculum] for a [http://www.water-resources.us/Advanced/ masters degree in water resources planning] for the Corps' new hires.  The curriculum (30 semester hours) consists of 10 courses:  eight cornerstone courses, an independent study course, and a capstone course with advanced planning practicum.   [http://www.water-resources.us/Advanced/participating.cfm/ Six universities] now (2005) offer an MS degree consistent with this model curriculum.

There is now a reasonable chapter summery for chapter 32 of [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]. I hope to be able to do more chapter summeries (if not much else) for the rest of the books, when i have some spare time on my hands. [[User:Jammi568|Jammi568]] 17:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Welcome to the project. Please contact [[User:Chazz]] before you write any more chapter summaries so that you can get familiar with the writing style of these pages from an experienced editor.

okay, sure thing. But for a first attempt, i think it was very good, personally [[User:Jammi568|Jammi568]] 09:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:For a first effort, yes... but it will need to be expanded now to include all the details that are important; for instance, the fact that Harry's blood was used in Voldemort's revival was somehow interesting to Dumbledore later, and the author has suggested that we should be curious about that. The amount of interest caused by that one choice certainly makes it critical that we include that in the synopsis, and perhaps go into it in greater depth both in the analysis (where we would mention that Voldemort says that it will grant him immunity against the protection from his mother's sacrifice) and in the greater picture (where we mention Dumbledore's interest in chapter 36, and speculate on the effect it will have in Deathly Hallows).

== x86 Architecture ==
The x86 architecture has 8 General-Purpose Registers (GPR), 6 Segment Registers, 1 Flags Register and an Instruction Pointer. 64-bit x86 has additional registers.
{{Wikipedia|Processor register}}
=== General-Purpose Registers (GPR) - 16-bit naming conventions ===  
The 8 GPRs are:
# Accumulator register (AX). Used in arithmetic operations.
# Counter register (CX). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
# Data register (DX). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
# Base register (BX). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).
# Stack Pointer register (SP). Pointer to the top of the stack.
# Stack Base Pointer register (BP). Used to point to the base of the stack.
# Source Index register (SI). Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
# Destination Index register (DI). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.

The order in which they are listed here is for a reason: it is the same order that is used in a push-to-stack operation, which will be covered later.

All registers can be accessed in 16-bit and 32-bit modes. In 16-bit mode, the register is identified by its two-letter abbreviation from the list above. In 32-bit mode, this two-letter abbreviation is prefixed with an 'E' (''extended''). For example, 'EAX' is the accumulator register as a 32-bit value.

Similarly, in the 64-bit version, the 'E' is replaced with an 'R', so the 64-bit version of 'EAX' is called 'RAX'.

It is also possible to address the first four registers (AX, CX, DX and BX) in their size of 16-bit as two 8-bit halves. The least significant byte (LSB), or low half, is identified by replacing the 'X' with an 'L'. The most significant byte (MSB), or high half, uses an 'H' instead. For example, CL is the LSB of the counter register, whereas CH is its MSB.

In total, this gives us five ways to access the accumulator, counter, data and base registers: 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, 8-bit LSB, and 8-bit MSB. The other four are accessed in only three ways: 64-bit, 32-bit and 16-bit. The following table summarises this:

=== Segment Registers ===

The 6 Segment Registers are:

* Stack Segment (SS). Pointer to the stack.
* Code Segment (CS). Pointer to the code.
* Data Segment (DS). Pointer to the data.
* Extra Segment (ES). Pointer to extra data ('E' stands for 'Extra').
* F Segment (FS). Pointer to more extra data ('F' comes after 'E').
* G Segment (GS). Pointer to still more extra data ('G' comes after 'F').

Most applications on most modern operating systems (like FreeBSD, Linux or Microsoft Windows) use a memory model that points nearly all segment registers to the same place (and uses paging instead), effectively disabling their use. Typically the use of FS or GS is an exception to this rule, instead being used to point at thread-specific data.

=== EFLAGS Register ===

The EFLAGS is a 32-bit register used as a collection of bits representing Boolean values to store the results of operations and the state of the processor.

The names of these bits are:
{|  width=100% style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; 
| 31 || 30 || 29 || 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16
|-  style=&quot;background-color: blue; color: white;&quot;
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || ID || VIP || VIF || AC || VM || RF
|- 
!  colspan=16 height=5 | 
|- 
!  colspan=16 style=&quot;background-color: black;&quot; | 
|- 
| 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0
|-  style=&quot;background-color: #777777; color: white;&quot;
| 0 || NT
!  colspan=2 | IOPL
| OF || DF || IF || TF || SF || ZF || 0 || AF || 0 || PF || 1 || CF
|} 

The bits named 0 and 1 are reserved bits and shouldn't be modified.

{|  
!  style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; colspan=2 | The different use of these flags are:
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 0. || CF : Carry Flag. Set if the last arithmetic operation carried (addition) or borrowed (subtraction) a bit beyond the size of the register.  This is then checked when the operation is followed with an add-with-carry or subtract-with-borrow to deal with values too large for just one register to contain.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 2. || PF : Parity Flag. Set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte is a multiple of 2.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 4. || AF : Adjust Flag. Carry of Binary Code Decimal (BCD) numbers arithmetic operations.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 6. || ZF : Zero Flag. Set if the result of an operation is Zero (0).
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 7. || SF : Sign Flag. Set if the result of an operation is negative.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 8. || TF : Trap Flag. Set if step by step debugging.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 9. || IF : Interruption Flag. Set if interrupts are enabled.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 10. || DF : Direction Flag. Stream direction. If set, string operations will decrement their pointer rather than incrementing it, reading memory backwards.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 11. || OF : Overflow Flag. Set if signed arithmetic operations result in a value too large for the register to contain.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 12-13. || IOPL : I/O Privilege Level field (2 bits). I/O Privilege Level of the current process.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 14. || NT : Nested Task flag. Controls chaining of interrupts. Set if the current process is linked to the next process.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 16. || RF : Resume Flag. Response to debug exceptions.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 17. || VM : Virtual-8086 Mode. Set if in 8086 compatibility mode.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 18. || AC : Alignment Check. Set if alignment checking of memory references is done.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 19. || VIF : Virtual Interrupt Flag. Virtual image of IF.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 20. || VIP : Virtual Interrupt Pending flag. Set if an interrupt is pending.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 21. || ID : Identification Flag. Support for CPUID instruction if can be set.
|}

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The EIP register contains the address of the '''next''' instruction to be executed if no branching is done.

EIP can only be read through the stack after a &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

=== Memory ===

The x86 architecture is [[Wikipedia:Little endian|little-endian]], meaning that multi-byte values are written least significant byte first. (This refers only to the ordering of the bytes, not to the bits.)

So the 32 bit value B3B2B1B0&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; on an x86 would be represented in memory as:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Little endian representation'''
| &lt;code&gt;B0&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B1&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B2&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B3&lt;/code&gt;
|} 

For example, the 32 bits double word 0x1BA583D4 (the '''0x''' denotes hexadecimal) would be written in memory as:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Little endian example'''
| &lt;code&gt;D4&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;83&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;A5&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;1B&lt;/code&gt;
|}

This will be seen as &lt;code&gt;0xD4 0x83 0xA5 0x1B&lt;/code&gt; when doing a memory dump.

=== Two's Complement Representation ===

Two's complement is the standard way of representing negative integers in binary.  The sign is changed by inverting all of the bits and adding one.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Two's complement example'''
|-
|''Start'':
|&lt;code&gt;0001&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|''Invert'':
|&lt;code&gt;1110&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|''Add One'':
|&lt;code&gt;1111&lt;/code&gt;
|}

0001 represents decimal 1

1111 represents decimal -1

=== Addressing modes ===
The addressing mode indicates the manner in which the operand is presented.

;Register Addressing:(operand address R is in the address field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, bx  ; moves contents of register bx into ax&lt;/source&gt;

;Immediate: (actual value is in the field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, 1   ; moves value of 1 into register ax&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, 010Ch ; moves value of 0x010C into register ax&lt;/source&gt;

;Direct memory addressing: (operand address is in the address field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
.data
my_var dw 0abcdh ; my_var = 0xabcd
.code
mov ax, [my_var] ; copy my_var content into ax (ax=0xabcd)
&lt;/source&gt;

;Direct offset addressing: (uses arithmetics to modify address)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
byte_tbl db 12,15,16,22,..... ; Table of bytes
mov al,[byte_tbl+2]
mov al,byte_tbl[2] ; same as the former
&lt;/source&gt;

;Register Indirect: (field points to a register that contains the operand address)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[di]&lt;/source&gt;
:The registers used for indirect addressing are BX, BP, SI, DI 

;Base-index:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[bx + di]&lt;/source&gt;
:For example, if we are talking about an array, BX contains the address of the beginning of the array, and DI contains the index into the array.

;Base-index with displacement:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[bx + di + 10]&lt;/source&gt;

=== General-purpose registers (64-bit naming conventions) ===
{{main|X86 Assembly/16 32 and 64 Bits}}
64-bit x86 adds 8 more general-purpose registers, named R8, R9, R10 and so on up to R15. It also introduces a new naming convention that must be used for these new registers and can also be used for the old ones (except that AH, CH, DH and BH have no equivalents). In the new convention:
*R0 is RAX.
*R1 is RCX.
*R2 is RDX.
*R3 is RBX.
*R4 is RSP.
*R5 is RBP.
*R6 is RSI.
*R7 is RDI. 
*R8,R9,R10,R11,R12,R13,R14,R15 are the new registers and have no other names.
*R0D~R15D are the lowermost 32 bits of each register. For example, R0D is EAX.
*R0W~R15W are the lowermost 16 bits of each register. For example, R0W is AX.
*R0L~R15L are the lowermost 8 bits of each register. For example, R0L is AL.
{{main|X86 Assembly/SSE}}
As well, 64-bit x86 includes SSE2, so each 64-bit x86 CPU has at least 8 registers (named XMM0~XMM7) that are 128 bits wide, but only accessible through [[X86 Assembly/SSE|SSE instructions]]. They cannot be used for quadruple-precision (128-bit) floating-point arithmetic, but they can each hold 2 double-precision or 4 single-precision floating-point values for a SIMD parallel instruction. They can also be operated on as 128-bit integers or vectors of shorter integers. If the processor supports AVX, as newer Intel and AMD desktop CPUs do, then each of these registers is actually the lower half of a 256-bit register (named YMM0~YMM7), the whole of which can be accessed with AVX instructions for further parallelization.

== Stack ==
The stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure; data is pushed onto it and popped off of it in the reverse order. 
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
 mov ax, 006Ah
 mov bx, F79Ah
 mov cx, 1124h
 push ax
&lt;/source&gt;  
You push the value in AX onto the top of the stack, which now holds the value $006A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;push bx&lt;/source&gt;
You do the same thing to the value in BX; the stack now has $006A and $F79A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;push cx&lt;/source&gt;
Now the stack has $006A, $F79A, and $1124.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;call do_stuff&lt;/source&gt;
Do some stuff. The function is not forced to save the registers it uses, hence us saving them.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop cx&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into CX, $1124; the stack now has $006A and $F79A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop bx&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into BX, $F79A; the stack now has just $006A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop ax&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into AX, $006A; the stack is empty.

The Stack is usually used to pass arguments to functions or procedures and also to keep track of control flow when the &lt;code&gt;call&lt;code&gt; instruction is used. The other common use of the Stack is temporarily saving registers.

== CPU Operation Modes ==
=== Real Mode ===
Real Mode is a holdover from the original Intel 8086. You generally won't need to know anything about it (unless you are programming for a DOS-based system or, more likely, writing a boot loader that is directly called by the BIOS).

The Intel 8086 accessed memory using 20-bit addresses. But, as the processor itself was 16-bit, Intel invented an addressing scheme that provided a way of mapping a 20-bit addressing space into 16-bit words. Today's x86 processors start in the so-called Real Mode, which is an operating mode that mimics the behavior of the 8086, with some very tiny differences, for backwards compatibility.

In Real Mode, a segment and an offset register are used together to yield a final memory address. The value in the segment register is multiplied by 16 (shifted 4 bits to the left) and the offset is added to the result. This provides a usable address space of 1 MB. However, a quirk in the addressing scheme allows access past the 1 MB limit if a segment address of 0xFFFF (the highest possible) is used; on the 8086 and 8088, all accesses to this area wrapped around to the low end of memory, but on the 80286 and later, up to 65520 bytes past the 1 MB mark can be addressed this way if the A20 address line is enabled. ''See: [[X86 Assembly/16 32 and 64 Bits#The_A20_Gate_Saga|The A20 Gate Saga]]''.

One benefit shared by Real Mode segmentation and by [[#Multi-Segmented Memory Model|Protected Mode Multi-Segment Memory Model]] is that all addresses must be given relative to another address (this is, the segment base address). A program can have its own address space and completely ignore the segment registers, and thus no pointers have to be relocated to run the program. Programs can perform ''near'' calls and jumps within the same segment, and data is always relative to segment base addresses (which in the Real Mode addressing scheme are computed from the values loaded in the Segment Registers).

This is what the DOS *.COM format does; the contents of the file are loaded into memory and blindly run. However, due to the fact that Real Mode segments are always 64&amp;nbsp;KB long, COM files could not be larger than that (in fact, they had to fit into 65280 bytes, since DOS used the first 256 of a segment for housekeeping data); for many years this wasn't a problem.

=== Protected Mode ===
==== Flat Memory Model ====
If programming in a modern operating system (such as Linux, Windows), you are basically programming in flat 32-bit mode. Any register can be used in addressing, and it is generally more efficient to use a full 32-bit register instead of a 16-bit register part. Additionally, segment registers are generally unused in flat mode, and it is generally a bad idea to touch them.

==== Multi-Segmented Memory Model ====

Using a 32-bit register to address memory, the program can access (almost) all of the memory in a modern computer. For earlier processors (with only 16-bit registers) the segmented memory model was used. The 'CS', 'DS', and 'ES' registers are used to point to the different ''chunks'' of memory. For a small program (small model) the CS=DS=ES. For larger memory models, these 'segments' can point to different locations.

== General Information ==

Examples in this article are created using the AT&amp;T assembly syntax used in GNU AS. The main advantage of using this syntax is its compatibility with the GCC inline assembly syntax. However, this is not the only syntax that is used to represent x86 operations. For example, NASM uses a different syntax to represent assembly mnemonics, operands and addressing modes, as do some [[Wikipedia:High_Level_Assembler|High-Level Assembler]]s. The AT&amp;T syntax is the standard on Unix-like systems but some assemblers use the Intel syntax, or can, like GAS itself, accept both.

GAS instructions generally have the form &lt;u&gt;mnemonic&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;source&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;destination&lt;/u&gt;. For instance, the following '''mov''' instruction:

 movb $0x05, %al

will move the hexadecimal value 5 into the register al.

== Operation Suffixes ==
GAS assembly instructions are generally suffixed with the letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;q&quot; or &quot;t&quot; to determine what size operand is being manipulated.

*b = byte (8 bit)
*s = short (16 bit integer) or single (32-bit floating point)
*w = word (16 bit)
*l = long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating point)
*q = quad (64 bit)
*t = ten bytes (80-bit floating point)

If the suffix is not specified, and there are no memory operands for the instruction, GAS infers the operand size from the size of the destination register operand (the final operand).

== Prefixes ==

When referencing a register, the register needs to be prefixed with a &quot;%&quot;. 
Constant numbers need to be prefixed with a &quot;$&quot;.

== Address operand syntax ==

There are up to 4 parameters of an address operand that are presented in the syntax &lt;code&gt;segment:displacement(base register, offset register, scalar multiplier)&lt;/code&gt;.  This is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;segment:[base register + displacement + offset register * scalar multiplier]&lt;/code&gt; in Intel syntax.  Either or both of the numeric, and either of the register parameters may be omitted:
 movl    -4(%ebp, %edx, 4), %eax  # Full example: load *(ebp - 4 + (edx * 4)) into eax
 movl    -4(%ebp), %eax           # Typical example: load a stack variable into eax
 movl    (%ecx), %edx             # No offset: copy the target of a pointer into a register
 leal    8(,%eax,4), %eax         # Arithmetic: multiply eax by 4 and add 8
 leal    (%eax,%eax,2), %eax      # Arithmetic: multiply eax by 2 and add eax (i.e. multiply by 3)

== Introduction ==

This section is written as a short introduction to GAS. GAS is part of the [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU Project], which gives it the following nice properties:

*It is available on many operating systems.
*It interfaces nicely with the other GNU programming tools, including the GNU C compiler (gcc) and GNU linker (ld).

If you are using a computer with the Linux operating system, chances are you already have GAS installed on your system.  If you are using a computer with the Windows operating system, you can install GAS and other useful programming utilities by installing [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] or [http://www.mingw.org/ Mingw].  The remainder of this introduction assumes you have installed GAS and know how to open a command-line interface and edit files.

=== Generating assembly ===

Since assembly language corresponds directly to the operations a CPU performs, a carefully written assembly routine may be able to run much faster than the same routine written in a higher-level language, such as C.  On the other hand, assembly routines typically take more effort to write than the equivalent routine in C.  Thus, a typical method for quickly writing a program that performs well is to first write the program in a high-level language (which is easier to write and debug), then rewrite selected routines in assembly language (which performs better).  A good first step to rewriting a C routine in assembly language is to use the C compiler to automatically generate the assembly language.  Not only does this give you an assembly file that compiles correctly, but it also ensures that the assembly routine does exactly what you intended it to.&lt;ref&gt;This assumes that the compiler has no bugs and, more importantly, ''that the code you wrote correctly implements your intent''. Note also that compilers can sometimes rearrange the sequence of low-level operations in order to optimize the code; this preserves the overall semantics of your code but means the assembly instruction flow may not match up exactly with your algorithm steps.&lt;/ref&gt;

We will now use the GNU C compiler to generate assembly code, for the purposes of examining the GAS assembly language syntax.

Here is the classic &quot;Hello, world&quot; program, written in C:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
     printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
     return 0;
 }

Save that in a file called &quot;hello.c&quot;, then type at the prompt:

 gcc -o hello_c.exe hello.c

This should compile the C file and create an executable file called &quot;hello_c.exe&quot;.  If you get an error, make sure that the contents of &quot;hello.c&quot; are correct.

Now you should be able to type at the prompt:

 ./hello_c.exe

and the program should print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.

Now that we know that &quot;hello.c&quot; is typed in correctly and does what we want, let's generate the equivalent 32-bit x86 assembly language. Type the following at the prompt:

 gcc -S -m32 hello.c

This should create a file called &quot;hello.s&quot; (&quot;.s&quot; is the file extension that the GNU system gives to assembly files). On more recent 64-bit systems, the 32-bit source tree may not be included, which will cause a &quot;bits/predefs.h fatal error&quot;; you may replace the &quot;-m32&quot; gcc directive with an &quot;-m64&quot; directive to generate 64-bit assembly instead. To compile the assembly file into an executable, type:

 gcc -o hello_asm.exe -m32 hello.s

(Note that gcc calls the assembler (as) and the linker (ld) for us.)  Now, if you type the following at the prompt:

 ./hello_asm.exe

this program should also print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.  Not surprisingly, it does the same thing as the compiled C file.

Let's take a look at what is inside &quot;hello.s&quot;:

         .file   &quot;hello.c&quot;
         .def    ___main;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
         .def    _main;  .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret
         .def    _printf;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef

The contents of &quot;hello.s&quot; may vary depending on the version of the GNU tools that are installed; this version was generated with Cygwin, using gcc version 3.3.1.

The lines beginning with periods, like &quot;.file&quot;, &quot;.def&quot;, or &quot;.ascii&quot; are assembler directives -- commands that tell the assembler how to assemble the file.  The lines beginning with some text followed by a colon, like &quot;_main:&quot;, are labels, or named locations in the code.  The other lines are assembly instructions.

The &quot;.file&quot; and &quot;.def&quot; directives are for debugging.  We can leave them out:

         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret

=== &quot;hello.s&quot; line-by-line ===

         .text

This line declares the start of a section of code.  You can name sections using this directive, which gives you fine-grained control over where in the executable the resulting machine code goes, which is useful in some cases, like for programming embedded systems.  Using &quot;.text&quot; by itself tells the assembler that the following code goes in the default section, which is sufficient for most purposes.

 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;

This code declares a label, then places some raw ASCII text into the program, starting at the label's location.  The &quot;\12&quot; specifies a line-feed character, while the &quot;\0&quot; specifies a null character at the end of the string; C routines mark the end of strings with null characters, and since we are going to call a C string routine, we need this character here. (NOTE! String in C is an array of datatype Char (Char[]) and does not exist in any other form, but because one would understand strings as a single entity from the majority of programming languages, it is clearer to express it this way).

 .globl _main

This line tells the assembler that the label &quot;_main&quot; is a global label, which allows other parts of the program to see it.  In this case, the linker needs to be able to see the &quot;_main&quot; label, since the startup code with which the program is linked calls &quot;_main&quot; as a subroutine.

 _main:

This line declares the &quot;_main&quot; label, marking the place that is called from the startup code.

         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp

These lines save the value of EBP on the stack, then move the value of ESP into EBP, then subtract 8 from ESP.  Note that pushl automatically decremented ESP by the appropriate length.  The &quot;l&quot; on the end of each opcode indicates that we want to use the version of the opcode that works with &quot;long&quot; (32-bit) operands; usually the assembler is able to work out the correct opcode version from the operands, but just to be safe, it's a good idea to include the &quot;l&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or other suffix.  The percent signs designate register names, and the dollar sign designates a literal value.  This sequence of instructions is typical at the start of a subroutine to save space on the stack for local variables; EBP is used as the base register to reference the local variables, and a value is subtracted from ESP to reserve space on the stack (since the Intel stack grows from higher memory locations to lower ones).  In this case, eight bytes have been reserved on the stack.  We shall see why this space is needed later.

         andl    $-16, %esp

This code &quot;and&quot;s ESP with 0xFFFFFFF0, aligning the stack with the next lowest 16-byte boundary.  An examination of Mingw's source code reveals that this may be for SIMD instructions appearing in the &quot;_main&quot; routine, which operate only on aligned addresses.  Since our routine doesn't contain SIMD instructions, this line is unnecessary.

         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax

This code moves zero into EAX, then moves EAX into the memory location EBP-4, which is in the temporary space we reserved on the stack at the beginning of the procedure.  Then it moves the memory location EBP-4 back into EAX; clearly, this is not optimized code.  Note that the parentheses indicate a memory location, while the number in front of the parentheses indicates an offset from that memory location.

         call    __alloca
         call    ___main

These functions are part of the C library setup.  Since we are calling functions in the C library, we probably need these.  The exact operations they perform vary depending on the platform and the version of the GNU tools that are installed.

         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf

This code (finally!) prints our message.  First, it moves the location of the ASCII string to the top of the stack.  It seems that the C compiler has optimized a sequence of &quot;popl %eax; pushl $LC0&quot; into a single move to the top of the stack.  Then, it calls the _printf subroutine in the C library to print the message to the console.

         movl    $0, %eax

This line stores zero, our return value, in EAX.  The C calling convention is to store return values in EAX when exiting a routine.

         leave

This line, typically found at the end of subroutines, frees the space saved on the stack by copying EBP into ESP, then popping the saved value of EBP back to EBP.

         ret

This line returns control to the calling procedure by popping the saved instruction pointer from the stack.

=== Communicating directly with the operating system ===

Note that we only have to call the C library setup routines if we need to call functions in the C library, like &quot;printf&quot;.  We could avoid calling these routines if we instead communicate directly with the operating system.  The disadvantage of communicating directly with the operating system is that we lose portability; our code will be locked to a specific operating system.  For instructional purposes, though, let's look at how one might do this under Windows.  Here is the C source code, compilable under Mingw or Cygwin:

 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
     LPSTR text = &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
     DWORD charsWritten;
     HANDLE hStdout;
 
     hStdout = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
     WriteFile(hStdout, text, 14, &amp;charsWritten, NULL);
     return 0;
 }

Ideally, you'd want check the return codes of &quot;GetStdHandle&quot; and &quot;WriteFile&quot; to make sure they are working correctly, but this is sufficient for our purposes.  Here is what the generated assembly looks like:

         .file   &quot;hello2.c&quot;
         .def    ___main;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
         .def    _main;  .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -16(%ebp)
         movl    -16(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, -4(%ebp)
         movl    $-11, (%esp)
         call    _GetStdHandle@4
         subl    $4, %esp
         movl    %eax, -12(%ebp)
         movl    $0, 16(%esp)
         leal    -8(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, 12(%esp)
         movl    $14, 8(%esp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, 4(%esp)
         movl    -12(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, (%esp)
         call    _WriteFile@20
         subl    $20, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret

Even though we never use the C standard library, the generated code initializes it for us.  Also, there is a lot of unnecessary stack manipulation.  We can simplify:

         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp
         pushl   $-11
         call    _GetStdHandle@4
         pushl   $0
         leal    -4(%ebp), %ebx
         pushl   %ebx
         pushl   $14
         pushl   $LC0
         pushl   %eax
         call    _WriteFile@20
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret
 
Analyzing line-by-line:

         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp

We save the old EBP and reserve four bytes on the stack, since the call to WriteFile needs somewhere to store the number of characters written, which is a 4-byte value.

         pushl   $-11
         call    _GetStdHandle@4

We push the constant value STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE (-11) to the stack and call GetStdHandle.  The returned handle value is in EAX.

         pushl   $0
         leal    -4(%ebp), %ebx
         pushl   %ebx
         pushl   $14
         pushl   $LC0
         pushl   %eax
         call    _WriteFile@20

We push the parameters to WriteFile and call it.  Note that the Windows calling convention is to push the parameters from right-to-left.  The load-effective-address (&quot;lea&quot;) instruction adds -4 to the value of EBP, giving the location we saved on the stack for the number of characters printed, which we store in EBX and then push onto the stack.  Also note that EAX still holds the return value from the GetStdHandle call, so we just push it directly.

         movl    $0, %eax
         leave

Here we set our program's return value and restore the values of EBP and ESP using the &quot;leave&quot; instruction.

=== Caveats ===

From [http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/i386_002dBugs.html#i386_002dBugs The GAS manual's AT&amp;T Syntax Bugs section]:

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&amp;T derived ix86 Unix assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source and destination registers in certain cases. Unfortunately, gcc and possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck with it.

For example

         fsub %st,%st(3)

results in &lt;code&gt;%st(3)&lt;code&gt; being updated to &lt;code&gt;%st - %st(3)&lt;/code&gt; rather than the expected &lt;code&gt;%st(3) - %st&lt;/code&gt;. This happens with all the non-commutative arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where the source register is &lt;code&gt;%st&lt;/code&gt; and the destination register is &lt;code&gt;%st(i)&lt;/code&gt;. 

Note that even objdump -d -M intel still uses reversed opcodes, so use a different disassembler to check this. See http://bugs.debian.org/372528 for more info.

== Conventions ==

The following template will be used for instructions that take no operands:
{{x86-inst}}

The following template will be used for instructions that take 1 operand:
{{x86-inst-1}}

The following template will be used for instructions that take 2 operands. Notice how the format of the instruction is different for different assemblers.
{{x86-inst-2}}

The following template will be used for instructions that take 3 operands. Notice how the format of the instruction is different for different assemblers.
{{x86-inst-3}}

=== Suffixes ===

Some instructions, especially when built for non-Windows platforms (i.e. Unix, Linux, etc.), require the use of suffixes to specify the size of the data which will be the subject of the operation.  Some possible suffixes are:
* b (byte) = 8 bits
* w (word) = 16 bits
* l (long) = 32 bits
* q (quad) = 64 bits

An example of the usage with the [[mov]] instruction on a 32-bit architecture, GAS syntax:
     movl $0x000F, %eax          # Store the value F into the eax register
On Intel Syntax you don't have to use the suffix. Based on the register name and the used immediate value the compiler knows which data size to use.
     MOV EAX, 0x000F

While integers are sufficient for some applications, it is often necessary to use the floating point coprocessor to manipulate numbers with fractional parts.

== x87 Coprocessor ==

The original x86 family members had a separate math coprocessor that handled floating point arithmetic. The original coprocessor was the 8087, and all FPUs since have been dubbed &quot;x87&quot; chips. Later variants integrated the floating point unit (FPU) into the microprocessor itself. Having the capability to manage floating point numbers means a few things:
#The microprocessor must have space to store floating point numbers
#The microprocessor must have instructions to manipulate floating point numbers
The FPU, even when it is integrated into an x86 chip, is still called the &quot;x87&quot; section. For instance, literature on the subject will frequently call the FPU Register Stack the &quot;x87 Stack&quot;, and the FPU operations will frequently be called the &quot;x87 instruction set&quot;.

== FPU Register Stack ==

The FPU has 8 registers, st0 to st7, formed into a stack. Numbers are pushed onto the stack from memory, and are popped off the stack back to memory. FPU instructions generally will pop the first two items off the stack, act on them, and push the answer back on to the top of the stack.

Floating point numbers may generally be either 32 bits long (C &quot;float&quot; type), or 64 bits long (C &quot;double&quot; type). However, in order to reduce round-off errors, the FPU stack registers are all 80 bits wide.

Most [[X86 Assembly/High-Level_Languages#C_Calling_Conventions|calling conventions]] return floating point values in the st0 register.

== Examples ==
The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) calculates the square root of 123.45.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

section .data
    val: dq 123.45  ;declare quad word (double precision)

section .bss
    res: resq 1     ;reserve 1 quad word for result

section .text
    _start:

    fld qword [val] ;load value into st0
    fsqrt           ;compute square root of st0 and store in st0
    fst qword [res] ;store st0 in result

    ;end program
&lt;/source&gt;

Essentially, programs that use the FPU load values onto the stack with &lt;code&gt;FLD&lt;/code&gt; and its variants, perform operations on these values, then store them into memory with one of the forms of &lt;code&gt;FST&lt;/code&gt;. Because the x87 stack can only be accessed by FPU instructions ‒ you cannot write &lt;code&gt;mov eax, st0&lt;/code&gt; ‒ it is necessary to store values to memory if you want to print them, for example.

A more complex example that evaluates the [[Trigonometry/Law_of_Cosines|Law of Cosines]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
;; c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - cos(C)*2*a*b
;; C is stored in ang

global _start

section .data
    a: dq 4.56   ;length of side a
    b: dq 7.89   ;length of side b
    ang: dq 1.5  ;opposite angle to side c (around 85.94 degrees)

section .bss
    c: resq 1    ;the result ‒ length of side c

section .text
    _start:

    fld qword [a]   ;load a into st0
    fmul st0, st0   ;st0 = a * a = a^2

    fld qword [b]   ;load b into st1
    fmul st1, st1   ;st1 = b * b = b^2

    fadd st0, st1   ;st0 = a^2 + b^2

    fld qword [ang] ;load angle into st0
    fcos            ;st0 = cos(ang)

    fmul qword [a]  ;st0 = cos(ang) * a
    fmul qword [b]  ;st0 = cos(ang) * a * b
    fadd st0, st0   ;st0 = cos(ang) * a * b + cos(ang) * a * b = 2(cos(ang) * a * b)

    fsubp st1, st0  ;st1 = st1 - st0 = (a^2 + b^2) - (2 * a * b * cos(ang))
                    ;and pop st0

    fsqrt           ;take square root of st0 = c

    fst qword [c]   ;store st0 in c ‒ and we're done!

    ;end program
&lt;/source&gt;

== Floating-Point Instruction Set ==

{{Wikipedia|MMX (instruction set)}}

MMX is a supplemental instruction set introduced by Intel in 1996. Most of the new instructions are &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD), meaning that single instructions work with multiple pieces of data in parallel. 

MMX has a few problems, though: instructions run slightly slower than the regular arithmetic instructions, the FPU can't be used when the MMX registers are in use, and MMX registers use saturation arithmetic.

== Saturation Arithmetic ==
In an 8-bit grayscale picture, 255 is the value for pure white, and 0 is the value for pure black. In a regular register (AX, BX, CX ...) if we add one to white, we get black! This is because the regular registers &quot;roll-over&quot; to the next value. MMX registers get around this by a technique called &quot;Saturation Arithmetic&quot;. In saturation arithmetic, the value of the register never rolls over to 0 again. This means that in the MMX world, we have the following equations:

 255 + 100 = 255
 200 + 100 = 255
 0 - 100 = 0;
 99 - 100 = 0;

This may seem counter-intuitive at first to people who are used to their registers rolling over, but it makes sense in some situations: if we try to make white brighter, it shouldn't become black.

== Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) Instructions ==

The MMX registers are 64 bits wide, but can be broken down as follows:

 2 32 bit values
 4 16 bit values
 8 8 bit values

The MMX registers cannot easily be used for 64 bit arithmetic. Let's say that we have 4 bytes loaded in an MMX register: 10, 25, 128, 255. We have them arranged as such:

 MM0: | 10 | 25 | 128 | 255 |

And we do the following pseudo code operation:

 MM0 + 10

We would get the following result:

 MM0: | 10+10 | 25+10 | 128+10 | 255+10 | = | 20 | 35 | 138 | 255 |

Remember that our arithmetic &quot;saturates&quot; in the last box, so the value doesn't go over 255.

Using MMX, we are essentially performing 4 additions in the time it takes to perform 1 addition using the regular registers, using 4 times fewer instructions. 

== MMX Registers ==

There are 8 64-bit MMX registers. To avoid having to add new registers, they were made to overlap with the FPU stack register. This means that '''the MMX instructions and the FPU instructions cannot be used simultaneously'''. MMX registers are addressed directly, and do not need to be accessed by pushing and popping in the same way as the FPU registers. 

 MM7 MM6 MM5 MM4 MM3 MM2 MM1 MM0

These registers correspond to to same numbered FPU registers on the FPU stack.

Usually when you initiate an assembly block in your code that contains 
MMX instructions, the CPU automatically will disallow floating point 
instructions. To re-allow FPU operations you must end all MMX code with 
&lt;code&gt;emms&lt;/code&gt;.

The following is a program for GNU AS and GCC which copies 8 bytes from one variable to another and prints the result.

Assembler portion
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
.globl copy_memory8
.type  copy_memory8, @function
copy_memory8:
    pushl %ebp
    mov  %esp, %ebp
    mov 8(%ebp), %eax
    movq (%eax), %mm0
    mov 12(%ebp), %eax
    movq %mm0, (%eax)
    popl %ebp
    emms
    ret
.size copy_memory8,.-copy_memory8
&lt;/source&gt;

C portion
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void copy_memory8(void * a, void * b);

int main () {
	long long b = 0x0fffffff00000000;
	long long c = 0x00000000ffffffff;
	printf(&quot;%lld == %lld\n&quot;, b, c);
	copy_memory8(&amp;b, &amp;c);
	printf(&quot;%lld == %lld\n&quot;, b, c);
	return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== MMX Instruction Set ==
Several suffixes are used to indicate what data size the instruction operates on:
*'''B'''yte (8 bits)
*'''W'''ord (16 bits)
*'''D'''ouble word (32 bits)
*'''Q'''uad word (64 bits)

The signedness of the operation is also signified by the suffix: '''US''' for unsigned and '''S''' for signed.

For example, PSUB''USB'' subtracts unsigned bytes, while PSUB''SD'' subtracts signed double words.

{{Wikipedia|Streaming SIMD Extensions}}

SSE stands for '''Streaming SIMD Extensions'''. It is essentially the floating-point equivalent of the MMX instructions. The SSE registers are 128 bits, and can be used to perform operations on a variety of data sizes and types. Unlike MMX, the SSE registers do not overlap with the floating point stack.

== Registers ==

SSE, introduced by Intel in 1999 with the Pentium III, creates eight new 128-bit registers:

 XMM0 XMM1 XMM2 XMM3 XMM4 XMM5 XMM6 XMM7

Originally, an SSE register could only be used as four 32-bit single precision floating point numbers (the equivalent of a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; in C). SSE2 expanded the capabilities of the XMM registers, so they can now be used as:

 2 64-bit floating points (double precision)
 2 64-bit integers
 
 4 32-bit floating points (single-precision)
 4 32-bit integers
 
 8 16-bit integers
 
 16 8-bit characters (bytes)

==Data movement examples==
The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) performs data movements using SIMD instructions.

    addps xmm0, xmm1    ;add the 4 numbers in xmm1 (from v2) to the 4 numbers in xmm0 (from v1), store in xmm0. for the first float the result will be 5.5+1.1=6.6
    mulps xmm0, xmm1    ;multiply the four numbers in xmm1 (from v2, unchanged) with the results from the previous calculation (in xmm0), store in xmm0. for the first float the result will be 5.5*6.6=36.3
    subps xmm0, xmm1    ;subtract the four numbers in v2 (in xmm1, still unchanged) from result from previous calculation (in xmm1). for the first float, the result will be 36.3-5.5=30.8

===Debugger commands explained===
;break: In this case, sets a breakpoint at a given label
;stepi: Steps one instruction forward in the program
;p: short for '''p'''rint, prints a given register or variable. Registers are prefixed by $ in GDB.
;x: short for e'''x'''amine, examines a given memory address. The &quot;/4f&quot; means &quot;4 floats&quot; (floats in GDB are 32-bits). You can use c for chars, x for hexadecimal and any other number instead of 4 of course. The &quot;&amp;&quot; takes the address of v1, as in C.

==Shuffling example using &lt;tt&gt;shufps&lt;/tt&gt;==
{{x86-inst-3x|att={{{1|shufps}}}|intel={{{1|shufps}}}|src={{{2|arg1}}}|dest={{{3|arg2}}}|aux={{{4|IMM8}}}}}

&lt;code&gt;shufps&lt;/code&gt; can be used to shuffle packed single-precision floats. The instruction takes three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. &lt;code&gt;shufps&lt;/code&gt; will take two elements each from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, copying the elements to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. The lower two elements will come from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the higher two elements from &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;.

===IMM8 control byte description===

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the output into &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the least significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || Copy to the least significant element 
|-
| 01b || Copy to the second element
|-
| 10b || Copy to the third element
|-
| 11b || Copy to the most significant element
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

| 11b || Copy to the most significant element
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the third element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7:6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the most significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;/table&gt;

The 2-bit values shown above are used to determine which elements are copied to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. Bits 7-4 are &quot;indexes&quot; into &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, and bits 3-0 are &quot;indexes&quot; into the &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;.
*Since bits 7-6 are 0, the least significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the most significant elements of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 127-96.
*Since bits 5-4 are 1, the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is copied to third element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 95-64.
*Since bits 3-2 are 2, the third element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 63-32.
*Since bits 0-1 are 3, the fourth element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the least significant elements of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits (31-0).

Note that since the first and second arguments are equal in the following example, the mask 0x1B will effectively reverse the order of the floats in the XMM register, since the 2-bit integers are 0, 1, 2, 3. Had it been 3, 2, 1, 0 (0xE4) it would be a no-op. Had it been 0, 0, 0, 0 (0x00) it would be a broadcast of the least significant 32 bits.

==Text Processing Instructions==

SSE 4.2 adds four string text processing instructions &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt;. These instructions take three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. These instructions will perform arithmetic comparison between the packed contents of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the input/output as well as the operation of two intermediate stages of processing. The results of stage 1 and stage 2 of intermediate processing will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; respectively. These instructions also provide additional information about the result through overload use of the arithmetic flags(&lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;). 

The instructions proceed in multiple steps:
#&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; are compared
#An aggregation operation is applied to the result of the comparison with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;
#An optional negation is performed with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;
#An output in the form of an index(in &lt;code&gt;ECX&lt;/code&gt;) or a mask(in &lt;code&gt;XMM0&lt;/code&gt;) is produced

===IMM8 control byte description===

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the following settings:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the 128-bit source data(&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || unsigned bytes(16 packed unsigned bytes)
|-
| 01b || unsigned words(8  packed unsigned words)
|-
| 10b || signed bytes(16 packed signed bytes)
|-
| 11b || signed words(8  packed signed words)
|}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the aggregation operation whose result will be placed in intermediate result 1, which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;. The size of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; will depend on the format of the source data, 16-bit for packed bytes and 8-bit for packed words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!IMM8[3:2]
!Description
|-
| 00b ||  &lt;b&gt;Equal Any&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a character set, arg2 is the string to search in. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg2[i] is in the set represented by arg1:
               arg1    = &quot;aeiou&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Example string 1&quot;
               IntRes1 =  1010001000010000
|-
| 01b ||&lt;b&gt;Ranges&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a set of character ranges i.e. &quot;09az&quot; means all characters from 0 to 9 and from a to z., arg2 is the string to search over. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg[i] is in any of the ranges represented by arg1:

               arg1    = &quot;09az&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Testing 1 2 3, T&quot;
               IntRes1 =  0111111010101000
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Each&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is string one and arg2 is string two. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg1[i] == arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;The quick brown &quot;
               arg2    = &quot;The quack green &quot;
               IntRes1 =  1111110111010011
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Ordered&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a substring string to search for, arg2 is the string to search within. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if the substring arg1 can be found at position arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;he&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;, he helped her &quot;
               IntRes1 =  0010010000001000
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the polarity or the processing of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;, into intermediate result 2, which will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[5:4]
!Description
|-
| 00b || &lt;b&gt;Positive Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 01b || &lt;b&gt;Negative Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = -1 XOR IntRes1
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Positive&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Negative&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1 if reg/mem[i] is invalid else ~IntRes1 
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the output selection, or how &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; will be processed into the output. For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, the output is an index into the data currently referenced by &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, the output is a mask reflecting all the set bits in &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Bit Mask, the least significant bits of XMM0 contain the IntRes2 16(8) bit mask. XMM0 is zero extended to 128-bits.
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Byte/Word Mask, XMM0 contains IntRes2 expanded into byte/word mask
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7]&lt;/code&gt; should be set to zero since it has no designed meaning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

==SSE Instruction Set==

There are literally hundreds of SSE instructions, some of which are capable of much more than simple SIMD arithmetic. For more in-depth references take a look at the [[X86 Assembly/Resources|resources]] chapter of this book.

You may notice that many floating point SSE instructions end with something like PS or SD. These suffixes differentiate between different versions of the operation. The first letter describes whether the instruction should be '''P'''acked or '''S'''calar. Packed operations are applied to every member of the register, while scalar operations are applied to only the first value. For example, in pseudo-code, a packed add would be executed as:
 v1[0] = v1[0] + v2[0]
 v1[1] = v1[1] + v2[1]
 v1[2] = v1[2] + v2[2]
 v1[3] = v1[3] + v2[3]
While a scalar add would only be:
 v1[0] = v1[0] + v2[0]
The second letter refers to the data size: either '''S'''ingle or '''D'''ouble. This simply tells the processor whether to use the register as four 32-bit floats or two 64-bit doubles, respectively.

Very few projects are written entirely in assembly. It's often used for accessing processor-specific features, optimizing critical sections of code, and very low-level work, but for many applications, it can be simpler and easier to implement the basic control flow and data manipulation routines in a higher level language, like C. For this reason, it is often necessary to interface between assembly language and other languages.

== Compilers ==
The first compilers were simply text translators that converted a high-level language into assembly language. The assembly language code was then fed into an assembler, to create the final machine code output. The GCC compiler still performs this sequence (code is compiled into assembly, and fed to the AS assembler). However, many modern compilers will skip the assembly language and create the machine code directly. 

Assembly language code has the benefit that it is in one-to-one correspondence with the underlying machine code. Each machine instruction is mapped directly to a single Assembly instruction. Because of this, even when a compiler directly creates the machine code, it is still possible to interface that code with an assembly language program. The important part is knowing exactly how the language implements its data structures, control structures, and functions. The method in which function calls are implemented by a high-level language compiler is called a '''calling convention'''.

The calling convention is a contract between the function and caller of the function and specifies several parameters:

# How the arguments are passed to the function, and in what order? Are they pushed onto the stack, or are they passed in via the registers?
# How are return values passed back to the caller? This is usually via registers or on the stack.
# What processor states are volatile (available for modification)? Volatile registers are available for modification by the function. The caller is responsible for saving the state of those registers if needed. '''Non-volatile''' registers are guaranteed to be preserved by the function. The called function is responsible for saving the state of those registers and restoring those registers on exit.
# The function '''prologue''' and '''epilogue''', which sets up the registers and stack for use within the function and then restores the stack and registers before exiting.

== C Calling Conventions == 
{{Wikipedia|x86 calling conventions}}

=== CDECL ===
For C compilers, the CDECL calling convention is the de facto standard. It varies by compiler, but the programmer can specify that a function be implemented using CDECL usually by pre-appending the function declaration with a keyword, for example '''__cdecl''' in Visual studio:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __cdecl func()
&lt;/source&gt;

in gcc it would be '''__attribute__( (__cdecl__ ))''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __attribute__((__cdecl__ )) func()
&lt;/source&gt;

CDECL calling convention specifies a number of different requirements:

#Function arguments are passed on the stack, in '''right-to-left''' order. 
#Function result is stored in EAX/AX/AL
#Floating point return values will be returned in ST0
#The function name is pre-appended with an underscore.
#The arguments are popped from the stack by the caller itself.
#8-bit and 16-bit integer arguments are promoted to 32-bit arguments.
#The volatile registers are: EAX, ECX, EDX, ST0 - ST7, ES and GS
#The non-volatile registers are: EBX, EBP, ESP, EDI, ESI, CS and DS
#The function will exit with a RET instruction.
#The function is supposed to return values types of class or structure via a reference in EAX/AX. The space is supposed to be allocated by the function, which unable to use the stack or heap is left with fixed address in static non-constant storage. This is inherently not thread safe. Many compilers will break the calling convention:
##GCC has the calling code allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.
##Visual C++ will:
###Pass POD return values 32 bits or smaller in the EAX register.
###Pass POD return values 33-64 bits in size via the EAX:EDX registers
###For non-POD return values or values larger than 64-bits, the calling code will allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.


CDECL functions are capable of accepting variable argument lists. Below is example using cdecl calling convention:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main 

extern printf

section .data
	align 4
	a:	dd 1
	b:	dd 2
	c:	dd 3
	fmtStr:	db &quot;Result: %d&quot;, 0x0A, 0

section .bss
	align 4

section .text
				
;
; int func( int a, int b, int c )
; {
;	return a + b + c ;
; }
;
func:
	push	ebp		; Save ebp on the stack 
	mov	ebp, esp	; Replace ebp with esp since we will be using
				; ebp as the base ponter for the functions
				; stack.
				;
				; The arguments start at ebp+8 since calling the
				; the function places eip on the stack and the
				; function places ebp on the stack as part of
				; the preamble.
				;
	mov	eax, [ebp+8]	; mov a int eax
	mov	edx, [ebp+12]	; add b to eax
	lea	eax, [eax+edx]	; Using lea for arithmetic adding a + b into eax
	add	eax, [ebp+16]	; add c to eax
	pop	ebp		; restore ebp
	ret			; Returning, eax contains result

	;
	; Using main since we are using gcc to link
	;
	main:

	;
	; Set up for call to func(int a, int b, int c)
	;
	; Push variables in right to left order 
	;
	push	dword [c]
	push	dword [b]
	push	dword [a]
	call	func
	add	esp, 12		; Pop stack 3 times 4 bytes
	push	eax
	push	dword fmtStr
	call	printf
	add	esp, 8		; Pop stack 2 times 4 bytes

	;
	; Alternative to using push for function call setup, this is the method
	; used by gcc
	;
	sub	esp, 12		; Create space on stack for three 4 byte variables
	mov	ecx, [b]
	mov	eax, [a]
	mov	[esp+8], dword 4 
	mov	[esp+4], ecx
	mov	[esp],	 eax
	call	func
	;push	eax
	;push	dword fmtStr
	mov	[esp+4], eax
	lea	eax, [fmtStr]
	mov	[esp], eax 
	call	printf

				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
nasm -felf32 -g cdecl.asm 
gcc -o cdecl cdecl.o
./cdecl
&lt;/source&gt;

=== STDCALL ===
STDCALL is the calling convention that is used when interfacing with the Win32 API on Microsoft Windows systems. STDCALL was created by Microsoft, and therefore isn't always supported by non-Microsoft compilers. It varies by compiler but, the programmer can specify that a function be implemented using STDCALL usually by pre-appending the function declaration with a keyword, for example '''__stdcall''' in Visual studio:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __stdcall func()
&lt;/source&gt;

in gcc it would be '''__attribute__( (__stdcall__ ))''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __attribute__((__stdcall__ )) func()
&lt;/source&gt;

STDCALL has the following requirements:

#Function arguments are passed on the stack in '''right-to-left''' order.
#Function result is stored in EAX/AX/AL
#Floating point return values will be returned in ST0
#64-bits integers and 32/16 bit pointers will be returned via the EAX:EDX registers.
#8-bit and 16-bit integer arguments are promoted to 32-bit arguments.
#Function name is prefixed with an underscore
#Function name is suffixed with an &quot;@&quot; sign, followed by the number of bytes of arguments being passed to it.
#The arguments are popped from the stack by the callee (the called function).
#The volatile registers are: EAX, ECX, EDX, and ST0 - ST7
#The non-volatile registers are: EBX, EBP, ESP, EDI, ESI, CS, DS, ES, FS and GS
#The function will exit with a RET n instruction, the called function will pop n additional bytes off the stack when it returns.
#POD return values 32 bits or smaller will be returned in the EAX register.
#POD return values 33-64 bits in size will be returned via the EAX:EDX registers.
#Non-POD return values or values larger than 64-bits, the calling code will allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.

STDCALL functions are not capable of accepting variable argument lists.

For example, the following function declaration in C:

 _stdcall void MyFunction(int, int, short);

would be accessed in assembly using the following function label:

 _MyFunction@12

Remember, on a 32 bit machine, passing a 16 bit argument on the stack (C &quot;short&quot;) takes up a full 32 bits of space.

=== FASTCALL ===
FASTCALL functions can frequently be specified with the '''__fastcall''' keyword in many compilers. FASTCALL functions pass the first two arguments to the function in registers, so that the time-consuming stack operations can be avoided. FASTCALL has the following requirements:

#The first 32-bit (or smaller) argument is passed in ECX/CX/CL (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6xa169sk.aspx])
#The second 32-bit (or smaller) argument is passed in EDX/DX/DL
#The remaining function arguments (if any) are passed on the stack in right-to-left order
#The function result is returned in EAX/AX/AL
#The function name is prefixed with an &quot;@&quot; symbol
#The function name is suffixed with an &quot;@&quot; symbol, followed by the size of passed arguments, in bytes.

== C++ Calling Conventions (THISCALL) ==
The C++ THISCALL calling convention is the standard calling convention for C++. In THISCALL, the function is called almost identically to the CDECL convention, but the '''this''' pointer (the pointer to the current class) must be passed.

The way that the '''this''' pointer is passed is compiler-dependent.  Microsoft Visual C++ passes it in ECX.  GCC passes it as if it were the first parameter of the function.  (i.e. between the return address and the first formal parameter.)

== Ada Calling Conventions ==

== Pascal Calling Conventions ==

The Pascal convention is essentially identical to cdecl, differing only in that:

# The parameters are pushed left to right (logical western-world reading order)
# The routine being called must clean the stack before returning

Additionally, each parameter on the 32-bit stack must use all four bytes of the DWORD, regardless of the actual size of the datum.

This is the main calling method used by Windows API routines, as it is slightly more efficient with regard to memory usage, stack access and calling speed.


Note: the Pascal convention is NOT the same as the Borland Pascal convention, which is a form of fastcall, using registers (eax, edx, ecx) to pass the first three parameters, and also known as Register Convention.

== Fortran Calling Conventions ==

== Inline Assembly ==

=== C/C++ ===

This Borland C++ example splits &lt;code&gt;byte_data&lt;/code&gt; into two bytes in &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;, the first containing high 4 bits and low 4 bits in the second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void ByteToHalfByte(BYTE *buf, int pos, BYTE byte_data)
{
    asm
    {
        mov al, byte_data
        mov ah, al
        shr al, 04h
        and ah, 0Fh
        mov ecx, buf
        mov edx, pos
        mov [ecx+edx], al
        mov [ecx+edx+1], ah
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This page will explain x86 Programming using MASM syntax, and will also discuss how to use the macro capabilities of MASM. Other assemblers, such as [[X86 Assembly/NASM Syntax|NASM]] and [[X86 Assembly/FASM Syntax|FASM]], use syntax different from MASM, similar only in that they all use Intel syntax.

== Instruction Order ==

MASM instructions typically have operands reversed from GAS instructions. for instance, instructions are typically written as '''Instruction Destination, Source'''. 

The '''mov''' instruction, written as follows:

 mov al, 05h

will move the value 5 into the al register.

== Instruction Suffixes ==

MASM does not use instruction suffixes to differentiate between sizes (byte, word, dword, etc).

== Macros ==

MASM is known as either the &quot;Macro Assembler&quot;, or the &quot;Microsoft Assembler&quot;, depending on who you talk to. But no matter where your answers are coming from, the fact is that MASM has a powerful macro engine, and a number of built-in macros available immediately. 

== MASM directives ==

MASM has a large number of directives that can control certain settings and behaviors. It has more of them compared to NASM or FASM, for example.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

== HLA Syntax ==

HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, usually). 

In MASM, for instance, we could write the following code:

 mov EAX, 0x05

In HLA, this code would become:

 mov(0x05, EAX);

HLA uses the same order-of-operations as GAS syntax, but doesn't require any of the name decoration of GAS. Also, HLA uses the parenthesis notation to call an instruction. HLA terminates its lines with a semicolon, similar to C or Pascal.

== High-Level Constructs ==

Some people criticize HLA because it &quot;isn't low-level enough&quot;. This is false, because HLA can be as low-level as MASM or GAS, but it also offers the options to use some higher-level abstractions. For instance, HLA can use the following syntax to pass eax as an argument to the Function1 function:

 push(eax);
 call(Function1);

But HLA also allows the programmer to simplify the process, if they want:

 Function1(eax);

This is called the &quot;parenthesis notation&quot; for calling functions.

HLA also contains a number of different loops (do-while, for, until, etc..) and control structures (if-then-else, switch-case) that the programmer can use. However, these high-level constructs come with a caveat: Using them may be simple, but they translate into MASM code instructions. It is usually faster to implement the loops by hand.</text>

== [[X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax|GNU Assembler (GAS)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|GNU Assembler}}
The GNU assembler is most common as the assembly back-end to the GCC compiler. One of the most compelling reasons to learn to program GAS (as it is frequently abbreviated) is to write inline assembly instructions (assembly code embedded in C source code) when compiled by the [[w:GNU_Compiler_Collection|gcc]] need to be in GAS syntax. GAS uses the AT&amp;T syntax for writing the assembly language, which some people claim is more complicated, but other people say it is more informative.

== [[X86_Assembly/MASM_Syntax|Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|Microsoft Macro Assembler}}
Microsoft's Macro Assembler, MASM, has been in constant production for many many years. Many people claim that MASM isn't being supported or improved anymore, but Microsoft denies this: MASM is maintained, but is currently in a bug-fixing mode. No new features are currently being added. However, Microsoft is shipping a 64-bit version of MASM with new 64-bit compiler suites. MASM is available from Microsoft as part of Visual C++,  as a download from MSDN, or as part of the Microsoft DDK. The latest available version of MASM is version 11.x (ref.: www.masm32.com).

MASM uses the Intel syntax for its instructions, which stands in stark contrast to the AT&amp;T syntax used by the GAS assembler. Most notably, MASM instructions take their operands in reverse order from GAS. This one fact is perhaps the biggest stumbling block for people trying to transition between the two assemblers.

MASM also has a very powerful macro engine, which many programmers use to implement a high-level feel in MASM programs.

== [[JWASM|JWASM]] ==
{{Wikipedia|JWASM}}

JWASM is a 16, 32 and 64-bit assembler for 80x86 platforms, based upon Open Watcom's WASM, and was created by Japheth.

While syntactically compatible with MASM, it is faster, and its sourcecode is freely available under the Sybase Open Watcom Public License, and thus it is free for both commerical and non-commercial use.
Furthermore, it supports ELF, and is thus the only cross-platform assembler supporting the popular MASM syntax. JWASM is actively being developed, and is generally regarded as the unofficial successor to MASM.

== [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|Netwide Assembler (NASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|Netwide Assembler}}
The Netwide Assembler, NASM, was started as an open-source initiative to create a free, retargetable assembler for 80x86 platforms. When the NASM project was started, MASM was still being sold by microsoft (MASM is currently free), and GAS contained very little error checking capability. GAS was, after all, the backend to GCC, and GCC always feeds GAS syntax-correct code. For this reason, GAS didn't need to interface with the user much, and therefore writing code for GAS was very tough.

NASM uses a syntax which is &quot;similar to Intel's but less complex&quot;.

The NASM users manual is found at http://www.nasm.us/doc/ .

Features:
* Cross platform: Like Gas, this assembler runs on nearly every platform, supposedly even on PowerPC Macs (though the code generated will only run on an x86 platform)
* Open Source
* Macro language (code that writes code)

== [[X86_Assembly/FASM_Syntax|Flat Assembler (FASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|FASM}}
Although it was written in assembly, it runs on several operating systems, including DOS, DexOS, Linux, Windows, and BSD. Its syntax is similar to TASM's &quot;ideal mode&quot; and NASM's but the macros in this assembler are done differently.

Features:
* Written in itself; and therefore its source code is an example of how to write in this assembler
* Open source
* Clean NASM-like syntax
* Very very fast
* Has macro language (code that writes code)
* Built-in IDE for DOS and Windows
* Creates binary, MZ, PE, ELF, COFF - no linker needed

== YASM Assembler ==

{{Wikipedia|Yasm}}

YASM is a ground-up rewrite of NASM under the new BSD licence. YASM is designed to understand multiple syntaxes natively (NASM and GAS, currently). The primary focus of YASM is to produce &quot;libyasm&quot;, a reusable library that can work with code at a low level, and can be easily integrated into other software projects.

== HLA ==

{{Wikipedia|High Level Assembly}}

HLA is an assembler front-end created by Randall Hyde and first popularized in his book &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot;.

HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, usually). Another assembler (MASM or GAS) will then assemble the instructions into machine code.


== BBC BASIC for WINDOWS (propriatery) ==

The proprietary BBC BASIC for Windows supports the development of  32 bit x86  assembler targeting user mode for Windows using INTEL syntax, but does not currently permit the generation of standalone EXE's (without the inclusion of a proprietary runtime and environment).  Macro assembly is possible by use the BBC BASIC environment, defining macros by means of BASIC functions wrapped around the relevant code. 

More information is in the  [http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcwin/manual/bbcwina.html Assembler section of the manual]

{{Wikipedia|x86}}
The term &quot;x86&quot; can refer both to an instruction set architecture and to microprocessors which implement it. The name x86 is derived from the fact that many of Intel's early processors had names ending in &quot;86&quot;.

The x86 instruction set architecture originated at Intel and has evolved over time by the addition of new instructions as well as the expansion to 64-bits. As of 2009, x86 primarily refers to [[w:IA-32|IA-32]] (Intel Architecture, 32-bit) and/or [[w:X86-64|x86-64]], the extension to 64-bit computing.

Versions of the x86 instruction set architecture have been implemented by Intel, AMD and several other vendors, with each vendor having its own family of x86 processors.

== Intel x86 Microprocessors ==
{{Wikipedia|List of Intel microprocessors}}
;8086/8087 (1978): The 8086 was the original x86 microprocessor, with the 8087 as its floating-point coprocessor. The 8086 was Intel's first 16-bit microprocessor with a 20-bit address bus, thus enabling to address up to 1 Megabytes, although there was a limit of 640 Kilobytes of RAM. This limitation is still present in modern CPUs, since they all support the backward-compatible &quot;Real Mode&quot; and boot into it.
;8088 (1979): After the development of the 8086, Intel also created the lower-cost 8088. The 8088 was similar to the 8086, but with an 8-bit data bus instead of a 16-bit bus. The address bus was left untouched.
;80186/80187  (1982): The 186 was the second Intel chip in the family; the 80187 was its floating point coprocessor. Except for the addition of some new instructions, optimization of some old ones, and an increase in the clock speed, this processor was identical to the 8086.
;80286/80287 (1982): The 286 was the third model in the family; the 80287 was its floating point coprocessor. The 286 introduced the “Protected Mode” mode of operation, as opposed to the “Real Mode” that the earlier models used. All subsequent x86 chips can also be made to run in real mode or in protected mode. Switching back from protected mode to real mode was initially not supported, but found to be possible (although relatively slow) by resetting the CPU, then continuing in real mode. Although the processor featured an address bus with 24 lines (24 bits, thus enabling to address up to 16 Mebibytes), these could only be used in protected mode. In real mode, the processor was still limited to the 20-bits address bus.
;80386 (1985): The 386 was the fourth model in the family. It was the first Intel microprocessor with a 32-bit word. The 386DX model was the original 386 chip, and the 386SX model was an economy model that used the same instruction set, but which only had a 16-bit data bus. Both featured a 32-bits address bus, thus getting rid of the segmented addressing methods used in the previous models and enabling a &quot;flat&quot; memory model, where one register can hold an entire address, instead of relying on two 16-bit registers to create a 20-bit/24-bit address. The flat memory layout was only supported in protected mode. Also, contrary to the 286, it featured an &quot;unreal mode&quot; in which protected-mode software could switch to perform real-mode operations (although this backward compatibility was not complete, as the physical memory was still protected). The 386EX model is still used today in [[Embedded Systems|embedded systems]],
;80486 (1989): The 486 was the fifth model in the family. It had an integrated floating point unit for the first time in x86 history.  Early model 80486 DX chips were found to have defective FPUs. They were physically modified to disconnect the FPU portion of the chip and sold as the 486SX (486-SX15, 486-SX20, and 486-SX25).  A 487 &quot;math coprocessor&quot; was available to 486SX users and was essentially a 486DX with a working FPU and an extra pin added.  The arrival of the 486DX-50 processor saw the widespread introduction of fanless heat-sinks being used to keep the processors from overheating.
;Pentium (1993): Intel called it the “Pentium” because they couldn't trademark the code number “80586”. The original Pentium was a faster chip than the 486 with a few other enhancements; later models also integrated the MMX instruction set.
;Pentium Pro (1995): The Pentium Pro was the sixth-generation architecture microprocessor, originally intended to replace the original Pentium in a full range of applications, but later reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop chip.
;Pentium II (1997): The Pentium II was based on a modified version of the P6 core first used for the Pentium Pro, but with improved 16-bit performance and the addition of the MMX SIMD instruction set, which had already been introduced on the Pentium MMX.
;Pentium III (1999): Initial versions of the Pentium III were very similar to the earlier Pentium II, the most notable difference being the addition of SSE instructions.
;Pentium 4 (2000): The Pentium 4 had a new 7th generation &quot;NetBurst&quot; architecture.  It is currently the fastest x86 chip on the market with respect to clock speed, capable of up to 3.8&amp;nbsp;GHz. Pentium 4 chips also introduced the notions “Hyper-Threading”, and “Multi-Core” chips.
&lt;!-- ;Pentium M (2003): Due to the greater power consumption and heat emission of the 7th generation NetBurst architecture, it was unsuitable for mobiles.  The Pentium M was the solution for mobiles; it was created by taking the 6th generation Pentium III and adding some enhancements such as SSE2 instruction support. --&gt;;Core (2006): The architecture of the Core processors was actually an even more advanced version of the 6th generation architecture dating back to the 1995 Pentium Pro. The limitations of the NetBurst architecture, especially in mobile applications, were too great to justify creation of more NetBurst processors.  The Core processors were designed to operate more efficiently with a lower clock speed. All Core branded processors had two processing cores; the Core Solos had one core disabled, while the Core Duos used both processors.
;Core 2 (2006): An upgraded, 64-bit version of the Core architecture. All desktop versions are multi-core.
;i Series (2008): The successor to Core 2 processors featuring Hyper-Threading.
;Celeron (first model 1998): The Celeron chip is actually a large number of different chip designs, depending on price. Celeron chips are the economy line of chips, and are frequently cheaper than the Pentium chips—even if the Celeron model in question is based off a Pentium architecture.
;Xeon (first model 1998): The Xeon processors are modern Intel processors made for servers, which have a much larger cache (measured in megabytes in comparison to other chips' kilobyte-sized cache) than the Pentium microprocessors.

== AMD x86 Compatible Microprocessors ==
{{Wikipedia|List of AMD microprocessors}}
;Athlon : Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of different x86 processors designed and manufactured by AMD. The original Athlon, or Athlon Classic, was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and, in a first, retained the initial performance lead it had over Intel's competing processors for a significant period of time.
;Turion : Turion 64 is the brand name AMD applies to its 64-bit low-power (mobile) processors. Turion 64 processors (but not Turion 64 X2 processors) are compatible with AMD's Socket 754 and are equipped with 512 or 1024 KiB of L2 cache, a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller, and an 800&amp;nbsp;MHz HyperTransport bus.
;Duron : The AMD Duron was an x86-compatible computer processor manufactured by AMD. It was released as a low-cost alternative to AMD's own Athlon processor and the Pentium III and Celeron processor lines from rival Intel.
;Sempron : Sempron is, as of 2006, AMD's entry-level desktop CPU, replacing the Duron processor and competing against Intel's Celeron D processor.
;Opteron : The AMD Opteron is the first eighth-generation x86 processor (K8 core), and the first of AMD's AMD64 (x86-64) processors. It is intended to compete in the server market, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">added some stuff. Tried to not anthropomorphize the subject, and did not precisely succeed. Maybe I could try and make a simple visual chart showing co-evolution in hummingbirds and the flowers, with say three steps to show how the flowers evolved to be longer to better rub pollen on the bird, and the birds' beak evolved longer to better suck out more nectar- I could discuss how perhaps many different taxa of birds fed on the flower, but when the long flower became prevalent, only the birds that would evolve longer beaks to suck all of the nectar would still find it worth their while to go after those flowers.
I can see myself going a little lamarkian if I'm not careful. Or even if I am.
:I like the start. Develop it how you think best.  I will likely do some editing, and may even move it to a different part of the textbook (for example, Chapter 5) if it seems to require that.  But for now, keep going with your ideas - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:31, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

Some of the most important and most frequently used instructions are those that move data. Without them, there would be no way for registers or memory to even have anything in them to operate on.

= Data transfer instructions =

== Move ==

{{x86-inst-2|mov}}

Move

The &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand.

''' Operands '''

''src''
* Immediate
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register
* Memory

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .data
 
 value:
         .long   2
 
 .text
         .global _start
 
 _start:
         movl    $6, %eax
         # %eax is now 6
 
         movw    %ax, value
         # value is now 6
 
         movl    $0, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 0
 
         movb    %al, %bl
         # %ebx is now 6
 
         movl    value, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 6
 
         movl    $value, %esi
         # %esi is now the address of value
 
         xorl    %ebx, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 0
 
         movw    value(, %ebx, 1), %bx
         # %ebx is now 6
 
 # Linux sys_exit
         mov     $1, %eax
         xorl    %ebx, %ebx
         int     $0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

== Data swap ==

{{x86-inst-2|xchg}}

Exchange.

The &lt;code&gt;xchg&lt;/code&gt; instruction swaps the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand with the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand. It's like doing three move operations: from ''dest'' to a temporary (another register), then from ''src'' to ''dest'', then from the temporary to ''src'', except that no register needs to be reserved for temporary storage.

If one of the operands is a memory address, then the operation has an implicit &lt;code&gt;LOCK&lt;/code&gt; prefix, that is,  the exchange operation is atomic.  This can have a large performance penalty.

It's also worth noting that the common &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt; (no op) instruction, &lt;code&gt;0x90&lt;/code&gt;, is the opcode for &lt;code&gt;xchgl %eax, %eax&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Operands'''

''src''
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register
* Memory

However, only one operand can be in memory: the other must be a register.

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .data
 
 value:
        .long   2
 
 .text
        .global _start
 
 _start:
        movl    $54, %ebx
        xorl    %eax, %eax
 
        xchgl   value, %ebx
        # %ebx is now 2
        # value is now 54
 
        xchgw   %ax, value
        # Value is now 0
        # %eax is now 54

{{x86-inst-2-generic|cmpxchg}}

Compare and exchange.

The &lt;code&gt;cmpxchg&lt;/code&gt; instruction has two implicit operands &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt;(depending on the size of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;(zero) flag. The instruction compares &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt; and if they are equal sets &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; and sets the zero flag, otherwise it sets &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and clears the zero flag. Unlike &lt;code&gt;xchg&lt;/code&gt; there is not an implicit &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; prefix and if the instruction is required to be atomic then &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; must be prefixed.

The following example shows how to use the cmpxchg instruction to create a spin lock which will be used to protect the &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; variable. The last thread to grab the spin lock will get to set the final value of &lt;code&gt;result&lt;code&gt;:

== Move with zero extend ==

{{x86-inst-2x|att=movz|intel=movzx}}

Move zero extend

The &lt;code&gt;movz&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand and pads the remaining bits not provided by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; with zeros (0).

This instruction is useful for copying a small, unsigned value to a bigger register.

 # Linux sys_exit 
        mov     $1, %eax
        xorl    %ebx, %ebx
        int     $0x80

== Sign Extend ==

{{x86-inst-2x|att=movs|intel=movsx}}

Move sign extend.

The &lt;code&gt;movs&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand and pads the remaining bits not provided by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; with the sign bit (the MSB) of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.

This instruction is useful for copying a signed small value to a bigger register.

        int     $0x80

== Move String ==

{{x86-inst|movsb}}

Move byte

The &lt;code&gt;movsb&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies one byte from the memory location specified in &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; to the location specified in &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt;. If the direction flag is cleared, then &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; are incremented after the operation. Otherwise, if the direction flag is set, then the pointers are decremented. In that case the copy would happen in the reverse direction, starting at the highest address and moving toward lower addresses until &lt;code&gt;ecx&lt;/code&gt; is zero.

''' Operands '''

None.

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;

  ; copy mystr into mystr2
  mov esi, mystr    ; loads address of mystr into esi
  mov edi, mystr2   ; loads address of mystr2 into edi
  cld               ; clear direction flag (forward)
  mov ecx,6

section .bss

section .data
  mystr db &quot;Hello&quot;, 0x0
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst|movsw}}

Move word

The &lt;code&gt;movsw&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies one word (two bytes) from the location specified in &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; to the location specified in &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt;. It basically does the same thing as &lt;code&gt;movsb&lt;/code&gt;, except with words instead of bytes.

&lt;/source&gt;

== Load Effective Address ==

{{x86-inst-2|lea}}

Load Effective Address

The &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; instruction calculates the address of the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand and loads it into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand.

''' Operands '''

''src''
* Immediate
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Note '''
Load Effective Address calculates its &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the same way as the &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction does, but rather than loading the ''contents'' of that address into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand, it loads the address itself.

&lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; can be used not only for calculating addresses, but also general-purpose unsigned integer arithmetic (with the caveat and possible advantage that FLAGS are unmodified).  This can be quite powerful, since the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand can take up to 4 parameters: base register, index register, scalar multiplier and displacement, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[eax + edx*4 -4]&lt;/code&gt; (Intel syntax) or &lt;code&gt;-4(%eax, %edx, 4)&lt;/code&gt; (GAS syntax). The scalar multiplier is limited to constant values 1, 2, 4, or 8 for byte, word, double word or quad word offsets respectively. This by itself allows for multiplication of a general register by constant values 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, as shown below (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax):
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
lea ebx, [ebx*2]      ; Multiply ebx by 2
lea ebx, [ebx*8+ebx]  ; Multiply ebx by 9, which totals ebx*18
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Control flow}}

Almost all programming languages have the ability to change the order in which statements are evaluated, and assembly is no exception. The instruction pointer (EIP) register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. To change the flow of control, the programmer must be able to modify the value of EIP. This is where control flow functions come in. 

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov eip, label   ; wrong
jmp label        ; right
&lt;/source&gt;


== Comparison Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|test|arg1|arg2}}

Performs a bit-wise logical AND on &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; the result of which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; and sets the &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;(zero), &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt;(sign) and &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;(parity) flags based on &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; is then discarded.

* &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;- 0
* &lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt; is undefined

{{x86-inst-2|cmp|arg2|arg1}}

Performs a comparison operation between &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. The comparison is performed by a (signed) subtraction of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;, the results of which can be called &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; is then discarded. If &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is an immediate value it will be sign extended to the length of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;EFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; register is set in the same manner as a &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

Note that the GAS/AT&amp;T syntax can be rather confusing, as for example &lt;code&gt;cmp $0, %rax&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;jl branch&lt;/code&gt; will branch if &lt;code&gt;%rax &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; (and not the opposite as might be expected from the order of the operands).

== Jump Instructions ==
The jump instructions allow the programmer to (indirectly) set the value of the EIP register. The location passed as the argument is usually a label. The first instruction executed after the jump is the instruction immediately following the label. All of the jump instructions, with the exception of &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;, are '''conditional jumps''', meaning that program flow is diverted only if a condition is true. These instructions are often used after a comparison instruction (see above), but since many other instructions set flags, this order is not required.

See [[X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#EFLAGS_Register]] for more information about the flags and their meaning.

=== Unconditional Jumps ===

{{x86-inst-1|jmp|loc}}

Loads EIP with the specified address (i.e. the next instruction executed will be the one specified by jmp).

=== Jump on Equality ===

{{x86-inst-1|je|loc}}
''ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if operands of previous CMP instruction are equal. For example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov $5, ecx
mov $5, edx
cmp ecx, edx
je equal
; if it did not jump to the label equal, then this means ecx and edx are not equal.
equal:
; if it jumped here, then this means ecx and edx are equal
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Jump on Inequality ===

{{x86-inst-1|jne|loc}}
''ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if operands of previous CMP instruction are not equal.

=== Jump if Greater ===

{{x86-inst-1|jg|loc}}
''ZF = 0 and SF = OF''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than the second (performs signed comparison).

{{x86-inst-1|jge|loc}}
''SF = OF''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than or equal to the second (performs signed comparison).

{{x86-inst-1|ja|loc}}
''CF = 0 and ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than the second. &lt;code&gt;ja&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jg&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

{{x86-inst-1|jae|loc}}
''CF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than or equal to the second. &lt;code&gt;jae&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jge&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

=== Jump if Less ===

{{x86-inst-1|jl|loc}}

The criteria required for a &lt;code&gt;JL&lt;/code&gt; is that &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt;, loads EIP with the specified address, if the criteria is meet. So either &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; can be set but not both in order to satisfy this criteria. If we take the &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;which is basically what a &lt;code&gt;CMP&lt;/code&gt; does&lt;/i&gt;) instruction as an example, we have:

&lt;DL&gt;&lt;DD&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

With respect to &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CMP&lt;/code&gt; there are several cases that fulfill this criteria:

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &lt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation does not have overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &gt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation has an overflow
&lt;/OL&gt;

In case 1) &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; will be set but not &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; and in case 2) &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set but not &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; since the overflow will reset the most significant bit to zero and thus preventing &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; being set. The &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt; criteria avoids the cases where:

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &gt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation does not have overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &lt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation has an overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 == arg1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;

In case 1) neither &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are set, in case 2) &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set and &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; will be set since the overflow will reset the most significant bit to one and in case 3) neither &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set.

'''Example'''
The example code below runs the five cases outlined above and prints out whether &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are equal or not:

				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80

&lt;/source&gt;

The expected output is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
SF &lt;&gt; OF
SF &lt;&gt; OF
SF == OF
SF == OF
SF == OF
&lt;/source&gt;



{{x86-inst-1|jle|loc}}

The criteria required for a &lt;code&gt;JLE&lt;/code&gt; is that &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt;, loads EIP with the specified address if the criteria is meet. See the &lt;code&gt;JL&lt;/code&gt; section for a more detailed description of the criteria, the one point of departure would be that &lt;code&gt;arg2 == arg1&lt;/code&gt; fulfills the criteria for &lt;code&gt;JLE&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt;.


'''Example'''
The example code below runs the five cases outlined previously and prints out whether &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are equal or not and whether &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt; or not:

&lt;/source&gt;

The expected output is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
SF &lt;&gt; OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
SF &lt;&gt; OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
SF == OF and ZF == 1

SF == OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst-1|jb|loc}}
''CF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is less than the second. &lt;code&gt;jb&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jl&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

{{x86-inst-1|jbe|loc}}
''CF = 1 or ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is less than or equal to the second. &lt;code&gt;jbe&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jle&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

=== Jump on Overflow ===

{{x86-inst-1|jo|loc}}
''OF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the overflow bit is set on a previous arithmetic expression.

{{x86-inst-1|jno|loc}}
''OF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the overflow bit is not set on a previous arithmetic expression.

=== Jump on Zero ===

{{x86-inst-1|jz|loc}}
''ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the zero bit is set from a previous arithmetic expression. &lt;code&gt;jz&lt;/code&gt; is identical to &lt;code&gt;je&lt;/code&gt;.

{{x86-inst-1|jnz|loc}}
''ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the zero bit is not set from a previous arithmetic expression. &lt;code&gt;jnz&lt;/code&gt; is identical to &lt;code&gt;jne&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Jump on Sign ===

{{x86-inst-1|js|loc}}
''SF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the sign bit is set from a previous arithmetic expression.

{{x86-inst-1|jns|loc}}
''SF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the sign bit is not set from a previous arithmetic expression.

== Function Calls ==
{{x86-inst-1|call|proc}}

Pushes the address of the next opcode onto the top of the stack, and jumps to the specified location. This is used mostly for subroutines.

{{x86-inst-1|ret|[val]}}

Loads the next value on the stack into EIP, and then pops the specified number of bytes off the stack. If ''val'' is not supplied, the instruction will not pop any values off the stack after returning.

== Loop Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|loop}}

The &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; instruction decrements ECX and jumps to the address specified by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt; unless decrementing ECX caused its value to become zero. For example:

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
 mov ecx, 5
 start_loop:
 ; the code here would be executed 5 times
 loop start_loop
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; does not set any flags.

{{x86-inst-1|loopx}}

These loop instructions decrement ECX and jump to the address specified by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt; if their condition is satisfied (that is, a specific flag is set), unless decrementing ECX caused its value to become zero.

*&lt;code&gt;loope&lt;/code&gt;  loop if equal
*&lt;code&gt;loopne&lt;/code&gt; loop if not equal
*&lt;code&gt;loopnz&lt;/code&gt; loop if not zero
*&lt;code&gt;loopz&lt;/code&gt;  loop if zero

== Enter and Leave ==

{{x86-inst-1|enter}}

Creates a stack frame with the specified amount of space allocated on the stack.

{{x86-inst|leave}}

destroys the current stack frame, and restores the previous frame. Using Intel syntax this is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp
&lt;/source&gt;

This will set &lt;code&gt;EBP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ESP&lt;/code&gt; to their respective value before the function prologue began therefore reversing any modification to the stack that took place during the prologue.

== Other Control Instructions ==

{{x86-inst|hlt}}

Halts the processor. Execution will be resumed after processing next hardware interrupt, unless IF is cleared.

{{x86-inst|nop}}

No operation. This instruction doesn't do anything, but wastes an instruction cycle in the processor. This instruction is often represented as an '''XCHG''' operation with the operands '''EAX''' and '''EAX'''.

{{x86-inst|lock}}

Asserts #LOCK prefix on next instruction.

{{x86-inst|wait}}

Waits for the FPU to finish its last calculation.

== Arithmetic instructions ==

Arithmetic instructions take two operands: a destination and a source. The destination must be a register or a memory location. The source may be either a memory location, a register, or a constant value. Note that at least one of the two must be a register, because operations may not use a memory location as both a source and a destination.


{{x86-inst-2|add}}
This adds &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the MASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the second argument. 


{{x86-inst-2|sub}}
Like ADD, only it subtracts source from destination instead. In C: &lt;tt&gt;dest -= src;&lt;/tt&gt;


{{x86-inst-1|mul}}
This multiplies &quot;arg&quot; by the value of corresponding byte-length in the AX register.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| operand size || 1 byte || 2 bytes || 4 bytes
|-
| other operand || AL || AX || EAX
|-
| higher part of result stored in: || AH || DX || EDX
|-
| lower part of result stored in: || AL || AX || EAX
|-
|}

In the second case, the target is not EAX for backward compatibility with code written for older processors.



{{x86-inst-1|imul}}
As MUL, only signed. The IMUL instruction has the same format as MUL, but also accepts two other formats like so:

{{x86-inst-2|imul}}
This multiplies &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the NASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the second argument.
{{x86-inst-3|imul}}
This multiplies &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;aux&lt;/code&gt; and places it into &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the NASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the third argument. 


{{x86-inst-1|div}}
This divides the value in the dividend register(s) by &quot;arg&quot;, see table below.


:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| divisor size || 1 byte || 2 bytes || 4 bytes
|-
| dividend || AX || DX:AX || EDX:EAX
|-
| remainder stored in: || AH || DX || EDX
|-
| quotient stored in: || AL || AX || EAX
|-
|}

The colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;) means concatenation. With divisor size 4, this means that EDX are the bits 32-63 and EAX are bits 0-31 of the input number (with lower bit numbers being less significant, in this example).

As you typically have 32-bit input values for division, you often '''need to use [[w:X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_80386|CDQ]] to sign-extend EAX into EDX just before the division'''.

If quotient does not fit into quotient register, arithmetic overflow interrupt occurs.
All flags are in undefined state after the operation.


{{x86-inst-1|idiv}}
As DIV, only signed.


{{x86-inst-1|neg}}
Arithmetically negates the argument (i.e. two's complement negation).

== Carry Arithmetic Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|adc}}

Add with carry. Adds &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;carry flag&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, storing result in &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;.  Usually follows a normal add instruction to deal with values twice as large as the size of the register. In the following example, ''source'' contains a 64-bit number which will be added to ''destination''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, [source] ; read low 32 bits
mov edx, [source+4] ; read high 32 bits
add [destination], eax ; add low 32 bits
adc [destination+4], edx ; add high 32 bits, plus carry
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst-2|sbb}}
Subtract with borrow. Subtracts &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;carry flag&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, storing result in &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;.  Usually follows a normal sub instruction to deal with values twice as large as the size of the register.


== Increment and Decrement ==

{{x86-inst-1|inc}}
Increments the register value in the argument by 1. Performs much faster than '''ADD arg, 1'''.


{{x86-inst-1|dec}}
Decrements the register value in the argument by 1. Performs much faster than '''SUB arg, 1'''.

== Pointer arithmetic ==
The &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; instruction can be used for arithmetic, especially on pointers.  See [[X86 Assembly/Data Transfer#Load Effective Address]].</text>

== Logical instructions ==
The instructions on this page deal with bit-wise logical instructions. For more information about bit-wise logic, see [[Digital Circuits/Logic Operations]].

{{x86-inst-2|and}}

Performs a bit-wise AND of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx
 andl %edx, %ecx
 ; here ecx would be 0 because 1 AND 0 = 0

{{x86-inst-2|or}}

Performs a bit-wise OR of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx
 orl  %edx, %ecx
 ; here ecx would be 1 because 1 OR 0 = 1

{{x86-inst-2|xor}}

Performs a bit-wise XOR of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx 
 xorl %edx, %ecx 
 ; here ecx would be 1 because 1 XOR 0 = 1

{{x86-inst-1|not}}

Performs a bit-wise inversion of arg. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 notl %edx
 ; here edx would be 0xFFFFFFFE because a bitwise NOT 0x00000001 = 0xFFFFFFFE</text>

== Logical Shift Instructions ==

In a '''logical shift''' instruction (also referred to as '''unsigned shift'''), the bits that slide off the end disappear (except for the last, which goes into the carry flag), and the spaces are always filled with zeros. Logical shifts are best used with unsigned numbers.

{{x86-inst-2|shr}}

Logical shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

{{x86-inst-2|shl}}

Logical shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 movw   $ff00,%ax        # ax=1111.1111.0000.0000 (0xff00, unsigned 65280, signed -256) 
 shrw   $3,%ax           # ax=0001.1111.1110.0000 (0x1fe0, signed and unsigned 8160)
                         # (logical shifting unsigned numbers right by 3
                         #   is like integer division by 8)
 shlw   $1,%ax           # ax=0011.1111.1100.0000 (0x3fc0, signed and unsigned 16320) 
                         # (logical shifting unsigned numbers left by 1
                         #   is like multiplication by 2)

== Arithmetic Shift Instructions ==

In an '''arithmetic shift''' (also referred to as '''signed shift'''), like a logical shift, the bits that slide off the end disappear (except for the last, which goes into the carry flag). But in an arithmetic shift, the spaces are filled in such a way to preserve the sign of the number being slid. For this reason, arithmetic shifts are better suited for signed numbers in two's complement format.

{{x86-inst-2|sar}}

Arithmetic shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits. Spaces are filled with sign bit (to maintain sign of original value), which is the original highest bit.

{{x86-inst-2|sal}}

Arithmetic shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits. The bottom bits do not affect the sign, so the bottom bits are filled with zeros.  This instruction is synonymous with SHL.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 movw   $ff00,%ax        # ax=1111.1111.0000.0000 (0xff00, unsigned 65280, signed -256)
 salw   $2,%ax           # ax=1111.1100.0000.0000 (0xfc00, unsigned 64512, signed -1024)
                         # (arithmetic shifting left by 2 is like multiplication by 4 for
                         #   negative numbers, but has an impact on positives with most
                         #   significant bit set (i.e. set bits shifted out))
 sarw   $5,%ax           # ax=1111.1111.1110.0000 (0xffe0, unsigned 65504, signed -32)
                         # (arithmetic shifting right by 5 is like integer division by 32
                         #   for negative numbers)

== Extended Shift Instructions ==

The names of the ''double precision'' shift operations are somewhat misleading, hence they are listed as ''extended'' shift instructions on this page.

They are available for use with 16- and 32-bit data entities (registers/memory locations). The &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand is always a register, the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand can be a register or memory location, the &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; operand is an immediate byte value or the CL register. In 64-bit mode it is possible to address 64-bit data as well.

{{x86-inst-3|shld|src|dest|cnt}}

The operation performed by &lt;code&gt;shld&lt;/code&gt; is to shift the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits out of &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, but instead of filling up the least significant bits with zeros, they are filled with the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.

{{x86-inst-3|shrd|src|dest|cnt}}

Likewise, the &lt;code&gt;shrd&lt;/code&gt; operation shifts the least significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits out of &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, and fills up the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits with the least significant bits of the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand.

Intel's nomenclature is misleading, in that the shift does not operate on double the basic operand size (i.e. specifying 32-bit operands doesn't make it a 64-bit shift): the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand always remains unchanged.

Also, Intel's manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325383.pdf Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2] ([[w:PDF|PDF]], 6.2 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; states that the results are undefined when &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the operand size, but at least for 32- and 64-bit data sizes it has been observed that shift operations are performed by (&lt;code&gt;cnt [[w:Modulo_operator|mod]] n&lt;/code&gt;), with n being the data size.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 xorw   %ax,%ax          # ax=0000.0000.0000.0000 (0x0000)
 notw   %ax              # ax=1111.1111.1111.1111 (0xffff)
 movw   $0x5500,%bx      # bx=0101.0101.0000.0000
 shrdw  $4,%ax,%bx       # bx=1111.0101.0101.0000 (0xf550), ax is still 0xffff
 shldw  $8,%bx,%ax       # ax=1111.1111.1111.0101 (0xfff5), bx is still 0xf550

Other examples ('''decimal numbers are used instead of binary number to explain the concept''')
 # ax = 1234 5678
 # bx = 8765 4321
 shrd   $3, %ax, %bx     # ax = 1234 5678 bx = 6788 7654 

 # ax = 1234 5678
 # bx = 8765 4321
 shld   $3, %ax, %bx     # bx = 5432 1123 ax = 1234 5678

== Rotate Instructions ==

In a rotate instruction, the bits that slide off the end of the register are fed back into the spaces. 

{{x86-inst-2|ror}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

{{x86-inst-2|rol}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

== Rotate With Carry Instructions ==

Like with shifts, the rotate can use the carry bit as the &quot;extra&quot; bit that it shifts through.

{{x86-inst-2|rcr}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits with carry.

{{x86-inst-2|rcl}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits with carry.

=== Number of arguments ===
Unless stated, these instructions can take either one or two arguments. If only one is supplied, it is assumed to be a register or memory location and the number of bits to shift/rotate is one (this may be dependent on the assembler in use, however).
&lt;code&gt; shrl $1, %eax &lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt; shrl %eax&lt;/code&gt;  (GAS syntax).

== Stack Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|push}}
This instruction decrements the stack pointer and stores the data specified as the argument into the location pointed to by the stack pointer.
 
{{x86-inst-1|pop}}
This instruction loads the data stored in the location pointed to by the stack pointer into the argument specified and then increments the stack pointer. For example:

{|
|-
|
 mov eax, 5
 mov ebx, 6
|
|-
|
 push eax 
| The stack is now: [5]
|-
|
 push ebx 
| The stack is now: [6] [5]
|-
|
 pop eax 
|The topmost item (which is 6) is now stored in eax. The stack is now: [5]
|-
|
 pop ebx 
|ebx is now equal to 5. The stack is now empty.
|}

{{x86-inst|pushf}}
This instruction decrements the stack pointer and then loads the location pointed to by the stack pointer with the contents of the flag register.

{{x86-inst|popf}}
This instruction loads the flag register with the contents of the memory location pointed to by the stack pointer and then increments the contents of the stack pointer.

{{x86-inst|pusha}}
This instruction pushes all the general purpose registers onto the stack in the following order: EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI. The value of ESP pushed is the value before the instruction is executed. It is useful for saving state before an operation that could potential change these registers.

{{x86-inst|popa}}
This instruction pops all the general purpose registers off the stack in the reverse order of PUSHA. That is, EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, EBX, EDX, ECX, EAX. Used to restore state after a call to PUSHA.
{{x86-inst|pushad}}
{{x86-inst|popad}}
== Flags instructions ==

While the [[X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#EFLAGS_Register|flags]] register is used to report on results of executed instructions (overflow, carry, etc.), it also contains flags that affect the operation of the processor. These flags are set and cleared with special instructions.

=== Interrupt Flag ===
The IF flag tells a processor if it should accept hardware interrupts. It should be kept set under normal execution. In fact, in protected mode, neither of these instructions can be executed by user-level programs.

{{x86-inst|sti}}

Sets the interrupt flag. If set, the processor can accept interrupts from peripheral hardware. 

{{x86-inst|cli}}

Clears the interrupt flag. Hardware interrupts cannot interrupt execution. Programs can still generate interrupts, called software interrupts, and change the flow of execution. Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) cannot be blocked using this instruction.

=== Direction Flag ===

The DF flag tells the processor which way to read data when using [[X86_Assembly/Data_Transfer#Move_String|string]] instructions. That is, whether to decrement or increment the &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; registers after a &lt;code&gt;movs&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

{{x86-inst|std}}

Sets the direction flag. Registers will decrement, reading backwards.

{{x86-inst|cld}}

Clears the direction flag. Registers will increment, reading forwards.

=== Carry Flag ===

The CF flag is often modified after arithmetic instructions, but it can be set or cleared manually as well.

{{x86-inst|stc}}

Sets the carry flag.

{{x86-inst|clc}}

Clears the carry flag.

{{x86-inst|cmc}}

Complements (inverts) the carry flag.

=== Other ===
{{x86-inst|sahf}}

Stores the content of AH register into the lower byte of the flag register.

{{x86-inst|lahf}}

Loads the AH register with the contents of the lower byte of the flag register.

== I/O Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|in}}

The '''IN''' instruction almost always has the operands AX and DX (or EAX and EDX) associated with it. DX (src) frequently holds the port address to read, and AX (dest) receives the data from the port. In Protected Mode operating systems, the IN instruction is frequently locked, and normal users can't use it in their programs.

{{x86-inst-2|out}}

The '''OUT''' instruction is very similar to the IN instruction. OUT outputs data from a given register (src) to a given output port (dest). In protected mode, the OUT instruction is frequently locked so normal users can't use it.



== System Instructions ==

These instructions were added with the Pentium II.

{{x86-inst|sysenter}}

This instruction causes the processor to enter protected system mode (supervisor mode or &quot;kernel mode&quot;).

{{x86-inst|sysexit}}

This instruction causes the processor to leave protected system mode, and enter user mode.

== Misc Instructions ==

{{x86-inst|RDTSC}}

RDTSC was introduced in the Pentium processor, the instruction reads the number of clock cycles since reset and returns the value in EDX:EAX. This can be used as a way of obtaining a low overhead, high resolution CPU timing. Although with modern CPU microarchitecture(multi-core, hyperthreading)  and  multi-CPU machines you are not guaranteed synchronized cycle counters between cores and CPUs. Also the CPU frequency may be variable due to power saving or dynamic overclocking. So the instruction may be less reliable than when it was first introduced and should be used with care when being used for performance measurements.

It is possible to use just the lower 32-bits of the result but it should be noted that on a 600 MHz processor the register would overflow every 7.16 seconds:

:&lt;math&gt;	2^{32} cycles * (1 second / 600,000,000 cycles) = 7.16 seconds&lt;/math&gt;

While using the full 64-bts allows for 974.9 years between overflows:

:&lt;math&gt;	2^{64} cycles * ((1 second / 600,000,000 cycles) / ( 86400 seconds\ in\ a\ day\ *\ 365\ days\ in\ a\ year) ) = 974.9 years&lt;/math&gt;

The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) is an example of using RDTSC to measure the number of cycles a small block takes to execute:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main 

extern printf

section .data
	align 4
	a:	dd 10.0
	b:	dd 5.0
	c:	dd 2.0
	fmtStr:	db &quot;edx:eax = %llu edx = %d eax = %d&quot;, 0x0A, 0

section .bss
	align 4
	cycleLow:	resd 1
	cycleHigh:	resd 1
	result:		resd 1

section .text
	main:			; Using main since we are using gcc to link

;
;	op	dst,  src
;
	xor	eax, eax
	cpuid
	rdtsc
	mov	[cycleLow], eax
	mov	[cycleHigh], edx 

				;
				; Do some work before measurements 
				;
	fld	dword [a]
	fld	dword [c]
	fmulp	st1
	fmulp	st1
	fld	dword [b]
	fld	dword [b]
	fmulp	st1
	faddp	st1
	fsqrt
	fstp	dword [result]
				;
				; Done work
				;

	cpuid
	rdtsc
				;
				; break points so we can examine the values
				; before we alter the data in edx:eax and
				; before we print out the results.
				;
break1:
	sub	eax, [cycleLow]
	sbb	edx, [cycleHigh]
break2:
	push	eax
	push	edx
	push 	edx
	push	eax
	push	dword fmtStr
	call	printf
	add	esp, 20		; Pop stack 5 times 4 bytes


				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -felf -g rdtsc.asm -l rdtsc.lst
$ gcc -m32 -o rdtsc rdtsc.o
$ ./rdtsc
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You can sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* Check out our [[Wikibooks:Help|help]] page if you need additional help.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** [[Wikibooks:Template messages|Templates]] can save your time
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], or ask me personally on my talk page.

Good luck! --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:57, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jun-Dai. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jun-Dai~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Introduction==
*[[Electronics|Electric circuits]] include [[../Resistors|resistors]], [[../Capacitors|capacitors]], [[Electronics/Inductors|'''inductors''']], etc. A piece of wire has a very small amount of [[Electronics/Inductance|inductance]], but usually we talk about inductors when we think about [[School Science/OHP coil|coils]], which are a lot of wire wound in near-circles around a [[Electronics/Inductor Construction|core]] which is some kind of magnetic material, such as iron. That core magnifies the inductance of the coil.
*While the wire has some resistance, the coil has not only that resistance, but also [[w:reactance (chemistry)|reactance]]. Reactance is proportional to frequency, and coils are used mainly in AC circuits for that reason. Usually the reactance(L) (in Ohms) is much higher than the resistance(R) of the inductor (also in Ohms), with the L/R ratio being important.

==[[Electronics/Magnetic Field|Saturation]]==
There is a limit to the strength of the magnetic field of an inductor, and therefore also a limit to the inductance of the inductor. '''Saturation''' is reached when a small increase in the electric current creating the magnetic field no longer causes an increase in the magnitude of the magnetic field. This is done intentionally in [[w:Saturable reactor|&quot;Saturable reactors&quot;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You can sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* Check out our [[Wikibooks:Help|help]] page if you need additional help.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** [[Wikibooks:Template messages|Templates]] can save your time
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lemony. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lemony~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)'''

==Contracting==
*What questions or concerns would you like us to address today?
*What has your experience been like with OI?
*Explanation of what will occur during the session
**Confirm family history
**We have some medical records, but will want to confirm some of his med history
**Dr. will come in to examine him
**And we will discuss what we think regarding whether we think he has OI and why we have come to the conclusions we have
**We will then answer any questions you might have

==Overview of OI==
*OI is a genetic disorder. Eight types of OI can be distinguished. Most cases are caused by dominant mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. Some are caused by recessive mutations.  
*It is due to a lack of or poor quality of type 1 collagen (Collagen is the major protein of the body's connective tissue)
*Extreme variations in severity from one individual to another
*Clinical diagnosis is often grouped into four types based on severity and characteristics

==Inheritance==
*As a genetic disorder, OI has historically been viewed as an autosomal dominant disorder of type I collagen. Most cases have been caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. In the past several years, there has been the identification of autosomal recessive forms.  
*Most cases of OI are caused by new mutation (especially type II)
**If spontaneous (parents unaffected) then empiric recurrence is 6-7% (Marini JC and Chernoff EJ)
**Empiric recurrence increases to 28% if more than one affected child has been born to unaffected parent
**Recurrence is caused by gonadal mosaicism (or even somatic mosaicism in a parent where parent is only mildly affected)
**18 cases of mosaicism in literature (12 paternal and 6 maternal)
**approximately 1/3 of these parents were mildly affected
**determining proportion of mutation in sperm can be most accurate way to obtain recurrence risk for mosaic fathers
*Affected individual has 50% chance of passing mutation on to each child (if dominant form)

==Genetics==
*Caused by an alteration in COL1A1 gene on chromosome 17 or COL1A2 gene on chromosome 7
*Over 200 mutations recognized (most unique to an individual family)
Geneotype Phenotype correlation (Not well understood)
*Even in families there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity
*Unrelated individuals with identical mutations may have similar or distinct phenotype
*Individuals with near identical phenotypes often have different mutations
*Lethal and nonlethal mutations are both represented about equally on alpha1 and alpha2 chains
*Type I caused by inactivation of one copy of gene resulting in underproduction of collagen
*More severe forms of OI generally result from structural mutations in gene that cause collagen fibers to become unstable
*Type I collagen is a primary component of bone
*Fibroblasts of patients show decrease in secretion of type I collagen into matrix
*Since the proportions of the components are important for mineralization of bone lack of enough type I results in poor matrix deposition
*Tissue specific difference in metabolism of mutant type I collagen may explain why mostly bone is affected

==Incidence==
(Marini JC and Chernoff EJ)
*Between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 30,000
*Incidence in US is 1 in 20,000 if all diagnosed within 1 year of birth included
*No preferential distribution by gender, race or ethnic group.
*Brittle bone disease is un-cureable for the time being.

==Clinical Features==
(Vary widely within types and between types)
(There are 4 types according to current classification, but an individual may not fit one category clearly)
*Type I
**Mildest type of OI
**Bones predisposed to fracture, especially before puberty (postnatal onset of fractures usually without bony deformity)
**Normal or near normal stature
**Loose joints (hyperextensible)
**Blue sclera
**Triangular face
**Spinal curvature
**Teeth possibly brittle (dentinogenesis imperfecta)
**Hearing loss in 20s or 30s
*Type II
**Most severe form
**Usually fetal demise or death in the perinatal period
**Numerous fractures and severe bone deformity
**Length and weight SGA
**Head large for body size
**Usually blue-gray sclera
**Markedly reduced ossification
**Underdeveloped lungs
*Type III (progressive deforming form)
**Bones fracture easily - fractures present at birth
**Bone deformity sometimes severe
**Short stature
**Blue sclera (thought to be due to differential scattering of light because of differences in the connective tissue) tends to whiten with age
**Loose joints and poor muscle development
**Barrel-shaped rib cage
**Triangular face
**Relative macrocephaly
**intellectually normal
**most are severely physically handicapped
**Spinal curvature
**Respiratory problems sometimes
**Teeth brittle possibly
**Hearing loss possible
*Type IV
**Between Type I and Type III in severity
**Bones fracture easily, most before puberty
**Mild to moderate bone deformity
**Moderate osteoporosis and modeling abnormalities of the long bones
**Shorter than average stature (moderately short)
**Normal sclera (but some cases reported of blue sclerae that seem to fit this type better than type I)
**Tendency toward spinal curvature
**Barrel-shaped rib cage
**Triangular face
**Brittle teeth possible
**Hearing loss possible

==Management==
*Hearing loss
*characteristic in type I OI and also occurs in types III and IV
*Combined sensorineural and conductive deficits
*Hearing aids help with conductive hearing loss more than sensorineural
*Referral to center with experience in OI when hearing aid no longer enough
*Surgical intervention with stapedectomy gives satisfactory long-term results in OI with severe loss (not routine) because won't relieve sensorinerual component
*Dental
*May need orthodontic work for maloculsion
*Other dental considerations for dentinogenesis imperfecta
*Cardiovascular
*Aortic root dilatation (12% of all affected individuals 28% in type III)
*No standard regimen for evaluation
*Aortic and mitral regurgitation occasionally noted
*Respiratory
*Pulmonary function evaluated by cardiology or pulmonology initially at young age (4-6 years) then reassessed every 2-3 if normal

==Natural History==
*Type II
**Frequently lethal at or shortly after birth due to respiratory problems
**Those that survive perinatal period generally die from pneumonia or respiratory insufficiency
**Some have lived for months or years, but bones are very porotic and no evidence of haversian canals or lamellar bone
*Type I
**rarely diagnosed at birth because it is mildest form
*Type III
**often causes fractures at birth, and fractures may occur in utero
**Compatible with long life, but many die in infancy of respiratory difficulties or in childhood of pneumonia
**Early intervention and rehab have improved prognosis

==Development and behavior==
*Minimal delay in fine motor development
*Significant delay in gross motor
*Intelligence and language unaffected

==Diagnosis/Testing==
*Can be diagnosed based on fractures, clinical features, and family history
*Collagen testing
**Study cells making type I collagen
**Biopsy 1/8 to 1/16 of an inch of skin
**Radiolabel and run on gel
**In people with OI, also bands that migrate more slowly - abnormal collagen molecules
**Does not identify 10-15% of individuals with mild OI
**May not be possible to distinguish between types of OI
**Usually used before molecular testing
*Molecular testing
**DNA sequencing
**Most families have unique mutation
**Does not identify mutation in about 5% of those with OI
*Prenatal diagnosis
**Ultrasound can often detect fractures, bowing, or other bone deformities in severe cases of OI (milder forms may be missed)
***Type II OI identifiable as early as 15 weeks gestation
***Type III OI not reliable until after 20 weeks (limb shortness may not be apparent until then)
***Findings on U/S may include
**CVS
***Cells analyzed for abnormal collagen
***DNA test for mutation if it has been identified in family
**Amniocentesis
***can identify genetic mutation (useful only if mutation has already been identified)

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Currently is no cure
*Management of fractures
**Usually treated with short-term immobilization in lightweight casts, splints, or braces to allow movement as soon as possible
*Physical therapy
**Should begin as soon as muscle weakness identified
**Goal is to give independence in life functions
**Swimming, water therapy, and walking safe exercises to maintain bone and muscle mass
*Rodding surgery
**Metal rods inserted in long bones to control fractures and improve deformities
**Two types of rods
***Nonexpandable versatile but must be replaced when child grows
***Expandable rods grow with child but only appropriate for longer bones
**Very thick
**Must be firmly anchored at both ends
**Spinal rodding for severe scoliosis
**If bones strong enough to support rods
*Bisphosphonate drugs
**Currently used to treat osteoporosis and bone complications in cancer
**Study at Montreal Shriners Hospital
**Administered pamindronate intravenously
**Treatment cycle is 4 hour infusion for 3 successive days
**Received cycle every 4 - 6 months
**Prevents breakdown of bones by osteoclasts
**Normally osteoblasts create new bone to replace older bone that is resorbed by osteoclasts
**In OI bone is resorbed by osteoclasts more quickly because it is imperfect and osteoblasts become less efficient (produce less bone) because collagen is abnormal
**Slowing down resorption of bone may strengthen skeleton
**Study included 30 children with severe OI
**Results showed increased bone density, reduction in bone pain, increased motility and decreased incidence of fractures
**Only side effect was mild fever in 87% of children on second day of first treatment - did not occur again
**Small study, no controls, and did not include patients with mild OI
*Growth hormone (still under investigation)
**Administration to those with type III and IV significantly increases linear growth rate in about half of individuals (type IV compose majority of responders)
**Individuals with type I also usually are responsive to GH.
**GH also increases muscle mass and strength.
**GH does not worsen skeletal deformities, but there is increase in blood levels of all components of bone turnover due to an increased rate of whole body remodeling associated with rapid bone gain

==Health tips for individuals with OI==
*Safe exercise
*Nutritious diet
*Calcium maintains bone density
*Vitamin C promotes healing
*Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol or caffeine, and steroid medications

==Precautions to take when caring for someone with OI==
*Never pull or push on limb or bend it in awkward position
*Don't lift baby under armpits or by ankles - put one hand under buttocks and other under shoulders and head
*Covered foam or a pillow may be used to transport baby but be sure to hold and touch babies
*Support infants in a variety of positions to develop muscles
*Use caution when performing medical procedures
*Minimize handling of limb when fracture suspected
*Respect opinions or instructions of family members

==Differentials==

An important differential diagnosis of OI is child abuse, as both may present with multiple fractures in various stages of healing. Differentiating them can be difficult, especially when no other characteristic features of OI are present. Other differential diagnoses include rickets, osteomalacia, and other rare skeletal syndromes.

==Psychosocial issues==
*Family attitudes depend on previous experience with OI
*Surprise, shock, anger, guilt, depression, and mourning common in parents with new diagnosis
**Families with a previous child may have already developed coping strategies and acceptance
**May be overprotective and overindulgent with affected children
**Frustration with medical personnel who don't handle child carefully
**Anxiety, frustration if unexplained fractures and child abuse suspected
*Affected individuals
**Frustration with inaccessibility of school, work, social environments
**Concerns about physical appearance, sexual development, and peer acceptance
**Feelings of isolation, discrimination, frustration

What is mentioned about countability seems a bit strange. Are you sure that practically all Polish words can be said in a plural form?  &quot;Pogoda&quot;, &quot;wiek&quot; (age), &quot;wiedza&quot;, &quot;owłosienie&quot;, &quot;karmel&quot; etc. &lt;BR&gt;
I'm afraid , the rule here is more or less like in English, namely : you never know whether you can say something in plural or not ;-) And the example with &quot;beers&quot; is ridiculous as , obviously, '''exactly the same refers to English uncountables''', of course one can say &quot;two beers&quot; in English. Two teas, three soaps or whatever if there exist implied counters. &lt;BR&gt;And similarly, many uncountable products can only be said in plural if you mean &quot;types of...&quot;, e.g. &quot;mąki&quot;, &quot;cukry&quot;, &quot;tłuszcze&quot;, etc. And again, same happens in English. So, generally, I think the paragraph on countability brings more unnecessary confusion rather than explanation



&quot;Wiedza&quot; doesn't have plural form,  &quot;pogoda&quot;, &quot;owłosienie&quot;, &quot;karmel&quot; have plural, &quot;wiek&quot; too, but plural form only meaning &quot;centuries&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
You can say uncountable products in singular and plural form, so &quot;mąka&quot;-&quot;mąki&quot;, &quot;cukier&quot;-&quot;cukry&quot;(only in meaning &quot;carbohydrates&quot;!), &quot;tłuszcz&quot;-&quot;tłuszcze&quot;, &quot;woda&quot;-&quot;wody&quot;, &quot;ser&quot;-&quot;sery&quot;(I never have understood, why cheese is uncontable in English ;p I'm polish) are correct.</text>

==Contracting==
*What concerns do you have for yourself or for your family?
*What questions do you have?
*Overview of agenda
**Elicit medical history
**Review family history
**Discuss genetics, testing, treatment and management

==Osteosarcoma Background==
*Most common type of bone cancer
**Arises in osteoid tissue in bones
**Most common in knees, upper legs, and upper arms
**Commonly affects people from ages 10-25
***Accounts for about 5% of childhood tumors
***50% form in bones around knee
***Only about 30% of patients with localized tumors survive free of relapse
*Symptoms of bone cancer
**Pain is most common symptom
**Other symptoms depend on location and size of tumor
***Tumors in or near joints may cause swelling or tenderness
***Can interfere with normal ability to move
**May weaken bones and make fractures more likely
**General symptoms include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and anemia
*Diagnosis
**Alkaline phosphatase assay
***Blood test to determine enzyme levels
***Large amounts of alkaline phosphatase found in blood when cells of bone tissue are active
****During childhood growth
****During mending of broken bone
****When tumor causes production of abnormal bone tissue
**X-rays show location, size, and shape of tumor
**Bone scan, CT, MRI, or angiogram may be recommended if X-ray suggests that a tumor is cancerous
**Biopsy needed to determine for sure if tumor is cancer
***Needle biopsy - make small hole in bone and remove tissue sample from tumor with needle-like instrument
***Incisional biopsy - cut into tumor and remove sample of tissue
**No staging system for osteosarcoma so use general terms
***Localized
***Metastatic - most often to lungs or other bones (20% of patients)
***Recurrence - most often in the lungs (5 year survival is 20-40% following surgery)
*Treatment
**Depends on type, size, location, and stage of cancer
**Surgery
***Amputation of limb necessary in some cases
***Pre or post-operative chemotherapy has improved success of limb-sparing surgery
***May remove only cancerous section of bone and replace it with prosthesis
**Chemotherapy and radiation may be used alone or together
***Tumors are generally resistant to radiation
***Degree of necrosis following chemotherapy predicts prognosis
**Various clinical trials for surgeries, radiation therapies, and chemotherapies
*Risk factors for bone cancers
**Radiation or chemotherapy treatment in children or young adults for other conditions
**Adults with Paget's disease are at increased risk for osteosarcoma
**Hereditary factors

==Li Fraumeni Syndrome Overview==
*Cancer predisposition syndrome
**Associated with soft-tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemia, osteosarcoma, melanoma, and cancer of the colon, pancreas, adrenal cortex, and brain
**Increases risk for development of cancers
*Diagnosis is made clinically and genetic testing is available

==Genetic Etiology==
*Due to mutation in TP53 gene on 17p13 that codes for TP53 protein in more than 50% of cases
**Tumor suppressor gene nicknamed &quot;guardian of the genome&quot;
**Acts as checkpoint control following DNA damage by delaying cell cycle progression until damaged DNA is repaired or cell commits to apoptosis
***Activates downstream genes to repair DNA
***Signals molecule to confirm damage and proceed with apoptosis
**Arrests cell cycle by mediating RB pathway
*CHEK2 gene at 22q12.1 also associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
**Reported in only a few families thus far
**Putative tumor suppressor gene
***Lies in TP53 pathway
***One of checkpoint genes activated in response to DNA damage by phorsphorylating p53
**Not known if cancer risks are different than those due to TP53 mutations
**Mutations in this gene appear to be most common in osteosarcomas
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
**Offspring of affected individuals have 50% chance of inheriting mutation
**Most individuals diagnosed have an affected parent
**De novo mutation rate unknown
*Fewer than 400 families reported worldwide
*Association of malignancies with TP53 mutations
**Less than 1% of all breast cancers
**2-10% of childhood brain tumors
**50-100% of childhood adrenocortical carcinomas
**2-3% of osteosarcomas
**9% of rhabdomyosarcomas
**7-20% of multiple primaries occurring at young ages
*Penetrance
**May be as high as 90%
**About 25% of cancers occur before age 18
**About 50% of individuals have malignancy by age 40
**About 90% of individuals have malignancy by age 70
**Different studies give different numbers - may be genetic heterogeneity

==Clinical Features==

**Melanoma
**Stomach cancer
**Colon cancer
**Pancreatic cancer
**Esophageal cancer
**Gonadal germ cell tumors diagnosed at young ages
**Wilm's tumor
*Adult women have higher cancer risk than men because of high frequency of breast cancer
*Also increases risk to develop multiple primary cancers
**Up to 50% may develop second cancer
**4% develop third cancer
**2% develop four cancers
**Survivors of childhood cancer have greatest risk to develop another primary
**Radiation exposure appears to increase risk of second cancer
*Genotype-phenotype correlation
**R337H mutations associate with development of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as low penetrance allele
**13964gc mutation in intron 6 in series of patients with breast cancer as low penetrance allele

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnostic criteria (LFS)
**Proband with sarcoma diagnosed under 45 years of age
**First-degree relative with any cancer under 45 years of age
**Third family member who is first- or second-degree relative with cancer under 45 or sarcoma at any age
*Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL)
**Share some, but not all features of LFS
**Birch's definition
***Proband with any childhood cancer or sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenal cortical tumor diagnosed under 45 years of age
***First- or second-degree relative with a typical LFS cancer at any age
***Additional first- or second-degree relative with any cancer under the age of 60
**Eele's definition
***Two first- or second-degree relatives with LFS-related malignancies
***Can occur at any age
*Molecular genetic testing
**Identifies mutations in TP53 gene in about 70% of patients with LFS and 8-22% of families with LFL
**DNA sequencing
***Available clinically
***Identifies mutations in about 75% of families
***About 80% of identifiable mutations are in exons 5-8 so testing is often limited to only these exons
***Full gene sequencing and protein function for novel missense mutations generally only offered on research basis
**Chip-based DNA sequencing
***Available on research basis only
***Detects most of common single base pair mutations that have been identified
***Sensitivity of 90-98% depending on how much of coding region is sequenced
**Can test asymptomatic individuals once mutation is identified in the family
***Cannot predict age of onset, severity, type of cancer, or rate of preogression
***Lack of proven surveillance or prevention so not justified for management but may be useful for reproductive, financial, and career planning or peace of mind
***Testing has been confined to individuals 18 and older since no proven management options
**Prenatal testing is possible if mutation identified in family but requires careful genetic counseling
**Potential risks of testing
***May not be covered by insurance
***Possible problems with health, life, and disability insurance coverage
***Possible employment and educational discrimination
***Changes in social and family interaction
***Implications for other at-risk family members

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ovarian Cancer'''

==Contracting==
*Before we get started, I want to give you a chance to ask any questions or express any concerns that you may have.
*What issues do you want to make sure we discuss? What do you want to gain from our session today?
*Our plan:
**talk about your medical history and diagnosis
**discuss your family history in a little more detail
**talk about the genetics of hereditary cancers
**we'll explain what we see and discuss your risks
**talk about genetic testing - what it tests, limitations
**discuss ways for you to stay healthy

==Medical History==
*Tell me how you got to this point. How was your ovarian cancer diagnosed?
*Fill out intake with details.
*Any other medical illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?

==Family History==
*Update pedigree with details. A pedigree is our &quot;physical exam&quot;. Gives us clues as to whether the cancer is hereditary. It's important to know who has AND who doesn't have cancer.
**Very specific questions about the cancer in different family members
**Age at diagnosis
**Current age &amp; screening practices
**Age at death &amp; specific cause of death
**Primary site of cancer (type, location, stage, laterality)
**Metastasis or any new primary cancers
**Methods of treatment/surgery
**Any types of precancerous lesions
**Ethnic background
**Environmental exposures
**Lifestyle issues (diet, exercise, stress)
**Screening habits of &quot;unaffected&quot; relatives
**Any other medical conditions that may be associated with cancer
**any family hx of early heart attacks, blindness, deafness, birth defects, or multiple miscarriages

==Cancer Epidemiology==
*Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. All cancers are genetic, but not all are inherited. It is a multifactorial disorder, caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors.
*Cancer is a very common disease. 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop some form of cancer in their lifetimes. The most common cancer sites are lung, breast, prostate, and colon.
*In the U.S., 1 in 55 women will develop ovarian cancer (1.8% lifetime risk)
**5-10% of all ovarian cancer is hereditary (meaning that it runs in families)
**90% of this is caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
*In the U.S., 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetimes.
**Average age of developing cancer is 62 (2/3 of the women will be over 55)
**5-10% of all breast cancer is hereditary. Of this, 2/3 (66%) of it is due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
**This gene is the link between breast and ovarian cancer.

==Red Flags==
*How do we know when a cancer is hereditary? We look for clues (red flags).
*What makes us suspicious:
**more than one generation affected
**multiple close relatives affected on the same side of the family
**early age of onset (before 50)
**bilateral cancer or more than one type of cancer in the same person
**rare or unusual cancers

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Hereditary cancers are caused by a change in a specific gene that is passed on
through a family
**Genes are made of DNA. They have all the instructions for how our bodies grow and develop.
**When there is a change in a gene, it causes the cell to not work properly, so it can grow out of control and become cancerous.
*Genes are packaged on chromosomes. Chromosomes come in pairs, and we inherit one from mom and one from dad.
*This gene is autosomal dominant, so only need one copy of it to inherit a higher risk of cancer. There is a 50% chance of getting it from our parents. If we carry the gene, then we have a 50% chance of passing it on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pallister-Killian Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Tetrasomy 12p (mosaicism)

==Incidence and carrier frequency==
*Very rare disorder
*Affects males and females in equal numbers
*&gt;30 cases reported in the literature

==Risk to various family members==
*Sporadic inheritance, extremely rare
*No increased recurrence risk

==Clinical features==
*Typical findings:
*Hypotonia
*sparse scalp hair
*a high forehead with frontal bossing
*a coarse face
*an abnormally wide space between the eyes
*broad nasal bridge
*highly arched palate
*epicanthal folds
*large ears with lobes that are thick and protrude outward.
*Additional features many include:
*congenital heart defects
*diaphragmatic hernia
*hypopigmentation
*extra nipples
*seizures
*droopy upper eyelids
*strabismus
*contractures
*cognitive delays, speech delays
*mental retardation
*stenosis of the external auditory canal
*abnormal opening in the anus
*hypoplastic lung
*abnormalities of the genitourinary system
*skeletal malformations.

==Testing/Diagnosis==
*the chromosome abnormality in Pallister-Killian Mosaic Syndrome is limited to specific cell types
*mechanism and parental origin of the isochromosome 12p can usually not be determined
*diagnosis is usually made from a chromosome study of skin cells (fibroblasts)
*a blood chromosome study usually shows normal chromosomes
*peripheral blood lymphocytes are continually dividing
*they may lose the extra chromosome with their frequent divisions
*fibroblasts normally cycle less frequently, don't lose the extra chromosome
*Other reasons to test skin cells:
*During the 3rd week of fetal development gastrulation determines 3 germ layers
*Ectoderm: gives rise to the epidermis (skin) and central nervous system
*Endoderm: gives rise to the inner lining of the digestive tract and also the linings of tissues that sprout from the digestive tract, such as the respiratory system, liver, and pancreas
*Mesoderm: gives rise to tissues such as bones, muscle, blood, and connective tissue
*If a chromosome error arises after these tissues differentiate, there could be an error in the skin cells that is not present in other tissues that came from other germ layers

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
*There is no specific therapy for individuals with Pallister-Killian Syndrome

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pancreatic Cancer'''

==Pancreatic Cancer==
*Incidence is more than 29,000 new cases/year in US
**Fifth leading cause of cancer death
**4.1% five-year survival rate is lowest of all cancers
**About 9-10% of pancreatic cancer is familial
*Pancreas is a gland located in the abdomen between the stomach and the spine
**Responsible for producing insulin, glucagon, and other hormones
**Releases digestive juices through series of ducts leading to common bile duct
*Risk factors for pancreatic cancer
**Smoking - increases risk 2-3 times
**Age - most cancers diagnosed between 60 and 80 years
**Diabetes
**Chronic pancreatitis
***Long-term inflammation of the pancreas
***Especially inherited form of the condition
**Family history
***Risk increases by 4.7% if first degree relative has been diagnosed
***Increases by 7.3% if diagnosis was made before age 60
***Increases by 12.3% if multiple primary cancers in family
**Males and African-Americans may be at increased risk
**Diets high in fat may increase risk

==Diagnosis and Surveillance Options==
*Possible symptoms
**Pain in upper abdomen or upper back
**Yellowing of skin and eyes, dark urine due to jaundice
**Weakness
**Loss of appetite
**Nausea and vomiting
**Weight loss
*Physical exam
**Look for signs of jaundice or changes in area near pancreas
**Check for ascites (build-up of fluid in abdomen)
*Lab tests
**Blood, urine, and stool samples
**Check for bilirubin that may be high if tumor blocking common bile duct prevents its passage
*CT Scan
**Produces detailed picture of abdomen
**Can provide information about nature and location of tumors, resectability
*Ultrasonography
**Transabdominal ultrasound
**Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
***Pass thin, illuminated optic instrument down mouth into stomach
***Ultrasound device at tip of endoscope takes images of pancreas and surrounding areas
*Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
**Pass endoscope through mouth and stomach into first part of small intesting
**Inject dye through catheter into ducts
**Take X-rays to determine if ducts are narrowed or blocked by tumor
*Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC)
**Dye injected through needle inserted through skin into liver
**Dye moves freely through bile ducts unless blocked
**X-rays can show if dye has moved through ducts
*Biopsy
**Fine-needle aspiration
**During EUS or ERCP
**Open abdomen during operation
*Laparoscopy
**Uses several small incisions and TV camera to visualize organs in abdomen
**Usually only used if CT scan shows evidence of metastases

==Treatment==
*Pancreatic cancer is currently difficult to treat so participation in clinical trials is often recommended
*Surgery
**May be used alone or in combination with radiation or chemotherapy
**Whipple procedure
***If tumor is in head of pancreas
***Remove head and part of small intestine, bile duct, and stomach
**Distal pancreatectomy
***Surgeon removes body and tail of pancreas
***May also remove the spleen
**Total pancreatectomy
***Remove entire pancreas
***Also remove part of small intestine and stomach, and all of common bile duct, gallbladder, spleen, and nearby lymph nodes
**Create bypass or insert stent if tumor is blocking common bile duct or duodenum
***Relives jaundice and pain resulting from blockage
***Done if cancer cannot be completely removed surgically
**Side effects of removal of all or part of pancreas
***Diet control and medication may help with food digestion
***Diarrhea, pain, cramping, and feelings of fullness are common
*Radiation therapy and chemotherapy often used to destroy cancer cells

==Genetic Conditions Associated with Pancreatic Cancer==
*Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma (FAMMM)
**Due to mutations in p16 tumor suppressor gene
**TP16 (CKDN2) located at 9p21
**Affected individuals develop multiple nevi, atypical nevi, melanomas, and pancreatic cancer
*Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
**Due to mutations in LKB1 (STK11) gene at 19p13.3
**Causes multiple hamartomaous polyps of GI tract and pigmented macules on lips, buccal mucosa, and digits
**Increases risk to develop cancers
***In women: breast, pancreas, uterus, and ovary
***In men: colon, pancreas, lung, or testes
*Hereditary Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome
**Due to mutations in BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene at 13q12
**Most common inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer identified to date
**Mutations in BRCA2 have been identified in individuals with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer
**Estimated that carriers of 6174delT have 10-fold increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer
**Increases risk for breast, ovarian, prostate, and colon cancers also
*HNPCC
**Due to mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2 and MLH1
**Microsatellite instability has been identified in ~4% of pancreatic cancers
**Should be considered in patients with family history of colon cancer
**Increases risk for colon/rectum, endometrium, ovarian, urinary tract, stomach, and small intestine also
*MEN1
**Due to mutations in menin tumor suppressor gene at 11q13
**Associated specifically with insulinomas (10%) or gastrinomas (40%)
**Can cause tumors on parathyroid and pituitary glands also
*Hereditary Pancreatitis
**Due to mutations in cationic trypsinogen gene on 7q35
**Block inactivation of trypsin, resulting in autodigestion of pancrease
**Increase in pancreatic cancer may be secondary to chronic injury and repair
**Clinical testing available through University of Pittsburgh
**Penetrance of mutations is only 80%

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Worry about the future - caring for themselves, family, etc.
*Financial concerns
*Concerns about treatments and side effects
*Concern about necessity of frequent hospital visits, home care, etc.
*Feelings of guilt, anxiety, fear surrounding potential diagnosis of hereditary syndrome

[[Image:Neofelis nebulosa.jpg|thumb|A clouded leopard is at home in trees]]
'''Clouded leopards''' are not truly leopards at all but they spend a great deal of time in trees, just as the true leopards of Africa do.

==Where do clouded leopards live?==
[[Image:Clouded leopard prevalence.png|thumb|left|Areas where the clouded leopards live are colored green]]
Clouded leopards live throughout southern China, the eastern Himalayan Mountains, south-east Asia, and some parts of Indonesia. They prefer to live in tropical or subtropical forests, yet they can also be found living in mangrove swamps and grasslands.

The clouded leopard is a medium-sized wild cat found in the forests of Asia. Little is known about the wild behavior of clouded leopards due to their extremely secretive nature. Much of our understanding of this cat’s natural history and behavior is a result of observations of them in captivity.

==What do clouded leopards look like?==
[[File:Clouded leopard.jpg|thumb|A clouded leopard at the San Antonio zoo]]
At adult age a clouded leopard will range from somewhere between two and a half feet, nose to rump, to three and a half feet. The clouded leopard has short legs for its size.  It also has the longest canine teeth (2-inch fangs) for any similarly sized cat species that lives today.  Only the extinct sabretooth cats had longer canine teeth for their body size.

Clouded leopards are excellent climbers and their major prey animals live in trees. Short flexible legs, large paws, and keen claws combine to make them very sure-footed in this environment. The clouded leopard's tail can be as long as the rest of its body and helps to maintain the cat's balance while moving through the trees. Amazingly, these cats can hang upside-down under branches, and can even climb down tree trunks head-first. Other cats cannot do this because their claws are not shaped in the same way.

The beautiful pattern of the clouded leopard's fur is its most interesting feature.  The large square rosettes look like clouds to some people, and that is how they got the name &quot;clouded leopard.&quot;  Other people think the blotches look more like mint leaves, so they are also called &quot;mint leopards.&quot;

==What do clouded leopards eat, and how do they catch their prey?==

While not much is known about their behaviour in the wild, their prey is thought to be mostly mammals that live in trees, particularly monkeys, along with small mammals, deer, birds, porcupines, goats, wild boar, young buffalo, and domestic livestock.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the clouded leopard:
*They can climb down tree trunks head first.
*Like marbled cats and margays, they will sometimes hang head-down from branches using their hind legs.
*Young clouded leopards are born with  spots that become open squares as they grow older.

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself and others
*Assess concerns and what they hope to gain from the session
*Discuss reason for follow-up
*Provide overview of session

==Interim medical/developmental history==

==Discussion of concerns/question==

==Discussion about follow-up plans==

==Elicit interim medical history==
*Any illnesses/hospitalizations/surgeries since last visit in September?
*Current medications
*Any recent medical tests or procedures (since September)?
*Immunizations up to date?
*Review of systems

==Elicit developmental history==

==Elicit interim family history==
*Any newborns in the family?
*Any new information about health problems in family members?
*Any significant changes in family members' health?

==Psychosocial update?==
*Any changes in work?
*Who takes care of during the day?
*Any plans for more children?
*How are finances after paying for ____'s medical needs? Any assistance used or needed?

==Genetic etiology==
*Partial trisomies are usually de novo
*Possible mechanisms for formation of a partial trisomy/duplucation:
*Unequal crossing over during homologous chromosome recombination in meisosis, chromosomes mispaired resulting in duplication in one set of homologous chromosomes and deletion in one set of homologous chromosomes
*Parental gonadal mosaicism-One of his parents could have duplication of this region in some germ cells (caused by same mechanism as above)
*Recurrence risk for parents to have another child with Patient's chromosome rearrangement is less than 0.5% (probably MUCH less, but in case of gonadal mosaicism, we should say this number)
*Risk for any chromosome abnormality in future pregnancy: 1/417 at age 29, 1/384 at age 30 (from Maternal-Fetal Medicine)
*Risk for Patient to have a child with the same chromosome abnormality is about 50%
*Homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis requires the chromosomes to contort in order to pair up properly-this can lead to problems during crossing over, where further chromosome abnormalities could occur, as well as formation of an extra abnormal chromosome
*Fertility may be a problem with Patient, as it commonly is in people with chromosome abnormalities (especially males) and so this may be something the parents or Patient will want to assess after puberty

==Molecular genetics==
*People with duplications in different regions of 11q have been identified in the literature, but none with the same region as Patient
*Even though some of these people's duplicated regions may overlap slightly with Patient's duplicated region, there are very different genes duplicated in those people, and so we would not expect Patient to have the same effects
*Some of the documented literature:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling (PUBS)'''

==Introduction==
*Welcome and acknowledge prior phone contact
*Discuss the reason for referral
*Elicit prior knowledge about Rh isoimmunization
*Assess questions and concerns
*Discuss overview of the session and explain relevance of each portion
**Medical information and family history
**Rh factor and isoimmunization
**Treatment options for the fetus

==Medical History==

==Explain Genes and Chromosomes==
*Tell patient that we need to discuss genes and chromosomes so she can understand how we can tell that her baby is Rh negative
*Dominant vs. recessive alleles and autosomal dominant inheritance

==Rh Factor and Rh Isoimmunization==
*Rh refers to a protein that is sometimes present on the surface of red blood cells. If a person has this protein, they are Rh positive; if not, they are Rh negative
*A person with Rh negative blood can develop antibodies against Rh positive cells if they are exposed to Rh positive blood. This can happen during pregnancy with an Rh - mother and Rh + fetus.
*These antibodies attack the Rh + fetal cells
*A medication called RhoGAM can be given to an Rh - mother so that she will not produce antibodies against her Rh + fetus
*If the mother makes these antibodies, fetal blood cells will be destroyed and a serious condition called anemia can result. Another more life-threatening condition, immune hydrops fetalis, can also occur. This is the accumulation of water in the fetus, causing severe swelling. This can cause other organ systems in the baby to shut down or not develop correctly.
*Even though Rh is the most common blood protein to cause sensitization in mothers there are other blood proteins such as Kell that can cause isoimmunization.  
==Explain PUBS==
*Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling is a technique used to collect a sample of blood from a fetus through an umbilical vessel
**&quot;Percutaneous&quot; refers to going through skin without puncturing or opening it
*We can use this technique to do a blood transfusion directly into a fetus to treat anemia
**Because of Rh incompatibility, we can't give the blood to the mother-it must be given directly to the baby
*PUBS can be done starting at 16 weeks gestation until birth
*The umbilical vessels connect the baby to the placenta (show on visual aid)
*A doctor and an ultrasound technician will typically be in the room during the procedure. The mother may have someone come in with her if she chooses.
*Mother will lie on an exam table on her back with her hands folded behind her head.
*An ultrasound will be done first to determine the location of the fetus and the placenta
**This is a special type of ultrasound, known as Color Doppler imaging. It allows the best view of the umbilical cord because it uses different colors to measure blood flow in the baby and allows the cord to be seen very easily.
**The physician and ultrasound technician will look for the best place to access the umbilical artery-this is usually where the umbilical cord meets the placenta, since it is farthest from the baby. This is not always possible, so the physician will look for the best spot available. This may include a loop in the umbilical cord, the place where the umbilical cord enters the fetus, or the hepatic vein (inside the fetal body)
*The entire procedure is done under ultrasound guidance
*Once the insertion site has been determined, the mother's abdomen will be sterilized with betadeine
*She will then be injected with a topical anesthetic at the insertion site
*The physician will then insert a special needle into the mother's abdomen, through the uterus and into the umbilical vein
**The needle is a 20 or 22-gauge needle (about the size used for drawing blood) and has a stylet inside of it
**Even though a topical anesthetic has been given, the mother will still feel some cramping when the needle passes through the uterus. Most women say this is the most painful part and compare it to a strong menstrual cramp.
*Once the needle has been inserted, the stylet will be removed and a syringe will be attached to the needle
**The syringe will have a drug in it (heparin) to help with blood clots
*A blood sample will then be taken to see if the baby is anemic. If that test (hematocrit) shows anemia, the procedure will continue.
**Hematocrit allows us to determine whether or not fetal blood cells are being destroyed due to Rh incompatibility.
*The baby will be given a neuromuscular blocking agent. This is to keep the baby from moving during the procedure.
*The blood transfusion will then be given to the baby
*The needle will then be removed and the physician will use ultrasound to check for fetal well-being
*The entire procedure will take less than ten minutes
*This procedure can reverse potentially detrimental conditions in a fetus. The overall survival rate for babies who have had a blood transfusion in utero is 84.7%. For babies without hydrops, the survival rate is 91.1%.
*If necessary, the procedure will be repeated at 2-to-3-week intervals until 34-35 weeks of gestation.
Discharge Instructions
*If the mother is Rh negative, RhoGam needs to be administered within 72 hours.
*After the test, avoid any strenuous activity for 24 hours. This includes standing for long periods of time, lifting, and exercising. A woman may return to work if her job doesn't require physical activity.
*No sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or use of tampons for 72 hours.
*Some minor cramping after the procedure is normal. If the cramps become severe, call a doctor. Also, call a doctor if leakage of clear fluid (amniotic fluid) or blood from the vagina, fever, unusual fetal activity, or any other unusual feelings occur.
*A few days after the test, a mother should return for a follow-up ultrasound just to check on the baby. Also, serial ultrasounds are recommended to check for signs of hydrops.

==Risks==
*If the placenta is located closer to the abdominal wall than the fetus is, the needle will pass through the placenta. This can cause maternal-fetal blood mixing.
**RhoGAM will be given to the mother to prevent problems
*1-2% risk for pregnancy loss (this is above the 3-5% background risk)
*Infection (chorioamnionitis) is another risk. Less common risks include blood clots in the umbilical cord, excessive bleeding (mother or baby), decreased fetal heart rate, and placental abruption. The overall risk of any of these things happening is between 1-6.7%, depending on the experience of the physician.
*Loss rates are higher in fetuses who have genetic conditions, structural anomalies, or IUGR. Maternal complications are uncommon.

==Other Testing Options==
*Amniocentesis
**By using amnio, we can look at the amount of bilirubin in the amniotic fluid. This pigment is an indicator of hemolysis and can tell us if the baby is anemic. Also, we can measure the levels of DOD450 to tell if the fetus is anemic.
**This is accurate during the third trimester, but not accurate in the second trimester.
**This can diagnose anemia, but cannot treat it

==Discuss Patient's Feelings About the Procedure==
*Emphasize the fact that this is entirely her choice

==Provide Resources==

==Assess Understanding and Elicit Questions==

==Notes==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Phenylketonuria (PKU)'''

==Introduction/Contracting==
*What is your understanding about why you are here?
*When were you first told about the abnormal test?
*Do you have any specific questions or concerns?
*Outline the visit
**We will be taking a family history
**We will discuss the genetic basis of PKU
**The medical geneticist will obtain some medical history and discuss medical management
**The dietitian will also be visiting with you to discuss the specifics about diet

==Family history==
*Get basic 3 generation pedigree
*Ask about mental retardation, pregnancy losses, birth defects, learning difficulties, chronic health problems, children that died young, and PKU specifically
Basic Info to review with family
*PKU is one of the disorders that is part of the newborn screening for in every state using a heel prick to get a blood sample
*PKU can be successfully treated to prevent symptoms by maintaining a strict diet
*There can be serious effects if the diet is not maintained especially during childhood
*Mental retardation
*Microcephaly
*Delayed speech
*Seizures
*Eczema
*Behavioral abnormalities
*This is a diet that should be maintained throughout life.
*The goal is to maintain phe levels below 6 mg/dl during childhood(some metabolic geneticists prefer to keep them below 5 mg/dl)
*It is especially important that a woman with PKU maintain the diet before and during a pregnancy because high phe can harm the development of the baby.
*Phe is an essential amino acid and is one of the building blocks of protein
*When a baby has an excess amount of phe there are a couple of potential explanations as follows:
**Phenyalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency -- (most common cause, 98% of the time this is explanation)
*(show diagram) This liver enzyme usually converts phenylalanine to another amino acid tyrosine
*Sometimes the gene that tells the body how to make the PAH is changed and so it doesn't work as well or doesn't work at all
*When this happens the path can be blocked and some by products will build up and cause the effects that can be seen in patients that are not on a well controlled diet
**Inability to make or recycle a cofactor that is required to help PAH do its job.
*This is rare and is found in about 2% of those with high phe.
*HOWEVER it can't be ruled out completely until results of the test for this come back which will indicate if this is the explanation.
*Because this cofactor also helps out in other important reactions in our bodies this can often be more severe sometimes referred to as atypical PKU

==Details for Reference==
*tetrahydrobiopterine (BH4), the cofactor in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylation reactions.
*Defects in BH4 synthesis result from guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) deficiency or 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterine synthase (PTPS) deficiency.
*Impaired recycling of BH4 is caused by deficient dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) or deficient pterin-4a carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD).
*All of the HPAs caused by BH4 deficiency are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
*They account for approximately 2% of patients with HPA. BH4 is also involved in catecholamine and serotonin biosynthesis.
*The typical (severe) forms of GTPCH, PTPS, and DHPR deficiencies have the following variable, but common, symptoms:
**mental retardation
**Convulsions
**disturbance of tone and posture
**drowsiness
**irritability
**abnormal movements
**recurrent hyperthermia without infections
**hypersalivation
**swallowing difficulties
**Microcephaly is common in PTPS and DHPR deficiencies
*Plasma phenylalanine levels can vary
*Mild forms of BH4 deficiency have no clinical signs
*PCD deficiency, sometimes referred to as &quot;primapterinuria&quot; is associated with benign transient hyperphenylalaninemia.
*Treatment requires the normalization of blood phe concentration and restoration of the BH4-dependent hydroxylation of tyrosine and tryptophan by BH4 supplementation or by dietary modification, neurotransmitter precursor replacement therapy, and supplements of folic acid in DHPR deficiency

==Three category classification==
(when due to altered PAH) based on levels of phe when untreated
*Classic PKU
**due to a complete or near-complete deficiency of PAH activity
**plasma phe concentrations above 20 mg/dl in the untreated state
**must be treated by diet or brain damage will develop
*Non-PKU Hyperphenylalinemia (also referred to as benign hyperphenylalinemia)
**characterized by plasma phe concentrations consistently above normal when the patient is on a normal diet, but not high enough to cause impaired cognitive development
**does not need to be treated by diet
*Variant PKU (intermediate levels and requires some treatment)
**intermediate levels between PKU and benign hyperphenylalinemia
**many metabolic geneticists choose to treat these patients with a modified diet that may not be as restrictive as for those with classical PKU

==Inheritance==
(regardless of whether it is due to PAH gene or to a problem with the cofactor BH4, it is inherited in an AR fashion)
*Autosomal means that the gene for PAH is on a chromosome other than the sex chromosomes
*Recessive means that for a person to have clinical symptoms they must have inherited two copies of the altered gene one from each parent
*We assume that you and your partner (husband) are carriers and don't have symptoms because you each have one functional copy
*Two carriers have a one in four (or 25%) chance for each pregnancy that the baby will have PKU (draw out AR inheritance) and a 50 % chance of having a child that is a carrier just like the parents, a 25% chance of having a child with both functional copies

==Prevalence==
*one in 15,000 live births in Caucasian populations and in Utah (carrier frequency in this population is approximately one in sixty)
*Most literature still quotes one in 10,000 live births in Caucasian and East Asian pop. (one in 60 carrier rate)
*Highly variable among populations
:*Turks one in 2600
:*Irish one in 4500
:*Japanese population one in 143,000
:*Finn and Ashkenazi Jewish populations one in 200,000

==Psychosocial considerations==
*It can feel overwhelming to get a diagnosis and so much information
*Reassure that we don't expect them to remember everything and that is why we'll be sending out a letter that will explain much of what we discuss
*It is common for parents not to even know the test was done or what it means initially
*Concerns about their ability to carry out the diet restrictions
*Scared of the unknown
*Provide information about the PKU picnic and potential to meet other families and see how children with PKU who are on diet since birth don't look or act any different than other children
*Reassure them that it is possible to manage, but don't give the impression that it is super easy because it does take some special planning, time and effort
*Reassure that we all carry genes that don't function properly, but we don't always know what they are unless we happen to find a partner that has one of the same altered genes (estimates are 4-6)
*Explain that we are here to help them and they can call the dietician (Sharon) about diet questions or concerns and us about questions concerning the genetics of PKU
Molecular Genetic Testing
*used primarily for genetic counseling purposes to determine carrier status of at-risk relatives and for prenatal testing
*Over 380 different disease-causing mutations have been identified in the PAH gene
*Molecular diagnosis for these mutations is possible but is only available on a limited clinical basis in the US and Canada
*Mutations are identified and confirmed by DNA analysis using various methods
*When mutation analysis is not available or disease-causing mutations are not identified in a family, linkage analysis can be considered for couples who have a child affected with PAH deficiency
*No other phenotypes are known to be associated with mutations in the PAH gene

==Determination of carrier status==
*Molecular testing used to be offered only to at-risk family members with a positive history
*Now molecular testing can be offered to unrelated spouses and detects carriers with a rate of 98%
*Not recommended for population screening to detect carriers
*Three methods can be used
**analysis of the plasma phe concentration and phe/tyr ratio (this test must take into account circadian variation and variations in a woman's menstrual cycle; it is not accurate during pregnancy.) When these variations are taken into account there is a 0.01 probability or less of heterozygote misclassification
**DNA analysis if the disease-causing PAH mutation in the family is known
**Linkage analysis with markers in the PAH gene

==Prenatal Testing==
*Prenatal testing (once the genotype of the proband has been established) is possible for fetuses at 25% risk for PAH deficiency by amnio and CVS
*Has also been done with linkage studies

==Addenda==
THE REST OF THE OUTLINE IS ONLY IF QUESTIONS ARISE, but much of it will be talked about by other members of the team

==Symptoms/prognosis==
*Each person with PKU is affected differently and at varying levels of severity
*Appear to have some other factors that may modify the phenotype (modifier genes and definitely environment)
*Variations in severity correlate somewhat with the type of over 500 mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene located at chromosomal locus 12q22-q24
*If diet is adhered to intelligence is usually in normal range, but still tends to be slightly lower than expected based on sibling and parent IQ's, but it mostly tends to correlate with levels of phe that are maintained and age at which treatment begun
*Untreated patients often have:
**abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs)
**seizures
**neurologic disorders
**a musty odor
**varying degrees of mental retardation
*Other possible symptoms include:
**increased occurrences of eczema
**tremor in the hands and eyelids
**memory problems
**raised levels of anxiety and depression
**social disorders, i.e. agoraphobia
**decreased motor functions, i.e. hand-eye coordination
**on average, a loss of one IQ point per year off diet
*Behavior problems of untreated or late-treated patients with PKU include:
**Hyperactivity
**aggressiveness
**negative moods
**motor and attention disturbances
**self-inflicted injury

==Screening==
*carried out in every state in the US and in many other countries with a heel-prick blood test
*screening started in the mid-1960's however this could be earlier or later depending on which state and hospital
*Utah statewide screening for PKU began in 1965 and galactosemia screening was added in 1979
*PKU detected in virtually 100% of cases
*Used to be done with Guthrie test that detected the presence of high phe by whether or not bacteria that were auxotrophic for phe would grow
*Utah uses the Delphia method which is a fluormetric assay and is semi-quantitative
*Mass spectrometry is now being used by some states (better accuracy and less false positives then Guthrie test)
*In the US there are several hundred babies diagnosed and put on diet each year
*An initial positive test does not necessarily mean that the child will have PKU
*A false positive elevated phe concentration (hyperphenylalaninemia) may result from:
**a blood spot that is too thick (when using Guthrie test)
**a sample that is improperly prepared
**combinations of the following: liver immaturity, protein overload (in newborns who are fed cow's milk), and heterozygosity for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.
*A second screening will be performed if the first is failed
*If the second test is positive, than further quantitative testing will be performed to confirm the levels of phe
*After hyperphe has been established, further tests must be done to distinguish those infants with PAH deficiency from the ~2% of infants with hyperphenylalaninemia who have impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis or recycling)
*After diagnosis, the infant is treated without delay

==Diet for PKU==
*Medical management is a low phe diet maintained throughout life
*Just the right amount of phe is required because some is necessary for the body to make proteins
*Adults with PKU who were not diagnosed at birth and have suffered irreversible brain damage can still benefit significantly from being placed on a phenylalanine-restricted diet (improved behavior noted)
*not a typical vegetarian or vegan diet
*protein replaced by low phe formula, usually taken in powdered form mixed with water
*excludes all meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, legumes chickpeas), nuts and seeds
*diet includes starchy foods, fruits, vegetables, special low-protein products, and foods that contain no protein
*starchy foods in the PKU diet contribute enough phenylanine
*diet sweeteners such as Nutrasweet®, Sweetmate®, Canderal®, or aspartame® are made from phenylalanine and aspartic acid and should be avoided
*diet must be carefully monitored so that growth and nutritional status are unaffected and deficiency of phenylalanine or tyrosine is not created.
*must be adjusted for growth, illness, activity, etc.

==Treatment in infancy and childhood==
*A phe-restricted diet and a phe-free medical formula must be started as soon as possible after birth under the direction of a nutritionist
*Intake of tyrosine and total amino acids must be monitored
*Consumption of phe-free formula should be spread out evenly over the 24 hours of the day to minimize fluctuations in blood amino acid concentrations
*avoid long periods of low blood phe concentration, which is also harmful to brain development
*blood phe concentration should be monitored periodically to evaluate control
*Recommendations for monitoring may vary, but levels should be maintained below 6 mg/dl according to NIH consensus
*Levels are usually taken weekly or bi-weekly in infancy and less frequently as a child gets older

==Treatment in adolescence and adulthood==
*Recommendations for treatment of adolescents and adults vary
*In general, support for &quot;diet therapy for life&quot; is increasing
*Adults who have abandoned the phe-restricted diet tend to have a reduced attention span, slow information processing abilities, and slow motor reaction time
*They also develop changes in the frequency distribution of brain electrical activity, increased muscle tone and tremor, lowered bone mineral content and mental health disorders
*Controversy remains over the plasma phe concentration to be achieved for patients older than 12 years of age
*General consensus is that the closer the phe concentration is to the recommended normal value, the better is the individual's general state of well being

==Treatment for patients with levels below that of classical PKU==
*Patients with non-PKU HPA who have plasma phe concentrations consistently below (10mg/dl) have been shown to not be at higher risk of developing intellectual, neurological, and neuropsychological impairment than individuals without PAH deficiency
*Some specialists believe that dietary treatment is unnecessary for the individuals in this class
*However, others debate the advisability of non-treatment and will treat if level is above 5-6mg/dl

==Maternal PKU risks==
*fetus can be severely damaged in the womb before birth by the effects of the mother's high PHE levels
*Blood PHE levels of a pregnant woman transferred at a 1:3 ratio to fetus
*very possible to have normal, healthy children if the mother follows the low-phenylalanine diet strictly before conception and throughout the pregnancy
*women with PAH deficiency who are planning a pregnancy should start a phe-restricted diet prior to conception and should maintain plasma phe concentrations between 2 to 6mg/dl (ideally over several months) before attempting conception, but the exact preferred level depends on the clinic. (At the U of U Nichola prefers that they are kept between 2-4 mg/dl)
*after conception, they should be offered continuous nutritional guidance and weekly or bi-weekly measurement of plasma phe concentration because dietary phe and protein requirements change considerably during pregnancy
*the likelihood that the fetus will have congenital heart disease, intrauterine and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, and mental retardation depends upon the severity of the maternal HPA and the effectiveness of her dietary restriction
*Potential consequences to the fetus if diet is not maintained
**mental retardation
*slowness in learning ability and growth
*affect on short term memory
*low birth size
*microcephaly
*congenital heart disease

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pituitary Tumor'''

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge prior contact and receipt of family history information
*Assess the most important concerns since there are so many issues at hand
*Discuss family plans (timing, size, etc.) and how those plans may be influenced by what is learned today

==Intake and Family History==
*Review family history information and personal health information already obtained
*Use pedigree to make the review easier
*Specifically ask about cancer in the family
*Ask about pituitary tumor
**When was it diagnosed? How? By whom?
**What symptoms was she having?
**Did she receive any treatment beside the drug mentioned?
**Was surgery or radiation therapy ever discussed?
**Has her physician discussed recurrence risks with her?

==What is the Pituitary Gland?==
*The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland located in the center of the brain just above the back of the nose
*The pituitary gland makes hormones that affect the growth and functions of other glands in the body; therefore it is sometimes called the &quot;master gland&quot;
*Some hormones produced by the pituitary include: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Growth Hormone, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Luteinizing and Follicle Stimulating Hormones, Vasopressin, and others
*When there is an abnormality of the pituitary gland, it often produces either too much or too little of one or a combination of hormones. This can result in a variety of hormonal problems that can affect the whole body.
*Enlargement of the gland can also cause visual disturbances and/or impairment

==Pituitary Tumors==
*Pituitary tumors or adenomas are almost always benign which means that they grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body
*Pituitary tumors are rare.
*Some may be &quot;silent&quot; lesions that are incidentally found at autopsy
*The manifestations of a pituitary tumor depend on the hormones secreted by the tumor and the pattern of growth
*Some hormonally active tumors are those that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, or growth-hormone
*Hormonally-inactive adenomas are often larger and may exhibit invasive properties. Thus, the likelihood for blindness is greater in patients with this tumor type
*Pituitary tumors are seen in one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. MEN type I is well recognized, dominantly inherited, and comprises tumors of the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary. Eighty percent of patients have involvement of 2 or more glands, and pituitary tumors occur in 54% to 80% of patients with MEN I.
*MRI most readily determines the presence of a pituitary tumor, although it may also be established by CT (computer tomography) scan.
*Many patients experience visual loss. Headaches occur in about 20%.

==Treatment==
*Treatment depends upon the type of tumor and if it extends into the brain around the pituitary.
*Hormone-secreting tumors may be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Drug therapy with bromocriptine has been used with success in patients with prolactin-secreting tumors.
*Lesions that extend beyond the confines of the pituitary often require radiation therapy and surgery

==Risk for==
*I could not find a population rate for pituitary tumors, only that they are &quot;very rare&quot;
*sister was probably treated with bromocriptine which was used in the past for lactation cessation and is currently used to treat prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors
*Her tumor was likely small at the start, and she has responded well to treatment thus far
*Even if sister has a recurrence of the tumor, it will not affect the risk that this couple would have a child with a pituitary tumor

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polycystic Kidney Disease'''

==Introduction==
*Greet the family/parent
*What do you understand about why you are here in genetics today?
*What questions or concerns do you want to have addressed today?

==Elicit Medical History==
(interim history form)
*update medical history since last seen
*determine if there have been any problems since released from the hospital
*assess developmental history

==Update Family History==
*Update pedigree
*determine if there are any other family members with kidney problems, heart problems, liver problems or that died in early infancy

==What is Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)?==
*Two main types
**Autosomal Dominant PKD (adult PKD)
**Autosomal Recessive PKD (infantile PKD)

==ADPKD==
*Etiology and Natural History
**gene PKD1 mutated in about 85% of cases
**gene PKD2 mutated in about 15% of cases
symptoms usually develop beginning in early adulthood although can be found in the infant period or not begin until later in adulthood
**large amount of variability both within and between families
*Prevalence and Inheritance
**most common single gene disorder that is potentially lethal
**prevalence at birth: 1/400 - 1/1000
**10% of cases due to new mutation
**occurs in all races
**inherited in autosomal dominant fashion
***if one parent is affected there is a 50% chance of having an affected child
*Symptoms
**multiple bilateral renal cysts (100% of cases)
***leads to end stage renal insufficiency by 60 years old in 50% of cases
**cysts in other organs specifically the liver (20% by 3rd decade; 75% by 6th decade)
**intracranial aneurysms (10% of cases)
***more common in patients with family history of intracranial aneurysms (22%) than those without this history (6%)
**mitral valve prolapse and other heart defects
*Diagnosis
**patients with known 50% risk
***at least 2 cysts either unilateral or bilateral by 30years of age
***large kidneys without cysts in infants and children
**patients with no known risk
***bilateral renal enlargements and cysts
***in absence of indication for different renal cystic disease
***suggestive of ADPKD, but not definite diagnosis
**Differential from:
***ARPKD - unaffected parents
***Glomerulocystic kidney disease - minimal tubular involvement
*Molecular Testing
**Linkage analysis - need a large number of family members to establish which gene is responsible
**Prenatal Testing - only available after a mutation has been identified in an affected family member
*Management
**no treatment for disease itself
**treat symptoms to prevent premature death and alleviate pain

==ARPKD==
*Etiology and Natural History
**mutation in PKHD1 locus (6p21) present in all studied patients with ARPKD
**enlarged echogenic kidneys found in perinatal period
**large amount of variability both within and between families
**30% of patients with ARPKD die in neonatal period
*Prevalence and Inheritance
**prevalence: 1/20,000 - 1/40,000
**prevalence may be underestimated due to death in neonatal period
**carrier frequency: 1/70
**inherited in autosomal recessive fashion
***if both parents are carriers there is a 25% chance of having a child who is affected , 50% chance of having a child who is a carrier, and a 25% chance of having
*Symptoms
**enlarged, echogenic kidneys with poor differentiation (100% of cases)
***renal function impaired in 70-80% of cases
**hypertension
***usually occurs within first week of life
**Liver disease (45% of cases at presentation)
**pulmonary hypoplasia resulting from oligohydramnios
**other abnormalities: low set ears, micrognathia, flattended nose, growth deficiency
*Diagnosis
**enlarged echogenic kidneys with poor differentiation
**one or more of the following:
***absence of renal cysts in parents
***signs of hepatic fibrosis
***pathoanatomical proof of ARPKD in affected sibling
***parental consanguinity suggesting AR inheritance
**Differential from:
***ADPKD - more likely to have bilateral macrocysts
***Glomerulocystic kidney disease - minimal tubular involvement
*Molecular Testing
**Linkage analysis - based on accurate diagnosis of ARPKD in affected individual and accurate understanding of relationships in family
**Prenatal Testing - only available after a linkage has been identified in an affected family member
*Management
**no treatment for disease itself
**treat symptoms to prevent premature death and alleviate pain
***stabilize respiratory function
**feeding difficulty and growth failure in chidren

==Psychosocial Issues==
*uncertainty of diagnosis and prognosis may lead to anxiety
*possibity that parent could find out they have the diease (for ADPKD)
*guilt over passing trait to child
*Concern for risks to future pregnancies
*Are you interested in pursuing linkage analysis?
*How are you dealing with your son's health problems?
*Are you anxious about the possibility of upcoming surgeries?
*Reassure that this could not have been prevented

==Recommended Follow-up for PKD==
*renal ultrasounds to monitor cysts and function
*control of hypertension
*CT scan to detect aneurysm (ADPKD)
*monitor liver function

==Resources==
*PKD foundation (www.pkdcure.com)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polydactyly and Syndactyly'''



==Medical and Family History==
*Medical history
**How/when did they diagnose the polydactyly/syndactyly?
**Is it bilateral?
**Has she had X-rays or other imaging? Is this scheduled?
**Pregnancy history - teratogen exposures, illness, womb anomalies
**Birth history - any complications?
**Hearing screen? Responses to sound?
*Family history
**Polydactyly/syndactyly? Other limb anomalies?
**Cleft lip or palate?
**Learning difficulties? Mental retardation?
**Heart defects? Kidney abnormalities?
**Skeletal abnormalities? Short stature? Other birth defects?

==Overview of Hand/Foot Abnormalities==
**Presence of more than normal number of fingers or toes
**Can vary from rudimentary finger or toe to fully developed extra digits
*Syndactyly
**Webbing or fusing of two or more fingers or toes
**Varies from incomplete webbing of skin of two digits to complete untion of digits or fusion of bones and nails
**Fusion can be connected by shared skin, bones, nerves, vessels, or nails
*Polysyndactyly is presence of extra digits that are fused
*Fetal development of digits
**Limbs arise from small limb buds
***Upper limb bud appears 26-27 days after fertilization, lower limb bud 28-30 days
***Consists of mesenchymal core covered by epithelial tissue
**Apical ectodermal ridge (AER) forms along anteroposterior surface
***Longitudinal growth of limb with pattern forming proximodistally and anteroposteriorly
***Homeobox genes and morphogen (possibly retinoic acid) provide information for cell growth and division
**Separation of digits occurs due to programmed cell death in interdigital zones
*Anything that disrupts patterning or programmed cell death can result in limb defect

==Syndactylies==
*Most are malformations except when associated with amniotic bands
*Can be classified based on anatomic criteria
**Syndactyly type I
***Cutaneous syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4 or toes 2 and 3
***Can be bilateral in hands (50%) and feet (66%)
***Syndactyly of toes is four times more common than fingers
***Can be inherited as autosomal dominant trait
***About twice as common in males than in females
**Syndactyly type II (synpolydactyly)
***Syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4 or toes 4 and 5 with partial or complete duplication of digit
***Can be variable, hand anomalies can be severe including clinodactyly
***Extra digit may have fused, forked, or broad metacarpals and metatarsals, complete or partial duplications or digit
***Incidence is uncertain, some autosomal dominant forms have been reported
**Syndactyly type III
***Variable cutaneous or osseous syndactyly of fingers 3 to 5
***Syndactyly might be complete or partial, nails may be fused
***Condition is rare
**Syndactyly type IV (Haas type polysyndactyly)
***Complete cutaneous syndactyly of fingers and/or thumbs with a degree of polydactyly on radiography and a hypoplastic or triphalangeal thumb
***Hands often resemble &quot;mitten&quot; deformity
***Rarely seen as isolated defect, very rare with few families reported
**Syndactyly type V
***Metacarpal and metatarsal fusion associated with variable degrees of syndactyly
***Usually involves digits 4 and 5 but can be variable
***Can be variable involvement within families
***Autosomal dominant and X-linked recessive families have been described
***Rare - only 10 families reported
**Complete syndactyly
***Includes digits 2-5 and may include thumb also
***Usually seen with Apert syndrome (craniosynostosis)
**Cenani-Lenz syndrome
***Syndactyly involving all elements of all digits, often with fusion of radius and ulna or tibia and fibula
***Hands and feet often appear as mass of digits
***Autosomal recessive inheritance
**Preaxial syndactyly
***Failure of separation of preaxial digits of hands and feet
***Postaxial digits are relatively normal
***Lack of separation of thumb from finger 2 in hands, similar in feet
***Only reported in one family
**Symbrachydactyly
***Shortening of phalanges and other elements of digits in association with cutaneous syndactyly
***Usually seen unilaterally, middle phalanges tend to be more severely affected
***Incidence estimated to be 1/32,000

==Polydactylies==
*Usually manifest as extra digits or incomplete digits resulting in broad or bifid digit
*Postaxial polydactyly (80% of cases)
**Extra digit on ulnar or fibular side of limb
**Type A postaxial polydactyly
***Digit usually consists of three phalanges and nail
***Extra digit is relatively well formed but some or all of elements may be reduced
**Type B postaxial polydactyly
***Extra digit is represented by small conical projection or tag containing distal phalanx and nail on fifth digit
***10 times more common in African-Americans than Caucasians
***Unilateral in 2/3 of cases, affects left side twice as commonly as right
***Autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance
*Preaxial polydactyly
**Preaxial polydactyly type I
***Complete or partial duplication of a normal biphalangeal thumb
***Varies from extra phalanx to complete hypoplastic thumb
***May cause broadening of distal phalanx to triphalangeal thumb
***More common in males, most often unilateral, usually not familial
***Part of many malformation syndromes
**Preaxial polydactyly type II (triphalangeal thumb)
***Opposable thumb with three phalanges
***Estimated incidence is 1/25,000
***Usually sporadic, associated with prenatal hydantoin and thalidomide exposure, can be autosomal dominant
**Preaxial polydactyly type III (polydactyly of an index finger)
***Duplication of the index finger with or without an additional biphalangeal or triphalangeal thumb
***Can be autosomal dominant or associated with genetic syndromes
**Preaxial polydactyly type IV (polysyndactyly)
***Duplication of preaxial digits associated with syndactyly of the extra rays
***May see broadening of thumbs or six or seven toes
***Autosomal dominant with complete penetrance
***Sporadic cases occur in 1/10,000 births
**Mirror hands and feet
***Polydactyly of hand or foot with appearance of mirror duplication around midline axis of arm or leg in absence of recognizable thumb or great toe
***Very rare with a few autosomal dominant cases but usually sporadic

==Treatment/Management Options==
*Diagnosed by external observation, X-ray, or ultrasound
*Polydactyly
**Can be corrected surgically to improve appearance and functioning
**Usually done at 1 year of age so skeletal development is complete and accurate anatomic assessment can be done
**May require reconstruction of any associated abnormalities in remaining digit
**Cast and soft dressing may be used until healed
*Syndactyly
**Treatment aimed at maintaining and improving function with cosmetic benefits
**Involves surgery and may require skin graft from groin area
**Surgery usually done after 1 year and may be delayed as late as 18-24 months

      <text xml:space="preserve">Body language is, more generally, not specific to [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship|Courtship]]. Improvements needed to this module:
* '''Expanded scope''' - not only gender neutrality, but the meanings of body language outside the limited idea of courtship/dating.
* '''Verifiability''' - this module appears to contain some speculations, and it is necessary to have a way to check them. A good way to start establishing this would be to create links to Wikipedia articles.

The how-to in this module might to too passive. Sometimes it suggests to let the other person do something, when you could do it. For example, in the current version, instead of letting the other person observe your rapport, ''you'' could observe the rapport of the other person. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:02, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

==Elicit History==
*Construct pedigree:
**Abnormal # miscarriages, stillbirths, infant deaths?
**Previous children with chromosome abnormality, Down syndrome, birth defects, mental retardation?
**Consanguinity? Ethnicity? Other concerns/risk factors?

==What is Prader-Willi Syndrome?==
*A complex, multi-system mental retardation disorder
*The first recognized microdeletion syndrome identified when high-resolution chromosome analysis was introduced
*Now known to be one of the most common microdeletion syndromes
*Also one of the most common recognized genetic forms of obesity
*Caused by several different genetic alterations of proximal chromosome 15q

==Etiology &amp; Incidence==
*History
**Prader-Willi syndrome was first described in 1956.
*The basis of Prader-Willi syndrome
**Caused by the lack of expression of normally active paternally inherited genes at chromosome 15q11-q13
**The maternally inherited genes are normally inactive due to genetic imprinting
***Imprinting is a phenomenon by which some genes are modified in different ways depending on the genederof the parent from whom they were inherited
**There are 3 ways in which P-W syndrome can be caused.
***Small deletion in the paternally contributed chromosome 15
****This is seen in 75% of patients
****Usually the deletion is 4-Mb or smaller
***Uniparental disomy 15 (UPD)
****Inheritance of 2 maternal chromomes 15 but no paternal chromosome 15
***Defect in the imprinting process
****Seen in approximately 1% of patients
****Very small deletion or other abnormality in the imprinting center
****All studied families in which there has been a recurrence of P-W have had an imprinting mutation.
**The actual genes whose deficiency that cause the phenotype have not yet been identified
**One-third of patients with P-W exhibit hypopigmentation due to deletion of a gene associated with tyrosinase-positive albinism
*Incidence
**1 in 10,000 - 15,000
**Occurs in both sexes and all races
**Diagnosis is often delayed or missed in many cases

==Clinical Features &amp; Natural History==
*Neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive
**Hypotonia is prenatal in onset and nearly uniformly present
**Causes decreased fetal movement, frequent abnormal fetal position, and difficulty at time of delivery
**State of hypoarousal are associated with poor suck and lack of awakening to feed
**Hypotonia gradually improves
**Motor milestones are delayed
***Average age of sitting is 12 months
***Average age of walking is 24 months
**It is recommended that all newborns with persistent hypotonia be tested for P-W
*Developmental delay and mild cognitive impairment
**Language development is delayed
***Speech is often poorly articulated, having a nasal and/or slurred character
**Most patients are mildly retarded
***Mean IQ 60s to low 70s
**Approximately 40% have borderline retardation or low normal intelligence
**20% have moderate retardation
*Characteristic facial appearance
**Narrow bifrontal diameter
**Almond-shaped palpebral fissures
**Narrow nasal bridge
**Downturned mouth with a thin upper lip
*Early-childhood-onset obesity
**Hyperphagia begins generally between ages 2 and 4 leading to significant obesity
**Hypothalamic abnormality results in lack of satiety
**There is a decreased caloric requirement likely related to hypotonia and decreased activity
**Food seeking behaior with hoarding or faraging for food and stealing food or money to buy food are common
**High threshold for vomiting may complicate binging on spoiled food
**The obesity is central in distribution, with relative sparing of the distal extremities
**Obesity is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in P-W syndrome
*Hypogonadism with genital hypoplasia
**Hypogonadism is prenatal in onset and persists throughout life
**Genital hypoplasia is evident at birth
**Pubertal development is abnormal
**In both males and females, sexual activity is uncommon and fertility is rare
*Mild short stature
**If not apparent in childhood, it is almost always present by the second half of the second decade
**Average height is 155cm for males and 148cm for females
**African-Americans tend to be taller
*Characteristic behavior profile
**Becomes evident in early childhood
**Tempor tantrums, stubbornness, controlling and manipulative behavior
**Obsessive-compulsive characteristics
**Difficulty with change in routing
**Lying, stealing, and aggressive behavior
**True psychosis is evident in young adulthood in approximately 5-10%
*Sleep disturbances
**Excessive daytime sleepiness and oxygen desaturation in REM sleep
**These are common even in the absence of obesity

==Inheritance==
*P-W is caused by a lack of expression of the paternally derived PWS/AS region of chromosome 15q11-q13 by one of several genetic mechanisms
*Deletion of PWS/AS region
**70% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**&lt;1% risk to siblings of an affected proband
**Most of these cases are de novo deletions
**A small number of cases are due to translocation with a concomitant deltion
**If a parent has a balanced chromosomal translocation the recurrence risk could be as high as 25%
*Uniparental disomy
**25% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**&lt;1% risk to siblings of an affected proband
*Imprinting defect
**&lt;5% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**The risk to siblings of an affected proband is up to 50%
**A healthy parent can carry this imprinting defect
**But recurrence risk may be lower because imprinting defects can be de novo mutations
*Balanced chromosome translocation within 15q11-q13 or abnormality
**&lt;1% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**All of these cases have been de novo
**Risk to siblings of an affected proband is &lt;1%
**If a familial case is detected, the theoretical risk of inheritance of the balanced translocation could be as high as 25%

==Diagnosis==
*Genetic testing
**Molecular Genetic Testing
***Testing for the parent-specific methylation imprint detects over 99% of cases and is highly specific
***Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis in all children
***The methylation abnormality can be determined by southern blot hybridization using a methylation-sensitive probe (SNRPN or PW71B) or with parent-specific PCR primers
***If the methylation pattern is characteristic of maternal inheritance only, then the diagnosis is confirmed
***DNA methylation testing detects all cases caused by deletions, UPD, and imprinting defects
***Once the diagnosis is established, further tests are done to classify the mutation
****Deletions can be detected using FISH analysis
****UPD can be detected with informative microsatellite markers
****An imprinting defect is presumed to be present in patients with an abnormality in the parent-specific methylation imprint without evidence of a deletion or UPD
**Cytogenetic Analysis
***1% of patients have a detected chromosomal rearrangement resulting in a deletion of bands 15q11-q13
***Deletion can be detected using high resolution chromosome studies at the 650 band level and FISH.
*Clinical diagnosis
**Consensus diagnostic criteria were developed in 1993
**Major Criteria
***Neonatal and infantile hypotonia with poor suck
***Feeding problems and/or FTT in infancy

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spina Bifida'''

==Quote Risks==
*Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect.

==Level II Ultrasound==
*At 18-20 weeks, a high resolution, targeted ultrasound examination can be done to carefully and specifically examine the baby's spine.
*This is noninvasive and may provide reassurance but cannot be used as a diagnostic tool.
**If no evidence of a NTD is seen, it cannot be guaranteed that the baby does not have a NTD.

==Amniocentesis==
*If the triple screen results indicate an increased risk for a NTD, one may choose to have an amniocentesis, which is a more invasive, but more diagnostic test.
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*What can it tell me?
**Amnio can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus.
***Chromosome abnormalities
***NTDs (Spina Bifida)
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Amnio cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation.
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from amnio.
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**The first few cc's of fluid will be discarded because they probably contain contamination from your cells.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
**There is a small possibility of lab error or lack of cell growth
***In this case, the procedure would have to be done again.
*What will it feel like?
**If an anesthetic is used, you may not feel the needle enter the skin, but you will still feel it enter the uterus.
**This is described as a sharp pain, like a menstrual cramp that usually lasts a few seconds.
**You may also feel some cramping after the procedure.
**You should avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours after the procedure.
**Call your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal pain or cramps, vaginal bleeding, leakage of clear fluid from the vagina, fever, or anything else unusual.
***Approximately 2% of women experience light bleeding or spotting.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)'''

==Introduction==
*Discuss the reason for referral.
*Elicit prior knowledge about CVS.
*Elicit knowledge about AMA or other indications for session.
*Assess concerns and set goals for the session.
*Provide overview of topics for counseling session.

==Client &amp; Partner Information==
*Discuss why it's important to get pregnancy, personal, and family history.
*Go over pregnancy history:
**G?P?
**LMP? EDC?
**Infertility?
**Exposures?
**Medical complications?
**How has the pregnancy been going?
*Personal background:
**Occupation?
**Religion?
**Ethnicity?
**Chronic illness?
**Partner exposure?

==Elicit Family History==
*Construct pedigree:
**Abnormal # miscarriages, stillbirths, infant deaths?
**Previous children with chromosome abnormality, NTD, Down syndrome, birth defects, mental retardation?
**Consanguinity?
**Other concerns/risk factors?

==What is AMA?==
*Woman is age 35 &amp; above at expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, risks of birth defects increase.
*Women do not make new eggs like males make sperm.
*They are born will all the eggs they will have in their life and these eggs mature with age.
*There are procedures that can be done to assess the risk, but there are also risks associated with the procedures.
*The age of 35 is the &quot;magic&quot; number because this is when the risk of the procedure is justified.
*The background risk for major birth defects for women of all ages is 3-5%.

==Explain Chromosome Abnormalities==
*Explain cells, chromosome, and DNA
*Show karyotypes
*Explain nondisjunction
*Show abnormal karyotypes (trisomy 13, 18, 21, sex chromosome anomalies)
*Give a general description of the clinical features and prognoses.
**Trisomy 18 &amp; 13 are most severe with most affected dying before the age of 1 year
**Trisomy 21 is more mild; characteristic physical features and mild to moderate MR
**Turner and Kleinfelter's syndromes are sex chromosome anomalies. Also usually mild.

==Quote Risks==
*Show charts to figure risk of chromosome abnormalities.
*Give age-specific risks:
**Age at CVS: ____________
**Down syndrome: 1 in _______ ( %)
**Any CA: 1 in ________ ( %)

==Discuss the option of CVS==
*What is it?
**CVS is short for chorionic villus sampling
**The chorionic villi are wisps of fetal tissue or finger-like projections that attach the pregnancy sac to the uterine wall
**CVS is the technique in which this sample of placental tissue is obtained
**The technique has been around for approximately 15 years although methods have changed over time
**It is unique because it is used to diagnose certain birth defects in the 1st trimester of pregnancy rather than later in the pregnancy like amniocentesis
***It is usually performed at 10-12 weeks gestation
*What can it tell me?
**CVS can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus
***General chromosome abnormalities
***Specific genetic disorders that have been previously identified
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**CVS cannot detect neural tube defects such as spina bifida
***For this reason, it may be useful to measure the amount of AFP in the maternal serum at 15-18 weeks gestation
***Also, follow-up with US at 18-20 weeks is recommended
**It cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from CVS
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figures of CVS
**Transcervical CVS:
***Done at 10-12 weeks gestation
***A speculum is inserted and the vagina and cervix are cleaned with betadeine
***Some physicians apply a tenaculum to the lip of the cervix which can be painful
***Using US to guide, a thin tube is guided into the placenta
***Gentle suction is applied to the tube to remove the villi
***This method is easiest to perform when the placenta is posterior and close to the cervix
***A larger sample is taken as compared to transvaginal CVS
***Discomfort is often minimal, perhaps similar to a pap smear
***Post-procedure bleeding occurs in up to 10% of patients
**Transabdominal CVS:
***Done at 10 weeks gestation or later
***The abdomen is cleansed with betadeine
***A local anesthetic injection may be given
***Using US to guide, a spinal needed is inserted through the abdomen into the uterine wall and into the placenta
***The needle is moved back and forth several times through the placenta
***Suction is used to remove the villi sample
***This method is easiest when the placenta is anterior or away from the cervix
***This method is better for women with a retroverted uterus
***A smaller sample (pieces of villi) is taken as compared to transcervical CVS
***The procedure is usually more uncomfortable than the transcervical method
***Bleeding after the procedure is rare
**CVS takes approximately 5-7 minutes (not including prep time)
**The baby's heartbeat is monitored by US
**The collected sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue and not maternal tissue was collected
**If maternal cells were collected, the CVS will be repeated
**The sample is sent to the lab
**Results are available in approximately 10 days
*What will it feel like?
**There may be some discomfort when the needle enters the skin and the uterus or when the catheter enters the cervix and placenta
**Some say that they feel pressure during the procedure
**You may experience a small amount of bleeding after CVS
*What are the risks?
**The background rate of pregnancy loss at 10-12 weeks is 2-3%
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 1/100 (1%) in women with a normal uterus
***Reinforce that 99% of women will have a healthy baby
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 5/100 (5%) in women with a retroverted uterus using transcervical CVS
**Some studies indicate an increased risk for limb defects when CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation
***When performed at 10-12 weeks, most recent studies do not report an increased risk because limbs have already formed at this point
***The risk is approximately 1/3000 (0.0003%)
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the CVS procedure
**There is a low risk of uterine infection
**Exercise or strenuous activity is to be avoided for 24 hours after the procedure
**Sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or tampon use are to be avoided for 72 hours after CVS procedure
**CVS is not recommended for women with the following:
***Cervical polyps, overly curved sampling pathway, active genital herpes (for trans-cer)
***Interceding bowel, placenta too far from abdomen surface (for trans-abd)
***Active vaginal bleeding or bleeding disorder
**You should notify your doctor if any of the following occur:
***Fever greater than 100.4 F
***Heavy bleeding or cramping
***Amniotic fluid leakage
*Why should I choose CVS?
**CVS can be done earlier than amniocentesis (10-12 weeks versus 15-18 weeks)
**It may reduce a couples emotional stress if at risk for abnormality
**The procedure allows for termination at an earlier age
***This is before the pregnancy is visible
***Also before fetal movement is felt
**Allows for treatment of fetus affected with 21-hydroxylase deficiency
*Why might I not want to choose CVS?
**There is a higher risk for pregnancy loss as compared to amniocentesis
***1% for CVS versus 0.5% for amnio
**CVS does not detect NTDs
**CVS is less commonly done as compared to amnio
**With CVS, there is a greater likelihood of needing further invasive testing due to:
***Laboratory failure
***Insufficient sample
***Maternal cell contamination
****Seen in approximately 1.9% of cases
***Mosaic or ambiguous results
****There are 2 or more cell types that are different genetically
****Seen in 1-2% of CVS cases

==Elicit Interim Medical History==

==Definition==
*Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a disorder caused by the inheritance of a paternally derived deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 and is characterized by abnormalities in physical and mental development.

==Historical significance==
*First recognized microdeletion syndrome identified with high-resolution chromosome analysis
*Most common recognized genetic form of obesity
*First recognized human genomic imprinting disorder
*First recognized disorder resulting from uniparental disomy

==Etiology==
*Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 at q11-q13 (~75% of cases)
**Detectable by high-resolution chromosome analysis or FISH with specific probes
**Paternally derived chromosome has been deleted (maternal genes are inactive due to genomic imprinting)
*Maternal disomy- receiving 2 copies of the maternal 15th chromosome and no paternal copies of the 15th chromosome (~24% of cases)
*Clinical differences exist between deletion patients and those with maternal disomy. Maternal disomy patients are less likely to have typical facial characteristics, slightly higher IQs and milder behavior problems.*
*A defect in the imprinting process occurs due to problems associated with the imprinting center, such as a mutation or deletion resulting in the biparental inheritance and a maternal-only pattern (1% of cases)
*In all cases where there has been a recurrence of Prader-Willi syndrome, there has been an imprinting mutation.

==Molecular Genetics==
*The actual genes that cause the phenotypic changes have not been identified.
*Several imprinted and nonimprinted genes have been found to exist in the deletion region (called the PWS/AS critical region).
*A deletion in the nonimprinted P gene, which codes for tyrosinase-positive albinism, is associated with hypopigmentation seen in 33% of patients with PWS.
*The SNRPN is the best described gene likely to cause some of the PWS features
**This ribosome-associated protein functions by controlling gene splicing and may therefore be involved in the control of the synthesis of some proteins
**SNRPN is known to be imprinted in the brain
*SNURF is upstream of SNRPN is a putative imprinting control element for the critical region
*Very small deletions in this gene have been identified in a few cases
*Many other genes have been identified from the critical region, but the function of these genes has yet to be elucidated

==Associated Risks==
*Patients with PWS usually have an unremarkable family history
*PWS that is caused by a deletion has a recurrence risk of 1% or less.
*Uniparental disomy is caused by nondisjunction thus the recurrence risk is 1% or less
*When counseling patients with a detected imprinting mutation, a recurrence risk of up to 50% pertains because the mutation is likely dominant and occurred in the paternal grandmother's germ line.

==Incidence==
*Approximately 1: 10,000-15,000 live births
*Both sexes and all races are affected
*The majority of affected individuals are the only family member affected

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*These criteria were developed before the availability of diagnostic testing and are still valuable in suggesting diagnosis and the need for a diagnostic test.
*Major criteria (1 point each)
**Infantile central hypotonia
**Infantile feeding problems and failure to thrive
**Characteristic facial appearance
**Early-childhood-onset of obesity (2-3 years of age)
**Hypogonadism with genital hypoplasia
**Developmental delay and mild cognitive impairment
**Mild short stature
**Characteristic behavior disorder
*Minor Criteria (1/2 point each)
**Decreased movement and infantile lethargy
**Typical behavior problems
**Sleep apnea
**Short stature
**Hypopigmentation
**Small hands and feet for height and age
**Esotropia, myopia
**Thick, viscous saliva
**Speech articulation defects
**Skin picking
*Supportive criteria (no points)
**High pain threshold
**Decreased vomiting
**Temperature control problems
**Scoliosis
**Early adrenarche
**Osteoporosis
*In children under 3 with 5 points (at least 3 from major criteria) or those above 3 with 8 points (at least 4 from major criteria) a diagnosis should be suspected

==Clinical Features==
*Hypotonia
**Prenatal in onset and present in nearly 100% of cases
**Causes decreased fetal movement and abnormal fetal position
**The fetus is often breeched in position at the time of delivery, thus delivery is often via a caesarian section.
**The infant usually has a poor suck reflex and fails to awake to feed leading, in many cases, to failure to thrive
**Infantile lethargy and a weak cry are also associated with hypotonia
**Motor milestones are delayed and average age of sitting is ~12 months and walking at 24 months
**Hypotonia results in a decrease in lean body mass leading to a high ratio of fat to lean body mass in children.
**Hypotonia gradually improves, although the adult with PWS remains mildly hypotonic with decreased muscle tone and bulk
**All newborns with persistant hypotonia are suggested to have PWS testing.
*Developmental delay and intelligence
**Motor milestones are delayed in 90-100% of cases (see above)
**Language development is also delayed
***Verbal skills are a strength in most patients but..
***Speech is often poorly articulated, nasal and slurred.
**Cognitive abnormalities are present and most patients are mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of 60s-low 70s
**~40% have borderline MR or low normal intelligence
**~20% have moderate MR
**Academic performance is poor for cognitive ability
**Strengths are in reading, long-term memory, and visual-spatial skills
**Weaknesses are in math, sequential processing, and short-term memory
**Patients often have an unusual skill with jigsaw puzzles and word-find puzzles.
*Hypogonadism
**Prenatal in onset and persists throughout life
**At birth it is evident by genital hypoplasia
**Cryptorchidism is present in 90-100% of male patients
**Sexual activity is uncommon in both sexes and fertility is rare (one case reported)
*Early-childhood-onset of obesity
**Significant obesity is not found in young infants
**Onset is usually triggered by hyperphagia between 1-6 years of age, but can occur as early as 6 months
**Hyperphagia is due to a hypothalamic abnormality resulting from lack of satiety
**There is a decreased caloric requirement, related to hypotonia and associated decreased activity
**Food-seeking behavior with hoarding and foraging of food is often common in patients with PWS
**Patients often eat unappealing substances such as garbage, frozen food and pet food
**Patients have decreased vomiting activity
**The obesity is central in location
***Abdomen
***Buttocks
***Thighs
**Obesity is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in PWS and longevity can be nearly normal if obesity is avoided.
**Obesity results in complications such as:
***Cardiopulmonary compromise
***Diabetes mellitus type II
***Hypertension
***Chronic leg edema
***Sleep apnea
*Characteristic Facial Features that are present at birth or appear over time for MOST patients:
**Narrow bi-frontal diameter
**Almond-shaped palpebral fissures
**Narrow nasal bridge
**Down-turned mouth with a thin upper lip
*Other characteristic physical findings
**Small narrow hands with a straight ulnar border
**Short broad feet, present by age 10 *African Americans are less likely to have small hands and feet*
**Shoulders are usually sloping
**Hypopigmentation manifests as fairer skin, hair, and eye color and occurs in about 1/3 of patients
**Scoliosis and/or kyphosis are common (about 40-80% of cases)
**Short stature is almost always present by the 2nd half of the 2nd decade for 90-95% of patients due to lack of pubertal growth spurt
**Strabismus is found in 60-70% of cases
*Behavior profile is present in 70-90% of cases
**A characteristic profile becomes evident in early childhood, with temper tantrums, stubbornness, controlling and manipulating behavior, OCD, and difficulty with change in routine
**Lying, stealing, and aggressive behavior are also common.
**These behavioral problems interfere with the quality of life for adults
*Others:
**Thick viscous saliva
***Predispose to dental caries
***Can result in articulation problems
**High pain threshold
**Skin picking
**Sleep disturbances, especially daytime sleeping
**Osteoporosis, frequent but poorly studied

==Diagnostic Testing==
*Methylation analysis
**PCR test that can detect all three causes of PWS
**All three causes result in the genes for PWS being methylated
**Methylated DNA is cut differently by restriction enzymes than unmethylated DNA
**The differences in the sizes of DNA can be detected
**This test can be used for both prenatal and postnatal testing
*Chromosome analysis using the FISH probe for SNRPN
*High resolution chromosome analysis alone is insufficient due to false positives and false negatives
*Uniparental disomy can be identified using microsatellite repeat sequences from chromosome 15 in the patients and the parents; if none of the variants of these repeats that are present in the father are seen in the child, then all the genetic information from chromosome 15 has been maternally derived.
*The presence of a normal FISH test plus abnormal methylation analysis indicates a probable imprinting center error

==Management and Treatment Options==
Intervention and management of PWS can significantly impact the health, functional abilities, and life of patients.
*Infantile FTT-
**Special feeding techniques are required because breast feeding is usually inhibited by the hypotonia
*Short Stature-
**Growth hormone has been shown to increase height and muscle tone
**Good results have been shown for adolescents.
*Development and behavior-
**Closely monitor development and behavior in infancy and toddler-hood.
**Developmental assessments should be conducted on patients and they should have early intervention services as soon as possible.
**Educational intervention should occur throughout school years. Most children require special education classes, speech therapy, and physical/occupational therapies.
**It is important to apply specific and consistent limits at home and school. Most individuals require consistency in daily routines and should be prepared in advance for changes in routine or activities.
**Those with severe behavioral problems may respond to psychotherapy. Medication for treatment of psychiatric problems is often needed.
*Obesity-
**Avoidance of obesity is extremely important, yet very difficult to achieve.
**Close monitoring of weight percentiles and height to weight ratio is critical throughout life
**Those who are extremely obese should have an assessment of glycosylated hemoglobin levels
**Decrease caloric intake, to1000-1200 Kcal/day or less.
**Vitamins and calcium should be taken everyday (100% of daily recommended)
**Keeping food under lock and only keeping healthy low calorie food in the house is critical
**Involve teachers and employers of individuals with PWS in food monitoring
**Regular exercise is extremely important; a program should be initiated as early as possible.
*Hypotonia-
**Physical therapy is appropriate
**Evaluation of hypothyroidism if hypotonia is persistant
*Hypogonadism (endocrine)-
**Administration of hCG may stimulate testicular descent
**Administration of testosterone in males or estrogen in females to improve secondary sex characteristics
*Ophthalmologic-
**Exams to monitor strabismus, myopia and hyperopia
*Dental-
**Emphasis placed on good dental hygiene
**Products that increase saliva flow can be used as necessary
*Musculoskeletal-
**Scoliosis should be monitored and treated as in the general population
**Calcium and vitamin D levels should be assured
*Dermatologic-
**Examination of the skin should occur to monitor the presence of sores from skin picking
**Keep lesions moist and covered
**Behavior modification techniques may be necessary

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parents often must monitor children with PWS 24 hours a day to control symptoms such as obesity; this is draining for the parents.
*Fathers often struggle with guilt, blaming themselves for the occurrence of the syndrome.
*Important for counselors to ask how the parents are coping and how they are handling the situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Protein S Deficiency'''

(pregnancy loss)

==Introduction and contracting==
*Introduction
*What is your understanding about why you were referred for genetic counseling?
*Do you have any questions or concerns you would like to discuss?
*Address immediate concerns
*Explain that we will be taking a detailed pregnancy and family history
*Then we will answer your questions and talk a little more about protein S deficiency including how it is inherited and how it may increase the risk for pregnancy loss as well as other causes of multiple pregnancy losses

==Medical History==
*Who was referring physician
*How many pregnancies have you had?
*Confirm when the losses were and use EMPATHY
*Why do you believe you had the miscarriages?
*Sometimes women who have miscarriages are concerned that it might be due to something they did or did not do during the pregnancy
*What were you told you about the pregnancy losses?
*What types of testing did they do to find a reason for the miscarriages?
*Were you sick at all during the pregnancies?
*Did you drink, smoke or use drugs?
*Any medications during the pregnancies
*Did you take prenatal vitamins?
*Any concerns about anything you might have been exposed to during any of your pregnancies?
*Have you had any other chronic health problems except those due to the protein S deficiency?
*Could you describe how you first found out you had protein S deficiency
*Have you had any complications related to the protein S deficiency?

==Family History==
*Take a family history to see if there are any hereditary diseases that may run in your family that may or may not be related to your history of pregnancy losses
*Miscarriages in other family members
*Infertility
*Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects (heart defects, CL/CP, spina bifida)
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Anyone else with protein S deficiency
*Any other blood clotting problems in the family
*Sickle cell anemia
*Specifically ask about symptoms of blood clotting see below
*Consanguinity

==Psychosocial considerations and assessment==
*How are you handling the pregnancy losses?
*Have family members or friends been supportive?
*What do your plans for the future look like?
*Are you currently working outside the home?
*Are you in touch with a perinatal loss support group?
*Would you like to be in touch with a support group?
*Is your insurance covering the testing that has been performed?
*Are there any other concerns or questions?

==Protein S deficiency==

==What is protein S==
*A protein that is involved in stopping the blood clotting process
*(Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein)
*(Major function is as a cofactor to facilitate the action of activated protein C (APC) on its substrates, activated factor V (FVa), and activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) )
*(Normally forms a complx with protein C to inhibit coagulation)
*Not having enough protein S may lead to problems with blood clotting in the veins (venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism in the lungs, but does not appear to increase risk for arterial thrombosis)
*Also associated with increased risk for miscarriage (studies have focused mostly on miscarriages that occur in 2nd and 3rd trimesters)

==How does protein S deficiency occur (Inherited vs. Acquired)==
*Inherited risk factors
*Caused by mutation in one of the two copies of the genes that instruct the body on how to make protein S (located on chromosome 3 at locus 3p11.1-q11.2 near a protein S pseudogene)
*Discuss genes and AD inheritance
*Incomplete penetrance (some individuals with protein S deficiency remain completely healthy and assymptomatic and there are other risk factors that may also contribute to the blood clotting in some individuals)
*VTE develops in 60-80% of patients who are heterozygous for protein S deficiency. The remaining patients are asymptomatic, and some heterozygous individuals never develop VTE.
*Occasionally a person can inherit two mutated copies
*This results in purpura fulminans (characterized by small vessel thrombosis with cutaneous and subcutaneous necrosis, and it appears early in life, usually during the neonatal period or within the first year of life)
*Acquired risk factors for thrombophilia
*Age - 1 in 10,000 in young before age 40 and 1 in 1,000 in elderly
*Malignancy -Tumor cells increase coagulant activity and so do chemotherapy drugs
*Antiphospholipid antibodies - may be associated with lupus or other autoimmune disease and increases risk 9 fold
*Surgery or major trauma-without prophylactic treatment risk may be as high as 45-70% with total hip or knee replacement surgery and increased risk continues for several weeks
*Pregnancy -RR is 10 increases to 1 in 1,000 from 1 in 10,000
*HRT and oral contraceptives-- risk depends on estrogen content and type of progesterone some studies show 2-3 fold increase
*Acquired thrombophilia
*usually due to liver disease
*vitamin K
*systemic lupus erythematosus
*Protein S levels decrease in pregnancy and can fall into the abnormal-low laboratory range, but the low levels of protein S in pregnancy do not cause thrombosis by themselves

==Special Concerns During Pregnancy==
*Pregnancy can result in falsely low protein S assays, especially functional assays. In addition, pregnancy increases the risk of thrombosis in patients who are heterozygous for protein S deficiency
*A female patient who is on warfarin for prior thrombosis should not continue warfarin during pregnancy due to teratogenic effects
*Heparin should be started during pregnancy and for 4-6 weeks postpartum in patients with protein S deficiency
*One case control study suggested that fetuses with a prothrombotic risk factor may have an increased incidence of low birth weight, but only statistically significant when fetus carried multiple thrombotic risk factors or was homozygous for risk factors
*Women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, were more likely to have protein S deficiency than controls, but too small to assess strength of association
*Feb 2002 article in Seminars in Perinatology stated that not all studies have found association between inherited thrombophilias and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is limited by lack of well designed studies and therefore no clear evidence to determine when to test, whom to test, and what to test for

==Protein S deficiency and risk of miscarriage==
*French case control study of 232 instances of women experiencing stillbirth (&gt; 22 weeks gestation) and 464 controls (cases were referred patients which may add bias because 84% had more than one stillbirth)
*Independently protein S deficiency and factor V Leiden were correlated with stillbirth
*MTHFR mutation frequency alone was no greater
*However, with homozygosity for the MTHFR mutation plus an additional thrombophilic risk factor, and in the absence of supplementation with folic acid, the risk for stillbirth was 100% (28/28)
*This study also confirmed that those with the assessed risk factors and stillbirth virtually always showed maternal vascular markers when the placenta was thoroughly evaluated
*Study in Israel (May 2002) demonstrated among 40 women with unexplained intrauterine fetal death at &gt;27 wks matched with 80 healthy women demonstrated significantly higher rate of protein S deficiency than controls (OR 3.2, 2.4-4.1 CI) biased sample may not be representative of women of other ethnicities
*Prospective study in US of 145 patients with idiopathic pregnancy loss and 145 matched controls
*1 or greater thrombophilic defect in 66% of study group and 28% of controls
*21% of women with loss had combined thrombophilic defects compared to 5.5% controls
*late pregnancy wastage more common in women with thrombophilia

==Prevention?==
*Individuals with homozygosity for the MTHFR mutation and any other predisposing factor (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, the thrombophilic prothrombin mutation, factor V Leiden, or antiphospholipid antibodies), high dose folate supplementation beginning preconceptually may have a protective effect.
*Those who have had one or more stillbirths and are found to have a thrombophilic mutation (not including MTHFR homozygosity in isolation) heparin and low dose aspirin may be appropriate

==Testing for Protein S Deficiency==
*Absent /reduced protein S and normal total proteins in heterozygote
*Protein S antigen testing:
*Functional protein S:
*Assays for functional protein S are difficult to perform, indirect and are based on prolongation of blood clotting by the generation of APC and its function
*Several other factors can alter the interpretation of test results falsely low protein S functional assay value can be observed in patients with factor V Leiden genetic defect and some pregnant women

==Incidence of Protein S Deficiency==
*based on 9000 blood donors 1 in 700 had protein S deficiency
*unknown if deficiency varies by race, but thrombotic disease in general less frequent in Asians
*No clear difference in male to female ratio

==Associated symptoms==
*Symptoms related to protein S deficiency include those associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), thrombophlebitis, or pulmonary embolus.
*Venous thrombosis of the lower limbs: Lower limb swelling and discomfort are the usual symptoms. Occasionally, redness or discoloration also is present, with or without associated cellulitis.
*A family history of thrombosis is an important finding, which suggests inherited thrombophilia.
*Thrombosis at an early age (e.g., usually &lt;40 y) or recurrent thrombosis also is indicative of an inherited thrombophilic state (e.g., protein S deficiency).
*Deep vein thrombosis
*The most common manifestation is venous thrombosis of the lower extremities (accounts for approximately 90% of all events)
*Superficial veins that are thrombosed usually appear distended, firm, and noncompressible (cords), with or without associated redness or pain.
*Superficial thrombophlebitis can be observed in some cases, with or without DVT
*Classic presentation of DVT is a triad of calf pain, edema, and pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (less than a third of DVT cases exhibit these 3 findings)
*Physicians observe unilateral leg or calf swelling with mild or moderate pain more often, which suggests DVT
*Rarely, calf discomfort without swelling is the only sign of DVT
*The differential diagnosis of DVT includes muscle strains and tears, passive swelling of a paralyzed or immobilized limb, Baker cyst, cellulitis, knee trauma or derangement, lymphatic obstruction, and the postphlebitic syndrome
*Pulmonary embolism
*Some patients may have associated or isolated pulmonary embolism and may experience dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or cardiac palpitations
*Classic pleuritic chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis suggests an embolism with pleural involvement
*Acute right-sided heart failure occurs rarely and is associated with massive embolus
*Findings of right ventricular dysfunction include bulging neck veins, a left parasternal lift, and an accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound.
*These findings in the chest also are not specific for pulmonary embolism.

==Early Pregnancy Loss==
*establishing pregnancy is more difficult than many people realize
*clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in ~15% of pregnancies
*40-60% of all conceptions may be lost, but most of these (3/4) are estimated to be lost before it is recognized clinically
*most miscarriages occur between 6-8 weeks and expulsion between 10-12 weeks
*after 3 consecutive clinical abortions the empiric risk of aborting next pregnancy is 20-55%

==Late Pregnancy Loss==
*seem to be associated with thrombophilia

==Possible causes of pregnancy losses==
*chromosomal abnormalities (most common 70% of first trimester loss)
**balanced translocation carrier (2.7-4.8% of couples with recurrent losses)
**trisomies and other chromosomal anomalies
*Hormonal causes
**Inadequate luteal phase
**Deficient progesterone
*Endometrial factors (endometrial protein expression)
*Uterine abnormalities
**septate uterus
**bicornate uterus
**uterine myomas or fibroids
**DES exposure in utero
*Environmental exposures
**Alcohol (women who drink 2X's week had sig. higher SA than other women but drinkers also tend to smoke also - possible confounding?)
**tobacco ( if ½ pack a day or greater and appears to be dose dependent)
**very heavy caffeine intake (moderate intake is not associated with SA)
**chemical solvent exposure in either sex may increase risk
*Immune Causes
**autoimmune problems -- estimated to be cause of multiple SA's in up to 30% of women (woman makes antibodies that will attack her own proteins and those that she has in common with the fetus)
o anticardiolipin antibodies -- type of a group of antiphospholipid antibodies that may be associated with miscarriage
o circulating antibodies to cardiolipin and/or inappropriate coagulation parameters, plus poor reproductive outcome, SLE, or spontaneous thrombosis (the antibodies can react with phospholipids that are required for coagulation)
o SLE - an autoimmune disease thought to be related to SA's (Antichromatin IgG is useful in diagnosing SLE antinuclear antibody testing can indicate many at risk for SLE or some other autoimmune diseases)
**alloimmune causes -- (response to tissues from another individual of the same species)
*Diabetes (controlled or unsuspected is not thought to cause SA)
*Infection
**chlamydia trachomatous causes acute and chronic infection of the endometrium which could interfere with implantation (more chlamydia antibodies in women with recurrent SA's but not all studies confirmed this)
**Mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum (controversy over importance in losses)
**CMV but suggests this is rare and causation not proven
**Herpes simplex virus (importance in SA's debated)
**HIV does not increase rates of loss in asymptomatic women
*Psychological factors-two studies showed significant reduction in SA among women who have 3 or more SA's when undergoing counseling once per week during pregnancy

==Contracting==
*What were you told about why you were referred to Genetics?
*What did they tell you about the results of the chromosome studies?
*What are your main concerns? Do you have any questions?
*Overview of session

==Intake==
*Follow intake questions
**What doctors are they seeing?
**Has she had any surgeries, or is she scheduled for any?
**What have they been told about the Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephalus?
**What have they been told about her heart defect?
**Has anyone talked with them about what to expect in the future?
*Updates to family history?
**Ask again about mental retardation, learning problems, birth defects
**Ask again about miscarriages and stillbirths in family

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Chromosomes are instruction books for bodies - genes located all along chromosomes
*One copy of each from mother, one from father

==Explanation of Chromosomes==
*Show her karyotype to parents and point out rearrangement
*This is what we call a reciprocal translocation
*Parts of two different chromosomes break off and redistributed to different chromosomes
*Her chromosomes look a little bit different than what we would expect
**This happens to about 1 in 500 people
**We don't know why this happens sometimes
**This is not something that we can change or fix
**Nothing that anyone did or didn't do caused this to happen - it is a random event

==What Does this Mean==
*We don't really know right now - but there are some ways that we can try to find out
*It looks like the translocation is balanced
**All of the genetic material is still there, it is just rearranged (show yellow and pink chromosomes)
**Most of the time, this does not cause a problem so it would not explain why was born with Dandy-Walker malformation and a heart problem
**Remember that there are genes along the length of the chromosomes?
***There are spaces between those genes
***If the chromosomes broke in those spaces, it should not have disrupted any genes and all of the body functions should still work
***We would expect a child with a balanced reciprocal translocation to be healthy
***This would mean that her health complications are caused by something other than the translocation
**BUT . . .
***If one or both of the chromosomes broke in the middle of a gene, or if a small piece of one of the chromosomes is missing, that could cause problems (5%)
***Unfortunately, we can't look any closer at her chromosomes right now, so we can't tell if this is the case
***If a gene is interrupted or a piece is missing, this COULD explain her problems
**To help us determine whether the translocation is balanced or not, we need to look at BOTH of her parents chromosomes

==Importance of Looking at Parent's Chromosomes==
*If you both have normal chromosomes:
**The balanced translocation is something new
**If might explain the Dandy-Walker malformation and heart defect
*If one of you has the same balanced translocation as_____
**We know that you both do NOT have Dandy-Walker malformation or a heart defect
**Because you both don't have any health complications, we know that all of the genetic information is there - nothing is missing or interrupted
**This means that her problems may have another cause

==What Does this Mean for her's Future?==
*At this point, it is hard to say
*Once we know more about parents chromosomes, we will have a better idea about what caused the Dandy-Walker malformation and heart defect
**If the translocation does appear to be the cause of the problems, we still may not be able to predict what will happen to her in the future
***As mentioned before, we can't always look close enough at the chromosomes to know exactly what genes might not be working right
***We can be sure that her gets the care that she needs, including tests to rule out any possible problems and physical, occupational, speech therapies if needed
**If the translocation is not the cause of the problems, we may be able to identify another cause
**Either way, the important thing is that her gets the medical care that she needs

==Reproductive Risks of a Balanced Reciprocal Translocation==
*As we have already talked about, a balanced reciprocal translocation usually does not cause any physical differences
*Does have impact on reproduction
*Four possible outcomes for any pregnancy:
**A child with normal chromosomes
***Would expect child to be healthy
***They cannot pass on the translocation to their children
**A child that is a balanced translocation carrier
***If the parents are healthy, we would expect the child to be too
***Child would have same four possible outcomes for a pregnancy as we are discussing now
**A child with an unbalanced translocation causing a physical or mental handicap
***Unbalanced translocation means that there is extra or missing chromosomal material
***Could lead to physical differences, medical problems like heart defects, etc.
**An unbalanced translocation that leads to miscarriage or stillbirth
***Usually if the piece that is extra or missing is large (contains a lot of chromosomal material)
***There are too many changes in genetic material to allow a conception to grow
*Some people with balanced translocations have problems with infertility

==Risk Assessment==
*The exact risk assessment depends on where the chromosome breaks
*Overall, there is 5-30% risk to have child born with physical or mental handicaps (general population is 3-5%)
*There is a 20-30% risk for miscarriage (general population 15%)

==Reproductive Options for Balanced Translocation Carrier==
*Just be aware of risks
*Prenatal testing - amniocentesis or CVS
*Adoption
*Sperm or egg donor
*PGD or IVF

==Psychosocial==
*How do you feel about what we talked about?
*Do you have any new concerns?
*Give patient literature about translocations
*Feelings of guilt or blame if either parent is translocation carrier
*Frustration over inability to offer an explanation right now
*Fear, worry, anxiety about the future

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Renal Cell Carcinoma'''

==Introduction==
*Renal (comprising most kidney) cancer is usually sporadic or randomly occurring
*Some individuals with renal cancer have a genetic predisposition to developing cancer and we call these hereditary cancers
*There are a couple of things that sometimes make us wonder if a cancer is due to an inherited genetic predisposition. One of these is early age of onset of cancer.
*______ was diagnosed at a young age (most individuals with renal carcinoma are diagnosed in their 40's-60's)
*Two most common types of renal carcinomas
*Most common is clear cell renal carcinomas (comprise 80% of sporadic cases and are the type seen in Von Hippel Lindau, which rules this genetic cancer syndrome out)
*Second most common is papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCCs) I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING DETAILS ONLY THOSE STARRED
**generally accepted that it has a better prognosis than other types of renal cancer
**appears to be sporadic in majority of cases
**accounts for about 5-10% of sporadic renal cell carcinoma and is seen in Hereditary Papillary Renal Carcinomas (HPRC)
**estimated that male to female ratio for PRCC is between 5:1 and 8:1 (however when 9 families were studied they found 28:12 (2.33:1 ratio)
**Sporadic PRCC are usually solitary tumors (but multiple papillary adenomas were described in surrounding renal parenchyma in some cases)
**In one study all 29 patients from the 6 families with HPRC studied had multiple bilateral tumors
**Suggestion to subdivide PRCC into type 1 and type 2 tumors
**Those with family history and those with met mutation share features of type 1, but not all individuals with tumors characteristic of type 1 had an identified met mutation
**Trisomy 7 characteristic of sporadic and hereditary papillary renal carcinomas (shown in 95% of PRCCs)
**Also characterized by trisomy or tetrasomy 17, and trisomy 16, 20, and 12 and loss of Y in males
**Suggested that those with tri or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to papillary adenomas and more complex karyotypic changes are papillary carcinomas

==Review genes and chromosomes==
*In order to understand the difference between hereditary and sporadic cancer it can be helpful to review some genetic information because it is not something most people think about all the time.
*Some genes help control when cells divide and how fast they divide.
*Essentially there are genes that act like the breaks of a car and there are genes that function like the gas pedal to accelerate cell growth and division.
*If these genes are changed it can sometimes cause a cell to keep dividing and dividing and develop into cancer.

==HPRC==
*Recently described form of hereditary cancer
*Genetic predisposition to develop multiple tumors in both kidneys (bilateral, multifocal)
*Median age of onset is 45, but ranges from 18-79 with most between 35 and 55 years old
*Explain AD inheritance with reduced penetrance
*Associated with (germline) mutation of a gene present in all of the cells of affected family members
*gene is called MET and is found at 7q31
*the gene is involved with regulating cell division
*this gene is called a proto-oncogene which just means that when it has a change or a mutation in the gene, it can cause cell division to become accelerated (it is kind of like pressing down harder on the gas pedal and not releasing the it so the car can stop)
*met mutations have also been found in 13% of tumors of PRC patients without a family history but all but one had bilateral disease and may be ascertainment bias
*half had somatic mutation and half were shown to have germline mutation so rate of met mutation in true sporadic mutations may be 7% or even lower due to bias
*In those with germline mutation it is possible that these are de novo mutations or may be possible that family members are not picked up because in known families, tumors not always detected until intense radiologic screening is done
*Germline mutation screening for met does not appear to be clinically indicated in patients with PRCC without additional evidence for genetic predisposition, which includes positive family history, unusual age at onset, bilateral disease (Mary Liebert 2001 found in Genetic Testing)
*Tumors are predominantly PRCs in HPRC but also breast, pancreas, lung, skin and stomach have been described in some of these families

==Management in those with HPRC==
*Use of partial nephrectomy due to risk of tumor in other kidney
*Those at high risk might benefit from earlier and aggressive site-specific surveillance

==Differential Causes==
*1;X translocations
**may have prominent papillary architecture
**may seem to be widely metastatic and poor prognosis
**TFE3 gene identified at breakpoint
*Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)
**Described in large Finnish family
**Along with PRCs, uterine leiomyomas, skin leiomyomas, breast cancers, and bladder cancers also found
**Mapped to 1q42-q44

==Facts about renal cell carcinoma==
*accounts for about 3% of adult malignancies and 90-95% of neoplasms in the kidney
*more common in individuals of Northern European descent but incidence increasing most rapidly in African Americans
*twice as common in men
*lack of early warning signs
*25-30% are asymptomatic

==Symptoms and presentation==
*hematuria (40%)
*flank pain (40%)
*palpable mass in the flank or abdomen (25%)
*weight loss (33%)
*fever (20%)
*hypertension (20%)
*hypercalcemia (5%)
*night sweats
*malaise
*variocele, usually left sided, due to obstruction of the testicular vein (2% of males)
*cytokine release by tumor frequently causes paraneoplastic conditions

==metastasis==
*lung 75%
*soft tissues 36%
*bone 20%
*liver 18%
*cutaneous sites 8%
*CNS 8%

==Risk factors==
*Smoking doubles risk and contributes to as many as 1/3 of cases
*Obesity also seems to increase risk especially in women
*Risk increased also with
**Abuse of phenacetin-containing analgesics
**Acquired cystic kidney disease
**Renal dialysis
**Renal transplantation

==MET function==
*proto-oncogene that encodes met receptor (receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor)
*triggers autophosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MET, activating a signal cascade

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Retinoblastoma'''

==What is Retinoblastoma?==
*a rare, malignant tumor of the retina (nerve-rich, light-sensitive layer that enables us to see) of one or both eyes that occurs in children, usually before 3 years of age

==Incidence==
*affects 1 in every 15,000 to 20,000 live births
*represents about 2% of all childhood malignancies
*approximately 350 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year
*affects both sexes in all races

==Types of Retinoblastoma==
*Unilateral - when the tumors are present in one eye
**50-70% of cases
**mean age of diagnosis is 24 months
*Bilateral - when the tumors occur in both eyes
**30-50% of cases
**mean age of diagnosis is 15 months
*&quot;Trilateral&quot; - the occurrence of bilateral RB plus a pinealoma
*Unifocal - when a single RB tumor is present
*Multifocal - when more than one tumor is present in one eye

==Mode of Inheritance==
*90% of patients have no family history of retinoblastoma
*most cases arise spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadic)
*20% of cases are transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait
*patients heterozygous for a cancer-predisposing mutation in one RB1 allele are said to have a germline mutation &amp; have a hereditary predisposition to RB
*a combo. of clinical presentation, family history, and mutation analysis is used to determine if a proband has a germline (heritable) mutation or 2 somatic mutations
*occurs in cells that have cancer-predisposing mutations in both copies of the gene
**&quot;Two hit model&quot; - if a child inherits a gene predisposing it to get Retinoblastoma, a second event must take place to change the other gene, causing Retinoblastoma to occur. The nature of the 2nd event is unknown, but research is trying to determine which factors can precipitate the onset of this disorder.

==Risks to family members==
*Parents of a proband -
**Cytogenetically detectable chromosome 13 deletion or rearrangement. Recommendation: Parental cytogenetic studies to determine if either parent carries a balanced chromosome translocation or rearrangement
**Positive family history (i.e., the parent had retinoblastoma or a close relative of one parent had retinoblastoma). Conclusion: The parent has an RB1 cancer-predisposing germline mutation
**Negative family history. Recommendation: Examination of apparently unaffected parents by an ophthalmologist knowledgeable about retinoblastoma, retinoma, and retinoblastoma-associated eye lesions. If such a lesion is detected, the parent has an RB1 cancer-predisposing germline mutation
**Presence of a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation. Recommendation: Molecular genetic testing of a blood sample of both parents.
***If a germline mutation is identified in either parent, the parent is at risk of developing non-ocular second primary tumors and is at-risk to transmit the mutation to other offspring.
***If a germline RB1 mutation is not identified in either parent, two possibilities exist: 1) the index case has a de novo RB1 germline mutation (90-94% chance); or 2) one parent has mosaicism (which includes the germline) for the RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation (6-10% chance).
***Mosaicism for an RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation. Recommendation: Molecular genetic testing of the parents is not necessary.
*Sibs of a proband - The risk to sibs of an index case depends on the genetic status of the parents of the index case.
**If a parent is determined to have a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation either by positive family history, by an eye examination that reveals a retinoblastoma-associated eye lesion, or by molecular genetic testing that reveals the presence of a cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation, the risk to each sib of the index case is 50% (or lower if the carrier parent is a mutational mosaic) of inheriting the cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation. Given the approximately 99% penetrance of most RB1 cancer-predisposing mutations, the actual risk for retinoblastoma in these individuals is about 50% (or lower if the carrier parent is a mutational mosaic). (Note: In rare families with &quot;familial-low penetrance retinoblastoma,&quot; the risk of tumor development is less than 40%)
**If neither parent has the cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation that was identified in the index case, germline mosaicism in one parent is possible and the risk to each sib of having retinoblastoma is 3-5%
**If the index case has mosaicism for an RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation, it is assumed that the mutation arose as a post-zygotic event and that neither parent has an RB1 germline mutation. The risk to the sibs is not increased.
**If molecular genetic testing is not available or is uninformative, empiric risks based on tumor presentation (i.e., unifocal or multifocal) and family history can be used. The low, but not negligible, risk to sibs of an index case with a negative family history presumably reflects the presence of either a germline RB1 mutation with reduced penetrance in one parent or somatic mosaicism (that includes the germline) for an RB1 mutation in one parent.
*Offspring of a proband -
**If the index case has sporadic bilateral RB, a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation has to be assumed and the risk to each offspring is close to 50%.
**If the index case has had sporadic unilateral multifocal RB, recurrence risk for offspring is lower. (Note: In rare families with &quot;familial-low penetrance retinoblastoma,&quot; the risk of tumor development is less than 40%).
**The low (~1%), but not negligible, risk to the offspring of index cases with unifocal disease and a negative family history reflects the possibility of a germline RB1 mutation with low penetrance or mutational mosaicism.

==Chromosome location==
*chromosome 13q14
*cytogenetic analysis (600-650 bands for at least 30 metaphases) detects deletions or rearrangements in approx. 5% of patients with unilateral RB and 7.5% of patients with bilateral RB -may also result in DD and facial dysmorphism
*with a normal cytogenetic study? 10% of cases have a positive family history and unilateral or bilateral RB; 30% of cases have a negative family history and multifocal RB; 60% of cases have a negative family history and unifocal RB
*mosaic aberrations are present in about 1% of patients

==Molecular genetics==
*gene RB1
*Normal gene product: The RB1 gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is involved in cell cycle regulation (G1 to S transition). The RB-protein is phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) system prior to the entry into S-phase. Upon phosphorylation, the binding activity of the pocket domain is lost, resulting in the release of cellular proteins
*80% of patients have a point mutation in the coding regions of RB1 gene; 15% have a partial deletion in the RB1 gene; 5% are unknown (mo mutation found)
*recessive oncogene - gene that appears to prevent retinoblastoma
*Two kinds of oncogenes - can cause cancer either by their presence or their absence. Both are mutants/incomplete versions of ordinary genes that normally regulate cell growth. One is dominant and causes out-of-control cell growth (cancer). The other kind is recessive and normally limits or stops the growth of cells. When they are lost, cells can proliferate wildly, causing cancer.

==Penetrance==
*incomplete (90%; including all bilateral cases and about 15% of unilateral cases)
**up to 10% of gene carriers will not develop the tumor but may pass on the gene

==Signs/Symptoms==
*leukocoria (white pupil reflex or &quot;cat's eye reflex&quot;) - distinctive white mass in the pupil area behind the lens
*strabismus
*eye may become red and painful
*unusual: glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyeball), orbital cellulites, uveitis, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage
*some retinal tumors (retinocytoma, retinoma) may undergo spontaneous growth arrest, leading to retinal lesions and scars

==Testing:==
*Diagnostic -
**clinical ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus of the eye with dilated pupils
tumors appear as gray-yellow elevations on the retina (&quot;tumor seeds&quot; - the beginnings of tumors may be visible in the vitreous body of the eye)
**imaging studies may be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor
****ultrasound, CAT scan, or MRI may detect calcifications in the tumors
**probes may be used to identify newborns with a genetic predisposition in order to diagnose earlier
*Molecular - used in patients with RB with normal cytogenetic studies for risk prediction in relatives
**mutation analysis of RB1 gene in white blood cell DNA and tumor cells
**40% of patients have an abnormal RB1 gene
**can detect a germline mutation in 80% of the patients with hereditary RB
**Testing available at several labs, including [http://www.retinoblastomasolutions.org/ Retinoblastoma Solutions], University of Pennsylvania, Vermont, etc.
**detection depends on whether the tumor is unifocal or multifocal, whether the family history is positive or negative, and the sensitivity of the methodology
**if a germline mutation is identified in the proband, RB1mutation analysis can be used to determine the status of at-risk siblings and offspring
**indirect testing using linkage analysis (microsatellite markers) can be used in some families
**Prenatal - RB1 mutations can be detected in utero through CVS or amnio if the RB1 mutation is known or if linkage was informative
*Screening - ASCO classifies RB as a Group 1 disorder (genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members). Therefore, asymptomatic at-risk children are tested for early identification to improve diagnostic certainty and also to reduce the need for costly screening procedures in those members who have not inherited the mutation.

==Treatment==
*9 of 10 children are treated successfully (goal is preservation of sight and life)
*enucleation - excision of the tumor and the eye, removal of some of the optic nerve
**bilateral? more involved eye is removed, other treated in another way
*photocoagulation
*cryotherapy
*radiation
*systemic chemotherapy
*follow-up ophthalmological exams every 3 months
*radiologic surveys for bony metastases
*studies of spinal fluid &amp; bone marrow for malignant cells

==Future prognosis==
*early diagnosis and treatment can reduce morbidity and increase longevity
*patients with hereditary RB are at an increased risk of developing other (non-ocular) tumors, including pinealomas in the brain which are usually fatal
*may be at risk of developing osteosarcoma (rare form of bone cancer) - same gene involved in both disorders, soft tissue sarcomas, or melanomas

==Differential diagnosis==
*sporadic congenital disorders such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous &amp; Coat's disease
*hereditary disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, Norrie disease, incontinentia pigmenti, and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy
*ocular infestation by Toxocara canis

==Contracting==
*What were you told about why you were referred to genetics?
*What would you like to learn today?
*Do you have any questions that you would like us to be sure to address?

==Intake and Family History==
*Development during first 6-18 months (should be normal)?
*Recent development - will see rapid regression in language and motor skills?
*Loss of purposeful hand use? Repetitive hand movement?
*Screaming fits and inconsolable crying (18-24 months)?
*Autistic features?
*Apnea or hyperpnea?
*Tremors and acquired miccrocephaly?
*Seizures?

==Etiology==
*Progressive neurological disorder characterized by normal birth and normal psychomotor development until 6-18 months when see rapid regression
**Affects girls
**Diagnosis based on clinical or molecular basis
*X-linked dominant inheritance
**About 99.5% of cases are sporadic
***Result from de novo mutation or from one parent who has somatic or germline mosaicism
***Mother may have favorable skewed X-inactivation that results in her being unaffected or only slightly affected
**Risks to siblings depends on status of parents
***When mother of affected has MECP2 mutation, risk to inherit mutation is 50%
***If mutation is not identified in parents, risk to low but germline mosaicism cannot be excluded
***Healthy sisters of girl with Rett syndrome could be carriers with no symptoms due to skewed X-inactivation
**Females who reproduce have 50% chance of passing on mutation
***Daughters who inherit mutation at high risk to develop classic Rett syndrome
***Skewed X inactivation in girls may result in milder phenotype
***Sons who inherit mutation may suffer severe neonatal encephalopathy or have severe mental retardation syndrome - usually result in miscarriage
*Due to mutations in MECP2 gene
**Located at Xq28
**Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)
***Expressed in all tissues
***Thought to be global transcriptional repressor, and mutation disrupts gene expression during development
***Most active in brain tissue
*Prevalence is estimated to be 1:10,000 to 1:15,000

==Clinical Features==
*Normal course of development but may have mild hypotonia
**Poor suck or weak cry
**Generally very placid
*Stage I (early onset)
**Generally begins between 6 and 18 months of age
***Symptoms are vague and often overlooked
***Lasts for a few months to a year
**Infants show less eye contact and less interested in toys
**Delays in gross motor skills such as crawling or sitting
**Handwringing and decreasing head growth are mild
*Stage II (rapid destructive stage)
**Begins between ages 1 and 4 years old
***Lasts for weeks or months
***May have rapid or gradual onset
**Purposeful hand skills and spoken language lost
***May being wringing, washing, clapping, tapping, or hand-to mouthing
***Hands sometimes clasped behind back or at sides with random touching, grasping, and releasing
***Movements persist while awake but disappear during sleep

***Loss of social interaction and communication
***General irritability and sleep irregularities
**Gait patterns unsteady and difficult to initiate movements
**Slowing of head growth is noticeable
***Brain size may eventually be 30% smaller than normal
***May begin to notice change as early as 3 months
**Gastrointestinal findings
***About 85-90% of girls have general growth failure and wasting
***Oropharyngeal and gastroesophageal incoordination may result in poor food intake
***Bowel dysmotility, constipation, and functional megacolon common
***Fecal impaction, vovulus, and intussusception can occur
***May also involve gallstones
*Stage III (plateau or pseudostationary stage)
**Begins between ages 2 and 10
***Can last for years
***Many girls remain in this stage for most of their lives
**Apraxia, motor problems common during this stage
**Seizures occur in about 50% of girls
***Tonic-clonic and partial complex are most common
***Occur more frequently once disease stabilizes
**Improvement in behavior with less irritability, crying, and autistic-like features
**May show more interest in her surroundings
***Alertness and attention span may improve
***Communication skills may also improve
**Osteoporosis is problem, possibly due to poor bone formation - results in fractures
*Stage IV (late motor deterioration stage)
**Can last for years or decades
**Characterized by reduced mobility
***Muscle weakness, rigidity (stiffness), spasticity, dystonia (increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of extremity or trunk), and scoliosis
***Girls may stop walking
***Generally no decline in cognition, communication, or hand skills
***Repetitive hand movements may decrease
***Eye gaze usually improves
*Girls typically survive into adulthood
**Incidence of sudden, unexplained death significantly higher
**May be due to reduced heart rate variability and neurological differences
*Atypical Rett syndrome
**Females have mild learning disability or a few women with no symptoms and skewed X-inactivation
**Mutations have been found in those previously diagnosed with autism, mild learning disability, and Angelman syndrome
*Males
**Males meeting clinical phenotype have been found with 47,XXY and mosaicism for MECP2 mutations
**Males with 46,XY can also (rarely) be affected

==Diagnosis/Testing Options==
*Clinical diagnosis
**Requires following:
***Apparently normal prenatal and perinatal period
***Normal head circumference at birth
***Apparently normal development through age six months
***Deceleration of head growth occurring anytime between ages three and 48 months
***Loss of acquired hand skills and purposeful hand use between ages five and 30 months, with subsequent development of stereotyped hand movements
***Severe impairment of expressive and receptive language together with severe psychomotor retardation
***Development of gait apraxia and truncal ataxia between ages 12 and 48 months
**Limitations
***May be considered tentative until patient is 2-5 years old
***Broad clinical variability
****Some girls do lose purposeful hand motion and have seizures but can walk and retain some speech
****Some girls severe with no period of normal development
****Some girls have less dramatic regression and milder mental retardation
*Biochemical laboratory studies not helpful
*Mutation analysis
**Used to confirm diagnosis in patients or family members of patients
**Bi-directional sequencing
***Detects mutations in about 80% of patients
***Can also do PCR based DHPLC or combination of both
**Must be sure mutation is disease-causing and not polymorphism (truncating or previously reported)
**Baylor College of Medicine
***MECP2 testing using PCR amplification of 3 exons
***14cc for adults or 6cc for child in purple top EDTA tube
***CPT codes 83891, 83898x5, 83904x5, 83912 for index case; 83891, 83898x1, 83904x1, and 83912 (for other family members)
*X-chromosome inactivation
**Useful in family with several children having various MECP2 mutation phenotypes but asymptomatic mother
**Mother may have mutation but XCI pattern causes her to have no clinical signs
**Not used for diagnosis in at-risk family members
*Prenatal testing
**Prenatal diagnosis offered to women with known MECP2 mutations
***Male fetus will at best survive with severe mental retardation
***Phenotype in female difficult to predict since depends on X-inactivation
**Also offered whether or not disease-causing mutation is identified in parent because of germline mosaicism

==Treatment/Management==
*No treatment known to improve neurologic outcome
**Several trials have had questionable efficacy and outcomes
**Tried naltrexone (oral opiate agonist) and L-carnitine
*Management is supportive and symptomatic therapy
**Low dose risperidone for agitation or other selective seratonin uptake inhibitors
**May also try chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, or diphenhydramine with melatonin
**Carbidopa/levodopa for rigidity but benefit not proven
**Melatonin may help sleep disturbances
**Try controlling diet to help with constipation
***Ample fluid intake and high fiber diet can help prevent crisis
***May use stool softeners
**Anti-reflux agents, smaller and thickened feedings, and positioning can help with reflux
*Video/EEG studies can give definitive information about seizures and need for antiepileptic
*Occupational and physical therapy to maintain function and prevent scoliosis
*Music therapy may be beneficial to girls to improve receptive and expressive language
*Mental function is not impaired!

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
**Loss of motorskills and seizures, dementia, and spasticit
**Have retinal dystrophy with blindness not seen in Rett syndrome
**Relies on electron microscopic findings on tissue biopsy, analysis of PPT-1 enzyme, or mutation analysis of CLN1 gene
*Autism
**Common diagnosis of girls with Rett syndrome without microcephaly, seizures, kyphoscoliosis
**No clinical criteria can distinguish between them
*Angelman syndrome
**Mental deficiency, seizures, ataxia, hand stereotypes, and microcephaly
**Developmental regression should distinguish Rett syndrome
**Seizures more difficult to manage in Angelman Syndrome
**Molecular genetic testing identifies about 90% of Angelman mutations
*Older patients may have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Lifelong care for a child who may never be able to take care of herself
*Feelings of guilt, anger, fear, sadness, sense of loss surrounding new diagnosis
*Concern about risk for future children
*Worry, frustration about what future holds since may not be able to predict
*One child that requires extra care and attention, detracting from other children or family relationships

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''method''' in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value.  With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program.  Other languages sometimes refer to this as a [[w:Subroutine|function]].  A method may be defined as a part of a [[Ruby Programming/Classes|class]] or separately.

==Method Calls==

Methods are called using the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
method_name(parameter1, parameter2,…)
&lt;/source&gt;

There are situations where inserting a space between the method name and the left parentheses can result in syntax errors so in Ruby it is best to not have any spaces between the method call and the parentheses. If the method has no parameters the parentheses can usually be omitted as in the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
method_name
&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't have code that needs to use method result immediately, Ruby allows to specify parameters omitting parentheses:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
results = method_name parameter1, parameter2           # calling method, not using parentheses

# You need to use parentheses if you want to work with the result immediately.
# e.g., if a method returns an array and we want to reverse element order:
results = method_name(parameter1, parameter2).reverse
&lt;/source&gt;

==Method Definitions==

Methods are defined using the keyword &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; followed by the ''method name''.  
Method [[w:en:parameter (computer science)|parameters]] are specified between parentheses following the method name.  The ''method body'' is enclosed by this definition on the top and the word &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; on the bottom. By convention method names that consist of multiple words have each word separated by an underscore. 

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def output_something(value)
  puts value 
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Return Values===

Methods return the value of the last statement executed.  The following code returns the value &lt;code&gt;x+y&lt;/code&gt;.  
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def calculate_value(x,y)
  x + y
end
&lt;/source&gt;

An explicit return statement can also be used to return from function with a value, prior to the end of the function declaration. This is useful when you want to terminate a loop or return from a function as the result of a conditional expression.

Note, if you use &quot;return&quot; within a block, you actually will jump out from the function, probably not what you want. To terminate block, use '''break'''. You can pass a value to break which will be returned as the result of the block:
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
six = (1..10).each {|i| break i if i &gt; 5}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, six will have the value 6.

===Default Values===

A default parameter value can be specified during method definition to replace the value of a parameter if it is not passed into the method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def some_method(value='default', arr=[])
  puts value
  puts arr.length
end

some_method('something')
&lt;/source&gt;

The method call above will output:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  something
  0
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is a syntax error in Ruby 1.8
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo( i = 7, j ) # Syntax error in Ruby 1.8.7 Unexpected ')', expecting '='
    return i + j
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code will work in 1.9.2 and will be logically equivalent to the snippet below
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo( j, i = 7)
    return i + j
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Length Argument List, Asterisk Operator===

The last parameter of a method may be preceded by an asterisk(*), which is sometimes called the 'splat' operator.  This indicates that more parameters may be passed to the function. Those parameters are collected up and an [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Arrays|array]] is created.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def calculate_value(x,y,*otherValues)
    puts otherValues
  end
  
  calculate_value(1,2,'a','b','c')
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above the output would be ['a', 'b', 'c'].

The asterisk operator may also precede an Array argument in a method call. In this case the Array will be expanded and the values passed in as if they were separated by commas.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  arr = ['a','b','c']
  calculate_value(*arr)
&lt;/source&gt;

has the same result as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  calculate_value('a','b','c')
&lt;/source&gt;

Another technique that Ruby allows is to give a [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Hashes|Hash]] when invoking a function, and that gives you best of all worlds: named parameters, and variable argument length.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def accepts_hash( var )
    print &quot;got: &quot;, var.inspect # will print out what it received
  end
  
  accepts_hash :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN'
  # =&gt; got: {:argN=&gt;&quot;giving argN&quot;, :arg1=&gt;&quot;giving arg1&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

You see, the arguments for accepts_hash got rolled up into one [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Hashes|hash]] variable. This technique is heavily used in the Ruby On Rails API.

Also note the missing parenthesis around the arguments for the accepts_hash function call, and notice that there is no { } Hash declaration syntax around the :arg1 =&gt; '...' code, either. The above code is equivalent to the more verbose:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  accepts_hash( :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' )  # argument list enclosed in parens
  accepts_hash( { :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' } ) # hash is explicitly created
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, if you are going to pass a code block to function, you need parentheses.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  accepts_hash( :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' )  { |s| puts s }
  accepts_hash( { :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' } )  { |s| puts s } 
  # second line is more verbose, hash explicitly created, but essentially the same as above
&lt;/source&gt;


In versions of Ruby since Ruby 2.0, it is also possible to use the new built-in ''keyword arguments'' that make above technique somewhat easier. The new syntax is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def test_method(a, b, c:true, d:false) 
   puts  a,b,c,d
end
&lt;/source&gt;
Above function can now be called as test_method(1,2), test_method(1,2, c: somevalue), test_method(1,2, d:someothervalue), test_method(1,2, c:somevalue, d:someothervalue) or even test_method(1,2, d: someothervalue, c: somevalue) . In this example, parentheses are again not required unless you want to chain the result to another function or method right away.
Note that this does mean that you 'have' to pass on names for (in this case) the 'c' and 'd' values you pass into the function, whenever you want to include them Calling the method like test_method(1,2,3,4) will not work.

Keyword Arguments are especially helpful whenever there is a lot of non-required options that might be passed into a function. Specifying the names whenever they are used makes the resulting function calls very readable.

===The Ampersand Operator===

Much like the asterisk, the ampersand(&amp;) may precede the last parameter of a function declaration.  This indicates that the function expects a code block to be passed in.  A Proc object will be created and assigned to the parameter containing the block passed in.

Also similar to the ampersand operator, a Proc object preceded by an ampersand during a method call will be replaced by the block that it contains.  [[Ruby Programming/Method Calling#yield|&lt;code&gt;Yield&lt;/code&gt;]] may then be used.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def method_call
    yield
  end

  method_call(&amp;someBlock)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Understanding blocks, Procs and methods===
====Introduction====

Ruby provides the programmer with a set of very powerful features borrowed from the domain of functional programming, namely closures, higher-order functions, and first-class functions [1]. These features are implemented in Ruby by means of code blocks, Proc objects, and methods (that are also objects)—concepts that are closely related and yet differ in subtle ways. In fact, I found myself quite confused about this topic, having difficulty understanding the difference between blocks, procs, and methods as well as unsure about the best practices of using them. Additionally, having some background in Lisp and years of Perl experience, I was unsure of how the Ruby concepts map to similar idioms from other programming languages like Lisp’s functions and Perl’s subroutines. Sifting through hundreds of newsgroup posts, I saw that I am not the only one with this problem and, in fact, quite a lot of “Ruby Nubies” struggle with the same ideas.

In this article I lay out my understanding of this facet of Ruby, which comes as a result of extensive research of Ruby books, documentation, and comp.lang.ruby, in sincere hope that other people will find it useful as well.

====Procs====

Shamelessly ripping from the Ruby documentation, Procs are defined as follows: Proc objects are blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables. Once bound, the code may be called in different contexts and still access those variables.

A useful example is also provided:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def gen_times(factor)
      return Proc.new {|n| n*factor }
  end
  
  times3 = gen_times(3)      # 'factor' is replaced with 3
  times5 = gen_times(5)
  
  times3.call(12)               #=&gt; 36
  times5.call(5)                #=&gt; 25
  times3.call(times5.call(4))   #=&gt; 60
&lt;/source&gt;

Procs play the role of functions in Ruby. It is more accurate to call them function objects, since like everything in Ruby they are objects. Such objects have a name in the folklore - functors. A functor is defined as an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax, which is exactly what a Proc is.

From the example and the definition above, it is obvious that Ruby Procs can also act as closures. On Wikipedia, a closure is defined as a function that refers to free variables in its lexical context. Note how closely it maps to the Ruby definition blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables.

====More on Procs====

Procs in Ruby are first-class objects, since they can be created during runtime, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions and returned as the value of other functions. Actually, the gen_times example demonstrates all of these criteria, except for “passed as arguments to other functions”. This one can be presented as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo (a, b)
      a.call(b)
  end
  
  putser = Proc.new {|x| puts x}
  foo(putser, 34)
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also a shorthand notation for creating Procs - the Kernel method lambda [2] (we’ll come to methods shortly, but for now assume that a Kernel method is something akin to a global function, which can be called from anywhere in the code). Using lambda the Proc object creation from the previous example can be rewritten as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  putser = lambda {|x| puts x}
&lt;/source&gt;

Actually, there are two slight differences between lambda and Proc.new. First, argument checking. The Ruby documentation for lambda states: Equivalent to Proc.new, except the resulting Proc objects check the number of parameters passed when called. Here is an example to demonstrate this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  pnew = Proc.new {|x, y| puts x + y}
  lamb = lambda {|x, y| puts x + y}

  # works fine, printing 6
  pnew.call(2, 4, 11)
  
  # throws an ArgumentError
  lamb.call(2, 4, 11)
&lt;/source&gt;

Second, there is a difference in the way returns are handled from the Proc. A return from Proc.new returns from the enclosing method (acting just like a return from a block, more on this later):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def try_ret_procnew
      ret = Proc.new { return &quot;Baaam&quot; }
      ret.call
      &quot;This is not reached&quot;
  end
  
  # prints &quot;Baaam&quot;
  puts try_ret_procnew
&lt;/source&gt;

While return from lambda acts more conventionally, returning to its caller:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def try_ret_lambda
      ret = lambda { return &quot;Baaam&quot; }
      ret.call
      &quot;This is printed&quot;
  end
  
  # prints &quot;This is printed&quot;
  puts try_ret_lambda
&lt;/source&gt;

With this in light, I would recommend using lambda instead of Proc.new, unless the behavior of the latter is strictly required. In addition to being a whopping two characters shorter, its behavior is less surprising.

====Methods====

Simply put, a method is also a block of code. However, unlike Procs, methods are not bound to the local variables around them. Rather, they are bound to some object and have access to its instance variables [3]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Boogy
      def initialize
          @dix = 15
      end
  
      def arbo
          puts &quot;#{@dix} ha\n&quot;
      end
  end

  # initializes an instance of Boogy
  b = Boogy.new

  # prints &quot;15 ha&quot;
  b.arbo
&lt;/source&gt;

A useful idiom when thinking about methods is that you are sending messages to the object that the method is defined for. Given a ''receiver'' - an object that has some method defined - we send it a message, which contains the name of the method, and optionally provides the arguments that the method would receive. In the example above, calling the method arbo without any arguments, is akin to sending a message with just “arbo” as the argument. 

Ruby supports the message sending idiom more directly, by including the send method in class Object (which is the parent of all objects in Ruby). So the following three lines are equivalent to the arbo method call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  # method is called on the object, with no arguments
  b.arbo

  # method/message name is given as a string
  b.send(&quot;arbo&quot;)
  
  # method/message name is given as a symbol
  b.send(:arbo)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that methods can also be defined in the so-called “top-level” scope, which is not inside any user-defined class. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def say (something)
      puts something
  end
  
  say &quot;Hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

While it seems that the method '''say''' is “free-standing”, it is not - Ruby silently tucks it into the Object class, which represents the scope of your application:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def say (something)
      puts something
  end
  
  say &quot;Hello&quot;
  Object.send(:say, &quot;Hello&quot;) # this will be the same as the above line
&lt;/source&gt;

But this doesn’t really matter, and for all practical purposes '''say''' can be seen as an independent method. Which is, by the way, just what’s called a “function” in some languages (like C and Perl). The following Proc is, in many ways similar:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  say = lambda {|something| puts something}
  
  say.call(&quot;Hello&quot;)

  # same effect
  say[&quot;Hello&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

The [] construct is a synonym to call in the context of Proc [4]. Methods, however, are more versatile than procs and support a very important feature of Ruby, which I will present right after explaining what blocks are.

====Blocks====

Blocks are so closely related to Procs that it gives many newbies a headache trying to decipher how they actually differ. I will try to ease on comprehension with a (hopefully not too corny) metaphor. Blocks, as I see them, are unborn Procs. Blocks are the larval, Procs are the insects. A block does not live on its own - it prepares the code for when it will actually become alive, and only when it is bound and converted to a Proc, it starts living:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  # a naked block can't live in Ruby
  # this is a compilation error !
  {puts &quot;hello&quot;}
  
  # now it's alive, having been converted
  # to a Proc !
  pr = lambda {puts &quot;hello&quot;}

  pr.call
&lt;/source&gt;

Is that it, is that what all the fuss is about, then ? No, not at all. The designer of Ruby, Matz saw that while passing Procs to methods (and other Procs) is nice and allows high-level functions and all kinds of fancy functional stuff, there is one common case that stands high above all other cases - passing a single block of code to a method that makes something useful out of it, for example iteration. And as a very talented designer, Matz decided that it is worthwhile to emphasize this special case, and make it both simpler and more efficient.

====Passing a block to a method====

No doubt that any programmer who has spent at least a couple of hours with Ruby has been shown the following examples of Ruby glory (or something very similar):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  10.times do |i|
      print &quot;#{i} &quot;
  end
  
  numbers = [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 21]
  
  numbers.each do |x|
      puts &quot;#{x} is &quot; + (x &gt;= 3 ? &quot;many&quot; : &quot;few&quot;)
  end
  
  squares = numbers.map {|x| x * x}
&lt;/source&gt;

(Note that &lt;code&gt;do |x| ... end&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;{ |x| ... }&lt;/code&gt;.)

Such code is, in my opinion, the part of what makes Ruby the clean, readable, and wonderful language it is. What happens here behind the scenes is quite simple, or at least may be depicted in a very simple way. Perhaps Ruby may not implement it exactly the way I am going to describe it, since there are optimization considerations surely playing their role, but it is definitely close enough to the truth to serve as a metaphor for understanding.

Whenever a block is appended to a method call, Ruby automatically converts it to a Proc object but one without an explicit name. The method, however, has a way to access this Proc, by means of the yield statement. See the following example for clarification:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice
      yield 
      yield
  end

  do_twice {puts &quot;Hola&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

The method do_twice is defined and called with an attached block. Although the method did not explicitly ask for the block in its arguments list, the yield can call the block. This can be implemented in a more explicit way using a Proc argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice(what)
      what.call
      what.call
  end

  do_twice lambda {puts &quot;Hola&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is equivalent to the previous example but using blocks with yield is cleaner and better optimized since only one block is passed to the method. Using the Proc approach, any amount of code blocks can be passed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice(what1, what2, what3)
      2.times do
          what1.call
          what2.call
          what3.call
      end
  end

  do_twice(   lambda {print &quot;Hola, &quot;},
              lambda {print &quot;querido &quot;},
              lambda {print &quot;amigo\n&quot;})
&lt;/source&gt;

This is important to note that many people frown at passing blocks and prefer explicit Procs instead. Their rationale is that a block argument is implicit and one has to look through the whole code of the method to see if there are any calls to yield there, while a Proc is explicit and can be immediately spotted in the argument list. While this is simply a matter of taste, understanding both approaches is vital.

====The ampersand (&amp;)====

The ampersand operator can be used to explicitly convert between blocks and Procs in a couple of cases. It is worthy to understand how these work.

Remember how I said that although an attached block is converted to a Proc under the hood, it is not accessible as a Proc from inside the method ? Well, if an ampersand is prepended to the last argument in the argument list of a method, the block attached to this method is converted to a Proc object and gets assigned to that last argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def contrived(a, &amp;f)
      # the block can be accessed through f
      f.call(a)
      
      # but yield also works !
      yield(a)
  end
  
  # this works
  contrived(25) {|x| puts x}
  
  # this raises ArgumentError, because &amp;f 
  # isn't really an argument - it's only there 
  # to convert a block
  contrived(25, lambda {|x| puts x})
&lt;/source&gt;

Another (IMHO far more efficacious) use of the ampersand is the other-way conversion - converting a Proc into a block. This is very useful because many of Ruby’s great built-ins, and especially the iterators, expect to receive a block as an argument, and sometimes it’s much more convenient to pass them a Proc. The following example is taken right from the excellent “Programming Ruby” book by the pragmatic programmers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  print &quot;(t)imes or (p)lus: &quot;
  times = gets
  print &quot;number: &quot;
  number = Integer(gets)
  if times =~ /^t/
      calc = lambda {|n| n*number }
  else
      calc = lambda {|n| n+number }
  end
  puts((1..10).collect(&amp;calc).join(&quot;, &quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

The collect method expects a block, but in this case it is very convenient to provide it with a Proc, since the Proc is constructed using knowledge gained from the user. The ampersand preceding calc makes sure that the Proc object calc is turned into a code block and is passed to collect as an attached block.

The ampersand also allows the implementation of a very common idiom among Ruby programmers: passing method names into iterators. Assume that I want to convert all words in an Array to upper case. I could do it like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  words = %w(Jane, aara, multiko)
  upcase_words = words.map {|x| x.upcase}
  
  p upcase_words
&lt;/source&gt;

This is nice, and it works, but I feel it’s a little bit too verbose. The upcase method itself should be given to map, without the need for a separate block and the apparently superfluous x argument. Fortunately, as we saw before, Ruby supports the idiom of sending messages to objects, and methods can be referred to by their names, which are implemented as Ruby Symbols. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  p &quot;Erik&quot;.send(:upcase)
&lt;/source&gt;

This, quite literally, says send the message/method upcase to the object “Erik”. This feature can be utilized to implement the map {|x| x.upcase} in an elegant manner, and we’re going to use the ampersand for this ! As I said, when the ampersand is prepended to some Proc in a method call, it converts the Proc to a block. But what if we prepend it not to a Proc, but to another object ? Then, Ruby’s implicit type conversion rules kick in, and the to_proc method is called on the object to try and make a Proc out of it. We can use this to implement to_proc for Symbol and achieve what we want:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Symbol
      
      # A generalized conversion of a method name
      # to a proc that runs this method.
      #
      def to_proc
          lambda {|x, *args| x.send(self, *args)}
      end
      
  end
  
  # Voilà !
  words = %w(Jane, aara, multiko)
  upcase_words = words.map(&amp;:upcase)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Dynamic methods ==

You can define a method on &quot;just one object&quot; in Ruby.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = 'b'
  def a.some_method
    'within a singleton method just for a'
  end
  &gt;&gt; a.some_method
  =&gt; 'within a singleton method just for a'
&lt;/source&gt;

Or you can use define_(singleton_)method, which preserves the scope around the definition, as well.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = 'b'
  a.define_singleton_method(:some_method) {
    'within a block method'
  }
  a.some_method
&lt;/source&gt;

==Special methods==
Ruby has a number of special methods that are called by the interpreter. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Chameleon
    alias __inspect__ inspect
    def method_missing(method, *arg)
      if (method.to_s)[0..2] == &quot;to_&quot;
        @identity = __inspect__.sub(&quot;Chameleon&quot;, method.to_s.sub('to_','').capitalize)
        def inspect
          @identity
        end
        self
      else
        super #method_missing overrides the default Kernel.method_missing
              #pass on anything we weren't looking for so the Chameleon stays unnoticed and uneaten ;)
      end
    end
  end
  mrlizard = Chameleon.new
  mrlizard.to_rock
&lt;/source&gt;

This does something silly but &lt;code&gt;method_missing&lt;/code&gt; is an important part of meta-programming in Ruby. In Ruby on Rails it is used extensively to create methods dynamically.

Another special methods is &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; that ruby calls whenever a class instance is created, but that belongs in the next chapter: [[Ruby_Programming/Classes_and_objects | Classes]].

==Conclusion==

Ruby doesn’t really have functions. Rather, it has two slightly different concepts - methods and Procs (which are, as we have seen, simply what other languages call function objects, or functors). Both are blocks of code - methods are bound to Objects, and Procs are bound to the local variables in scope. Their uses are quite different.

Methods are the cornerstone of object-oriented programming, and since Ruby is a pure-OO language (everything is an object), methods are inherent to the nature of Ruby. Methods are the actions Ruby objects do - the messages they receive, if you prefer the message sending idiom.

Procs make powerful functional programming paradigms possible, turning code into a first-class object of Ruby allowing to implement high-order functions. They are very close kin to Lisp’s lambda forms (there’s little doubt about the origin of Ruby’s Proc constructor lambda)

The construct of a block may at first be confusing, but it turns out to be quite simple. A block is, as my metaphor goes, an unborn Proc - it is a Proc in an intermediate state, not bound to anything yet. I think that the simplest way to think about blocks in Ruby, without losing any comprehension, would be to think that blocks are really a form of Procs, and not a separate concept. The only time when we have to think of blocks as slightly different from Procs is the special case when they are passed as the last argument to a method which may then access them using yield.

That’s about it, I guess. I know for sure that the research I conducted for this article cleared many misunderstandings I had about the concepts presented here. I hope others will learn from it as well. If you see anything you don’t agree with - from glaring errors to small inaccuracies, feel free to amend the book.

====Notes====

[1] It seems that in the pure, theoretical interpretation what Ruby has isn’t first-class functions per se. However, as this article demonstrates, Ruby is perfectly capable of fulfilling most of the requirements for first-class functions, namely that functions can be created during the execution of a program, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as the values of other functions.

[2] lambda has a synonym - proc, which is considered ‘mildly deprecated’ (mainly because proc and Proc.new are slightly different, which is confusing). In other words, just use lambda.

[3] These are ‘instance methods’. Ruby also supports ‘class methods’, and ‘class variables’, but that is not what this article is about.

[4] Or more accurately, call and [] both refer to the same method of class Proc. Yes, Proc objects themselves have methods !

===Essentials That You Can't Do Without===

;Screwdrivers : 0.5mm, 1mm and 1.5mm at least.  A full set (nine screwdrivers, from 0.6 to 3 mm) is much better. The USD 50 AF (which is a French-made one, but rebranded) is a sure bet. Bergeon makes a nice set, but a bit overpriced. Do not get the anti-magnetic ones, as these are way too soft.

;Tweezers : Quality makes a difference. I'd get one quality pair (Dumont is a very good brand), and a couple of less expensive ones to start. An anti-magnetic steel pair (size 1 or 2; whereas a fine size 5 is for hairspring work only), and any brass one, as brass is softer than steel, so it won't leave any mark on the steel, and brass is anti-magnetic (AM is always obviously written on these).

;Watch oil and oiler :  I like fountain oilers, because they save oil, especially if you don't do all that many watches at a time.  Dip oilers will work, but it is likely that your oil will be contaminated before you use much of it.  A reasonable substitute is an insulin syringe with a blunted tip. Depends on local rules; here I can get them without a prescription.

;Movement holder or movement rings : It's just barely possible to work without them, but only barely. The genuine Bergeon 4040 is a classic. Do not get the Chinese/Indian ones, their sides are not parallel.  


===Nearly Essential Tools===

;Digital camera : Unless your memory is a lot better than mine.  Take pictures of the movement.  If your camera won't take close-ups, you can probably hold a jeweler's loupe in front of the lens to get closer.  Generally best with the flash off. 

;Screwdriver sharpener : Possibly not right away if you get a very high quality screwdriver set, you'll need it if you get a $15 screwdriver set, and you'll need it eventually no matter what.  I'd rather have cheap screwdrivers and a sharpener than a good set without. You'll need a sharpening stone: buy a double-sided USA Norton &quot;India&quot; stone (orange/brown): one side is coarse, the other one is fine. Always put some PETROL on it BEFORE sharpening anything on it, or the stone will get clogged up with metal fragments. For a last fine sharpening job, you can use an Arkansas stone (they're gray or bluish/white colored). Always use oil with this stone.

;Loupes : If you're as nearsighted as I am, you can just barely manage without one, but they are too cheap to do without.  You'll want a x4 or so to get tools between the loupe and the watch, and a x12 or so to inspect extremely close.  Drill some holes in the body to reduce fogging. Good brands : Asco, Bergeon.  An Optivisor (headband mounted stereo magnafyer) is nice. The real ones have a prism that helps with close vision.   Cheaper ones just have the lens, you wind up having to go cross-eyed to see.  

;Case wrench : Jaxa-style is the best cheap version. If you go for the Asian copy of the Jaxa tool, remember you can still buy a good Bergeon set of replacement bits.

;Case knife : One of the easiest tools to substitute, but inexpensive. 

;Crystal press : For installing crystals and bezels, and for closing stubborn snap-on backs. 

;Crystal lift : For installing and removing plastic crystals, the only way to access some watches with one-piece cases

;Pin vise : For holding stems and similar.  

:Rubber dust blower : To remove dust, or to dry a part.

;A tool to remove the strap/bracelet from the watch : I like the cheap Bergeon 6767 (the one with fine tip).

;Parts trays : I use artist's watercolor trays from WalMart, less than $1.  

;Rodico cleaning putty : Putty-like thumbtack substitutes can work, but the real stuff isn't expensive.  The older Green one is okay, but the Premium gray leaves no residues at all.

;Watch tissue : Basically like wrapping tissue, but pre-cut in 3-4 inch squares.  

;Hand puller : Go for the black Bergeon one, expensive, but do not take a risk with those fragile hands !

;Small containers for movements : I like 2 oz condiment containers with lids from a restaurant supply store. 

;Watchmaker's bench : I started with a footstool on my desk to get close to the right level, built a custom bench later. Always clean it well before doing any watchmaking job, that's a priority.

===Advanced Tools===

;Cleaning machine : A mechanical watch cleaner (spins the parts around in jars of cleaner) does nearly as good a job as a good ultrasonic, a better job than a cheap ultrasonic, and is far easier.  

;Chemicals : L and R watch cleaning chemicals may cost more than a used mechanical machine, but make a huge difference.  Non-ammoniated will last longer for occasional use, the ammonia will evaporate.  If you can't afford both wash and rinse, get the wash and substitute Naptha (lighter fluid) or paint thinner for the rinse. 

;Staking set

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ring Chromosome 22'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*Could you explain to me in your own words why you were referred to genetics?
*What is your understanding of the chromosome results?
*What are your main questions or concerns?
*Outline session
**Explain chromosome results
**Take family history (ask standard questions i.e.) miscarriage, MR, learning disabilities, birth defects, etc.)
**Dr. will examine him and may ask more questions about his medical history
**We will discuss what we know and answer questions if we can

==Explain results==
*Briefly explain chromosomes and genes
*He has 46 chromosomes including an X and Y which indicates what we already knew that he is a boy
*He also has part of an extra chromosome that has formed a ring
*The ring contains part of chromosome 22 (show ideogram)
*a ring usually forms when the ends of a chromosome break off leaving &quot;sticky ends&quot; that then connect.
*We don't really know why rings form
*We also don't know where the extra piece of chromosome originally came from
*The presence of extra chromosomal material can change the way our bodies grow and develop
*There are no reports in the literature of individuals with an extra ring chromosome 22 that is exactly like the one found in _______.
*Therefore it makes it difficult to give you a clear idea of what to expect
*Especially since there are two things we are considering, the extra genetic material and the fact that it is present in a ring form
*However, we can tell you about what we do know from reports in the literature that are similar in some ways
*I'd like to address your main concerns the best I can so please jump in with questions

==Possibilities with ring chromosomes==
*Extra ring chromosomes have been passed on from parent to child (a case of grandfather, father and son all with extra ring 22 that is much small then _____'s ring)
*When the ring chromosome is copied before cells divide sometimes there is difficulty separating them and this can result in the ring being altered (new break points or duplication of some of the material)
*It is thought that if they can't separate the cell dies
*It tends to be more common to have ring chromosomes present in a certain percentage of a person's cells and not all of them
*When this is the case the cells with the extra ring are thought to die (evidence for this comes from the fact that sometimes when these individuals are retested there are no longer rings present or they are found in a smaller percentage of cells.)

==Discussion==
*It seems that _____ is doing better than nearly all of the individuals that have been reported to have a duplication of all or even part of chromosome 22 in the literature
*If individuals have an entire extra copy of chromosome 22 (that is not a ring) they generally die before birth or soon after. They also usually have a number of birth defects and characteristic physical features.
*Individuals with partial deletions have been reported with a number of physical characteristics and health concerns that ______ does not seem to have.

==Phenotype seen in other cases==
*Complete trisomy 22 syndrome, der(22) syndrome, and cat eye syndrome (CES) all have some overlapping characteristics (see charts from articles describing characteristics with complete and mosaic trisomy 22 and see chart listing features of CES)

==CES==
*Typically associated with supernumerary bisatellited marker chromosome (inv dup 22pter-22q11.2) resulting in 4 copies of that region
*Highly variable phenotype (same marker results in different phenotype in different generations)
*3 copies have been enough to result in CES phenotype (Reiss ''et al.'' 1985 and Knoll ''et al.'' 1994)
*Criteria for diagnosis of CES include;
**Ocular coloboma of the iris and or retina
**Anal atresia (with or without fistula)
**Preauricular skin tags and pits
**Heart defects (especially total anomalous pulmonary venous return
**Dysmorphic features (hypertelorism, down-slanting palpegral fissures, urogenital defects, mild to moderater MR

==Minute supernumerary ring chromosome 22 associated with CES==
*3 generations had the minute ring derived from 22q11.2
*ring present in 90% of blood cells over the three generations
*individual affected with CES has 4 copies of this region in each cell (unaffected father and grandfather have 3 copies)
*father and paternal grandfather had no clinical features
*may have been derivative of a dicentric marker chromosome

==Case of duplication of 22q11.2-q13.1 and pericentric inversion (Prasher VP et al. 1995)==
*Limited communication skills
*Persistent self injury
*Poor mobility
*Colobomata (common in cat eye syndrome)
*Prominent forehead
*Low posterior hairline
*Prognathism of lower jaw
*Tongue protrusion
*Poor vision
*Needed help with daily living skills
*Short hands and fingers
*Moderate thoracic kyphosis
*Small penis and testes
*Bilateral single transverse palmar crease

==Shares features of another case with duplication of 22q11.1 to q13==
*Absence of speech
*Persistent self-injury
*Lack of daily living skills
*very poor vision

==Case of de novo direct duplication of 22q11-q12==
*Milder phenotype than complete trisomy 22 and der(22)t(11:22)
*Similar in type and severity of cat eye syndrome (CES)

==Other case of 22q11.2-q13.1 de novo duplication==
*Minor physical anomalies
*Bilateral preauricular pits
*Failure to thrive
*Highly arched palate
*Bilateral hydronephrosis
*Delayed gross motor skills

==Mechanisms of ring formation==
*By two DNA breaks, one in each arm of the same chromosome, followed by fusion of the proximal broken ends. The causes of these DNA breaks are usually unknown and so is the mechanism behind ligation of the ends. It is possible that the non-homologous end-joining machinery plays a role in this process (Smith et al. 2001). A ring can also be formed by fusion at two breakpoints in the same chromosome arm. However, only few examples of such rings have been described. Most probably, this is because they are acentric and will lack attachment point for the cell division machinery. Unless there is a different anchorage sequence for the kinetochore complex they will be lost in subsequent mitoses. Such ÒneocentromereÓ sequences have, however, been described in rare cases of constitutional (Slater et al. 1999) and acquired (Gisselsson et al. 1999) ring chromosomes.
*By fusion of dysfunctional telomeres from the same chromosome. Several in vitro and animal models have shown that shortening of telomeric DNA repeats leads to the detachment of protective proteins from the chromosome ends (Counter et al. 1992). This renders the chromosome ends prone to recombination with DNA either from other chromosomes Ð leading to formation of a dicentric Ð or with the other arm of the same chromosome Ð leading to formation of a ring.
*Parents carrying acrocentric isochromosomes or homologous Robertsonian translocations have been known to have children with a ring chromosome apparently derived from the parental abnormality (Mears AJ cites de Almeida ''et al.'' 1983 and Neri et al. 1983)
*Extranumerary can form when a marker chromosome breaks and ends of the monocentric fragment fuse

==Constitutional ring chromosomes==
*1/50,000 human fetuses (Jacobs et al. 1975)
*In most instances, these rings are formed by breakpoints in both arms, followed by fusion of the proximal ends into a ring with loss of the distal material.
*Such rings may thus result in clinical features mimicking terminal deletion syndromes.
Supernumary ring chromosomes
*Alternatively, congenital ring chromosomes are supernumerary, i.e. they occur together with two normal homologues of the corresponding chromosome (Anderlid et al. 2001)
*rare due to:
*actually are rare in occurrence
*supernumerary ring chromosomes often gradually disappear in vivo and only cells with normal karyotype are eventually observed (Michalski K ''et al.'' 1993 cited Hoo ''et al.'' 1980)
*not very many reports makes it difficult to predict prognosis or provide empiric risk data
*supernumerary marker chromosomes are more common than supernumerary rings occurring in 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 500 for a (Michalski K ''et al.'' 1993 extrapolated this from multiple studies from 1984-1990)
*the consequences will be similar to partial trisomies or duplications
*Different characteristics depending on:
*which chromosome is involved
*the position of breakpoints within the chromosome.
*patients with extra rings do not only display diverse symptoms resulting from deletions or duplications
*In a meta-study including more than two-hundred patients with congenital ring chromosomes it has been demonstrated that the majority of children with rings show a failure to thrive beyond the extent expected from their chromosomal imbalances (Kosztolanyi 1987).
*suggested that this is due to the mitotic instability of rings, preventing somatic cells from proliferating normally.
*hypothesis is supported by the fact that growth failure is more common among patients with large ring chromosomes, than among those with small ones (Kosztolanyi 1987).
*This is in accordance with the BFB model of ring chromosome dynamics.
*Statistically, large rings will undergo more sister chromatid exchanges per cell cycle than small rings and would thus have a higher propensity for breaking at anaphase.
*In a normal cell, this provokes a physiological DNA damage response leading to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Cohen-Jonathan et al. 1999).
*a cell population carrying a ring chromosome would proliferate slower than a population without rings; the population with rings would be less fit and be at a selective disadvantage.
*Interestingly, ring chromosome loss or size reduction is not uncommon in cases with congenital rings.
*In particular, cases with small rings often exhibit a subclone without the ring chromosome and these patients are thus ring/monosomy mosaics (Gisselsson et al. 1999).

==Ring chromosomes at cell division==
*In contrast to linear chromosomes, rings may undergo cell division in three different ways (McClintock 1938; Lejeune 1968). Which of these pathways a ring chromosome will follow depends on the number of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) that has occurred in the ring before cell division:
**No SCE or an even number of SCEs in the same direction will enable normal, symmetrical segregation of the chromatids.
**An even number of SCEs in different directions will lead to the formation of interlocked rings.
**An odd number of SCEs will lead to transformation from two parallel chromatids into one continuous ring, with the double size of the original rings (Fig. 2).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Glossary of Terms Related to Invasive Species Ecology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

'''Alien species:'''  Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in population publications, public information displays, and educational literature.  This term refers to species that spread beyond their native range, not necessarily harmful, or species introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include exotic species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

'''Aquatic nuisance species: ''' Less commonly used in most literature.  1. A nonindigenous species that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological stability of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990).  2. Aquatic species that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003).  3.  An aquatic species with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. species that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  

'''Biological control or biocontrol:''' 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others.  Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of pests or weeds.  Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the pest species, whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby, 1998).  2. The release of one species to control another (Carlton, 2001).  3.  The management of weeds using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth et al., 2003). 4. Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target pest (Heutte and Bella, 2003).

'''Biological invasion or bioinvasion:''' A broad term that refers to both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton, 2001).

'''Biological diversity or biodiversity:''' Used to describe species richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). 

'''Bioregion:''' A biological subdivision of the earth’s surface delineated by the flora and fauna of the region (Allaby 1998).

'''Biota:'''  The plants and animals of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).
 
'''Casual species:'''  This term is becoming less common in usage.  A non native species that does not form self-replacing populations (Booth et al. 2003).  Similar terms include introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species.

'''Chemical control:''' Control method that employs herbicides to control exotic plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''Community:''' Any grouping of populations of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). 

'''Cryptogenic species:''' Species that are neither clearly native nor exotic (Cohen and Carlton 1988).

'''Cultivar:''' A variety of a plant produced and maintained by horticultural techniques and not normally found in wild populations (Allaby 1998). 

'''Disturbance:''' An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

'''Ecosystem:'''  A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

'''Endemic:''' A species or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic areas because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this species is said to be endemic to the place (Allaby 1998) and would be native. 

'''Exotic species:''' This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms alien species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Heutte and Bella 2003).  Other definitions include: 1. An introduced, non native species, or a species that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the species by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  2.  In North America, often refers to those species not present in a bioregion before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988).  

'''Fauna:''' The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Foreign species:''' A species introduced to a new area or country.  Similar terms include alien species, exotic species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species. 

'''Flora:''' Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Habitat:''' The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). 

'''Herbicide:'''  Pesticide that specifically targets vegetation (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Indigenous:''' A species that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for native species (Allaby 1998), although see &quot;endemic&quot;.

'''Injurious species:''' An introduced species that causes economic or environmental harm to humans.  Similar terms include aquatic nuisance species, noxious weed, and invasive species (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Intentional introduction:''' A species that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping species; a species that provides food; a groundcover species; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the species; or other purposeful reasons (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Introduced species:'''  This term, along with the terms introduced species and nonindigenous species, is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs.  This terms means those species that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001).  Similar terms include alien species, exotic species, foreign species, non indigenous species, and non native species.

'''Invasibility:''' The ease with which a habitat is invaded (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Invasion:''' The expansion of a species into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Invasive species: ''' This term is subject to the most confusion and debate within invasion biology terminology.  Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and causes harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction.  1. An alien species whose introduction does or whose introduction is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999).  2. An adjective for native or nonindigenous species that have colonized natural areas; 3.  Discrimination of nonindigenous species established in cultivated habitats (as ‘noninvasive’) from those established in natural habitats; 4. Nonindigenous species that are widespread; or 5. Widespread nonindigenous species that have adverse effects on the invaded habitat (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Other definitions include the following: 5. Species that spread beyond their native range, not necessarily harmful, or species introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).  6. Species that displace native species and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''IPM:''' Integrated Pest Management.  IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pests.  The integrated approach to weed management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Manual control:''' Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Mechanical control:''' Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, “weed-whackers”, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers.  Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Native range:''' The ecosystem that a species inhabits (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Native species:'''  1. A synonym for indigenous species 2. A species that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005).  3.  In North America, a species established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

'''Native weed (invasive native):''' A species that is native to an area or bioregion that has increased in number dramatically.  In cases of disturbance or change to a landscape, a ruderal species can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening^ members^ the diversity of a community.  In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the population of a species, such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).

'''Naturalized species:''' 1. A species that was originally introduced from a different country, a different bioregion, or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998).  2. A non native species that forms self-sustaining populations but is not necessarily an invasive species (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Niche opportunity:''' Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).

'''Nonindigenous species:''' This is a common term used along with non native species and introduced species in current literature and publications; other similar terms include alien species, exotic species, and foreign species.  1. Any species or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990).  2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). 

'''Non native species: ''' This term, along with the terms introduced species and nonindigenous species, is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs.  Similar terms also include alien species, exotic species, and foreign species.  This term has also been defined as: 1. A species whose presence is due to intentional or unintentional introduction as a result of human activity (Booth et al. 2003).  2. A species that has been introduced to an area or bioregion (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

'''Noxious weed:''' This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, prohibited or restricted.  1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).  2. Implies a species’ adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. species that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  3. Any species of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''Pathway:''' 1. Used to mean vector, purpose (the reason why a species is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001).  2. Mode by which a species establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Pest:''' 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect pest on a cropfield (Allaby 1998)  2. Synonymous to invasive species (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

'''Pesticide:''' A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Population:''' A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same species found in the same place at the same time (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Prohibited weed:''' A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Restricted weed:''' A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Ruderal species:''' A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground.  Ruderals are often weeds which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition.  See also native weed or invasive native (Allaby 1998).  

'''Seed bank:''' Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Species: ''' A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

'''Status''' or '''distributional statrus:'''

'''Tens rule:''' 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of species pass through each transition from being imported to becoming casual to becoming established, and finally becoming a weed (Booth et al. 2003).  2. Ten percent of the introduced species establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are pests (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). {note that J&amp;S found exceptions to the 10's rule}.

'''Time lag:''' 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).  2. The time between when a species is introduced and when its population growth explodes (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Unintentional introduction:''' An introduction of nonindigenous species that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the species involved, such as the transport of nonindigenous species in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). 

'''Vector:''' The physical means or agent by which a species is transported, such as ballast water, ships’ hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001).  See also Pathway.  

'''Weed:'''  1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed'' or ''invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops.  Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for beneficial purposes (Allaby, 1998).  2. A native or introduced species that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth et al., 2003).  3.  A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Robin Sequence'''

==Introduction==
*Robin sequence was named after the French stomatologist Pierre Robin.
*It has typically been regarded as the association of micrognathia, wide, U-shaped cleft palate, and upper airway obstruction.
*Robin sequence is a heterogenous disorder that most often occurs as a sequence of other syndromes.

==Incidence==
*Incidence has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 2,000 live births.
*Some babies with Robin sequence die shortly after birth because of severe airway obstruction or a variety of underlying syndromes incompatible with life (such as trisomy 13).
*Therefore, population prevalence is slightly lower than birth incidence.

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*The large majority of cases of Robin sequence are associated with other multiple-anomaly syndromes.
**The majority of syndromes that result in Robin sequence are single-gene disorders, often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
**There are also several X-linked recessive disorders and recessive disorders.
**The most common teratogenic disorder is fetal alcohol syndrome, although phenytoin and retinoic acid have been implicated as well.
*In one study, only 17% of Robin sequence cases were isolated.
*Stickler syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome are the first and second most commonly associated diagnoses.
*An initial diagnosis of Robin sequence should be regarded as a starting point in the diagnostic search.
*Robin sequence may be associated with mandibular anomalies other than micrognathia, including retrognathia and mandibular asymmetry.
*It may also be caused by macroglossia and severe muscle weakness.
*Most clinicians cite micrognathia, U-shaped cleft palate, and upper airway obstruction as the criteria for Robin sequence, but some may use only two of the features.
*Many other anomalies may exist with this triad because Robin sequence is most often secondary to another syndrome.

==Diagnostic Testing==
*There is no specific testing for Robin sequence other than observation of clinical features
*Micrognathia and cleft palate can be detected with sonography in the fetus
*Because Stickler syndrome and VCF account for nearly half of all cases of Robin sequence, it is appropriate to screen all newborns with Robin sequence for these disorders.

==Etiology==
*Robin sequence is a sequence, not a syndrome:
**The term syndrome is used when multiple anomalies in a single individual are caused by a single etiology.
**The term sequence is used when an individual has multiple anomalies caused secondarily by a single known or presumed structural anomaly or error in morphogenesis; that is, it is a cascade of events.
*The primary anomaly in Robin sequence which interrupts the normal developmental process is micrognathia or occasionally retrognathia.
*This mandibular anomaly is present at the time that palate fusion is to begin. As a result, the tongue is not free to descend from between the vertical palatal shelves, preventing them from growing toward fusion.
*Although the tongue may eventually descend in the oral cavity, it may do so after lateral head growth is too great for the remaining palatal growth to overcome or the period of programmed growth may be over.
*After birth, micrognathia persists. With the mouth closed and a small or retruded mandible present, the tongue is retrodisplaced in the pharynx (glossoptosis_ which causes airway obstruction and failure to thrive.
*The most common occurrence of a short mandibular body is in positional mandibular deformation, and extrinsic mechanical force
**This may occur as a result of fetal crowding caused by the presence of multiple fetuses, abnormal fetal position, or uterine anomalies.
**Associated deformations may include clubfoot, crumpled ear, or limb contractures.
**One would not expect to find other anomalies that were not related to mechanical constriction.
*The most common cause of retrognathia is platybasia, which draws the glenoid fossa and the temporomandibular joint backward away from the maxilla.
*Platybasia has been observed in a number of craniofacial syndromes, most commonly is VCF.

==Management==
*Growth and Feeding:
**Babies may have marginal airways that permit sufficient respiration to sustain life, but there is difficulty maintaining the airway while feeding.
**Failure to thrive becomes evident in the neonatal period.
**Failure to thrive and long-term feeding problems occur in over 50% of babies with Robin sequence.
**Respiratory sounds should be assessed by stethoscope during feeding.
**In most cases, resolution of the airway problem results in resolution of the feeding problem.
*Respiratory:
**Robin sequence is typically evident at birth because of the potentially life-threatening effects of upper airway obstruction.
**Apneic events are typically silent because the neonatal lung capacity cannot create the high negative pressures that would prompt loud noises or snoring.
**Glossoptosis associated with micrognathia is typically suspected to be the cause of airway obstruction and apnea.
**Other types of upper airway obstruction are hypotonic pharynx, absence of adequate muscle tone, laryngeal anomalies, or tracheomalacia.
**Treatment depends upon the severity of the airway obstruction, which can be variable in Robin sequence.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:en:class (object-oriented programming)|'''Classes''']] are the basic template from which [[w:en:Object (computer science)|object]] instances are created.  A class is made up of a collection of variables representing internal state and methods providing behaviours that operate on that state.  

==Class Definition==

Classes are defined in Ruby using the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword followed by a name.  The name must begin with a capital letter and by convention names that contain more than one word are run together with each word capitalized and no separating characters ([[w:en:CamelCase|CamelCase]]).  The class definition may contain method, class variable, and instance variable declarations as well as calls to methods that execute in the class context at read time, such as attr_accessor.  The class declaration is terminated by the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def some_method
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Instance Variables===
Instance variables are created for each class instance and are accessible only within that instance.  They are accessed using the @ operator. Outside of the class definition, the value of an instance variable can only be read or modified via that instance's public methods.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; 
  class MyClass
    @one = 1
    def do_something
      @one = 2
    end
    def output
      puts @one
    end
  end
  instance = MyClass.new
  instance.output
  instance.do_something
  instance.output
&lt;/source&gt;

Surprisingly, this outputs:

  nil
  2


This happens (nil in the first output line) because ''@one'' defined below ''class MyClass'' is an instance variable belonging to the class object (note this is not the same as a class variable and could not be referred to as ''@@one''), whereas ''@one'' defined inside the ''do_something'' method is an instance variable belonging to instances of ''MyClass''.  They are two distinct variables and the first is accessible only in a class method.

===Accessor Methods===

As noted in the previous section, an instance variable can only be directly accessed or modified within an instance method definition. If you want to provide access to it from outside, you need to define public accessor methods, for example

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end

    def foo
      return @foo
    end

    def foo=(value)
      @foo = value
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496
  puts instance.foo
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that ruby provides a bit of syntactic sugar to make it look like you are getting and setting a variable directly; under the hood

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = instance.foo
  instance.foo = b
&lt;/source&gt;

are calls to the foo and foo= methods

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = instance.foo()
  instance.foo=(b)
&lt;/source&gt;

Since this is such a common use case, there is also a convenience method to autogenerate these getters and setters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    attr_accessor :foo

    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496
  puts instance.foo
&lt;/source&gt;

does the same thing as the above program. The attr_accessor method is run at read time, when ruby is constructing the class object, and it generates the foo and foo= methods.

However, there is no requirement for the accessor methods to simply transparently access the instance variable. For example, we could ensure that all values are rounded before being stored in foo:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end

    def foo
      return @foo
    end

    def foo=(value)
      @foo = value.round
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496.2
  puts instance.foo #=&gt; 496
&lt;/source&gt;

===Class Variables===
Class variables are accessed using the @@ operator.  These variables are associated with the class hierarchy rather than any object instance of the class and are the same across all object instances. (These are similar to class &quot;static&quot; variables in Java or C++).

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    @@value = 1
    def add_one
      @@value= @@value + 1
    end
    
    def value
      @@value
    end
  end
  instanceOne = MyClass.new
  instanceTwo = MyClass.new
  puts instanceOne.value
  instanceOne.add_one
  puts instanceOne.value
  puts instanceTwo.value
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

  1
  2
  2

===Class Instance Variables===

Classes can have instance variables.  This gives each class a variable that is not shared by other classes in the inheritance chain.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Employee
    class &lt;&lt; self; attr_accessor :instances; end
    def store
      self.class.instances ||= []
      self.class.instances &lt;&lt; self
    end
    def initialize name
      @name = name
    end
  end
  class Overhead &lt; Employee; end
  class Programmer &lt; Employee; end
  Overhead.new('Martin').store
  Overhead.new('Roy').store
  Programmer.new('Erik').store
  puts Overhead.instances.size    # =&gt; 2
  puts Programmer.instances.size  # =&gt; 1
&lt;/source&gt;

For more details, see [http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html MF Bliki: ClassInstanceVariables]

===Class Methods===
Class methods are declared the same way as normal methods, except that they are prefixed by &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, or the class name, followed by a period.  These methods are executed at the Class level and may be called without an object instance.  They cannot access instance variables but do have access to class variables.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def self.some_method
      puts 'something'
    end
  end
  MyClass.some_method
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

  something

===Instantiation===
An object instance is created from a class through the a process called ''instantiation''.  In Ruby this takes place through the Class method &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  anObject = MyClass.new(parameters)
&lt;/source&gt;

This function sets up the object in memory and then delegates control to the initialize function of the class if it is present.  Parameters passed to the new function are passed into the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize(parameters)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Declaring Visibility==

By default, all methods in Ruby classes are public - accessible by anyone. There are, nonetheless, only two exceptions for this rule: the global methods defined under the Object class, and the initialize method for any class. Both of them are implicitly private. 

If desired, the access for methods can be restricted by public, private, protected object methods.

It is interesting that these are not actually keywords, but actual methods that operate on the class,
dynamically altering the visibility of the methods, and as a result, these 'keywords' influence the visibility of all following declarations until a new visibility is set or the end of the declaration-body is reached.

===Private===

Simple example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Example
    def methodA
    end
    
    private # all methods that follow will be made private: not accessible for outside objects
    
    def methodP
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

If private is invoked without arguments, it sets access to private for all subsequent methods.
It can also be invoked with named arguments. 

Named private method example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Example
    def methodA
    end
    
    def methodP
    end
    
    private :methodP
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Here private was invoked with an argument, altering the visibility of methodP to private.

Note for class methods (those that are declared using def ClassName.method_name), you need to use another function: private_class_method

Common usage of private_class_method is to make the &quot;new&quot; method (constructor) inaccessible, to force access to an object through some getter function. A typical Singleton implementation is an obvious example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class SingletonLike
    private_class_method :new
    
    def SingletonLike.create(*args, &amp;block)
      @@inst = new(*args, &amp;block) unless @@inst
      return @@inst
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Note :
another popular way to code the same declaration
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class SingletonLike
    private_class_method :new
    
    def SingletonLike.create(*args, &amp;block)
      @@inst ||= new(*args, &amp;block)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

More info about the difference between C++ and Ruby private/protected:
http://lylejohnson.name/blog/?p=5

One person summed up the distinctions by saying that in C++, “private” means “private to this class”, while in Ruby it means “private to this instance”. What this means, in C++ from code in class A, you can access any private method for any other object of type A. In Ruby, you cannot: you can only access private methods for your instance of object, and not for any other object instance (of class A).

Ruby folks keep saying &quot;private means you cannot specify the receiver&quot;. What they are saying, if method is private, in your code you can say:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class AccessPrivate
    def a
    end
    private :a # a is private method
        
    def accessing_private
      a              # sure! 
      self.a         # nope! private methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver at all, even if that receiver is &quot;self&quot;
      other_object.a # nope, a is private, you can't get it (but if it was protected, you could!)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &quot;other_object&quot; is the &quot;receiver&quot; that method &quot;a&quot; is invoked on. For private methods, it does not work. However, that is what &quot;protected&quot; visibility will allow.

===Public===

Public is default accessibility level for class methods. I am not sure why this is specified - maybe for completeness, maybe so that you could dynamically make some method private at some point, and later - public.

In Ruby, visibility is completely dynamic. You can change method visibility at runtime!

===Protected===

Now, “protected” deserves more discussion. Those of you coming from Java or C++ have learned that in those languages, if a method is “private”, its visibility is restricted to the declaring class, and if the method is “protected”, it will be accessible to children of the class (classes that inherit from parent) or other classes in that package.

In Ruby, “private” visibility is similar to what “protected” is in Java. Private methods in Ruby are accessible from children. You can’t have truly private methods in Ruby; you can’t completely hide a method.

The difference between protected and private is subtle. If a method is protected, it may be called by any instance of the defining class or its subclasses. If a method is private, it may be called only within the context of the calling object---it is never possible to access another object instance's private methods directly, even if the object is of the same class as the caller. For protected methods, they are accessible from objects of the same class (or children).

So, from within an object &quot;a1&quot; (an instance of Class A), you can call private methods only for instance of &quot;a1&quot; (self). And you cannot call private methods of object &quot;a2&quot; (that also is of class A) - they are private to a2. But you can call protected methods of object &quot;a2&quot; since objects a1 and a2 are both of class A.

[http://www.rubycentral.com/faq/rubyfaq-7.html Ruby FAQ] gives following example - implementing an operator that compares one internal variable with a variable from the same class (for purposes of comparing the objects):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    self.age &lt;=&gt; other.age
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

If age is private, this method will not work, because other.age is not accessible. If &quot;age&quot; is protected, this will work fine, because self and other are of same class, and can access each other's protected methods.

To think of this, protected actually reminds me of the &quot;internal&quot; accessibility modifier in C# or &quot;default&quot; accessibility in Java (when no accessibility keword is set on method or variable): method is accessible just as &quot;public&quot;, but only for classes inside the same package.

===Instance Variables===

Note that object instance variables are not really private, you just can't see them.
To access an instance variable, you need to create a getter and setter.

Like this (no, don't do this by hand! See below):
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class GotAccessor
    def initialize(size)
      @size = size
    end
    
    def size
      @size
    end
    def size=(val)
      @size = val
    end
  end
  
  # you could the access @size variable as
  # a = GotAccessor.new(5)
  # x = a.size 
  # a.size = y
&lt;/source&gt;

Luckily, we have special functions to do just that: attr_accessor, attr_reader, attr_writer.
attr_accessor will give you get/set functionality, reader will give only getter and writer will give only setter.

Now reduced to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class GotAccessor
    def initialize(size)
      @size = size
    end
    
    attr_accessor :size
  end
  
  # attr_accessor generates variable @size accessor methods automatically:
  # a = GotAccessor.new(5)
  # x = a.size 
  # a.size = y
&lt;/source&gt;

==Inheritance==
[[File:calling_super_in_ruby.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The ''super'' keyword only accessing the direct parents method.  There is a workaround though.]]
A class can ''inherit'' functionality and variables from a ''superclass'', sometimes referred to as a ''parent class'' or ''base class''.  Ruby does not support ''multiple inheritance'' and so a class in Ruby can have only one superclass.  The syntax is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  
  class ParentClass
    def a_method
      puts 'b'
    end
  end
  
  class SomeClass &lt; ParentClass  # &lt; means inherit (or &quot;extends&quot; if you are from Java background)
    def another_method
      puts 'a'
    end
  end
  
  instance = SomeClass.new
  instance.another_method
  instance.a_method
&lt;/source&gt;  
Outputs:

   a
   b

All non-private variables and functions are inherited by the child class from the superclass.

If your class overrides a method from parent class (superclass), you still can access the parent's method by using 'super' keyword.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class ParentClass
    def a_method
      puts 'b'
    end
  end
  
  class SomeClass &lt; ParentClass  
    def a_method
      super
      puts 'a'
    end
  end
  
  instance = SomeClass.new
  instance.a_method
&lt;/source&gt;
Outputs:
   b
   a

(because a_method also did invoke the method from parent class).

If you have a deep inheritance line, and still want to access some parent class (superclass) methods directly, you can't. ''super'' only gets you a direct parent's method. But there is a workaround! When inheriting from a class, you can alias parent class method to a different name. Then you can access methods by alias.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class X
    def foo
      &quot;hello&quot;
    end
  end
  
  class Y &lt; X
    alias xFoo foo
    def foo
      xFoo + &quot;y&quot;
    end
  end

  class Z &lt; Y
    def foo
      xFoo + &quot;z&quot;
    end
  end
  
  puts X.new.foo
  puts Y.new.foo
  puts Z.new.foo
&lt;/source&gt;
Outputs

  hello
  helloy
  helloz

==Mixing in Modules==

First, you need to read up on modules [http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_modules.html Ruby modules]. Modules are a way of grouping together some functions and variables and classes, somewhat like classes, but more like namespaces. So a module is not really a class. You can't instantiate a Module, and a module cannot use Self to refer to itself. Modules can have module methods (as classes can have class methods) and instances methods as well.

We can, though, include the module into a class. Mix it in, so to speak. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
module A
  def a1
    puts 'a1 is called'
  end
end

module B
  def b1
    puts 'b1 is called'
  end
end

module C
  def c1
    puts 'c1 is called'
  end
end

class Test
  include A
  include B
  include C

  def display
    puts 'Modules are included'
  end
end

object=Test.new
object.display
object.a1
object.b1
object.c1
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Modules are included
a1 is called
b1 is called
c1 is called
&lt;/source&gt;

The code shows Multiple Inheritance using modules.

==Ruby Class Meta-Model==
In keeping with the Ruby principle that everything is an object, classes are themselves instances of the class Class.  They are stored in constants under the scope of the [[Module|module]] in which they are declared.  A call to a method on an object instance is delegated to a variable inside the object that contains a reference to the class of that object.  The method implementation exists on the Class instance object itself.  Class methods are implemented on meta-classes that are linked to the existing class instance objects in the same way that those classes instances are linked to them.  These meta-classes are hidden from most Ruby functions.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{General Mechanics}}

The fundamental idea of kinematics is the discussion of the movement of objects, without actually taking into account what caused the movement to occur. By using simple calculus, we can find all of the equations for kinematics. To simplify the learning process, we will only consider objects that move with constant acceleration. For the first few parts, we will also assume that there is no friction or air resistance acting on the objects.

=Straight Line Motion (SLM)=
The name of this section '''Straight Line Motion''' means that we begin learning about the subject of kinematics by observing motion in one dimension. This means that we will only take one axis of a 3D &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system into account. We will be using the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis as our axis of motion.

Throughout our discussion, we will look at the motion of a '''rigid body''', one that does not deform as it moves. We idealize the rigid body by assuming that it has no dimensions and is infinitely small. This way we can talk about the entire body instead of saying, &quot;The front of the body is at this point while the rear of the body is at some other point&quot;. Also, subscripts on the variables in our equations will indicate the initial value, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and the final value, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, of that variable.

== Displacement ==

To start off with we will define the term '''displacement'''. Displacement is basically the shortest route of getting from one place to another, basically it is a straight line from the starting point of motion to the ending point of motion. No matter how much movement takes place in between and what sort of things come inbetween, we only care about the first location and the second location. We will use the variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, to stand for the locations of the rigid body that we are discussing. It is a vector quantity i.e. it has both magnitude and direction, if we want to define displacement for some movement then it would be like - '50 km due North'. 

In order to define motion we first must be able to say how far an object has moved. This is done by subtracting the final value of the displacement by the initial value of the displacement. Or, in other words, we subtract the initial position of the object on our coordinate system from the final position of the object on our coordinate system. It is necessary to understand that the values which you receive for this variable can be either positive or negative depending on how the object is moving and where your coordinates start:

:&lt;math&gt;x=x_f-x_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Velocity ==

The term '''velocity''', &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, is often mistaken as being equivalent to the term '''speed'''. The basic difference between speed and velocity is that, velocity is a vector quantity, whereas speed is a scalar quantity. The term '''velocity''' refers to the displacement that an object traveled divided by the amount of time it took to move to its new coordinate. From the above discussion you can see that if the object moves backwards with respect to our coordinate system, then we will get a negative displacement. Since we cannot have a negative value for time, we will then get a negative value for velocity( Here the negative sign shows that the body has moved in the backward direction to the coordinates system adopted). The term '''speed''', on the other hand refers to the magnitude of the velocity, so that it can only be a positive value. We will not be considering speed in this discussion, only velocity. By using our definition of velocity and the definition of displacement from above, we can express velocity mathematically like this:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar v={(x_f-x_i) \over (t_f-t_i)}&lt;/math&gt;  

The line over the velocity means that you are finding the average velocity, not the velocity at a specific point. This equation can be rearranged in a variety of ways in order to solve problems in physics dealing with SLM. Also, by having acceleration as a constant value, we can find the average velocity of an object if we are given the initial and final values of an object's velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar v={(v_f+v_i) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be combined with the other equations to give useful relationships in order to solve straight line motion problems. For example, to find the initial position of an object, if we are given its final position and the times that the object began moving and finished moving, we can rearrange the equation like this:

:&lt;math&gt;x_i=x_f-\bar v(t_f-t_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Acceleration==

The term '''acceleration''' means the change in velocity of an object per unit time. It is a vector quantity. We use the variable, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, to stand for acceleration. Basically, the sign of acceleration tells us whether the velocity is increasing or decreasing, and its magnitude tells us how much the velocity is changing. In order for an object that is initially at rest to move, it needs to accelerate to a certain speed. During this acceleration, the object moves at a certain velocity at a specific time, and travels a certain distance within that time. Thus, we can describe acceleration mathematically like this:

:&lt;math&gt;a={(v_f-v_i) \over (t_f-t_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we can rearrange our formula, this time using our definition for displacement and velocity, to get a very useful relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;x_f=x_i+v_i(t_f-t_i)+{1 \over 2}a(t_f-t_i)^2&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Relationship to Machine Code ==

X86 assembly instructions have a one-to-one relationship with the underlying machine instructions. This means that essentially we can convert assembly instructions into machine instructions with a look-up table. This page will talk about some of the conversions from assembly language to machine language.

== CISC and RISC ==

The x86 architecture is a '''complex instruction set computer''' (CISC) architecture. Amongst other things, this means that the instructions for the x86 architecture are of varying lengths. This can make the processes of assembly, disassembly and instruction decoding more complicated, because the instruction length needs to be calculated for each instruction.

x86 instructions can be anywhere between 1 and 15 bytes long. The length is defined separately for each instruction, depending on the available modes of operation of the instruction, the number of required operands and more.

== 8086 instruction format (16 bit) ==

This is the general instruction form for the 8086 sequentially in main memory:

{| border=1
|Prefixes (optional)
|}
{| border=1
|Opcode (first byte)
|D
|W
|
|}
{| border=1
|Opcode 2 (occasional second byte)
|
|}

{| border=1
|MOD
|Reg
|R/M
|}
{| border=1
|Displacement or data (occasional: 1, 2 or 4 bytes)
|}

;Prefixes: Optional prefixes which change the operation of the instruction
;D:   (1 bit) Direction. 1 = Register is Destination, 0 = Register is source.
;W:   (1 bit) Operation size. 1 = Word, 0 = byte.
;Opcode: the opcode is a 6 bit quantity that determines what instruction family the code is
;MOD (Mod): (2 bits) Register mode.
;Reg: (3 bits) Register. Each register has an identifier.
;R/M (r/m): (3 bits) Register/Memory operand

Not all instructions have W or D bits; in some cases, the width of the operation is either irrelevant or implicit, and for other operations the data direction is irrelevant.

Notice that Intel instruction format is little-endian, which means that the lowest-significance bytes are closest to absolute address 0. Thus, words are stored low-byte first; the value 1234H is stored in memory as 34H 12H. By convention, most-significant bits are always shown to the left within the byte, so 34H would be 00110100B.

After the initial 2 bytes, each instruction can have many additional addressing/immediate data bytes.

=== Mod / Reg / R/M tables ===

{| border=1
|-
|Mod || Displacement
|-
| 00 || If r/m is 110, Displacement (16 bits) is address; otherwise, no displacement
|-
| 01 || Eight-bit displacement, sign-extended to 16 bits
|-
| 10 || 16-bit displacement (example: MOV [BX + SI]+ displacement,al)
|-
| 11 || r/m is treated as a second &quot;reg&quot; field
|}

Note the special meaning of MOD 00, r/m 110. Normally, this would be expected to be the operand [BP]. However, instead the 16-bit displacement is treated as the absolute address. To encode the value [BP], you would use mod = 01, r/m = 110, 8-bit displacement = 0.

=== Example: Absolute addressing ===

Let's translate the following instruction into machine code:

 XOR CL, [12H]

Note that this is XORing CL with the contents of address 12H – the square brackets are a common indirection indicator. The opcode for XOR is &quot;001100dw&quot;. D is 1 because the CL register is the destination. W is 0 because we have a byte of data. Our first byte therefore is &quot;00110010&quot;.

Now, we know that the code for CL is 001. Reg thus has the value 001. The address is specified as a simple displacement, so the MOD value is 00 and the R/M is 110. Byte 2 is thus (00 001 110b).

Byte 3 and 4 contain the effective address, low-order byte first, 0012H as 12H 00H, or (00010010b) (00000000b)

All together,

 XOR CL, [12H] = 00110010 00001110 00010010 00000000 = 32H 0EH 12H 00H

=== Example: Immediate operand ===

Now, if we were to want to use an immediate operand, as follows:

 XOR CL, 12H

In this case, because there are no square brackets, 12H is immediate: it is the number we are going to XOR against. The opcode for an immediate XOR is 1000000w; in this case, we are using a byte, so w is 0. So our first byte is (10000000b).

The second byte, for an immediate operation, takes the form &quot;mod 110 r/m&quot;. Since the destination is a register, mod is 11, making the r/m field a register value. We already know that the register value for CL is 001, so our second byte is (11 110 001b).

The third byte (and fourth byte, if this were a word operation) are the immediate data. As it is a byte, there is only one byte of data, 12H = (00010010b).

All together, then:

 XOR CL, 12H = 10000000 11110001 00010010 = 80H F1H 12H

== x86-32 Instructions (32 bit) ==
The 32-bit instructions are encoded in a very similar way to the 16-bit instructions, except (by default) they act upon dword quantities rather than words. Also, they support a much more flexible memory addressing format, which is made possible by the addition of an SIB &quot;scale-index-base&quot; byte, which follows the ModR/M byte.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Flux. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Flux~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A. Setup NX Server on Fedora Core 3 machine ==
'''From a windows machine, use putty to login as root to Fedora Core 3 machine''' 

1. run command
 	
 rpm -q nc expect

If you get error like &quot;package expact is not installed&quot; or &quot;package nc is not 
installed&quot;,  from fedora core  cds, copy expect-5.42.1-1.i386.rpm and
nc-1.10- 22.i386.rpm  to /root directory  and run commands
    
 cd /root
 rpm -ivh expect-5.42.1-1.i386.rpm
 rpm -ivh nc-1.10-22.i386.rpm 

2. Then to download nx server, run command 

 wget http://fedoranews.org/contributors/rick_stout/freenx/nx-1.5.0-0.FC3.1.i386.rpm
 wget http://fedoranews.org/contributors/rick_stout/freenx/freenx-0.4.4-1.fdr.0.noarch.rpm

3. After download is finished, run command
  rpm -ivh nx-1.5.0-0.FC3.1.i386.rpm
  rpm -ivh  freenx-0.4.4-1.fdr.0.noarch.rpm   

4. create a user called testuser and set password for it with command

  useradd testuser
  password testuser

'''Now your NX Server is UP and running''' 


== B. Setup NX Client on Windows machine ==

1. Download nx client for windows from following link

http://64.34.161.181/download/1.5.0/client/nxclient-1.5.0-132.exe

2. Run '''nxclient-1.5.0-132.exe''' to install nx client

3. Click on  '''Start &gt; Programs &gt; NX Client for Windows &gt; NX Connection Wizard'''

In “Session” type '''Linux'''

In “Host”  type ip address of Fedora Core 3 Server

Click Next

4. Select &quot;Unix&quot;, “Gnome”. Make sure that &quot;Enable SSL encryption on all traffic&quot; is checked and click &quot;Next&quot;. 

5. Check &quot;Show the Advanced Configuration dialog&quot; box and click &quot;Finish&quot;.

6. Click on button &quot;Key...&quot;. It will open '''General – Key Management''' window. Press Alt + Tab to go to putty

On putty, run command '''vi /etc/nxserver/client.id_dsa.key''' and copy the key (To copy, just select the key text on screen. The selected text gets copied on windows clipbord).

Press Alt + Tab to go '''General – Key Management window''' and paste it here.

Click &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Ok&quot;.

7. Now type your login name '''testuser''' that you created on Linux machine and '''your password''' and click on Login button

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

This page is going to discuss the differences between real mode and protected mode operations in the x86 processors. It will also discuss how to enter protected mode, and how to exit protected mode. Modern Operating Systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, BSD, etc...) all operate in protected mode, so most assembly language programmers won't need this information. However, this information will be particularly useful to people who are trying to program kernels or [[X86_Assembly/Bootloaders|bootloaders]].

== Real Mode Operation ==
{{Wikipedia|Real mode}}
When an x86 processor is powered up or reset, it is in real mode. In real mode, the x86 processor essentially acts like a very fast 8086. Only the base instruction set of the processor can be used. Real mode memory address space is limited to 1MiB of addressable memory, and each memory segment is limited to 64KiB. Real Mode is provided essentially for backwards-compatibility with 8086 and 80186 programs.

== Protected Mode Operation ==
{{Wikipedia|Protected mode}}
In protected mode operation, the x86 can address 4 GB of address space. This may map directly onto the physical RAM (in which case, if there is less than 4 GB of RAM, some address space is unused), or paging may be used to arbitrarily translate between virtual addresses and physical addresses.
In Protected mode, the segments in memory can be assigned protection, and attempts to violate this protection cause a &quot;General Protection&quot; exception.

Protected mode in the 386, amongst other things, is controlled by the '''Control Registers''', which are labelled CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4.

Protected mode in the 286 is controlled by the '''Machine Status Word'''.

== Long Mode ==
{{Wikipedia|Long mode}}
Long mode was introduced by AMD with the advent of the Athlon64 processor. Long mode allows the microprocessor to access 64-bit memory space, and access 64-bit long registers. Many 16 and 32-bit instructions do not work (or work correctly) in Long Mode. x86-64 processors in Real mode act exactly the like 16 bit chips, and x86-64 chips in protected mode act exactly like 32-bit processors. To unlock the 64-bit capabilities of the chip, the chip must be switched into Long Mode.

== Entering Protected Mode ==

The lowest 5 bits of the control register CR0 contain 5 flags that determine how the system is going to function. This status register has 1 flag that we are particularly interested in: the &quot;Protected Mode Enable&quot; flag (PE). Here are the general steps to entering protected mode:

#Create a Valid GDT ([[X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table|Global Descriptor Table]])
#Create a 6 byte pseudo-descriptor to point to the GDT
# 
##If [[X86_Assembly/Protected_Mode#Paging | paging]] is going to be used, load CR3 with a valid page table, PDBR, or PML4.
##If PAE (Physical Address Extension) is going to be used, set CR4.PAE = 1.
##If switching to long mode, set IA32_EFER.LME = 1.
#Disable Interrupts (CLI).
#Load an IDT pseudo-descriptor that has a null limit (this prevents the real mode IDT from being used in protected mode)
#Set the PE bit (and the PG bit if paging is going to be enabled) of the MSW or CR0 register
#Execute a far jump (in case of switching to long mode, even if the destination code segment is a 64-bit code segment, the offset must not exceed 32-bit since the far jump instruction is executed in compatibility mode)
#Load data segment registers with valid selector(s) to prevent GP exceptions when interrupts happen
#Load SS:(E)SP with a valid stack
#Load an IDT pseudo-descriptor that points to the IDT
#Enable Interrupts.

Following sections will talk more about these steps.

== Entering Long Mode ==

To enter Long Mode on a 64-bit x86 processor (x86-64):

#If paging is enabled, disable paging.
#If CR4.PAE is not already set, set it.
#Set IA32_EFER.LME = 1.
#Load CR3 with a valid PML4 table.
#Enable paging.
#At this point you will be in compatibility mode. A far jump may be executed to switch to long mode. However, the offset must not exceed 32-bit.

== Using the CR Registers ==

Many bits of the CR registers only influence behavior in protected mode.

=== CR0 ===

The CR0 32-bit register has 6 bits that are of interest to us. The low 5 bits of the CR0 register, and the highest bit. Here is a representation of CR0:

 CR0: |PG|----RESERVED----|NE|ET|TS|EM|MP|PE|


;PE: Bit 0. The Protected Environment flag.  This flag puts the system into protected mode when set.
;MP: Bit 1. The Monitor Coprocessor flag. This flag controls the operation of the &quot;WAIT&quot; instruction.
;EM: Bit 2. The Emulate flag. When this flag is set, coprocessor instructions will generate an exception.
;TS: Bit 3. The Task Switched flag. This flag is set automatically when the processor switches to a new task.
;ET: Bit 4. The Extension Type flag. ET (also called &quot;R&quot;) tells us which type of coprocessor is installed. If ET = 0, an 80287 is installed. if ET = 1, an 80387 is installed.
;NE: Bit 5. New exceptions. If this flag is clear, FPU exceptions arrive as interrupts. If set, as exceptions. 
;PG: Bit 31. The Paging flag. When this flag is set, memory paging is enabled. We will talk more about that in a second.

=== CR2 ===

CR2 contains a value called the '''Page Fault Linear Address''' (PFLA). When a page fault occurs, the address that access was attempted on is stored in CR2.

=== CR3 === 

The upper 20 bits of CR3 are called the '''Page Directory Base Register''' (PDBR). The PDBR holds the physical address of the page directory.

=== CR4 ===

CR4 contains several flags controlling advanced features of the processor.

== Paging ==

Paging is a special job that microprocessors can perform to make the available amount of memory in a system appear larger and more dynamic than it actually is. In a paging system, a certain amount of space may be laid aside on the hard drive (or on any secondary storage) called the '''swap file''' or '''swap partition'''. The '''virtual memory''' of the system is everything a program can access like memory, and includes physical RAM and the swap space.

The total virtual memory is broken down into chunks or '''pages''' of memory, each usually being 4096 bytes (although this number can be different on different systems). These pages can then be moved around throughout the virtual memory, and all pointers inside those pages will be automatically directed to point to the new locations by referencing them to a global paging directory that the microprocessor maintains. The pointer to the current paging directory is stored in the CR3 register.

A '''page fault''' occurs when the system attempts to read from a page that is marked as &quot;not present&quot; in the paging directory/table, when the system attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a currently available page, or when any number of other errors occur in the paging system. When a page fault occurs, the accessed memory address is stored in the CR2 register.

== Other Modes ==

In addition to real, protected, and long modes, there are other modes that x86 processors can enter, for different uses :

* Virtual 8086 Mode: This is a mode in which application software that was written to run in real mode is executed under the supervision of a protected-mode, multi-tasking OS.

* System Management Mode: This mode enables the processor to perform system tasks, like power management, without disrupting the operating system or other software.</text>

These &quot;Advanced x86&quot; chapters all cover specialized topics that might not be of interest to the average assembly programmer. However, these chapters should be of some interest to people who would like to work on low-level programming tasks, such as [[w:Booting#Boot_loader | boot loaders]], [[w:Device driver | device drivers]], and Operating System [[w:Kernel (computing) | kernels]]. A programmer does not need to read the following chapters to say they &quot;know assembly&quot;, although they may be interesting. The topics covered in this section are:
*[[x86 Assembly/High-Level Languages|High-Level Languages]]
*[[x86 Assembly/Machine Language Conversion|Machine Language Conversion]]

The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a table in memory that defines the processor's memory segments. The GDT sets the behavior of the segment registers and helps to ensure that protected mode operates smoothly.

== GDTR ==
The GDT is pointed to by a special register in the x86 chip, the '''GDT Register''', or simply the GDTR. The GDTR is 48 bits long. The lower 16 bits tell the size of the GDT, and the upper 32 bits tell the location of the GDT in memory. Here is a layout of the GDTR:

 |LIMIT|----BASE----|

LIMIT is the size of the GDT, and BASE is the starting address. LIMIT is 1 less than the length of the table, so if LIMIT has the value 15, then the GDT is 16 bytes long.

To load the GDTR, the instruction '''LGDT''' is used:

 lgdt [gdtr]

Where &lt;code&gt;gdtr&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to 6 bytes of memory containing the desired GDTR value. Note that to complete the process of loading a new GDT, the segment registers need to be reloaded. The '''CS''' register must be loaded using a far jump:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
flush_gdt:
    lgdt [gdtr]
    jmp 0x08:complete_flush
 
complete_flush:
    mov ax, 0x10
    mov ds, ax
    mov es, ax
    mov fs, ax
    mov gs, ax
    mov ss, ax
    ret
&lt;/source&gt;

== GDT ==
{{Wikipedia|Global Descriptor Table}}
The GDT table contains a number of entries called '''Segment Descriptors'''. Each is 8 bytes long and contains information on the starting point of the segment, the length of the segment, and the access rights of the segment.

The following NASM-syntax code represents a single GDT entry:

 struc gdt_entry_struct
 
 	limit_low:   resb 2
 	base_low:    resb 2
 	base_middle: resb 1
 	access:      resb 1
 	granularity: resb 1
 	base_high:   resb 1
 
 endstruc

== LDT ==
{{Wikipedia|Local Descriptor Table}}
Each separate program will receive, from the operating system, a number of different memory segments for use. The characteristics of each local memory segment are stored in a data structure called the '''Local Descriptor Table''' (LDT). The GDT contains pointers to each LDT.</text>

==Liver anatomy==
The liver is divided anatomically into the left and right lobes, but surgically is divided into the left and right liver which does not correlate with the anatomic lobes.  The left and right liver contain four segments each. 
*The left part of the liver contains segments I to IV: 
**caudate lobe (I)
**lateral segment (II and III)
**medial segment (IV).  Division between lateral and medial segment is a line between the gallbladder and IVC, which is the same as dividing at the falciform ligament.  
*The right part of the liver consists of segments V to VIII: 
**anterior segment (V and VIII) 
**posterior segment (VI and VII).  The division between the anterior and posterior segments is the right hepatic vein.  The divison between the anterior segment from the left part of the liver ist he middle hepatic vein.  


==Child-Pugh Scoring==
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1-3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement.

==Liver RT Tolerance==
Whole liver radiation tolerance is ~30 Gy, which is not sufficient for &quot;cure&quot; but is sufficient for palliation of painful disease. Partial liver tolerance depends on the volume irradiated. Partial liver dose escalation to 70+ Gy has been reported, and there does appear to be some dose-response relationship. Similarly, efforts are underway to explore the role of stereotactic radiosurgery, with single doses as high as 26 Gy reported.

==EBRT Whole Liver==
Given the low whole-liver tolerance (~30 Gy), whole liver RT has been used historically (prior to development of conformal therapy) for palliation of painful primary and metastatic liver disease. Up to 90% of patients may report improvement in pain control. Overall survival is short (~6 months), and not improved with RT. Several RTOG attempts at improving whole-liver RT efficacy have not shown much benefit (hyperfractionation, misonidazole radiosensitization, radiolabelled antiferritin and CEA antibodies).

***Prospective, phase I. 43 patients with unresectable intrahepatic hepatobiliary cancer (27 patients) and colorectal liver mets (16 patients). Large tumors (10x10x8). Median dose 58.5 Gy (1.5 BID) with concurrent FUdR.

***Phase I/II. 22 patients with CRC mets, RT dose escalation + IAH FdUrd. RT given as 1.5-1.65 Gy/fx BID split-course to 48-72.6 Gy, depending on liver volume treated
***Response: 50% CR/PR; median survival 20 months. PR - 2 in-field failures, SD/PD - 5 in-field failures
***Toxicity: no clinical RILS
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined conformal radiation therapy and IAH FdUrd can produce an objective response in 50% of patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. However, response was not durable, and hepatic progression was frequent. Improvements in hepatic tumor control for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer may require higher doses of conformal radiation and/or improved radiosensitization. In an effort to increase radiosensitization, we have recently initiated a clinical trial combining IAH bromode-oxyuridine, a thymidine analog radiosensitizer, with conformal high dose radiation therapy.&quot;

***26 patients with non-met primary HB cancer (6 diffuse HCC, 11 localized HCC, 9 CCA) treated with conformal RT (48-72.6 Gy @ 1.5/1.65 Gy/fx BID) + intraarterial FdUrd (see 1991 Lawrence below)
***Toxicity: 2 patient radiation hepatitis, 7 patients &gt;= Grade III toxicity (5/7 whole liver RT)
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These findings suggest that three-dimensional planned focal liver radiation and IAH FdUrd can produce a high, durable response rate and an encouraging median survival duration in patients with nondiffuse, unresectable primary hepatobiliary cancer.&quot;

***Phase I/II trial of RT (30 Gy total liver @ 1.5 Gy/fx BID + 15/30 Gy boost depending on DVH) + intraarterial FdUrd as radiosensitizer; 33 patients reported

**Prospective. 27 patients with unresectable HCC who failed TACE; mean tumor 7.2 cm, treated with conformal RT mean 51.8 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fx
**Response: 67% PR/CR, median survival 14 months from RT
**Toxicity: acute LFTs, thrombocytopenia, gastroduodenal ulcer/duodenitis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In unresectable HCC patients who failed with TACE, local RT induced a substantial tumor response of 66.7%, with a 3-year survival rate of 21.4% and a median survival time of 14 months. Toxicity was significant but manageable. Although we do not know if there is survival benefit through this treatment, local RT in these patients seems to be valuable as a salvage for TACE-failed HCC.&quot;

**Prospective. 13 patients (9 3D-CRT alone, 4 3D-CRT + TACE)
**Tumor median 15 cm (6-25cm); dose 40-60 Gy; PR 58%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our experience indicates that HCC is more radiosensitive than it was traditionally expected. Three-dimensional reconstruction of tumour and surrounding organs helps to avoid excessive exposure of the liver and adjacent organs to RT and makes it a safer treatment modality for unresectable HCC.&quot;

**C-C variation: individual 4.1-10.8 mm, group 7.0 mm
**Initial static plan overestimated volume of liver treated to high dose, shifting some areas to lower doses due to setup uncertainties

**Retrospective. 18 patients with 27 tumors. Pre-op CT or MRI imaging compared to gross path
**Median radiographic size 2.9cm, median pathologic size 2.5cm. Radiographic size greater in 81% tumors
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our study shows that in most instances (81%), imaging by CT or MRI overestimates true gross pathologic size of HCC. Nineteen percent of tumors appeared smaller on preoperative imaging than on the final pathologic specimen. Radiation therapy utilizing a 0.5 or 1.0 cm margin around the radiographic tumor would have encompassed the gross pathologic tumor in 93% and 100% of cases, respectively.&quot;

**15 patients initially planned with 3D-CRT, replanned with IMRT to maximize generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) and NTCP
**IMRT significantly increased max gEUD by 11 Gy (high grade), 18 Gy (low grade), and 10 Gy (nonoverlap)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We have successfully used mathematical/biologic models directly as cost functions within the optimizing process to produce IMRT plans that maximize the gEUD while maintaining compliance with a well-defined protocol for the treatment of intrahepatic cancer. For both PTV-organ-at-risk overlap and nonoverlap situations, IMRT has the capacity to improve the maximal dose achievable across the PTV, expressed in terms of the gEUD. The use of multiple noncoplanar beams appears to confer an advantage over fewer beams in cases with PTV-organ-at-risk overlap. When liver toxicity is the dose-limiting factor, high gEUD values are obtained most frequently when the field arrangement is chosen to provide the shortest possible transhepatic path length.&quot;

**Average GTV difference 11cc (1-263); CT GTV larger in 3/7 mets, 4/4 CCA, 6/11 HCA
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;MR defined GTVs can be significantly different than CT defined GTVs and this should be considered for high precision liver cancer radiotherapy.&quot;

**Prospective. 10 patients, 177 treatments. Evaluation of Varian Real-Time Positioning Monitor
**Reproducible decrease in organ motion with gating enabled reduction in GTV-to-PTV margin from 2 to 1 cm. Calculated dose increased 7%-27% (median 21%)

**Retrospective. 12/68 HCC patients developed RILD, and replanned with IMRT 5F step-shoot
**Comparable target coverage, IMRT better with SC, similar kidney, stomach. IMRT significant reduction in NTCP (24% vs. 37%, p=0.009) but significant increase in mean dose (29.2 vs. 25.0 Gy, p=0.009)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;IMRT is capable of preserving acceptable target coverage and improving or at least maintaining the nonhepatic organ sparing for patients with HCC and previously diagnosed RILD after 3D-CRT. The true impact of this technique on the liver remains unsettled and may depend on the exact volume effect of this organ.&quot;

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radiotherapy using ABC for patients with intrahepatic cancer is feasible, with good intrafraction reproducibility of liver position using ABC. However, the interfraction reproducibility of organ position with ABC suggests the need for daily on-line imaging and repositioning if treatment margins smaller than those required for free breathing are a goal.&quot;

This allows a high-dose focal radiotherapy of these lesions. However, a control CT scan should be performed directly before therapy to confirm set-up accuracy and possibly prompt necessary corrections.

Interrupts are special routines that are defined on a per-system basis. This means that the interrupts on one system might be different from the interrupts on another system. Therefore, it is usually a bad idea to rely heavily on interrupts when you are writing code that needs to be portable.

== What is an Interrupt? ==
{{Wikipedia|Interrupt}}

In modern operating systems, the programmer often doesn't need to use interrupts. In Windows, for example, the programmer conducts business with the Win32 API. However, these API calls interface with the kernel, and the kernel will often trigger interrupts to perform different tasks. In older operating systems (specifically DOS), the programmer didn't have an API to use, and so they had to do all their work through interrupts.

== Interrupt Instruction ==
{{x86-inst-1|int}}

This instruction issues the specified interrupt. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
int 0x0A
&lt;/source&gt;

Calls interrupt 10 (0x0A (hex) = 10 (decimal)).

== Types of Interrupts ==
There are 3 types of interrupts: Hardware Interrupts, Software Interrupts and Exceptions.

=== Hardware Interrupts ===
Hardware interrupts are triggered by hardware devices. For instance, when you type on your keyboard, the keyboard triggers a hardware interrupt. The processor stops what it is doing, and executes the code that handles keyboard input (typically reading the key you pressed into a buffer in memory). Hardware interrupts are typically asynchronous - their occurrence is unrelated to the instructions being executed at the time they are raised.

=== Software Interrupts ===
There are also a series of software interrupts that are usually used to transfer control to a function in the operating system kernel. Software interrupts are triggered by the instruction '''int'''. For example, the instruction &quot;int 14h&quot; triggers interrupt 0x14. The processor then stops the current program, and jumps to the code to handle interrupt 14. When interrupt handling is complete, the processor returns flow to the original program.

=== Exceptions ===
Exceptions are caused by exceptional conditions in the code which is executing, for example an attempt to divide by zero or access a protected memory area. The processor will detect this problem, and transfer control to a handler to service the exception. This handler may re-execute the offending code after changing some value (for example, the zero dividend), or if this cannot be done, the program causing the exception may be terminated.

==External Beam==
Given the low whole-liver tolerance (~30 Gy), whole liver RT has been used historically (prior to development of conformal therapy) for palliation of painful primary and metastatic liver disease. Up to 90% of patients may report improvement in pain control. Overall survival is short (~6 months), and not improved with RT. Several RTOG attempts at improving whole-liver RT efficacy have not shown much benefit (hyperfractionation, misonidazole radiosensitization, radiolabelled antiferritin antibody).


*'''Meta-RTOG''' PMID 9612600 -- ''Survival results among patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis of three sequential treatments of the RTOG and Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.'' ('''1998 Abrams''' RA, Cancer J Sci Am. 1998 May-Jun;4(3):178-84.)
**Meta-analysis of 1) RTOG 83-19, 2) Hopkins pilot study, 3) RTOG 88-23 during 1983-1991
**Induction (EBRT 21.0 Gy at 3.0 Gy/fx) + radiosensitizing chemo, followed by 1) doxorubicin + 5-FU +/- 131-I-antiferritin, 2) intrahepatic artery cisplatin, or 3) intrahepatic artery cisplatin +/- 131-I-antiferritin, respectively.
**131-I-antiferritin: no improvement on survival, dramatic increase in hematologic toxicity
**Intrahepatic artery cisplatin: significantly better than doxorubicin/5-FU
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with unresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post-induction cycles of intra-arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5-FU. Intravenous 131I-polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post-induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities.&quot;

('''1993 Russell''' AH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 1;27(1):117-23.)
**Phase I/II. Dose escalation 27 -&gt; 33 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID
**No patients at 30 Gy showed RILD, 10% patients at 33 Gy showed RILD (study closed)
**No impact on OS
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation, however, it did succeed in determining that 33 Gy in fractions of 1.5 Gy is unsafe, carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury. The absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 Gy and 30 Gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose (21 Gy) to fully test the question.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

In the chapter on [[x86 Assembly/X86 Interrupts|Interrupts]], we mentioned the fact that there are such a thing as software interrupts, and they can be installed by the system. This page will go more in-depth about that process, and will talk about how ISRs are installed, how the system finds the ISR, and how the processor actually performs an interrupt.

{{Wikipedia|Interrupt}}

== Interrupt Service Routines ==

The actual code that is invoked when an interrupt occurs is called the '''Interrupt Service Routine''' (ISR). When an exception occurs, a program invokes an interrupt, or the hardware raises an interrupt, the processor uses one of several methods (to be discussed) to transfer control to the ISR, whilst allowing the ISR to safely return control to whatever it interrupted after execution is complete. At minimum, FLAGS and CS:IP are saved and the ISR's CS:IP loaded; however, some mechanisms cause a full task switch to occur before the ISR begins (and another task switch when it ends).

== The Interrupt Vector Table ==

In the original 8086 processor (and all x86 processors in Real Mode), the '''Interrupt Vector Table''' controlled the flow into an ISR. The IVT started at memory address 0x00, and could go as high as 0x3FF, for a maximum number of 256 ISRs (ranging from interrupt 0 to 255). Each entry in the IVT contained 2 words of data: A value for IP and a value for CS (in that order). For example, let's say that we have the following interrupt:

 int 14h

When we trigger the interrupt, the processor goes to the 20th location in the IVT (14h = 20). Since each table entry is 4 bytes (2 bytes IP, 2 bytes CS), the microprocessor goes to location [4*14H]=[50H]. At location 50H is the new IP value, and at location 52H is the new CS value. Hardware and software interrupts are all stored in the IVT, so installing a new ISR is as easy as writing a function pointer into the IVT. In newer x86 models, the IVT was replaced with the Interrupt Descriptor Table.

When interrupts occur in real mode, the FLAGS register is pushed onto the stack, followed by CS, then IP. The '''iret''' instruction restores CS:IP and FLAGS, allowing the interrupted program to continue unaffected. For hardware interrupts, all other registers (including the general-purpose registers) ''must'' be explicitly preserved (e.g. if an interrupt routine makes use of AX, it should push AX when it begins and pop AX when it ends). It is good practice for software interrupts to preserve all registers except those containing return values. More importantly, any registers that ''are'' modified must be documented.

== The Interrupt Descriptor Table ==
{{Wikipedia|Interrupt Descriptor Table}}
Since the 286 (but extended on the 386), interrupts may be managed by a table in memory called the '''Interrupt Descriptor Table''' (IDT). The IDT only comes into play when the processor is in protected mode. Much like the IVT, the IDT contains a listing of pointers to the ISR routine; however, there are now three ways to invoke ISRs:

* Task Gates: These cause a task switch, allowing the ISR to run in its own context (with its own LDT, etc.). Note that IRET may still be used to return from the ISR, since the processor sets a bit in the ISR's task segment that causes IRET to perform a task switch to return to the previous task.
* Interrupt Gates: These are similar to the original interrupt mechanism, placing EFLAGS, CS and EIP on the stack. The ISR may be located in a segment of equal or higher privilege to the currently executing segment, but not of lower privilege (higher privileges are ''numerically lower'', with level 0 being the highest privilege).
* Trap Gates: These are identical to interrupt gates, except they do not clear the interrupt flag.


The following NASM structure represents an IDT entry:

 struc idt_entry_struct
 
 	base_low:  resb 2
 	sel:       resb 2
 	always0:   resb 1
 	flags:     resb 1
 	base_high: resb 2
 
 endstruc

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Field
! Interrupt Gate
! Trap Gate
! Task Gate
|- 
! base_low
| colspan=2 | Low word of entry address of ISR
| Unused
|-
! sel
| colspan=2 | Segment selector of ISR
| TSS descriptor
|-
! always0
| colspan=2 | Bits 5, 6, and 7 should be 0. Bits 0-4 are unused and can be left as zero.
| Unused, can be left as zero.
|-
! flags
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 01110, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 01111, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 00101, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
|-
! base_high
| colspan=2 | High word of entry address of ISR
| Unused
|-
|}

where:
* DPL is the Descriptor Privilege Level (0 to 3, with 0 being highest privilege)
* The Present bit indicates whether the segment is present in RAM. If this bit is 0, a '''Segment Not Present''' fault (Exception 11) will ensue if the interrupt is triggered.

These ISRs are usually installed and managed by the operating system. Only tasks with sufficient privilege to modify the IDT's contents may directly install ISRs.

The ISR itself must be placed in appropriate segments (and, if using task gates, the appropriate TSS must be set up), particularly so that the privilege is never lower than that of executing code. ISRs for unpredictable interrupts (such as hardware interrupts) should be placed in privilege level 0 (which is the highest privilege), so that this rule is not violated while a privilege-0 task is running.

Note that ISRs, particularly hardware-triggered ones, should ''always'' be present in memory unless there is a good reason for them not to be. Most hardware interrupts need to be dealt with promptly, and swapping causes significant delay. Also, some hardware ISRs (such as the hard disk ISR) might be ''required'' during the swapping process. Since hardware-triggered ISRs interrupt processes at unpredictable times, device driver programmers are encouraged to keep ISRs very short. Often an ISR simply organises for a kernel task to do the necessary work; this kernel task will be run at the next suitable opportunity. As a result of this, hardware-triggered ISRs are generally very small and little is gained by swapping them to the disk.

However, it may be desirable to set the present bit to 0, even though the ISR actually is present in RAM. The OS can use the Segment Not Present handler for some other function, for instance to monitor interrupt calls.

== IDT Register ==

The x86 contains a register whose job is to keep track of the IDT. This register is called the '''IDT Register''', or simply &quot;IDTR&quot;. the IDT register is 48 bits long. The lower 16 bits are called the LIMIT section of the IDTR, and the upper 32 bits are called the BASE section of the IDTR:

 |LIMIT|----BASE----|

The BASE is the base address of the IDT in memory. The IDT can be located anywhere in memory, so the BASE needs to point to it. The LIMIT field contains the current length of the IDT.

To load the IDTR, the instruction '''LIDT''' is used:

 lidt [idtr]

== Interrupt Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|int}}

calls the specified interrupt

{{x86-inst|into 0x04}} 

calls interrupt 4 if the overflow flag is set

{{x86-inst|iret}}

returns from an interrupt service routine (ISR).

=== Default ISR ===
A good programming practice is to provide a default ISR that can be used as placeholder for unused interrupts. This is to prevent execution of random code if an unrecognized interrupt is raised. The default ISR can be as simple as a single '''iret''' instruction.

Note, however, that under DOS (which is in real mode), certain IVT entries contain pointers to important, but not necessarily executable, locations. For instance, entry 0x1D is a far pointer to a video initialisation parameter table for video controllers, entry 0x1F is a pointer to the graphical character bitmap table.

== Disabling Interrupts ==

Sometimes it is important that a routine is not interrupted unexpectedly. For this reason, the x86 allows hardware interrupts to be disabled if necessary. This means the processor will ignore any interrupt signal it receives from the interrupt controller. Usually the controller will simply keep waiting until the processor accepts the interrupt signal, so the interrupts are delayed rather than rejected.

The x86 has an ''interrupt flag'' (IF) in the FLAGS register. When this flag is set to 0, hardware interrupts are disabled, otherwise they are enabled. The command '''cli''' sets this flag to 0, and '''sti''' sets it to 1. Instructions that load values into the FLAGS register (such as '''popf''' and '''iret''') may also modify this flag.

Note that this flag does not affect the '''int''' instruction or processor exceptions; only hardware-generated interrupts. Also note that in protected mode, code running with less privilege than IOPL will generate an exception if it uses '''cli''' or '''sti'''. This means that the operating system can disallow &quot;user&quot; programs from disabling interrupts and thus gaining control of the system.

Interrupts are automatically disabled when an interrupt handler begins; this ensures the handler will not be interrupted (unless it issues '''sti'''). Software such as device drivers might require precise timing and for this reason should not be interrupted. This can also help avoid problems if the same interrupt occurs twice in a short space of time. Note that the '''iret''' instruction restores the state of FLAGS before the interrupt handler began, thus allowing further interrupts to occur after the interrupt handler is complete.

Interrupts should also be disabled when performing certain system tasks, such as when entering protected mode. This consists of performing several steps, and if the processor tried to invoke an interrupt handler before this process was complete, it would be in danger of causing an exception, executing invalid code, trashing memory, or causing some other problem.</text>

==What are Variables?==
TI-Basic is unusual among programming languages in that it does not support actual variables. Instead, all data are treated like files; there is no distinction between an ordinary number and an image, for example. TI refers to all files as &quot;variables;&quot; henceforth &quot;variable&quot; will refer to a file usable by a program.
&quot;Variables&quot; are the meat of any programming language - they are used to store and work with data. With variables, the outcomes of programs can differ depending on the user's input or the purpose of the program.  Variables in the TI calculators can store different types of data, whether it be numbers, lists of numbers, strings, mathematical functions, etc.  However, each data type has its own type of variable that it can be stored in and the rules must be followed fairly strictly.

==Storing and Recalling Variables==
Variables can be stored and recalled at the Homescreen (the startup screen), or within a program by simply using that variables name.  For example, to recall the variable X at the Homescreen, one would simply type X and hit enter (which would display 10 if X was ten):
{{bcode:FOutput|
X
              10
}}
or to recall Str1:
{{bcode:FOutput|
Str1
      HELLO WORLD
}}
The format to recall any variable is the same.

To store a value to a variable, you simply state the value you are trying to store, hit the store key (it looks like &quot;STO›&quot;), then the variable you are storing to, and then hit enter.  For example, making X equal to 52.5 would be as follows:

{{bcode:FOutput|
52.5→X
            52.5
}}

It should be noted that 52.5 was displayed after hitting enter on the homescreen.  This is because it also recalled the value of the variable after storing it.  In programming, the variable isn't actually recalled, but rather the variable in used in some sort of equation.  See the individual examples for more help.

==Types of Basic Variables==
There are many types of variables, but in this chapter, only the most common ones will be dealt with.  The [[Programming:TI-Basic:Advanced Variables|Advanced Variables]] section, will deal with the more complex variable types and uses.  The following sections will deal with:
*Real Numbers (i.e. 52.5)
*Lists (1,2,3,4,5)
*Strings (&quot;APPLES&quot;)

----
===Real Numbers===
For easability in this section/chapter, it should be noted that the variables 'A' through 'Z' and the variable theta are considered to be Real Number Variables.

Real number variables store both an integer and decimal part of a number.  Examples of real numbers are 0, 2.1, 5, 7.212 or 3.1415926.  Reals are accurate up to eight significant digits and can be in the range of -9e99 to 9e99 (that is 9*10^99).  If an attempt is tried to exceed this limit the calculator returns an error.
====Syntax====
To store a number to a Real Variable, the syntax is as follows:
{{bcode:Syntax|
''value''→''variable''
|
*Where ''value'' is a literal value, a variable, or an expression and
*Where ''variable'' is the variable to store ''value'' to
**Can be 'A' through 'Z' or theta.
***The variables are accessed by pressing the green ALPHA key, then finding the corresponding green character key on the keypad.
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
5.32→X
}}
====Ex: Variable====
{{bcode:Example|
A→X
}}
====Ex: Equation====
{{bcode:Example|
10/2+36+89/A→X
}}&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note:  In this example, if A was 89, X would be 42, not the actual equation.  Only the result of an equation is stored to X (the equation is 5+36+89/89 = 42, so X is 42)&lt;/small&gt;
----

===Lists===
For easability in this section/chapter, all lists will be considered as Real Number Lists.

Lists are basically what they sound like - lists of numbers.  They are considered by some to be the same as an array.  They store a series of numbers which are the same datatype (for this section we will assume that it is a Real Number List).  The individual numbers of a list are named elements.

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
{''value1'',''value2'',...,''valueN''}→''listName''
|
*Where ''value1'',''value2'' through ''valueN' are real number elements
**The number of elements (values) in a list is only limited by the memory of the calculator
**The minimum number of elements a list can contain is 0.
*Where ''listName'' is the name of a list.  This can be one of two types:
**Calculator defined:  L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6
**User defined:  a calculator 'L' (found via the list menu) followed by characters denoting the name
*The amount of elements in a list may not exceed 999.
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}→L1
}}

====Ex: Custom Named list====
{{bcode:Example|
{1,2,3,4,5}→&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;MYLIST
}}

====Ex: List to List====
{{bcode:Example|
L1→L2
}}
====Ex: Equations====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}+5→L1
}}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*Note:&lt;/nowiki&gt;  In this example, L1 would consist of {20,25,35} because each element was increased by five then stored to L1&lt;/small&gt;

----

===Strings===

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
''string''→''strN''
|
*Where ''string'' is the string literal, or some other form of string to store to ''strN'' and
*Where ''strN'' is one of the predefined strings for the calculator.  These are Str1, Str2, Str3, Str4, Str5, Str6, Str7, Str8, Str9 and Str0
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS BOB&quot;→Str1
}}
====Ex: Str to Str====
{{bcode:Example|
St1→Str2
}}
====Ex: Concatenation/Combination====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS &quot;+St1+&quot; AND YOU KNOW IT!&quot;→Str2
}}

The string variables can be accessed by pushing [VARS], selecting ''Strings'', then choosing the desired string variable.

In many cases it is advisable to prepare Word files, in order to avoid a number of well-known problems. The following is a little check-list that can be used as a guideline. 
(This list is based on material from one of the excellent courses run by Judy Ann Schoen [http://www.edv-und-seminare.de])

* Accept all changes and switch off track-changes mode. 
* Delete all comments. 
* Remove embedded graphics, logos, icons etc. from headers and footers. 
* Delete graphics and text fields that are located close to the document edge. 
* Remove inline graphics using the macro ImagesOutIn by Miri Ofek (available from the yahoogroups website of the dejavu-l list: [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/files/])
* Watch out for spaces with different formatting than the rest of the text. They can lead to excessive codes in the DV project. 
* Switch off the auto-recognition of the language. 
* In severe cases, where the Word document won't import or export or when there is an excessive number of codes, try to save as RTF or open and save using OpenOffice. 
* In hopeless cases, save the Word doc as plain text (*.txt) and apply the formatting manually (and cleanly) after translation. 
* Switch off the syllable division. 
* Remove nested groupings.

{{Wikipedia|Bootloader}}
When a computer is turned on, there is some beeping, and some flashing lights, and then a loading screen appears. And then magically, the operating system loads into memory. The question is then raised, how does the operating system load up? What gets the ball rolling? The answer is '''bootloaders'''.

== What is a Bootloader? ==

Bootloaders are small pieces of software that play a role in getting an operating system loaded and ready for execution when a computer is turned on. The way this happens varies between different computer designs (early computers required a person to manually set the computer up whenever it was turned on), and often there are several stages in the process of boot loading.

It's crucial to understand that the term &quot;bootloader&quot; is simply a classification of software (and sometimes a blurry one). To the processor, a bootloader is just another piece of code that it blindly executes. There are many different kinds of boot loaders. Some are small, others are large; some follow very simple rules while others show fancy screens and give the user a selection to choose from.

On IBM PC compatibles, the first program to load is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). The BIOS performs many tests and initialisations, and if everything is OK, the BIOS's boot loader begins. Its purpose is to load another boot loader! It selects a disk (or some other storage media) from which it loads a secondary boot loader.

In some cases, ''this'' boot loader loads enough of an operating system to start running it. In other cases, it loads yet another boot loader from somewhere else. This often happens when multiple operating systems are installed on a single computer; each OS may have its own specific bootloader, with a &quot;central&quot; bootloader that loads one of the specific ones according to the user's selection.

Most bootloaders are written exclusively in assembly language (or even machine code), because they need to be compact, they don't have access to OS routines (such as memory allocation) that other languages might require, they need to follow some unusual requirements, and they make frequent use of low-level features. However some bootloaders, particularly those that have many features and allow user input, are quite heavyweight. These are often written in a combination of assembly and C. The [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ GRand Unified Bootloader] (GRUB) is an example of such.

Some boot loaders are highly OS-specific, while others are less so - certainly the BIOS boot loader is not OS-specific. The MS-DOS boot loader (which was placed on ''all'' MS-DOS formatted floppy disks) simply checks if the files '''IO.SYS''' and '''MSDOS.SYS''' exist; if they are not present it displays the error &quot;Non-System disk or disk error&quot; otherwise it loads and begins execution of '''IO.SYS'''.

The final stage boot loader may be expected (by the OS) to prepare the computer in some way, for instance by placing the processor in protected mode and programming the interrupt controller. While it would be possible to do these things inside the OS's initialisation procedure, moving them into the bootloader can simplify the OS design. Some operating systems require their bootloader to set up a small, basic GDT ([[X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table|Global Descriptor Table]]) and enter protected mode, in order to remove the need for the OS to have any 16-bit code. However, the OS might replace this with its own sophisticated GDT soon after.

== The Bootsector ==

The first 512 bytes of a disk are known as the '''bootsector''' or '''Master Boot Record'''. The boot sector is an area of the disk reserved for booting purposes. If the bootsector of a disk contains a valid boot sector (the last word of the sector must contain the signature 0xAA55), then the disk is treated by the BIOS as bootable.

== The Boot Process ==

When switched on or reset, an x86 processor begins executing the instructions it finds at address FFFF:0000 (at this stage it is operating in '''Real Mode'''). In IBM PC compatible processors, this address is mapped to a ROM chip that contains the computer's Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) code. The BIOS is responsible for many tests and initialisations; for instance the BIOS may perform a memory test, initialise the interrupt controller and system timer, and test that these devices are working.

Eventually the actual boot loading begins. First the BIOS searches for and initialises available storage media (such as floppy drives, hard disks, CD drives), then it decides which of these it will attempt to boot from. It checks each device for availability (e.g. ensuring a floppy drive contains a disk), then the 0xAA55 signature, in some predefined order (often the order is configurable using the BIOS setup tool). It loads the first sector of the first bootable device it comes across into RAM, and initiates execution.

Ideally, this will be another boot loader, and it will continue the job, making a few preparations, then passing control to something else.

While BIOSes remain compatible with 20-year-old software, they have also become more sophisticated over time. Early BIOSes could not boot from CD drives, but now CD and even DVD booting are standard BIOS features. Booting from USB storage devices is also possible, and some systems can boot from over the network. To achieve such advanced functioning, BIOSes sometimes enter protected mode and the like, but then return to real mode in order to be compatible with legacy boot loaders. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: bootloaders are written to work with the ubiquitous BIOS, and BIOSes are written to support all those bootloaders, preventing much in the way of new boot loading features.

However, a new bootstrap technology, the [[w:Extensible_Firmware_Interface|EFI]], is beginning to gain momentum. It is much more sophisticated and will not be discussed in this article.

Note also that other computer systems - even some that use x86 processors - may boot in different ways. Indeed, some embedded systems whose software is compact enough to be stored on ROM chips may not need bootloaders at all.

== Technical Details ==

A bootloader runs under certain conditions that the programmer must appreciate in order to make a successful bootloader. The following pertains to bootloaders initiated by the PC BIOS:

#The first sector of a drive contains its boot loader.
#One sector is 512 bytes — the last two bytes of which ''must'' be 0xAA55 (i.e. 0x55 followed by 0xAA), or else the BIOS will treat the drive as unbootable.
#If everything is in order, said first sector will be placed at RAM address 0000:7C00, and the BIOS's role is over as it transfers control to 0000:7C00 (that is, it JMPs to that address).
#The DL register will contain the drive number that is being booted from, useful if you want to read more data from elsewhere on the drive.
#The BIOS leaves behind a lot of code, both to handle hardware interrupts (such as a keypress) and to provide services to the bootloader and OS (such as keyboard input, disk read, and writing to the screen). You must understand the purpose of the Interrupt Vector Table (IVT), and be careful not to interfere with the parts of the BIOS that you depend on. Most operating systems replace the BIOS code with their own code, but the boot loader can't use anything but its own code and what the BIOS provides. Useful BIOS serve include &lt;code&gt;int 10h&lt;/code&gt; (for displaying text/graphics), &lt;code&gt;int 13h&lt;/code&gt; (disk functions) and &lt;code&gt;int 16h&lt;/code&gt; (keyboard input).
#This means that any code or data that the boot loader needs must either be included in the first sector (be careful not to accidentally execute data) or manually loaded from another sector of the disk to somewhere in RAM. Because the OS is not running yet, most of the RAM will be unused. However, you must take care not to interfere with the RAM that is required by the BIOS interrupt handlers and services mentioned above.
#The OS code itself (or the next bootloader) will need to be loaded into RAM as well.
#The BIOS places the stack pointer 512 bytes beyond the end of the boot sector, meaning that the stack cannot exceed 512 bytes. It may be necessary to move the stack to a larger area.
#There are some conventions that need to be respected if the disk is to be readable under mainstream operating systems. For instance you may wish to include a [[w:BIOS Parameter Block|BIOS Parameter Block]] on a floppy disk to render the disk readable under most PC operating systems.

Most assemblers will have a command or directive similar to &lt;code&gt;ORG 7C00h&lt;/code&gt; that informs the assembler that the code will be loaded starting at offset 7C00h. The assembler will take this into account when calculating instruction and data addresses. If you leave this out, the assembler assumes the code is loaded at address 0 and this must be compensated for manually in the code.

Usually, the bootloader will load the kernel into memory, and then jump to the kernel. The kernel will then be able to reclaim the memory used by the bootloader (because it has already performed its job). However it is possible to include OS code within the boot sector and keep it resident after the OS begins.

Here is a simple bootloader demo designed for NASM:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
         org 7C00h
 
         jmp short Start ;Jump over the data (the 'short' keyword makes the jmp instruction smaller)
 
 Msg:    db &quot;Hello World! &quot;
 EndMsg:
 
 Start:  mov bx, 000Fh   ;Page 0, colour attribute 15 (white) for the int 10 calls below
         mov cx, 1       ;We will want to write 1 character
         xor dx, dx      ;Start at top left corner
         mov ds, dx      ;Ensure ds = 0 (to let us load the message)
         cld             ;Ensure direction flag is cleared (for LODSB)
 
 Print:  mov si, Msg     ;Loads the address of the first byte of the message, 7C02h in this case
 
                         ;PC BIOS Interrupt 10 Subfunction 2 - Set cursor position
                         ;AH = 2
 Char:   mov ah, 2       ;BH = page, DH = row, DL = column
         int 10h
         lodsb           ;Load a byte of the message into AL.
                         ;Remember that DS is 0 and SI holds the
                         ;offset of one of the bytes of the message.
 
                         ;PC BIOS Interrupt 10 Subfunction 9 - Write character and colour
                         ;AH = 9
         mov ah, 9       ;BH = page, AL = character, BL = attribute, CX = character count
         int 10h
 
         inc dl          ;Advance cursor
 
         cmp dl, 80      ;Wrap around edge of screen if necessary
         jne Skip
         xor dl, dl
         inc dh
 
         cmp dh, 25      ;Wrap around bottom of screen if necessary
         jne Skip
         xor dh, dh
 
 Skip:   cmp si, EndMsg  ;If we're not at end of message,
         jne Char        ;continue loading characters
         jmp Print       ;otherwise restart from the beginning of the message
 
 
 times 0200h - 2 - ($ - $$)  db 0    ;Zerofill up to 510 bytes
 
         dw 0AA55h       ;Boot Sector signature
 
 ;OPTIONAL:
 ;To zerofill up to the size of a standard 1.44MB, 3.5&quot; floppy disk
 ;times 1474560 - ($ - $$) db 0
&lt;/source&gt;


To compile the above file, suppose it is called 'floppy.asm', you can use following command:
 nasm -f bin -o floppy.img floppy.asm
While strictly speaking this is not a bootloader, it is bootable, and demonstrates several things:
*How to include and access data in the boot sector
*How to skip over included data (this is required for a BIOS Parameter Block)
*How to place the 0xAA55 signature at the end of the sector (NASM will issue an error if there is too much code to fit in a sector)
*The use of BIOS interrupts

On Linux, you can issue a command like
 cat floppy.img &gt; /dev/fd0
to write the image to the floppy disk (the image may be smaller than the size of the disk in which case only as much information as is in the image will be written to the disk). Under Windows you can use software such as RAWRITE.

== Hard disks ==

{{Wikipedia|Master boot record}}
Hard disks usually add an extra layer to this process, since they may be partitioned. The first sector of a hard disk is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). Conventionally, the partition information for a hard disk is included at the end of the MBR, just before the 0xAA55 signature.

The role of the BIOS is no different to before: to read the first sector of the disk (that is, the MBR) into RAM, and transfer execution to the first byte of this sector. The BIOS is oblivious to partitioning schemes - all it checks for is the presence of the 0xAA55 signature.

While this means that one can use the MBR in any way one would like (for instance, omit or extend the partition table) this is seldom done. Despite the fact that the partition table design is very old and limited - it is limited to four partitions - virtually all operating systems for IBM PC compatibles assume that the MBR will be formatted like this. Therefore to break with convention is to render your disk inoperable except to operating systems specifically designed to use it.

In practice, the MBR usually contains a boot loader whose purpose is to load another boot loader - to be found at the start of one of the partitions. This is often a very simple program which finds the first partition marked ''Active'', loads its first sector into RAM, and commences its execution. Since by convention the new boot loader is also loaded to address 7C00h, the old loader may need to relocate all or part of itself to a different location before doing this. Also, ES:SI is expected to contain the address in RAM of the partition table, and DL the boot drive number. Breaking such conventions may render a bootloader incompatible with other bootloaders.

However, many boot managers (software that enables the user to select a partition, and sometimes even kernel, to boot from) use custom MBR code which loads the remainder of the boot manager code from somewhere on disk, then provides the user with options on how to continue the bootstrap process. It is also possible for the boot manager to reside within a partition, in which case it must first be loaded by another boot loader.

Most boot managers support chain loading (that is, starting another boot loader via the usual first-sector-of-partition-to-address-7C00 process) and this is often used for systems such as DOS and Windows. However, some boot managers (notably GRUB) support the loading of a user-selected kernel image. This can be used with systems such as GNU/Linux and Solaris, allowing more flexibility in starting the system. The mechanism may differ somewhat from that of chain loading.

Clearly, the partition table presents a chicken-and-egg problem that is placing unreasonable limitations on partitioning schemes. One solution gaining momentum is the [[w:GUID Partition Table|GUID Partition Table]]; it uses a dummy MBR partition table so that legacy operating systems will not interfere with the GPT, while newer operating systems can take advantage of the many improvements offered by the system.

== GNU GRUB ==

The [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ GRand Unified Bootloader] supports the flexible [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/html_node/index.html ''multiboot''] boot protocol. This protocol aims to simplify the boot process by providing a single, flexible protocol for booting a variety of operating systems. Many free operating systems can be booted using multiboot.

GRUB is extremely powerful and is practically a small operating system. It can read various file systems and thus lets you specify a kernel image ''by filename'' as well as separate module files that the kernel may make use of. Command-line arguments can be passed to the kernel as well - this is a nice way of starting an OS in maintenance mode, or &quot;safe mode&quot;, or with VGA graphics, and so on. GRUB can provide a menu for the user to select from as well as allowing custom loading parameters to be entered.

Obviously this functionality cannot possibly be provided in 512 bytes of code. This is why GRUB is split into two or three &quot;stages&quot;:
*Stage 1 - this is a 512-byte block that has the location of stage 1.5 or stage 2 hardcoded into it. It loads the next stage.
*Stage 1.5 - an optional stage which understands the filesystem (e.g. FAT32 or ext3) where stage 2 resides. It will find out where stage 2 is located and load it. This stage is quite small and is located in a fixed area, often just after Stage 1.
*Stage 2 - this is a much larger image that has all the GRUB functionality.

Note that Stage 1 may be installed to the Master Boot Record of a hard disk, or may be installed in one of the partitions and chainloaded by another boot loader.

Windows can not be loaded using multiboot, but the Windows bootloader (like those of other non-multiboot operating systems) can be chainloaded from GRUB, which isn't quite as good, but does let you boot such systems.

== Example of a Boot Loader ‒ Linux Kernel v0.01==

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
SYSSIZE=0x8000
|
|	boot.s
|
| boot.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves itself
| out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
|
| It then loads the system at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. Thereafter
| it disables all interrupts, moves the system down to 0x0000, changes
| to protected mode, and calls the start of system. System then must
| RE-initialize the protected mode in it's own tables, and enable
| interrupts as needed.
|
| NOTE! currently system is at most 8*65536 bytes long. This should be no
| problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 512 kB
| kernel size should be enough - in fact more would mean we'd have to move
| not just these start-up routines, but also do something about the cache-
| memory (block IO devices). The area left over in the lower 640 kB is meant
| for these. No other memory is assumed to be &quot;physical&quot;, i.e. all memory
| over 1Mb is demand-paging. All addresses under 1Mb are guaranteed to match
| their physical addresses.
|
| NOTE1 above is no longer valid in it's entirety. cache-memory is allocated
| above the 1Mb mark as well as below. Otherwise it is mainly correct.
|
| NOTE 2! The boot disk type must be set at compile-time, by setting
| the following equ. Having the boot-up procedure hunt for the right
| disk type is severe brain-damage.
| The loader has been made as simple as possible (had to, to get it
| in 512 bytes with the code to move to protected mode), and continuous
| read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
| loads pretty fast by getting whole sectors at a time whenever possible.

| 1.44Mb disks:
sectors = 18
| 1.2Mb disks:
| sectors = 15

| &quot;interesting&quot; anyway. This is how REAL programmers do it.
|
| Well, now's the time to actually move into protected mode. To make

== Testing the Bootloader ==

Perhaps the easiest way to test a bootloader is inside a virtual machine, like VirtualBox or VMware.&lt;ref&gt;

by Alex Kolesnyk 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is useful if the bootloader supports the GDB remote debug protocol.&lt;ref&gt;

== Why Learn Assembly? ==

Assembly is among some of the oldest tools in a computer-programmer's toolbox. Entire software projects can be written without ever looking at a single line of assembly code. So the question arises: why learn assembly? Assembly language is one of the closest forms of communication that humans can engage in with a computer. With assembly, the programmer can precisely track the flow of data and execution in a program in a mostly human-readable form. Once a program has been compiled, it is difficult (and at times, nearly impossible) to reverse-engineer the code into its original form. As a result, if you wish to examine a program that is already compiled but would rather not stare at hexadecimal or binary, you will need to examine it in assembly language. Since debuggers will frequently only show program code in assembly language, this provides one of many benefits for learning the language.

Assembly language is also the preferred tool, if not the only tool, for implementing some low-level tasks, such as bootloaders and low-level kernel components. Code written in assembly has less overhead than code written in high-level languages, so assembly code frequently will run much faster than equivalent programs written in other languages. Also, code that is written in a high-level language can be compiled into assembly and &quot;hand optimized&quot; to squeeze every last bit of speed out of it. As hardware manufacturers such as Intel and AMD add new features and new instructions to their processors, often times the only way to access those features is to use assembly routines. That is, at least until the major compiler vendors add support for those features.

Developing a program in assembly can be a very time consuming process, however. While it might not be a good idea to write new projects in assembly language, it is certainly valuable to know a little bit about it.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book will serve as an introduction to assembly language and a good resource for people who already know about the topic, but need some more information on x86 system architecture. It will also describe some of the more advanced uses of x86 assembly language. All readers are encouraged to read (and contribute to) this book, although prior knowledge of programming fundamentals would definitely be beneficial.

== How is This Book Organized? ==

The first section will discuss the x86 family of chips and introduce the basic instruction set. The second section will explain the differences between the syntax of different assemblers. The third section will go over some of the additional instruction sets available, including the floating point, MMX, and SSE operations.

The fourth section will cover some advanced topics in x86 assembly, including some low-level programming tasks such as writing bootloaders. There are many tasks that cannot be easily implemented in a higher-level language such as C or C++. For example, enabling and disabling interrupts, enabling protected mode, accessing the Control Registers, creating a Global Descriptor Table, and other tasks all need to be handled in assembly. The fourth section will also deal with interfacing assembly language with C and other high-level languages. Once a function is written in assembly (a function to enable protected mode, for instance), we can interface that function to a larger, C-based (or even C++ based) kernel. The fifth section will discuss the standard x86 chipset, cover the basic x86 computer architecture, and generally deal with the hardware side of things. 

The current layout of the book is designed to give readers as much information as they need without going overboard. Readers who want to learn assembly language on a given assembler only need to read the first section and the chapter in the second section that directly relates to their assembler. Programmers looking to implement the MMX or SSE instructions for different algorithms only really need to read section 3. Programmers looking to implement bootloaders, kernels, or other low-level tasks, can read section 4. People who really want to get to the nitty-gritty of the x86 hardware design can continue reading on through section 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''ionic wind thruster''' is a booster based on ionizing air to create thrust.  These thrusters work by adding an electron to a particle of air so that the air is forced away from a the negatively charged grid.  This produces a level of thrust T=mv, with ''T'' being thrust, ''m'' being the mass of the air, and ''v'' being the velocity of the air.

A common science fair project may be using a charged grid to 'levitate' an object several decimeters above a surface; more interesting applications may include levitating the hull of a car and building something more akin to Luke Skywalker's speeder or a hoverboard as seen in Back to the Future 2.

The basic design involves using a 555 timer to repeatedly and rapidly pulse a high voltage, low current electrical charge through a grid of wire.  Typical values would be 30,000V at 0.001A, or 30kV at 1mA.  This is typically enough power to levitate a small grid on its own; however, the grid can be combined with a light-weight plastic skirt or cone to better control the thrust angle and create backpressure.  The function of such a cone would be to prevent air from going out sideways, which decreases the amount of thrust in the direction we want; however, too much backpressure will also overpower the total thrust of the system and negate the effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''railgun''' is a form of electromagnetic weaponry that works on Lorentz forces, magnetic fields created by running power through metal rails connected by a metal projectile.  Commonly, video games use [[Do-It-Yourself/Gauss gun|gauss gun]]s and call them railguns, for example Quake 2 and 3.  Wikipedia has an [[w:Railgun|article on railguns]].

[[Image:Railgun-1.png|thumb|340px|Schematic diagram of a railgun]]
As stated, railguns utilize an electromagnetic force called the Lorentz force to propel an electrically conductive projectile that is initially part of the current path.  The current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile perpendicularly to the current in the rail.  In short, the rails and the projectile push away from each other, and you wind up throwing a hunk of metal away from wherever the battery is connected.

Railguns have an inherent problem with the amount of power driving the projectile; the rails are forced apart, electrical arcing occurs, and the rails are partially vaporized.  Because of this, most railguns can only be fired once before the rails need to be replaced.  Our model will be a simple, low-power model designed to throw a projectile, but not do anything particularly spectacular like vaporize a car on impact.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A '''Gauss Gun''' or '''Coil Gun''' is a gun that works by using a coil of wire to generate an electromagnetic field used to laterally accelerate a metallic projectile; the projectile becomes the core of a solenoid, but being loose it leaves the barrel after being fired.

Gauss guns come in varied designs, some of which can fire nails or BBs through cardboard; while others make viable hunting rifles suitable for penetrating a deer's skull.  Unlike [[Do-It-Yourself/Railgun|railgun]]s, gauss guns can typically be put to practical use in a hobbyist environment; '''''both should be treated as deadly weapons'''''.  Please note that with many of the designs here, '''''you can kill someone'''''; treat these projectile weapons with the care you would give to a store-bought firearm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have a problem with the text concerning ancient Roman housing:
&quot;but normal houses were much smaller and regular-looking,&quot;
By &quot;normal&quot; houses, do you mean that of the average citizen? What was &quot;normal&quot; in ancient Rome? And what is &quot;regular-looking&quot;?  Regular to who?  What's regular to me may not be &quot;regular&quot; to someone living in India.
I would not consider this text comparable to any high school textbook we have in our schools.  The writing is of poor quality. Sorry, but I would definitely discourage my students from using this information.

== What did they believe (Romans in Ancient Civilizations) ==

There are so many spelling and grammar errors in this section that I am appalled &amp; vow never to let my students use a WikiText for research - ever!  This is the problem when anyone can write anything on the web and call it valid information.  I don't know if the facts here are correct because the person's writing is incomprehensible.  Our students deserve better than this.

== Correct Latin Pronoucation ==

Technically, Julius Caesar's name would be pronounced &quot;You-lee-us Ki-sir&quot; The &quot;I&quot; was pronounced as a &quot;y&quot; (later the y became &quot;j&quot; in the middle ages&quot;, and all &quot;c&quot; were prononced as hard, i.e. as &quot;k&quot;s, not like &quot;ch&quot; in teh current book. 

Please change, or if someone would like to argue. :)

This is a great module. It seems complete and is easy to read and follow. Thanks for contributing this module to Wikibooks and Wikijunior. I think kids will find this very fun and interesting. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 03:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Image replacement ==

I just replaced the image for the geographic context of the Empire. The previous image was ''far'' too detailed (in my opinion) for the book's target audience: 8-12 year olds. It might appear to the reader that the three Prefectures other than Italy were not part the Empire, or cause some other confusion. The new image is a single color, and should be much easier to comprehend. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 01:19, 5 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this module we will introduce the concept of the spanning tree, the minimum spanning tree, and some methods of finding minimum spanning trees.

Firstly, we must say what we mean by a tree.  A tree is a graph where there is exactly one path between any pair of vertices.  This means that a tree is connected, i.e. there exists at least one path between each pair of points.

A tree is the most efficient way of connecting a set of vertices, in the sense that if we have a tree then every edge is necessary, as if we remove any edge, then the graph is no longer connected.  Also all trees on a graph with n vertices have exactly n - 1 edges.

If we have a connected graph G then another graph H is a spanning tree of G, if it is a tree with the same vertices as G, and all the edges of H are edges of G.

Finally, we will introduce the concept of a minimum spanning tree.  For this to make sense, we must consider graphs called networks.  A network is a graph where each edge has a weight.  The weight can be the length of the edge, or the distance between the two points, or it could represent the difficulty of going between the points, or the cost.  In any case, the weight is a number.  It will usually be positive (or non-negative, with zero a possibility), but the maths is the same if we allow negative numbers.  As it is each edge of the graph that will be assigned a distance, rather than the pairs of vertices themselves, no distance is assigned for pairs of vertices not joined by an edge.  

Given a graph G with distances assigned to its edges, then a minimum spanning tree, H, is a spanning tree of G, where the sum of the weights of the edges are the lowest possible.  There may be more than one minimum spanning tree.  For a trivial example, any spanning tree of a graph G, with all weights 1, will be a minimum spanning tree, with the relevant sum equal to n-1, where n is the number of vertices of the original graph.

==Kruskal's algorithm==

Kruskal's algorithm is one way of finding a minimum spanning tree for a network G.  We start with  a graph H consisting of all the vertices of G, but with no edges.  Then we follow the following instructions:

#Consider the set E of edges in G, that will connect the end points when added to H
#Find the member of E with the lowest weight.  If there are more than one such member, pick any one.
#Add this edge to H
#If H is not connected, then go back to step 1.  Otherwise, H is a minimum spanning tree of G.

===Example===

[[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 1]]

Above is the diagram (figure 1) for a graph, for which a spanning tree will be constructed using Kruskal's algorithm.  Each edge is given a weighting.  The lines are dotted, as the edges of the spanning tree will be indicated with solid lines.

Below are figures 2 to 5, which indicate the stages of the construction of a spanning tree.

[[Image:Krustalexample1a.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 2]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1b.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 3]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1c.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 4]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1d.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 5]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

In figure 2, we add an edge of weight 2, as that is the edge of lowest weight.  For figure 3 there are two options, both of weight 3, that could have been added.  Note that the edge added is not connected to the first edge.  This is allowed under this algorithm, but not Prim's algorithm, described below.  In figure 4 the other edge of weight 3 is added.  Finally, in figure 5 we add an edge of weight 6, out of two allowable.  There are edges of lower weight, such as that of weight 4, but these all join edges we have already been connected.  The final spanning tree is given below in figure 6, with the other edges in the original graph, and their weights, not given.  The total weight is 2+3+3+6 = 14.

[[Image:Krustalexample1e.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 6]]

==Prim's algorithm==

Prim's algorithm is an alternative way of finding a minimum spanning tree for a network G.  Again, we start with a graph H, consisting of all the vertices of G, but with no edges.  Then we follow the following instructions:

#Pick any vertex v in the graph
#Make it the only member of a set S
#Consider the set E of edges joining one member of S to a vertex not in S.
#Find the member of E with the lowest weight.  If there are more than one such member, pick any one.
#Add this edge to H, and the add the vertex not in S, to S.
#If H is not connected, then go back to step 3.  Otherwise, H is a minimum spanning tree of G.

===Example===

[[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 7]]

Above is figure 7, which is the same as figure 1, the graph used for the example for Kruskal's algorithm.  We will construct a different spanning tree, although as is guaranteed, the total weight  will be the same.  The first step is to choose a vertex to start with.  This will be the top most vertex.  Below are figures 8 to 11, the stages in the construction of a spanning tree.

[[Image:Primexample1a.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 8]]
[[Image:Primexample1b.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 9]]
[[Image:Primexample1c.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 10]]
[[Image:Primexample1d.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 11]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

At the start, only the top vertex is in S.  The edges with lowest weight between S, and other vertices are those with weight 6, so in figure 8 one is chosen, thus adding the middle right vertex to S.  In figure 9 the edge of weight 2 is added, adding the bottom right vertex to S.  In figure 10, one of the edges of weight 3 is added, the other not having a vertex in S on either end.  This edge is then added in figure 11.  This is now allowed, as the middle left vertex was added to S in figure 10.  The final spanning tree is given below in figure 12.  The total weight is again 2+3+3+6=14, although the actual spanning tree is different from that for Krustal's algorithm.

[[Image:Primexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 12]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Matrix representation===

An alternative way of finding minimum spanning trees is when the graph we are interested in is in matrix form.  A matrix in this case is simply a table of numbers, the numbers corresponding to the weights of the edges.  For example, below is table 1, the matrix form of the graph we have been using in our examples, along with figure 13, the familiar graphical representation:

{| 
| 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 1
|-   
|
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| 2
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| 4
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}
| [[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 13]]
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

The vertices are given numbers 1 to 5, with 1 the top vertex, 2 and 3 the middle-left and middle-right vertices, and 4 and 5 the bottom-left and bottom-right.  The row and column headings correspond to these numbers, and the other numbers are the weights of the appropriate edges.  For example, the number 8 in row 1, column 2, is the weight, 8, of the edge between vertices 2 and 3.  Note that there is symmetry in the matrix, in that, for example, row 2, column 1 is also 8.  This is because the edge between 1 and 2, say, is also the edge between 2 and 1.  Also, there is no edge between a vertex and itself, so row 1, column 1, row 2 column 2, etc., are all empty.

Using this form we can apply Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree.  We will start with vertex 4, making that the only member of S.  To denote this, we write it in bold, and will for other members of S later.  You can use any method you want to indicate members of S, such as cicling.  Below is table 2, with vertex 4 marked as a member of S.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 2
|-
| ||1 || 2 || 3 || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| 2
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, we must pick the next edge.  This will have one vertex in S, and one not in S.  These correspond to the numbers in row 4 (the one in bold), where it doesn't cross column 4 (also in bold).  This gives the numbers 6, 3, 5 and 7, the lowest of which is 3, which corresponds to row 4, colunn 2, so the edge between vertices 4 and 2.  We thus add this to our tree, and 2 to S.  Below is table 3, with both 2 and 4, the members of S, in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 3
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || 3 || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, the edges to select from correspond to numbers in rows 2 and 4 (those in bold), but not in columns 2 and 4.  This gives the numbers 8, 3, 4, 6, 5 and 7.  The lowest is 3, corresponding to an edge between vertices 2 and 3.  Thus we add 3 to S, and this edge to our tree.  Below is table 4, with 3 now in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 4
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || '''3''' || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| '''3'''
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, we have the numbers 8, 4, 6, 2, 5 and 7.  The lowest is 2, which corresponds to the edge between vertices 3 to 5.  We thus add this edge to our tree, and vertex 5 to S.  In table 5, this vertex is added to S, and thus in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 5
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || '''3''' || '''4''' || '''5'''
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| '''3'''
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| '''5'''
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Here, the numbers are 8, 6, 6 and 9.  There are thus two possible edges, between 1 and either 3 or 4.  The previous edges were between 4 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 5.  Below are figure 14 and 15, images of the spanning trees formed by choosing one of the two edges.  Figure 14 has the edge between vertices 1 and 3, and figure 15 that between 1 and 4.

[[Image:Primexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 14]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 15]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

Note that these are the spanning trees generated by Prim's algorithm, and Krustal's algorithm, respectively.  Also note that when finding the lowest number, we only considered the case where the member of S is the row, and the non-member is the column.  This leaves out the possibility that the member of S is the column, and the non-member is the row.  However, as we have discussed, each edge is listed twice, and our way of considering elements includes each edge once.  For example, if 1 is in S, and 2 not, then we include the edge between them as row 1, column 2, but not as row 2, column 1.

Traditionally, a '''beurre blanc''' consists of nearly equal parts white wine and good white wine vinegar reduced dramatically with shallot, held in emulsion with quite a lot of butter.  Once the basic technique has been mastered, don't be afraid to experiment with new ingredients. Many modern variations exist employing any number of herbs and flavorings.  

The sauce, whose name means &quot;white butter,&quot; traces its roots to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]] of the Loire Valley, and would be conventionally served with river fish, like [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]] or pike.  

Correctly prepared, a basic beurre blanc should be creamy and tangy with a good savory component, pairing well with lean meats, particularly fish.  I recommend it highly with a nice preparation of pan-seared halibut, seasoned simply with salt and pepper.  What follows is a recipe for a simple, semi-traditional beurre blanc.

===Ingredients===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of good white [[Cookbook:White Wine|wine]] (dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé)
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]], very finely chopped
* 1 cup unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], in cubes or lumps
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] 
* 1 Tbs heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], (optional and non-traditional)

===Procedure===

# For four portions, start with a cup of good white wine with a strong acidity (think dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé) in a non-reactive saucepan with the juice of one lemon and one or two very finely chopped shallots.
# Reduce the mixture to about two tablespoons, and don't be shy about letting it boil: it will not adversely affect the sauce.  Once reduced, the shallot should still be fairly moist. If you're looking at a dry pan, there's a good chance your sauce won't hold.
# Reduce heat to low flame. If you want to increase the holding power of your sauce, you can add a tablespoon or so of heavy cream at this juncture, but every authority on traditional French preparation would disapprove.
# Begin to add smallish cubes of very good, very cold unsalted butter while whisking vigorously. From a technical standpoint, the sauce should stay under 200°F (95°C), so do some of the whisking off the flame.  Whisk in one or two cubes and add more, and continue until you've added about 10 to 12 tablespoons of butter.  
# Season with salt and white pepper and serve immediately. The sauce can be held in a vacuum container, such a Thermos, but I don't recommend it for long periods of time.

American chefs may try to enhance the presentation of the sauce by straining the shallot out before plating, but the French know better. If the shallot has been sufficiently chopped it has no deleterious effect on the texture of the finished product.

== Sam2p - a better graphics file converter than ImageMagic ==
I have struggled for some time with ImageMagic to get correct bounding-boxes in  .eps graphics files (converted from .jpg, .png, .pdf format). 

Generally speaking I found it unsatisfactory, so I searched for an alternative and finally found Sam2p (see http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p/). After using it for some months I was so impressed by its quality that I have come to use it exclusively instead of ImageMagic.

Like ImageMagic, Sam2P is a commandline program and Open Source. It is more recent than ImageMagic however and seems to boast a number of improvements over ImageMagic (other than finding bounding boxes) which are listed on its website.   
Highly recommended.

== Bug in file extension in graphicx package ==

Adding a figure with in this format : [filename.eps] produces an error : &quot;Unknown graphics extension .eps&quot;.

However removing the extension from the parameter solves the problem.

So, the correct format : [filename].

:Yes, seems to be a bug for .eps files, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it works flawlessly without extension. This detail has been added to the chapter. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== eps - what about using pdflatex ==

indeed, &quot;.eps&quot; extension is not needed in modern implementations of (la)tex, at least not in tetex.
An extra advantage is that if you also have a pdf-version of the picture, then it will automatically be picked up, instead of eps-version, when you run pdflatex

In the list of software producing EPS graphics, it is worth mentioning IDL, Matlab and Mathematica, used by many scientists.

At least since version 2010.20288-1, pdflatex natively handles EPS files by converting them to pdf.

-- [[User:Karper|Karper]] ([[User talk:Karper|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Karper|contribs]]) 20:38, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

:I updated the part about EPS support for pdflatex. I do not know enough about IDL, Matlab not Mathematica, but feel free to contribute! --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== Creating vector graphics natively in LaTeX ==

LaTeX has some primitive line drawing functions in the picture environment that can be used to create graphics. Although it's quite simple and probably not so useful anymore, an extension of it called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/ Portable Graphics Format (PGF) and TikZ] is really useful and amazingly extensible. I think it should be placed after Inkscape. (I just saw that there is an entire page called [[LaTeX/Creating_Graphics|Creating Graphics]], so this should definitely go into that page) --[[User:Cengique|Cengique]] ([[User talk:Cengique|talk]]) 18:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
:The whole section of creating graphics should be moved to the chapter about this subject. I'm no native English speaker so I prefer someone else doing it.--[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 14:09, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

::I moved the TikZ stuff to its dedicated chapter. I've put some references to the 'Creating Graphics' part. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== Examples do not work ==

Examples on this page do not work. LaTex keeps complaining Cannot determine size of graohic, or, no bounding box. 

None of the given examples actually do something usefull. This page is a waste of time.
:You do have to place the pictures with the exact same name (LaTeX is capital sensitive) in a directory where LaTeX searches (in jou directory where the .tex file is is a good option). Also be sure you have a good format. You may have renamed a .gif image to a .jpg but that doesn't make it readable for LaTeX.--[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 14:06, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

==Draft document option==

[[LaTeX/Importing_Graphics#Document_Options]] In this subsection there is said that the default is ''draft''. But when you compile your doc without draft, the figures are included and with draft only the name is shown. Am I wrong if I say the default isn't draft but final?--[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 16:19, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

:Fixed by someone. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

==Images as Figures==

The images as figures section sounded like two guys having an editting war. I think that both people had a point; images are not figures, definately, but the figures page (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Figures) jumps straight into more complex figure usage. I thought that a bare-minimum example was needed, so provided two; one that's almost completely useless, and a slightly longer one which provides a basic 'all you need' example for using figures and images. I think this is a much better way to present the concept than pushing people towards a more advanced topic, as most people who come looking for how to insert images are most likely looking for a figure &amp; image example to copy/paste into their documents.

: Yeah, this book needs more cross-referencing, and as is evident on the main page, many chapters are far from finished. Anyway, good edit, if you find any similar problems in other chapters feel free to correct them. [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 20:54, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

::I worked out duplicates and cross-referencing for this chapter (as well as for lots of chapters actually). I removed the wrapfig example, replacing it by a link to the Figure chapter. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== Process LaTeX article that use png or jpg image files to eps ones ... ==

I have created with some days of effort this script in order to convert a LaTeX using jpg files to one using eps.
All is done automatic. The new source folder is ready to be compiled using latex instead of pdflatex.
I did this for my self use in order to save many effort, specially looking for the included images through a complex images folder tree and calculating for each one its final dimension in &quot;cm&quot; in order to be converted to eps and able to be used for proffesional publication or by editors.

==Other names: Mucopolysacchardosis III, Type A, B, C, and D==
*So, it is a syndrome in which the large saccharides are not broken down properly in the lysosomes. It's a lysosomal storage deficiency.

==Characteristics==
*Most common of the MPS diseases
*Normal to fast growth 1-3 years. Slow growth after that.
*Slow development by 1-3 years then deterioration
*Short stature
*Hearing loss
*Poor gait
*Poor speech
*Poor behavior
*Synophrys (joined eyebrows)
*Mild cardiac involvement
*Clear corneas
*Sleep disturbances
*Upper respiratory tract infections
*Many die of pneumonia (10-20 years)

==Genetics==
*Autosomal recessive in all types
*Sanfilippo A = defect in heparan N-sulfatase
*Sanfilippo B = deficiency in N-acetyl-alpha-delta glucosaminidase
*Sanfilippo C = deficiency of acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide-N-acetyltransferase
*Sanfilippo D = deficiency of N-acetyl-alpha-delta glucosaminide-6-sulfatase

==Diagnosis==
*By clinical features mentioned above (same for all four types except type D)
**Overactivity
**Destructive tendencies
**Weakness in all extremities
*Presence of excess heparan sulfate in the urine

==Introductions==

==Contracting==
*Medical update
*Physical exam
*Answer any new questions

==Medical Update==
*How are your hands?
*Carpal tunnel repair… any complications?
*Current medications
*Current activities at school
*How's the replacement therapy going?
*How's your vision currently?

==Scheie Syndrome==
*Definition: It is a mucopolysaccharidoses Type I disease. This means the body has trouble breaking down the large molecules in the lysosomes. Instead of breaking them down completely, they kick out only partially degraded molecules = storage occurs as well. So there is an increase of stuff in the lysosomes causing a build up in various parts of the body
*Incidence
**1/500,000 births
*Characteristics
**Broad mouth and fill lips
**Clouding of corneas/visual impairment
**Aortic valve defects
**Hairy body
**Hernias are common
**Carpal tunnel syndrome
**Joint limitation leading to claw hand.
**Normal life span
*Genetics
**Autosomal recessive
**Chromosome 4p16 has a defect = the alph-L-iduronidase gene

==Recommendations==
*Ophthgamology
*Cardiology
*Physical Therapy
*Occupational Therapy

==Treatment==
*Bone marrow transplants -experimental
*Fetal tissue transplants - experiemntal
*Enzyme replacement - experimental (When lysosomal storage diseases were discovered, hopes were raised that they could be treated by enzyme substitution. When exogenous lysosomal enzymes are injected into the patient, this enzyme can eventually be taken up by enzyme-deficient cells. This uptake is regulated by certain receptors on the cell surface. Different tissue have different receptors. It is therefore necessary to change the natural enzyme to enable uptake in the tissue of interest. If properly designed, the missing enzyme could be injected regularly like the diabetic subject injects insulin. In many in vitro studies with the purified active enzyme added to the media of enzyme-deficient fibroblasts, the lysosomal substrate accumulation was corrected, but in vivo treatment has been hampered through the problem of producing the sufficient quantity of enzymes, immunological problems, and that the substituted enzyme does not pass the blood-brain barrier.
*Since it can be expected that enzymes supplied from the outside do not pass the blood brain barrier, suitable candidates for enzyme replacement are disorders without neurological involvement (e.g. Maroteaux Lamy, Morquio B, Fabry, late onset Pompe disease).

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring physician
*Assess understanding of the reason for the referral to genetics
*How much information has your physician given you about the possible effects of taking seizure medications while pregnant?
*Despite the increased risk of problems, there is a greater than 90% chance that the baby will be just fine
*Control of seizures is important because they may cause injury to you or the fetus
*Stillbirths or miscarriages are more common for women who have epilepsy, occurring in 1.7 percent of pregnancies (about three times the amount in the general population)
*There is a small increase in mortality rates during the first year of life for children of mothers with epilepsy. That risk is only about 0.6 percent, but is higher if seizures are not well controlled. (increased risks probably related to periods where the fetus does not get enough oxygen due to changes in the circulation of blood in the uterus and placenta during seizures)
*What concerns or questions do you have that you would like to discuss today?
*Outline session agenda
**Medical and family history questions
**Some of the possible effects that anticonvulsants can have on the pregnancy
**Options available to you
**Discussion of concerns and questions

==Elicit Medical History==
*Confirm LMP: __________
*EDC: __________
*Today's gestational age: __________
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*Date of ultrasound: __________
*Results of ultrasound: __________
*How has the pregnancy been going so far?
*Have you had any seizures during your pregnancy
*What medications are you taking?
**Amount and frequency of each.
**When did you start taking each?
*At what age did you begin having seizures?
*What type of seizures do you typically have?
*Any complications other than the seizures? Infections, colds, exposures etc.

==Elicit Family History==
(3 generations)
*Anyone else with seizures?
*Anyone had: multiple SAB, SB, early deaths or babies that required surgery as infants?
*Anyone born with birth defects such as cleft lip or palate, spina bifida, or heart problems
*MR/LD
*Has anyone in family had cancer (dx. &lt;50) or chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes)

==Discuss possible side effects of taking anticonvulsants during pregnancy==
*Stress importance of taking medicines- to keep you healthy and therefore the baby healthy
*Although it's very important for you to take these medications, sometimes seizure medications can have some effects on a developing baby
*There appears to be an increased risk of Stillbirth correlated with carbamazepine or valproic acid intake during first 6 weeks (2-5% risk of causing stillbirth)
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of birth defects or mental retardation
*Women who take anticonvulsants are at a 2-3 times increased risk for some specific problems (consensus seems to be about 7-10%)
*This doesn't mean that the baby will be born with a problem, it just means that we know that based on your special circumstances, your pregnancy is at an increased risk
*Some of the things that we sometimes see in children who have been exposed to seizure medications during pregnancy include:
**Subtle changes in the facial features of the baby
***such as the shape of the eyes and nose
***usually so subtle features that you might not even recognize them
**Sometimes we see changes in the length of the fingers (slightly shortened) and the fingernails may be small
**But sometimes children can be born with more apparent changes such as a cleft lip/palate or spina bifida
**Occasionally we see kids who have some delays in development (usually ranging from borderline normal intelligence to mild mental retardation)
**Heart defects have been reported in infants of a group of women who were treated with a number of different anticonvulsants (RR of 2.2, 1.4-3.5)
**RR of other birth defects when the group of meds was considered together was 2.5 (1.5-2.4) for oral clefts and 2.5 (1.2-5.0) for urinary tract anomalies
*** But this was for the group of meds considered together and not for individual meds
*Some children who have been exposed to anticonvulsants during pregnancy have several of these features and some have none
*Just based on your history I can't tell you whether or not your baby will have some or none of these features
*However, we can offer you a level II ultrasound that can often determine if the there is a major birth defect

==Options==
*Level II ultrasound -- performed at 18 -20 weeks
**Done by an experienced technician
**Can detect many of the birth defects for which your fetus is at increased risk
**Developing organs will be looked at in detail
**Can often detect abnormalities in the formation of the limbs, spine, heart, and brain
**U/S is good to make us suspicious of some birth defects but it can't tell us everything
**We won't know if there is mental deficiency by u/s
**Also, u/s is dependent upon cooperation of the baby. Sometimes we just can't get a great view and may not be able to see everything we are looking for
**But it can usually provide some reassurance to see that organs and body parts have formed properly
*MSAFP at about 16-18 weeks is optimal
**Screening performed on a sample of your blood
**Can provide an indication that a fetus may be at a higher or lower risk than the general population to have an ONTD, but it will not tell us for certain if there is a neural tube defect
**Detects about 80-90% of ONTD's (so it can miss some)
**Blood test can also look at other markers in the blood and determine if there may be an increased risk for two chromosomal abnormalities (for which you are not at an increased risk for based on your history of seizures and medications)
*Amniocentesis at about 15-18 weeks
**Can detect about 95-98% of open neural tube defects (when test both AFP and AchE)
**Procedural risk for miscarriage of 1 in 200
**Although you are not at an increased risk for other specific types of birth defects caused by changes in the chromosomes or hereditary material, amnio can also look at the chromosomes and determine if there is a chromosome abnormality with high accuracy

==Other medications==
*Studies of women have shown that neither other medication you are taking (Zoloft and Zantac) cause an increase in birth defects when compared to what would be expected in the general population. However, high levels of Zantac are found in breastmilk and it is recommended that a woman who is taking Zantac not breast-feed

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Guilt over doing something that may cause birth defects
*Catch 22 (don't want to hurt the fetus, but need to make sure that mom is healthy because if mom were having seizures that too would put the fetus at risk)
*Are there other health concerns or circumstances that would make this a difficult pregnancy
*Assess support system and coping strategies

==Follow-up==
*Questions?
*Registry for patients taking anticonvulsants…
*Do you plan to breast feed the baby?
*Provide information about Epilepsy foundation at 1-800-EFA-1000 or www.efa.org

==Carbitrol, Epitol, Tegretol (Carbamazepine) Facts==
*Anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*Clearance increases during pregnancy so doses may need adjustment
*Series of 125 infants exposed, 17 (12%) had congenital anomalies
*Several other reports show a 2-3 times as great of risk for birth defects as in the general population (this is similar to reports of children born to women treated with other anticonvulsants)
*Study with controls who had trivial exposure to ethanol
**Found malformations in 18% of babies exposed to Carbitrol during pregnancy
**Hypoplastic fingernails, short nose, long philtrum, upslanting palpebral fissures, distal digital hypoplasia and microcephaly
**But major birth defects not increased
**20% of exposed were found to have developmental delay (5 of 25 offspring)
***problems with the design though
*may be confounded by SES status or parental IQ
*used only one standard deviation as the cut off rather than two
*Other studies fail to show any significant effects of prenatal exposure on head size, IQ, or neurologic function
*Incidence of spina bifida
**When data from 22 published studies was pooled, a relative risk of 14 was calculated
**Questions about adequacy of data because many of 21 published studies that were used reported 0-1 cases
**Nested case control study showed odds ration of 6.0 for NTD's but not statistically significant, but is suggestive of a relationship
**May therefore be a risk and the risk is generally quoted at 1 in 200 to 1 in 100 (up to 10 times the risk for general population which is about 1 in 1,000)
**Folate supplements often recommended because carbamazepine is folic acid antagonist
*When in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs especially valproic acid, higher frequencies of birth defects have been observed
*Considered &quot;probably safe&quot; to consume while breastfeeding

==Topamax (Topiramate) Facts==
*Mechanism of action unknown --Appears to block the spread of seizures rather than raise the seizure threshold
*Not well studied in humans
*Most studies have been done on mice, rats, and rabbits
**developmental toxicity shown at all doses tested (lowest 20% of human dose)
**Show craniofacial malformations most commonly such as cleft lip and palate
**Caused limb reduction anomalies in rats at 10 times human dose
**Delays in physical development seen when used during late pregnancy and lactation in rats
**Skeletal abnormalities at 6 times the human dose in rabbits (maternal toxic dose)
**Intrauterine death in 2 times the human dose (maternal toxic dose)
*8 exposed pregnancies
**5 chose to terminate
**3 infants were normal
*Case report (abstract) one woman only on topamax throughout gestation (700mg) had infant with prenatal onset growth deficiency and multiple minor anomalies (5th nail hypoplasia, generalized hirsutism, third fontanelle, short nose and anteverted nares)

==Zoloft (Setraline) Facts==
*SSRI antidepressant
*Studies in rats and rabbits
**20 times the dose in pregnant rats and rabbits produced NO INCREASE in birth defects
**Neonatal survival was decreased at maternal doses of 5 times higher than recommended in humans
*Report of 147 women followed prospectively
**Comparable incidence of malformations to that found in unexposed controls
*Offspring of 112 women in another study
**Babies DID NOT have an increase in birth defects compared to control population
**Admission to a special care nursery were associated with late pregnancy exposure
*Case report of infant with withdrawal symptoms
**Agitation, poor feeding, constant crying, insomnia
**Intense for 48 hours then subsided
*Nystagmus reported in another infant and resolved after 72 hours
*Zoloft is excreted in breast milk, along with active metabolite
*Studies suggest that there is minimal transfer of active drug to the infant though

==Zantac (Ranitidine) facts==
*Histamine H2 antagonist used for peptic ulcer disease
*No increase in birth defects or fetal toxicity in rats or rabbits
*Frequency of major malformations NOT increased among children of 142 women taking various H2 receptor antagonists
*No increase in incidence of birth defects in 330 infants exposed to Zantac during first trimester
*Cohort study with 176 infants showed rate of birth defects NO greater than expected
*Not recommended during breast feeding because may accumulate in breast milk up to 6-12% of maternal daily dose

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Septo-optic dysplasia'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*What is your understanding about why you were referred to genetics?
*What are your main concerns for _______?
*Do you have any questions for us today?
*Outline the session:
**Want to first take a family medical history
**Then make sure the medical information I have is correct
**We will discuss the information we obtain with Dr. Doktour
**Then we will answer all your questions and explain what we believe might be the cause of the problems ____ has experienced

==Pedigree==
*Learning difficulties or mental retardation
*Birth defects
*Seizures
*Eye problems
*Problems with growth
*Infertility
*History of pregnancy losses
*Anyone died at a young age or unexpectedly
*Chronic health problem
*Anything that seems to be running in your family

==Take medical history==
(follow form)
*Explain how mosaic turner syndrome was ruled out as an explanation for her short stature and absent periods

==Introduce septo-optic dysplasia also called SOD==
*A rare disorder where some of the structures in the middle of the brain don't form properly
*This can lead to changes in the way they function and a number of symptoms and characteristic findings
*A number of findings on ______'s MRI suggested that she might have septo-optic dysplasia
*Septo refers to the center structure of the brain
*The septum pellucidum is a membrane that separates one of the fluid filled spaces in the brain (show picture)
*This membrane is missing in ________.
*The pituitary gland is also located in the center of the brain and does not seem to be functioning properly in _____.
*The term optic refers to the optic nerve, which is what carries the messages from the eyes to the brain
*______'s optic nerves are underdeveloped and small
*Dysplasia means that these structures are not formed properly

==Symptoms of SOD==
*The problems that can occur in individuals with SOD vary and can range from mild or serious
*A person with SOD can have a combination of any number of symptoms or characteristics
**Eye problems
***If the optic nerve is small or not developed properly will have fewer connections to the brain and can therefore have poor vision
***This is called optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH)
***Vision doesn't usually decrease over time though
***Most with ONH also have unusual eye movements where the eyes move around and don't focus well (nystagmus)
**Brain Structure and Function
***Septum pellucidum missing (agenesis)
***Some have an abnormal corpus callosum which is the group of nerve fibers connecting the brain
***Other structural changes (larger than usual fluid filled cavities (ventricles), and fluid filled sacs in the ventricles (cysts) )
***Sometimes changes in structure alter function and sometimes there is no brain function affected
***Can be mildly to severely affected and cause developmental delays and cognitive problems
***Some also have seizures
*Pituitary Gland
***Found in middle of brain and is master control gland
***Makes important chemicals (hormones) which direct other glands in other parts of body to make other hormones
***These other hormones are needed for things such as proper growth of body, energy control, sexual development

==GH (growth hormone)==
*About 6:10 children with ONH don't make enough growth hormone
*Can be treated with growth hormone shots
*GH also necessary after growth is complete to maintain bone strength and normal metabolism

==Thyroid hormone can be lacking in kids with ONH/SOD==
*Pituitary releases signal TSH to tell thyroid gland in neck to make thyroxin
*Thyroxin necessary for growth and metabolism
*Without enough can cause: poor growth, weight gain, slowing of mental function, feeling cold, irregular periods, dry skin, brittle nails, hair loss
*Can be replaced with pills taken every day

==Gonadotropins (FSH and LH)==
*Signal the ovaries and testes to produce sex hormones
*Without sex hormones sexual development may be delayed

==Cortisol==
*Made by adrenal glands above the kidneys
*ACTH from pituitary tells adrenal gland to make cortisol
*Increased amounts of cortisol needed when injured or sick
*If pituitary doesn't work right in telling adrenal glands to make more than may need to take cortisol pills daily

==ADH (anti-diuretic hormone)==
*Keeps water in the body by controlling amount of urine
*Without enough may lose too much water
*Feel thirsty, dry mouth, but urinates a lot
*May become dehydrated and have problems (called diabetes insipidus or water diabetes)
*Treatment available

==Prolactin==
*May have high prolactin
*Leads to no known health problems
*Used to test how pituitary is functioning

==Services==
*Children may need many tests and services
*Often followed by Ophthalmology, Endocrinology and Neurology
*Need early intervention
*May need IEP in school
*Services may include PT, OT, speech therapy depending on child's needs
*Special needs for those with severe vision problems

==Etiology of SOD==
*Exact cause of SOD is not known
*Probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences early in gestation at about 6 wks gestation
*Usually thought to be sporadic meaning that it is not something that was inherited
*Cases have been reported where it appears to be autosomal recessive (presence of two copies of altered copies of a gene)
*Mutations were in homeodomain of HESX1 gene
*Found similar phenotype in mice that were mutant for homologous gene Hesx1
*Also identified heterozygous mutations in HESX1 that correlated with milder pituitary phenotypes

==Recurrence Risks==
*Dependent on whether it is a sporadic case or a mutation is present
*Few documented reports of affected siblings
*Testing was available on a research basis for the HESX1 gene as of first part of Nov. 2001, but we would need to contact the researcher to see if they are still searching for mutations (researcher is in UK).

==Psychosocial considerations==
*May be a lot of new information and it is not simple
*We have some written information that you can read through if you would like
*May regret not having diagnosis earlier
*May feel that more could have been done if it was diagnosed earlier
*What are plans for her in the future
*Will she live at home or in a group home
*Is she connected with anyone who can help her with a job placement when school is done

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Short Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (SCAD)'''

==General Information==
*a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by a defect in the oxidation of short-chain fatty acids resulting in neurologic and gastrointestinal manifestations
*SCAD is one of four enzymes in the mitochondria responsible for the breakdown of short-chain (C4-C6) fatty acids to 2-carbon fragments (acetyl-CoA) in the beta oxidation pathway
*homozygous patients are unable to mobilize large fat stores and are thus at risk for becoming hypoglycemic when stressed (i.e., during infection or fasting) during which time the long and medium acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are unable to compensate for the lack of SCAD
*gene map locus: 12q22-qter
*autosomal recessive inheritance

==Diagnosis==
*diagnosis is difficult because patients do not consistently excrete characteristic metabolites
*it is necessary to collect and analyze several urine and plasma specimens in patients with neurologic abnormalities that suggest this disorder
*deficiency of SCAD activity in leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts
*prenatally, a deficiency of SCAD activity in cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes can be detected

==Clinical Evaluation==
*two distinct clinical phenotypes have been identified :
*one type observed in infants with acute acidosis and muscle weakness (generalized)
*one type observed in middle-aged patients with chronic myopathy (localized to skeletal muscles)
*cases with neonatal onset have a variable phenotype
*includes metabolic acidosis, failure to thrive, developmental delay, seizures and myopathy
*no episodes of nonketotic hypoglycemia (characteristic of medium-chain and long-chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiencies)

==Infantile type==
*metabolic: neonatal acidosis, low-normal plasma total carnitine, highly esterified
*GI: poor feeding, vomiting, failure to thrive
*muscle: progressive skeletal muscle weakness, hypotonia
*neurological: developmental delay
*laboratory results: generalized SCAD deficiency, ethylmalonate urinary excretion, low normal highly esterified muscle carnitine

==Adult type==
*muscle: lipid-storage myopathy
*lab results: skeletal muscle carnitine low, deficiency of skeletal muscle mitochondrial short-chain acyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Short Stature'''

==Considerations for Short Stature==
*Abnormally short stature may result form a primary abnormality of skeletal organization, growth, or development (skeletal dysplasia - metabolic or single-gene), or from extraosseous defect (nutrition, teratogen, endocrine, psychosocial, or cytogenetic).
*The use of growth curves with attention to ethnic and family background will help identify the patient with pathologic short stature.
*The initial step in the clinical evaluation of short stature is to determine whether the body is proportionate or disproportionate. (Proportionate growth suggests an extraosseous defect, while disproportionate growth suggests a skeletal dysplasia.) Precise body measurements, such as upper to lower-limb-segment ratios, sitting height, arm span, and hand and foot measurements are diagnostically useful.
*The next step is to determine whether the growth deficiency was of prenatal or postnatal onset. (Prenatal onset suggests a fetal environment insult or genetic defect, while a postnatal onset suggests chronic disease, endocrine disorder, or psychosocial issues.)
*A family height history should be discussed and parental heights should be measured. A pregnancy history should be taken and teratogen exposure should be discussed. Cytogenetic studies, including a karyotype should be done. Skeletal films of the hand will determine bone age. Growth hormone assays and thyroid studies should be coordinated through endocrinology.

==Considerations for Failure to Thrive==
*The term failure to thrive is used for children and infants who, without superficially evident cause, fail to gain and often lose weight.
*Most instances of FTT result from psychosocial circumstances which adversely affect the child's intake, absorption, or utilization of food (including emotional deprivation, physical neglect or abuse, and withholding food).
*FTT may be related to a physical handicap, such as cerebral palsy or cleft palate.
*FTT may also result from obscure organic abnormalities or overt diseases in which growth failure occurs.
*Hospitalization for study and treatment allows for quantification of factors controlling the net caloric intake (food intake, vomiting, and stools) and for observation of the child's interactions with the family. This hospitalization frequently leads to dramatic improvement of weight gain and provides evidence that the environmental factors are the cause.
*Making a growth chart and developmental flow sheet flow sheet may identify the point in time where the child began to fail to thrive. If the child's growth has been steady, just below the expected level (if the child is following their own growth curve), then diagnoses like constitutional short stature, hypopituitarism, or chromosomal abnormality may be considered.
*If the medical history and physical examination suggest disturbances in any particular organ systems, then diagnostic study should be pursued. This could begin with routine screening tests, like blood counts and urinalyses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sickle Cell Anemia'''

==Introduction==
*Determine what the patient already knows about sickle cell
*Assess what concerns the patient wants to address today

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is sickle cell disease?==
*inherited blood disorder affecting the oxygen carrying part of the blood cells called hemoglobin
*hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia forms a &quot;sickle&quot; or banana shape
**normal hemoglobin is called hemoglobin A
**sickle cell hemoglobin is called hemoglobin S
*this shape causes it to be broken down in the liver leading to not enough blood cells
*people with sickle cell disease experience pain, damage to organs, and sometimes early death
**this is due to sickle shaped blood cells blocking tiny blood vessels
**this leads to prevention of blood flow to certain areas of the body

==Diagnosis==
*diagnosis is made by a blood test called hemoglobin electrophoresis
**those with mostly hemoglobin S have sickle cell disease
**those with only hemoglobin A do not have sickle cell disease
**those with both hemoglobin A and hemoglobin S are heterozygote carriers and have sickle cell trait
***this means they are carriers of the sickle cell gene
***they generally do not have any health problems but can pass the gene to their children
**this test requires 3cc of blood in a red-capped EDTA tube
**prenatal testing is also available
**in Ohio children are now tested for sickle cell as part of the newborn screening program

==Symptoms==
*chronic hemolytic anemia - may lead to reduction in energy and cause growth retardation
*Vaso-occlusion - blockage of small blood vessels that may lead to pain and tissue damage.
*Splenic sequestration - increase in spleen size due to storage of red blood cells
*Organ failure - may result from insufficient blood flow later in life
*other problems may arise such as neurological effects, stroke, chronic eye disease, renal disease, and leg ulcers

==Treatment==
*mainly symptomatic
*drugs such as hydroxyurea are used to increase fetal hemoglobin
*vasodilators and lubricants used to prevent microvascular blockage with very little success

==Inheritance==
*Sickle cell disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion
**people with sickle cell disease have two copies of the mutated gene
**people with sickle cell trait have one normal gene and one mutated gene
*Parents who both have sickle cell trait will have a 25% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease, a 50% chance of having a child with sickle cell trait, and a 25% chance of having a normal child who is not a carrier
*If one parent has sickle cell disease and one parent has sickle cell trait, they have a 50% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease but the child will have sickle cell trait.
*If one parent has sickle cell disease and the other parent is normal the child will have sickle cell trait but 0% chance of having sickle cell disease.

Clarification: In order for a child to have sickle cell disease both parents must have at least one copy of the abnormal sickle cell gene, or in other words both parents must have sickle cell trait for the child to have sickle cell disease.

==Population Genetics==
*African-Americans: 1/12 are carriers
*1/400-600 children are born with sickle cell disease
*People of Hispanic, Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Asian Indian also have high carrier rates

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Guilt over passing on trait to children
*people with sickle cell trait may be treated as though they are sick despite having no symptoms
*people with sickle cell trait may also be more worried about their health despite having no symptoms
*worry over reproductive decisions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Make small talk and establish rapport with the family.
*Elicit the family's concerns. What issues would you like to discuss today?
*Briefly outline the topics to be covered during the visit.

==Eliciting Interim History==
*Interim Family History:
*Have there been any new births, deaths, or diagnoses in the family?
*Is there any consanguinity in the family?

==Psychosocial==

==Genetic Etiology==
*Autosomal recessive inheritance
*Caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 7DHCR, the final enzymatic step in the cholesterol biogenesis pathway.
*Molecular Genetics
*The gene encoding 7DHCR is located at 11q12-13, and is named DHCR7.
*19 different mutations have been reported (including 13 missense, 5 frameshift, and 1 nonsense mutation).
*Milder phenotypes can be seen if the mutation renders the enzyme partially active.
*The mechanism leading to the manifestations seen appears to be the result of a deficiency in cholesterol.
*Cholesterol is a critical component of myelin and other CNS proteins
*Cholesterol is also a precursor to the sex steroids, estrogen and testosterone, thus hypocholesterolemia results in a deficiency of these hormones.
*The derangement of sterol composition in the cell membranes may result in abnormal cell-to-cell interactions in the developing embryo. (? Explains polydactyly and cleft palate and growth deficiency seen in some??)
*Penetrance:
*100% penetrant with variable expressivity

==Recurrence Risks==
*The risk of recurrence is 25%

==Incidence==
*The incidence is estimated to be 1:40,000- 1:60,000
*The carrier frequency is approximately 1:122
*More common in people of European background, and has been seen rarely in those of African American and Asian descent.
*There is an excess of males diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (bias of ascertainment as a result of hypogenetalism seen in boys).

==Diagnostic Criteria and Clinical Features==
*Diagnosis is usually made based on the recognition of a constellation of characteristic clinical features, with diagnostic confirmation based on measurement of elevated 7DHC in plasma or other tissues.
*The cardinal features include:
*Prenatal growth deficiency with subsequent failure to thrive
*Developmental delay/ mental retardation (moderate to severe)
*Poor muscle tone (hypotonia)
*Characteristic facies (change with age and are difficult to recognize in adulthood)
*Microcephaly with narrow bifrontal diameter
*Ptosis (50%)
*Down-slanting palpebral fissures
*Short nose with depressed nasal bridge, with anteverted nares
*Low set and posteriorly rotated ears
*Retrognathia
*Cleft palate (37-52%)
*Cardiac defects (36-38%)
*AV canal defects, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return defects
*Gastrointestinal anomalies (25%)
*Pyloric stenosis, malrotation, Hirschsprung disease
*Polydactyly
*Cutaneous 2-3 toe syndactyly (90%)
*Genital abnormalities (70%)
*Hypospadias, cryptorchidism, micropenis, hypoplastic scrotum, and microutethra.
*Upper tract anomalies (57%) include hydronephrosis, renal cystic dysplasia, renal duplication, renal agenesis, and reflux.

==Occasional Abnormalities==
*Seizures
*Demyelination in the cerebral hemispheres, cranial nerves, and peripheral nerves.
*Cataracts
*Dislocation of the hip

==Natural History==
*Congenital onset
*Many are born in breech presentation
*Stillbirth and early neonatal death are not uncommon
*Feeding difficulty and vomiting, hypotonia, and irritable behavior with shrill screaming have been frequently reported problems in infancy
*Of those who survive, 20% die within the first year.
*Death is commonly related to pneumonia
*The degree of mental deficiency is usually moderate to severe (adults described had IQ's in the 20's).

==Testing==
*Diagnostic:
*Increased 7DHC levels in blood or other tissues
*Clinical evaluation
*Prenatal:
*Measurement of elevated 7DHC in amniotic fluid or chorionic villi
*Carrier testing:
*Not currently available
*Differences of 7DHC in heterozygotes is indistinguishable from homozygotes (normal).
*With the discovery of the gene, it is hoped that mutation analysis will assist in heterozygote identification.

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*Growth and Feeding:
*Adequate caloric intake should be ensured.
*Consideration should be given to cholesterol supplementation to improve weight gain.
*Oral-motor training with OT to help patient take food orally
*G-tube to assist in feeding if oral intake is not adequate
*Development and behavior
*EI, special education programs, and therapies to enhance the developmental potential of the patient.
*Supervised setting for adults (group home) - improved behavior and development has been noted in patients receiving cholesterol supplementation
*Craniofacial
*Cleft palate repair at age 12-18 months
*Ophthalmologic
*If there is a suggestion of visual compromise from ptosis, cataracts, or any other abnormality, referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended.
*Cardiovascular
*Specific to malformation identified
*Special consideration should be given in those cases where prognosis is poor.
*Gastrointestinal
*Surgical referral and standard treatment for each specific condition
*Genitourinary
*Ultrasound of urinary tract at diagnosis
*Treatment is dependent upon the condition identified
*Repair of hypospadias
*Observe boys with cryptorchidism to see if spontaneous descent occurs
*Determine chromosomal sex if ambiguous genitalia is present.
*Musculoskeletal
*Simple excision of supernumerary digits
*Skin
*Cholesterol treatment has been reported to cause a decrease in photosensitivity and skin rashes.
*Limit length of sun exposure to avoid sun photosensitivity

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Chromosomal abnormalities including Trisomy 18 (Growth deficiency, cleft palate, and DD) and Trisomy 13 (Growth retardation, polydactyly, and DD)
*Noonan syndrome (short stature, DD, cardiac defects, cryptorchidism)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sotos Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Overgrowth syndrome
*etiology still uncertain although researchers in Japan found a gene that may be the cause of Sotos syndrome in a large number of individuals with classical Sotos syndrome (published paper in 2002)
*usually sporadic
*&lt;2% show autosomal dominant inheritance (4 of 200 families, but facial gestalt is different)

==Incidence==
*Unknown slightly less common than Beckwith-Wiedemann with prevalence of 1 in 13,700 births

==Diagnosis==
*Diagnosis is clinical
*4 core features (must have at least 3 of the 4 to really make a diagnosis)
*First 3 features are relative to general population so setting a cutoff is not always clear
**rapid early growth pre and postnatal
**advanced bone age
**developmental delay
**characteristic facial appearance specific to Sotos syndrome
***alters in childhood and adolescence
***in newborn period (macrocephaly, high bossed forehead, dolichocephaly, high palate, appearance suggestive of hypertelorism)
***face lengthens, jaw becomes more prominent, dolichocephaly (tall narrow skull) and frontal bossing (prominent forehead) become more obvious
***delay in growth of hair which is often thin &quot;appearance of receding hairline&quot;
***midchildhood downslant to palpebral fissures, wear and discoloration of teeth, tendency for a rosy coloration of cheeks, chin, and nasal tip.
*All 4 core features are present in at least 75% of true cases of Sotos syndrome and &lt;20% of other specific and nonspecific overgrowth patterns

==At birth==
*Often the presence of a high arched palate, poor suck, and low muscle tone which often produce feeding problems
*Jaundice occurs frequently.

==Molecular Genetics and Genetic Testing==
*Gene mutation found in a number of Japanese patients with Sotos syndrome
*Located at 5q35 gene named NSD-1
*Lab in Chicago and Germany are doing clinical testing
*Details found at http://www.genes.uchicago.edu/clinic/SotosTest.html
*FISH analysis for NSD1 deletion detection. Mutation analysis is currently being validated for clinical use; please check back on availability.
*No lab listed on GeneClinics doing research testing presently, but lab in UK may be doing research testing
*FISH - 12 days and cost is $325
*NSD1 encodes 2,696 amino acids and may interact with nuclear receptors (NRs)
*expressed in the fetal and adult brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, spleen, and the thymus, and faintly in the lung.
*Among 42 SS patients examined, we detected 4 (10 %) de novo point mutations in NSD1
*In addition, FISH analysis using BAC clones flanking the 5q35 breakpoint revealed submicroscopic deletions involving the entire NSD1 gene in 20 (67%) of 30 patients whose chromosomes were available (Nat Genet 30:365-366, 2002)
*http://caroll.vjf.cnrs.fr/cancergene/CG1830.html discusses the NSD1 protein

==Neuroradiological findings==
*Ventricular abnormalities (prominence of trigone, prominent occipital horns, ventriculomegaly)
*Midline defects and absence or hypoplasia of corpus collosum

==Growth and Feeding==
*Feeding problems common in neonatal period
*Most LGA (most evident in length and in head circumference)
*Height and head circumference most significantly larger and run parallel to growth curve but sig. above 97th centile
*Excess growth mostly in limbs rather than trunk
*Girls in UK population were an average of 6.2 cm above calculated target height based on parental heights, but were within usual height range
*Boys height less predictable and greater tendency for increased adult stature

==Development, learning, behavior==
*Almost all have developmental delay and cognitive impairment (may be selection bias because this is used as diagnostic criteria)
*Behavioral problems common
*Poor concentration and ADHD common
*Difficulty with social interactions results in tendency to associate with younger children and social isolation later in life
*Reliance on routines common in many children
*May have impetuous behavior
*Poor sleep patterns common
*Unusual anxiety and subsequent phobias commonly reported

==Neurological==
*Hypotonia usually present from birth but improves during childhood
*Poor coordination and delayed motor skills primarily gross motor (swimming is sport many succeed in)
*Febrile convulsions in almost 50%
*Almost half with febrile seizure will go on to have nonfebrile seizures
*Seizures managed same as in other children/adults

==Immune system==
*Infections very common in early childhood
*Recurrent OM and potential conductive hearing loss
*Urinary tract infections in up to 20% (caused by structural abnormalities and reflux usually)

==Eye problems==
*poorly documented
*Refractive errors and strabismus (less common, glaucoma and nystagmas reported)
*Regular evaluations

==Dental abnormalities (common)==
*Early teeth eruption (54%)
*Excessive wear and discoloration
*Teeth may be crooked due to changes in craniofacial structure and many require orthodontic work

==Heart problems==
(thought to be rare)
*Overt congenital heart disease is thought to be rare may be up to 10%
*Most common are ASD, VSD, PDA
*Routine echo not necessary

==Malignant tumors==
(rare, but may occur in approximately 2-4% of individuals with Sotos syndrome)
*Embryonal tumors
*Neuroblastoma
*Mephroblastoma
*Hepatoblastoma
*Age of onset is wide and no clear benefit from surveillance

==Musculoskeletal==
*Hypotonia, large size, joint laxity can cause complications
*Foot deformities (~50%)
*Flat feet common
*Kyphoscoliosis

==GI==
*Tendency for severe constipation in over 10%

==Main Psychosocial Considerations==
*Intellectual, social, and emotional maturity may evolve on widely different timetables
*How is school going? (confirm that she is in 4th grade and ask specifically about math and language skills)
*Does she have a new IEP since last visit?
*Is she getting the help you would like her to?
*Math tutoring and speech therapy?
*How is attention and behavior?
*Assess social relationships (is she being teased or socially isolated)
*Any changes in the family?
*Confirm number of siblings

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Number of other generalized overgrowth syndromes
*Sotos syndrome is distinguished from others by presence of developmental delay and characteristic facial features.
*Other overgrowth syndromes have other commonly associated characteristics that also aid in distinction

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA1)'''

SMA is the number one genetic killer of children under the age of 2

==Introduction==
*Establish rapport with small talk and introduce myself
*Assess the concerns of the family and what they hope to learn today
*Ascertain the level of understanding of SMA
*Briefly discuss the topics to be discussed during the appointment
*Ask if anyone has any questions

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==Definition==
*Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of inherited neuromuscular diseases that attack motor neurons, which control the movement of voluntary muscles. This disease causes anterior horn cells (lower motor neurons) in the base of the brain and spinal cord to gradually disintegrate.

==Types of SMA==
*Prior to the availability of molecular diagnosis, SMA was classified into subgroups. These subgroup classifications are useful for prognosis and management.
*Infantile progressive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA 1)
*Intermediate SMA (SMA 2)
*Juvenile SMA (SMA 3)
*Adult SMA (SMA 4)
*These forms differ in the age of onset, the severity, the progression rate, and in the adult form, the muscles affected.

==Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance:
**SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder
*Chromosome location:
**Chromosomal locus 5q11-q13
*Molecular Genetics:
**SMN (survival motor neuron) has been identified as the primary SMA-determining gene
***The SMN gene is very complex, containing repetitive sequences, pseudogenes, deletions and inverted duplications
***2 copies exist: the telomeric copy (SMNT ) and the centromeric copy (SMNC)
***These only differ by a few nucleotides
***Unaffected individuals have 2 copies arranged in tandem on each chromosome 5 (centromeric and telomeric)
**A defect in both copies of the SMNT gene causes SMA
**Individuals with SMA are either:
***Homozygous for a deletion of exon 7 of the SMNT gene (95% of cases) or
***Compound heterozygotes for a deletion of exon 7 of the SMNT gene and a subtle intragenic mutation of SMN T (5% of cases)
**Abnormal protein product is produced by mutant SMN T
***Normal gene products are thought to play a role in splicing; it has been shown to be necessary for pre-mRNA splicing

==Incidence==
*One study suggests that SMA occurs at a frequency of ~4: 100,000
*1:40-1:80 are carriers for SMA

==Clinical Features (general for all types of SMA)==
*Progressive degeneration and loss of the lower motor neurons (anterior horn cells) in the spinal cord and sometimes in the brainstem nuclei.
**Results in muscle weakness and atrophy
**The onset varies from before birth until adulthood
**The weakness is symmetric and progressive
*Contractures, usually mild
*Anterior horn cell involvement, apparent due to tongue fasciculations and absent deep tendon reflexes
*Respiratory failure
*Variable cranial nerve involvement: opthalmoplegia, facial diplegia

==Additional Specific SMA1Clinical Features==
*Lack of motor development
*Infants with the gravest prognosis have sucking and swallowing difficulty
*Face muscles are completely spared
*Ocular and diaphragmatic muscles are involved late in the disease
*The heart is normal
*Intellect is normal
*Prognosis depends primarily upon respiratory function

==Risk Assessment==
*~98% of parents of an affected child are carriers, and ~2% are not carriers, thus the mutation was de novo
*The risk of occurrence/recurrence for parents who are both carriers is 25%, while the risk of having an unaffected carrier child is 50%.

==Age of Onset, natural history and life span==
*The age of onset for SMA1 is before 6 months
*The lifespan is two years or less

==Testing==
*Diagnostic: A direct DNA analysis to detect a homozygous deletion of exon 7 of SMNT is used to confirm a clinical diagnosis.
**This test has one limitation, it does not detect intragenic mutations
**If only one deletion SMNT is present, this does not confirm a clinical diagnosis but supports a clinical diagnosis.
*Carrier: Dosage testing for carrier detection. This PCR test determines the # of exon 7 containing SMNT gene copies that are present in an individual.
**Both technical and interpretation limitations for this test
***Some carriers have 2 SMNT gene copies on one chromosome
***Some carriers have one normal allele and a subtle mutation
***de novo mutations occur in 2% of SMA patients, meaning that only one parent is a carrier
*Prenatal: this test is possible for fetuses at a 25% risk when the disease causing SMN mutations in both parents is known
**Analysis of fetal DNA obtained via CVS or amnio
*If the SMNT gene is normal, two other tests are available:
**Neurophysiologic studies-electromyography (EMG). This reveals devervation and diminished motor potential amplitude.
**Muscle biopsy- reveals evidence of devervation with no other structural abnormalities.

==Management==
*Physical therapy and occupational therapy to promote and maintain motor skills
*Monitoring of respiratory function, ventilatory support (usually not used for SMA1 patients)
*SMA1 patients that aren't sucking or swallowing well may need a gastrostomy (g-tube)

==Differential Diagnosis==
*SMA1 is considered in the differential diagnosis of the &quot;floppy child
*Prader-Willi syndrome
*Pompe's disease (when cardiomegaly is present)
*Congenital myotonic dystrophy
*Congenital muscular dystrophy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*The parents,grandparents and immediate family have an impending death (patients with SMA1) and are typically having a difficult time dealing with the severity of the disease.
*Counselors should encourage parents to discuss their feelings and concerns.
*As this disease is very draining on the parents,grandparents and immediate family, the counselor should check on the support network available to the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spontaneous Pregnancy Loss and X-chromosome Inactivation'''

==General Information about Pregnancy Loss==
*Common problem
**Approximately 50% of all conceptions spontaneously lost
**Often occurs before pregnancy is diagnosed
**Miscarriage occurs in 20% of confirmed pregnancies
*Recurrent pregnancy loss affects 1 in 100 (1%) of couples who wish to have children
*Potential causes of pregnancy loss
**Most miscarriages due to sporadic chromosome abnormalities
**About 50% of women experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss of &quot;non-genetic&quot; explanation
***Anatomical problems of female reproductive tract
***Infectious diseases
***Hormonal problems
**About 20% of women with recurrent pregnancy loss may have a mutation on their X-chromosome causing skewed X-inactivation
**Many couples have no explanation for their recurrent pregnancy loss

==Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (SXCI)==
*Pattern of X-inactivation weighted heavily toward one chromosome
**Would expect random inactivation to inactivate each chromosome about 50% of the time
**Highly skewed is defined as &gt;90% of cells with same active X-chromosome
*May be caused by mutation in an essential gene on one X-chromosome that causes the chromosome to be selected against by the body
**Mutation probably causes the cells that express it to have a growth disadvantage
**The gene must be essential so that cells die when it doesn't function properly
*Usually causes no health problems in females
**If other X-chromosome also has an X-linked recessive mutation, female will be a manifesting carrier
**Have seen women with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Lesch-Nyhan, and hemophilia that are as severely affected as men
**Mutation on active X-chromosome can be new mutation inherited from father's sperm or mutation that affects her father also
*Mutation that causes skewed X-inactivation inherited from mother's side
**May be family history of pregnancy loss on mothers side affecting male conceptions
***Studies show consistently more females in families with skewed X-inactivation than males
***Mutation lethal in males who don't have second X-chromosome to compensate
**Females with SXCI have 32% risk to lose pregnancy compared to 15% risk in general population
**In families with SXCI, females who inherit their mother's inactive X will inactivate the same X chromosome

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stickler Syndrome'''

==Introductions==

==Contracting==
*What is your understanding of why your doctor referred you to see us?
*Do you have any questions or concerns?
*You are probably already familiar with Stickler syndrome since you have it yourself, but your doctor probably just wanted to make sure you understand the chance for your child to have it as well as the potential for a child to have different characteristics or symptoms than you.
*We also may have the ability to do prenatal testing to see if your fetus has Stickler syndrome.
*Is this something you are interested in?
*Establish an agenda: Obtain medical and family history to determine if there are any other risks that we might want to talk about, answer any questions you might have about Stickler syndrome, discuss risks

==Elicit Family History==
*Are there any other members of the family who have a diagnosis if Stickler syndrome
*Any family members with cleft palate, recurrent ear infections, nearsightedness, blindness, cataracts, glaucoma, astigmatism, early-onset arthritis, hyperextendable joints, joint replacements in the 30-40s, joint stiffness, hearing impairment (high-tone?), mitral valve prolapse, or a flatened midface
*Anyone die young or unexpectedly
*Anyone with Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects (heart defects, CL/CP, spina bifida)
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Anyone with cancer diagnosed at a young age (before 50)

==Stickler Syndrome (a.k.a. hereditary artho-ophthalmopathy)==
*A connective tissue disorder that can affect the ocular (eyes), craniofacial (formation of facial structures), audiologic (hearing), cardiovascular (heart), and skeletal systems.
*Connective tissue (CT) is the most plentiful protein in the body and acts as support tissue. CT can allow for elastic stretching and tightening, especially in the muscles.
*Prevalence: 1/7500 - 1/10,000 - often goes undiagnosed in individuals with mild symptoms
*Affects both sexes

==Clinical Description==
*Symptoms vary from patient to patient, even within the same family)
*Patients do not usually have all the symptoms!!
*Features include:
*Ophthalmologic
**Congenital or early-onset cataracts.
**Myopia (non-progressive, detectable in newborn period) - can lead to retinal detachment, which can result in blindness.
**Glaucoma
**Vitreal anomalies (gel that fills the eye).
***Type 1 characterized by a persistence of a vestigial vitreous gel in the retrolental space and is bordered by a folded membrane, present at birth.
***Type 2 is much less common, and is characterized by sparse and irregularly thickened bundles throughout the vitreous cavity, have milder ocular findings.
***Types of vitreal fluid anomalies breed true within families.
*Craniofacial
**Midface hypoplasia
**Depressed nasal bridge (in childhood)
**Anteverted nares (upturned nose)
**Bifid uvula, submucous cleft, or cleft palate
**Robin sequence (micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis)
*Audiologic
**Hearing impairment (40%) - degree of impairment (typically high one) is variable and may be progressive.
**Sensorineural hearing loss (common)
**Conductive hearing loss can also be seen.
*Skeletal (problems tend to worsen with age)
**Short stature as compared to unaffected siblings
**Marfanoid body habitus without tall stature
**Hypermobility
**Joint laxity (becomes less prominent with age)
**Mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
**Precocious osteoarthritis - joint pain in childhood may signify the onset, can be a major complication in adulthood.
**Scoliosis
*Mitral Valve Prolapse (45-50%) - occurs when the heart valve shuts and then protrudes into the next chamber.
*Possible learning difficulties due to sight and hearing problems/

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnosis
*At present, no consensus minimal clinical diagnostic criteria exist.
**A point system was developed to aid in the diagnosis by Rose et al. 2000.
*Molecular testing not reliable for making the diagnosis, only confirmatory.

==Management==
*Eye
**Ophthalmology evaluation - at least annual starting in infancy.
**-Prescribe corrective lenses as early as possible
**-Prophylactic laser photocoagulation of vitreoretinopathy.
**Surgery as needed to remove cataracts or repair detachments.
**Avoid activities such as contact sports which may lead to retinal detachment.
**Patients should be aware of symptoms associated with retinal detachment.
*Hearing Loss
**Baseline audiogram.
**Hearing can be progressive, so follow-up evals are recommended.
*Arthropy
**Full skeletal eval including x-rays for mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.
**Treatment is symptomatic with anti-inflammatory meds.
**Possible avoidance of high-impact activities.
*Cleft palate
**Deal with growth and feeding issues - bottle feed baby in seated position, use special bottles, frequent weight checks.
**Otolaryngology/craniofacial eval
**Test hearing regularly
**Treat otitis media aggressively, possibly PE tubes
**Cleft palate surgery ~9 months
**Eventual speech therapy.
*Mitral valve prolapse
**Screening for MVP with ECHO
**If MVP exists, need antibiotic prophylaxis for certain surgical procedures.

==Genetics==
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*Recurrence risk is 50% for each child of an affected parent.
*Prevalence of new gene mutations unknown
*Disease causing mutations in genes COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2, but some families are not linked to any of these loci.
*COL2A1 gene (cause in 75% of families)
**Typically have type 1 vitreous anomaly and a high risk for retinal detachment, normal hearing or mild SNHL, and early-onset arthritis.
*COL11A1
**Typically have type 2 vitreous anomaly and more severe hearing loss
*COL11A2
**Causes &quot;anocular&quot; Stickler syn because protein is not expressed in the eye -a.k.a oto-spondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED).

==Molecular Testing==
*Clinical testing available for COL2A1 and COL11A1
**Tulane University Health Sciences Center
Matrix DNA Diagnostics Laboratory New Orleans, LA
**Contact: Charlene Crain, MBA, BSMT (ASCP)
**email:ccrain@tulane.edu phone: (504) 988-7706 fax: (504) 988-7704
**Methodology: Direct DNA
*Research testing may be available for COL11A2 and mutations in unknown loci
*Geneclinics

==Pregnancy and Testing==
*Option of prenatal testing exists for fetuses at 50% risk for Stickler syndrome if a mutation in COL2A1 or COL11A1 has been identified in the affected parent
*molecular testing performed either on sample from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about 10-12 weeks' gestation or amniocentesis at 16-18 weeks' gestation.
*Alternatively, or in conjunction with molecular genetic testing, ultrasound can be performed at 19-20 weeks gestation to detect cleft palate,
*HOWEVER not all individuals with Stickler have cleft palate and cleft palates is difficult to detect on ultrasound
*Detection somewhat dependent on position of the fetus

==Psychosocial Counseling==
*Discuss patient experience with Stickler syndrome and perceived burden
*Discuss unaffected husband/partner's comfort-level with the diagnosis.
*Assess whether they are concerned about having a child with Stickler syndrome?
*Assess patient support systems.
*Address potential feelings of guilt.
*Assess whether she would like information about online support group

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tamoxifen - Selective Estrogen Response Modifiers (SERMS)'''

Risk Reduction Agents for Breast Cancer

==Why Estrogen is Important==
*Estrogen is a sex steroid hormone important for many physiologic processes
**Affects growth, differentiation, and function of reproductive system
**Maintains bone density and protects against osteoporosis
**Thought to be cardioprotective, largely through its effects on blood lipids
**Regulates reproductive behavior by effects in the brain
*Estrogen effects are mediated through their binding to nuclear proteins called estrogen receptors (ER)
**Binding activates receptor dimerization which activates or represses transcription depending on other tissue specific co-factors
***ER-mediated transcription is stimulated through at least 2 transactivation domains called AF-1 and AF-2 (AF-1 is hormone-independent, whereas AF-2 is hormone-dependent)
**There are two types of estrogen receptors: ER-alpha and ER-beta
***The exact role of ER-beta in breast cancer is unknown
***The role of ER-alpha is well defined
****Maximum transcriptional activation requires both AF-1 and AF-2
*Prolonged stimulation of breast ductal epithelium by estrogen can contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer
**The role of hormone therapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer was first demonstrated in 1895 by Dr. George Beatson in Glasgow, Scotland
***He performed a bilateral oophorectomy in a 33 year old woman with advanced cancer who lived 4 years before dying of recurrent disease
**Approximately 50%-70% of women benefit from hormonal therapy if their tumors are positive for both ER and PR (progesterone)
**Only 11% benefit if their tumors are negative for both types

==What is a Selective Estrogen Response Modifier (SERM)?==
*SERMS have estrogen agonist effects in some tissues and antagonist effects in others
**SERMS bind competitively to the ERs; AF-2 is not activated, but AF-1 remains active and receptor dimerization and nuclear localization occur
**SERMS can initiate transcription in the presence of certain accessory proteins and result in the expression of some estrogen-responsive genes
**The effect depends on the tissue and the gene
***Ideally, we want an anti-estrogen effect in the breast and endometrium and estrogenic effects on lipid profiles, the CNS, skeletal, vagina and cardiovascular systems.
****It is the anti-estrogenic effects in the CNS and vagina that cause menopausal side effects
*Three categories of SERMS
**Triphenylethylene derivatives like tamoxifen
**Other nonsteroidal compounds like raloxifene
**Steroidal compounds that have more complete antiestrogenic activity

==Tamoxifen (Nolvadex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals)==
*History and Background
**Synthesized in the 1960s
**The first chemotherapy to be approved for the prevention of any cancer
**Approved by the FDA in 1977 for treatment of advanced breast cancer
***Has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer as well as adjuvant treatment in post-menopausal patients following mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation
***Indicated as preventative treatment to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk patients and to reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer
***Most effective in patients who are ER+, PR+, and postmenopausal
***Approved dose is 20mg daily for 5 years
****Taking tamoxifen for longer than 5 years is not thought to be more effective than 5 years of therapy
***Also used to treat men who have breast cancer
**Approved in 1998, for reducing incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women
***Approximately 1/3 of ER+ cancers are resistant to Tamoxifen
*The Estrogen Effects of Tamoxifen
**Anti-estrogen effect in breast, CNS, and vagina mucosa
**Positive estrogen effect in liver (reducing cholesterol), bone, and endometrium
**Acquired tamoxifen resistance is a cause of treatment failure in breast cancer
***The mechanism of acquired tamoxifen resistance is not well defined
***Mouse studies showed that tamoxifen-resistant tumors remained estrogen dependent in vivo but the resistance was associated with the ability of tamoxifen to stimulate tumor growth
****Altered metabolism of tamoxifen was also seen in the tumor
*Preclinical Studies
**Decreased the incidence of mammary tumors in rodents, but increased the risk of liver tumors. There has been no increase in liver cancer in humans.
*Clinical Trials: 3 randomized trials of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent
**National Surgical Adjuvant Bowel and Breast Project (NSABP): Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT)
***A landmark trial that was stopped early by the independent safety monitoring committee due to promising results
***A trial of Tamoxifen (20mg daily for 5 years) versus placebo in 13,388 healthy women at risk for developing invasive breast cancer
****A randomized, prospective, double-blind study that began June 1st 1992
****Enrollment ended September 30, 1997
****Study was terminated and results disclosed March 24, 1998
***Eligibility criteria
****Age 60 or older
****Or age 35-59 with a 5-year predicted risk of developing breast cancer using the Gail model of 1.66%
****Or over 35 years with a diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ
***Results:
****With a median follow-up of 54.6 months, tamoxifen decreased the overall risk of developing invasive breast cancer by 49% and non-invasive breast cancer by 50%
*Breakdown of risk reduction:
**44% in women aged 49 years or younger
**51% in women 50-59 years
**55% in women 60 years or older
**56% in women with a history of LCIS
**86% in women with atypical hyperplasia
****The reduction of breast cancer was limited to the reduction of ER+ breast cancer. No difference was seen in the occurrence of ER- tumors
*The occurrence of ER+ tumors was decreased by 69%
****96% of participants were Caucasian
****There was no difference in mortality between the tamoxifen-treated and placebo groups in the trial
*A meta-analysis of 30,000 women in 55 trials with ER+ or unknown tumor status showed a mortality reduction of 26% during 5 years of follow up
**Royal Marsden Tamoxifen Breast Cancer Prevention Study
***From 1986 to 1996, 2494 women were randomized to tamoxifen (20mg daily) or placebo for 8 years
***Eligibility:
****Age between 30 and 70 with at least one first-degree relative under age 50 with breast cancer
****Or one first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer
****Or one affected first-degree relative of any age plus another affected first- or second-degree relative
****Or a benign breast biopsy and a first-degree relative with breast cancer
***Use of hormone replacement therapy was allowed
****41% of women in the study received HRT which is a potential confounding factor
***Results
****At 70 months follow up, no difference in the incidence of breast cancer was seen
**Italian Randomized Trial of Breast Cancer Prevention in Hysterectomized Women
***In 1992, this trial of tamoxifen (20mg daily for 5 years) versus placebo began
***Ended in 1997 with 5408 women with low to normal risk of breast cancer
****The goal was to recruit 20,000 women
****Half of the women recruited had already had an oophorectomy, which is known to reduce the risk of breast cancer, so only 3986 were available for evaluation
***Eligibility: Healthy women age 35-70 who had a hysterectomy
***Results: At median of 46 months follow up, there was no difference in the number of breast cancer cases in treatment versus control arms.
**How do we explain the discrepancy of the 3 trials?
***The studies are dissimilar in design, population enrolled, and eligibility criteria
***The two European trials together, had fewer than half the number of breast cancer cases of the NSABP
***The Italian trial had a high dropout rate
***Royal Marsden study likely had large number of mutation carriers based on eligibility criteria
***BCPT was largest and did not allow HRT: the influence of HRT on the potential effect of tamoxifen chemoprevention is unclear
***There could be differences in compliance
*Benefits of Tamoxifen
**Fewer bony fractures due to slower bone loss
**Lower blood cholesterol
*Risks of Tamoxifen
**Side effects similar to the onset of menopause
***Hot flashes, vaginal discharge, dryness or itching, and irregular menses
***Headaches, fatigue, nausea and/or vomiting, and skin rash
**Serious side effects
***Endometrial cancer (Risk ratio = 2.53 in Tamoxifen group in NSABP trial)
****No endometrial cancer deaths occurred in the NSABP trial
****All endometrial cancers were Stage I
***Deep Vein Thrombosis (1.6x higher in NSABP trial)
***Pulmonary embolism (3x higher in NSABP trial)
***Stroke
***Cataract development
***Most serious adverse events have occurred in women over age 50

==Other SERMS==
*Raloxifene (Evista; Eli Lilly and Co)
**Background
***A nonsteroidal compound; a benzothiophene derivative
***Binds to ER with an affinity equal to that of estradiol
***Unlike Tamoxifen, does not stimulate uterine tissue
****There is a raloxifene response element that was identified in the promoter region of certain genes which could contribute to some of its functional differences
***Has estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood clotting
**The MORE (Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation) Study
***Study Design
****7704 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were followed for a median of 40 months
*Women taking estrogen or who had a history of breast cancer were excluded
****Randomized, double-blind study of raloxifene (60mg or 120mg per day) versus placebo
***Results
****The primary endpoint was that raloxifene reduced the risk of osteoporosis progressing as seen by the preservation of bone mineral density, the reduction of bone turnover, and the decreased incidence of vertebral fractures
*Approved in the US in 1997 for the prevention of osteoporosis
****Raloxifene also decreased the incidence of invasive breast cancers by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during 3 years of treatment
*The risk reduction was similar for both doses of raloxifene and was confined to ER+ tumors
*13 cases of breast cancer were confirmed among the 5129 women assigned to raloxifene versus 27 among the 2576 women assigned to the placebo (RR=0.24)
*Raloxifene decreased the risk of ER+ breast cancer by 90%
****Raloxifene increased the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (RR=3.1), but did not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
**Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial
***Large, multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind study for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women which began in June 1999
***Will randomize 22,000 postmenopausal women at increased risk for developing breast cancer to tamoxifen (20mg daily) or raloxifene (60mg daily) for 5 years
****Women must be postmenopausal and at least 35 years old
****Increased risk is defined as LCIS treated by local excision only or at least a 1.66% projected 5-year probability of developing invasive breast cancer
***Designed to see if raloxifene is more or less effective than tamoxifen in reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in women at increased risk of developing the disease
***STAR trial information
****NCI (800) 422-6237 or cancertrials.nci.nih.gov
****NSABP www.nsabp.pitt.edu
****Anticipated time of final analysis is 2006
**NCI pilot trial is being done to evaluate the safety of 2 years of raloxifene therapy in high-risk premenopausal women.
*Toremifene (Fareston: Schering Corp)
**Very similar to tamoxifen; also a triphenylethylene; differs by only a single chlorine atom
**First synthesized in 1981; first clinical trials done in 1982
**Trials have been done to compare tamoxifen and toremifene
***Response rates are similar
****Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different
***Some studies have found a slightly higher incidence of undesirable effects in the tamoxifen treatment group, but these differences are not statistically significant
***There is no clinical data to imply that it causes endometrial carcinoma, although it may unmask pre-existing endometrial tumors
**Approved for use as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer in 1997 in the U.S.

==Chemoprevention for BRCA1/2 Mutation Carriers==
*Will Tamoxifen be as effective in mutation carriers as it is in other women who are at increased risk of breast cancer?
**The risk of BRCA1 tumors appears to be associated with estrogen related risk factors and oophorectomy reduces risk of hereditary breast cancer suggesting tamoxifen may be effective
**From 10 studies, 83% of BRCA1 breast tumors have been found to be ER-, whereas 76% of BRCA2 breast tumors were ER+
**If chemoprevention is needed for at least 10 years to produce and effect, new chemoprevention agents will need to be developed for women in their 30s, as the breast cancer risk curves are steepest between 40 and 50 years of age.
*Mary-Claire King's report of the NSABP trial (2001)
**The main outcome measure was to compare the incidence of breast cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were receiving tamoxifen versus placebo
**Design and Method
***Peripheral white blood cells were stored from study participants in the NSABP trial in anticipation of the identification of BRCA1/2
***Genomic analysis of BRCA1/2 was done for 288 breast cancer cases
****19 carriers were identified
****5/8 BRCA1 mutation carriers had taken tamoxifen
*RR=1.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-10.7
****3/11 BRCA2 mutation carriers had taken tamoxifen
*RR=0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-1.56
***The power to detect a moderate protective effect was low
**The results were not statistically significant
***Tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers by 62%, but did not reduce the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers
****Must consider that tamoxifen use began at age 35 or older
****It is not known if tamoxifen use at a younger age would reduce breast cancer incidence in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
**King concludes that for women who have not yet developed breast cancer, genotype at BRCA1 and BRCA2 has a major impact on the expected effect of tamoxifen in reducing incidence of primary breast cancer
*Steven Narod's case-control study (2000)
**Results contrast with the results of the NSABP trial, but sample size is much greater
**The aim of the study was to see if tamoxifen protects against contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers since it is known to do so in the general population
**Study Design
***Compared 209 women with bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations (cases) and 384 women with unilateral breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations (controls) in a matched case-control study.
**Results
***Tamoxifen use was reported by 10.5% of the 209 bilateral cases and 21.1% of the 384 unilateral controls
***Tamoxifen protected against contralateral breast cancer for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
***In women who used tamoxifen for 2-4 years, the risk of contralateral breast cancer was reduced by 75%

==The Future of Chemoprevention==
*To develop hormonally active agents with more favorable toxicity profiles
**Currently SERMS, aromatase inhibitors, and novel hormonal contraceptive regimens are being researched
***Anti-estrogen drugs called ERDs are estrogen receptor down-regulators and act by decreasing the number of active estrogen receptors on a cell or by decreasing their level of responsiveness to estrogen
****On April 25th 2002, the FDA approved an ERD called Faslodex (fulvestrant) for postmenopausal women with advanced ER+ disease for whom tamoxifen is no longer effective
*Given as a monthly intramuscular injection
*Side effects:
**Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache, and hot flashes
***Aromatase inhibitors
****They lower the amount of estrogen being produced by the body, rather than block estrogen's ability to &quot;turn on&quot; cancer cells
****In post-menopausal women, androgen is converted to estrogen by aromatase
****Aromatase inhibitors block this conversion and are often used by women who have already tried other anti-estrogen therapies
****Examples
*Arimidex (anastrozole)
*Femara (letrozole)
*Aromasin (exemestane)
*To develop agents for the prevention of ER- breast cancer
**Approximately 1/3 of invasive cancers are ER-
**Women under 50 years old are more than twice as likely to have an ER- tumor as women over 50
**Do the majority of pre-cancerous mammary epithelial cells progress from an estrogen-dependent phenotype to an estrogen-independent phenotype later in the carcinogenesis process? Or does it arise de novo?
*To define the precise molecular changes that characterize the progression of a normal breast epithelial cell through premalignancy and malignancy
**Then can search for agents to reverse these changes or prevent malignant transformation from occurring
*To develop biological markers of breast cancer risk and progression
**Biomarkers could be used to refine short-term risk assessments
**Could be used to predict response to specific classes of preventive agents

Re:

We're not making up new words. The term 'bioeconomics' has been using for more than half decades.

I agree. We need a comprehensive introduction to bioeconomics, not a series of mathematics examples.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tay-Sachs Disease'''

==Contracting==
*Establish rapport with small talk
*Assess the understanding for the referral to genetics
*Assess the concerns of the family and what they hope to learn today
*Ascertain the level of understanding of Tay-Sachs for those members present
*Discuss topics to be covered during the appointment
*Ask if anyone has any questions

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD)?==
*Also called Hexosaminidase A deficiency
*A genetic disorder that commonly affects the Ashkenazi Jewish population
*Hexosaminidase A is a lysosomal enzyme that is required to catalyze one step in the catabolism of gangliosides.
*The lack of hexosaminidase A results in the faulty metabolism of sphingolipids
*A specific sphingolipid, GM2 ganglioside accumulates in the cells, especially nerve and brain cells
*Death usually occurs before age 4 in the infantile type of disease
*Juvenile, chronic, and adult onset forms of the disorder also exist
*No specific therapy is currently available.

==Genetic Etiology==
*Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion
*The chromosomal locus of HEXA is 15q23-q24
*Mutations in the HEXA gene are associated with the Tay-Sachs phenotype

==Molecular Genetics==
*The HEXA gene is ~35 kb, has 14 exons and both 5' and 3' UTRs
*The normal gene product is Beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain
**The gene encodes the alpha chain of the heterodimeric protein, beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A)
**The protein has a single alpha chain and a single beta chain; both HEX A and HEX B show GM2 ganglioside cleaving acitivity, but that of HEX A is 8x greater than HEX B
**The gene for HEX B is located on chromosome 5; this subunit is responsible for most of the catalytic activity
*More than 90 HEXA mutations have been identified
**The majority are associated with the infantile phenotype
**2 null mutations result in 90-95% of the cases of infantile Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
*The abnormal gene product: mutations result in many effects ranging from processing or subunit assembly to defective catalytic activity

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*1:3600 Ashkenazi Jewish live births.
*The carrier rate is 1:25-30 Ashkenazi Jewish persons
*The carrier rate for the French-Canadian population is 1:50
*Among non-Jews, the disease incidence is about 100 times less common and the carrier rate is 1:250-1:300.
*As the result of extensive genetic counseling of carriers identified through screening programs and the monitoring of at risk pregnancies, the incidence of TSD has been reduced by greater than 90%.

==Risk Assessment==
*If both parents are carriers, the risk of occurrence is 25% with each pregnancy
*If either or both parents are carriers, the risk to have a carrier child is 50% for each pregnancy
*When both parents are carriers, unaffected children have a 67% risk of being carriers.

==Age of Onset and Life Span==
*Onset at age 3-6 months
*Death before the age of 4

==Clinical Features==
*Hexosaminidase A deficiency is characterized by:
**Progressive weakness and loss of motor skills beginning between 3-6 months
**Decreased attentiveness
**Increased startle response
**A cherry red spot of the fovea centralis of the macula of the retina can be seen in &gt;90% of cases
**Hyperreflexia with sustained ankle clonus
*These signs are followed by:
**Progressive neurodegeneration
**Seizures
**Blindness, typically by the end of the 8th month of life
**Spasticity of the limbs
**An increase in head circumference often reaches 3 standard deviations above normal due to an enlargement of the brain NOT hydrocephalus
**Progressive inability to swallow
**Breathing difficulties
*Juvenile, chronic and adult-onset forms have later onset, slower progression, and more variable neurologic findings

==Testing==
*Diagnostic (Biochemical)
**The diagnosis of TSD relies upon the absence or near absence of HEX A in the serum or WBC of a symptomatic individual in the presence of normal or elevated activity of HEX B isoenzyme
**If the HEX A activity is undetectable= homozygote, affected
*Carrier (Biochemical)
**In population screening, assay of HEX A activity in serum or leukocytes using synthetic substrates provides a simple, inexpensive and accurate method for heterozygote identification
**Serum is used for males and women who are not pregnant and not using oral contraceptives
**Leukocytes are used for testing pregnant women, women using oral contraceptives and any individual whose serum activity level was in the inconclusive range.
**If the HEX A activity is ~1/2 the normal level=heterzygote, carrier
*Molecular Genetic Testing:
**Used to identify specific disease-causing alleles in affected individuals and to distinguish pseudodeficiency alleles from disease-causing alleles in individuals with apparent deficiency of HEX A activity identified through screening programs
**Mutation analysis is available for the 6 most common mutations at most clinical laboratories
***Comprised of three null alleles (non expressing) +TATC1278, +1IVC12, +1IVS9, which in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity are associated with TSD
***The G269S allele, which is associated with the adult onset form of TSD in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity with a null allele
***And two pseudodeficiency alleles R247W and R249W, which are not associated with the neurological disease, but are associated with reduced degradation of synthetic substrate when HEX A activity is determined
*Pseudodeficiency alleles reduce HEX A activity toward synthetic substrates, but not toward the natural substrate GM2 ganglioside
*Since all assays use artificial substrate, a potential problem arises when distinguishing between a true deficient allele and a pseudodeficient allele.
*Problem avoided by using a DNA-based test on any individual who had abnormal activity to identify the disease causing mutation
*Prenatal
**Available when:
***HEX A enzyme assay has shown both parents to be carriers for TSD and molecular genetics has ruled out the possibility of pseudodeficient alleles in either parent
***If one parent is known to be a heterozygote and the other parent has inconclusive enzymatic activity and no disease-causing mutation can be found
***And if the mother is a known carrier and the father's status is unknown or he is unavailable for testing
**Testing can be performed by assay of the HEX A activity in fetal cells obtained by CVS or amniocentesis
**If the mutation has been identified in both parents, then mutational analysis of the HEXA gene in fetal DNA (extracted from fetal cells removed by CVS or amniocentesis) can be done.

==Management and Treatment==
*Treatment for TSD is primarily supportive
*Provide adequate nutrition and hydration
*Manage infectious disease
*Protect the airway
*Control seizures with anticonvulsant medications, alter dose based on severity and type of seizure
*As the patient becomes more disabled, good bowel management is important
*Older patients with the adult-onset form may need antidepressants or antipsychotic therapy
*Enzyme and gene therapy:
**Attempts have been unsuccessful
**Infusions and bone marrow transpantation have had no benefit
**CNS enzyme replacement are in the experimental stage at this time

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Activator deficient TSD
**The enzymatic activity of both HEX A and HEX B is normal
**GM2 ganglioside accumulation occurs due to a deficit of the intralysosomal glycoprotein &quot;GM2 activator&quot; that is required for the degradation of GM2 ganglioside.
**The phenotype is identical to TSD
*The cherry red spot of the fovea centralis of the macula of the retina is seen during the first year of life in patients with Gaucher disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, galactosialidosis, Niemann-Pick type A, and Sandhoff disease
*Neurologic regression during the first 6 months of life is seen in many disorders including: Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, Alexander disease, infantile Gaucher disease, and both infantile and late infantile forms of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.
*Sandoff disease presents with the same neurological findings as TSD, although it is rarely seen in Jewish infants.
*For the adult form- SMA3, Friedreich ataxia, ALS and other lysosomal storage diseases should be considered

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Impending death
*Devastating disease
*Contemplation of pregnancy termination
*Guilt

==Prevention==
*Heterozygote detection
*Population-based screens for Ashkenazi Jews
*Therapeutic termination

Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system.

==An Example==

First, let's examine a non-chemistry example.  Say you have one card from a deck of playing cards.  It can have one of 52 possible values.  Now you pick up four more cards.  If the deck were shuffled randomly, the odds of you holding, say, a &quot;straight flush&quot; are 0.00154%.  The odds of having a &quot;high card&quot;, which is essentially a &quot;nothing&quot; hand, is 50.12%.  In the case of a straight flush, the cards you are holding are highly organized.  They must be in a specific, exact pattern (like 10 9 8 7 6 of the same suit).  To have a high card, no two cards must have the same rank and the cards cannot be in order.

There is a very low probability of having a straight flush because the cards are in a very orderly state.  There is a large probability of having &quot;nothing&quot; because the cards are in a random, disorderly state.  In our card-playing system, straight flushes have '''low entropy''' because they are so orderly.  &quot;Nothing&quot; hands have '''high entropy''' because they are disorderly and random.  Furthermore, it takes minimal effort to toss all the cards in the air and randomize their order.  Increasing the entropy of the system comes naturally.  On the other hand, sorting the cards in order takes time and effort.  It does not happen randomly.  Decreasing the entropy of the system is unnatural and takes effort, or energy.

=== In Chemistry ===

The entropy of a chemical system is a measure of its disorder or chaos.  More precisely, it is a measure of the ''dispersion of energy''.  A solid has low entropy (low chaos, orderly) because the molecules are locked into a rigid structure.  Their energy is not dispersed freely.  A gas has high entropy (high chaos, disorderly) because the molecules are free to move about randomly.  The energy of the system is dispersed over a large area with unlimited possibilities of the location of each molecule.

{{SideBox|Absolute zero can never be achieved.}}
As temperature decreases, so does entropy.  Theoretically, at '''absolute zero''' (0 K, or -273 °C), the entropy of the system would be zero.  This is because the solid would be perfectly crystallized so that its energy is not dispersed at all.

As you will soon learn, [[General Chemistry/Thermodynamics/The Second Law of Thermodynamics|the Second Law of Thermodynamics]] tells us that the entropy of the universe always increases.  Think about it.  If you have built a house of cards, the entropy of the system is low.  A house of cards is very orderly, with each card having a very specific location.  The house of cards will undoubtedly collapse.  The resulting pile of cards is very disorderly.  The cards can be in any position and still be a random pile of cards.  The entropy has increased spontaneously.  Houses of cards will spontaneously collapse, but they never spontaneously build themselves up.  This is because high entropy is natural and low entropy is unnatural.

== Entropy Changes ==
When analyzing the entropy change of a chemical reaction, you would need specific numbers.  As a guideline, you can estimate the entropy change based on some basic rules:

{{TextBox|1=
* Melting and boiling ''increases'' entropy
* Freezing and condensing ''decreases'' entropy
* Dissolving a solute ''increases'' entropy
* Forming precipitates ''decreases'' entropy}}

If you do happen to know the absolute entropy of substances in a reaction (by looking it up in a chart), you can calculate the change in entropy.  Entropy is symbolized with &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  The change in entropy is &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;.  As with enthalpy, the degree symbol (&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^o&lt;/math&gt;) represents STP.  The change in entropy is the absolute entropy of the products minus the absolute entropy of the reactants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are precisely three different classes of three-dimensional constant-curvature geometry: Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry. The three geometries are all built on the same first four axioms, but each has a unique version of the fifth axiom, also known as the parallel postulate. The 1868 ''Essay on an Interpretation of Non-Euclidean Geometry'' by Eugenio Beltrami (1835 - 1900) proved the logical consistency of the two Non-Euclidean geometries, hyperbolic and elliptic.

== The Parallel Postulate ==

The parallel postulate is as follows for the corresponding geometries.

'''Euclidean geometry:'''
Playfair's version: &quot;Given a line ''l'' and a point ''P'' not on ''l'', there exists a unique line ''m'' through ''P'' that is parallel to ''l''.&quot; Euclid's version: &quot;Suppose that a line ''l'' meets two other lines ''m'' and ''n'' so that the sum of the interior angles on one side of ''l'' is less than 180°. Then ''m'' and ''n'' intersect in a point on that side of ''l''.&quot; These two versions are equivalent; though Playfair's may be easier to conceive, Euclid's is often useful for proofs.

'''Hyperbolic geometry:'''
Given an arbitrary infinite line ''l'' and any point ''P'' not on ''l'', there exist two or more distinct lines which pass through ''P'' and are parallel to ''l''.

'''Elliptic geometry:'''
Given an arbitrary infinite line ''l'' and any point ''P'' not on ''l'', there does not exist a line which passes through ''P'' and is parallel to ''l''.

== Hyperbolic Geometry ==

Hyperbolic geometry is also known as saddle geometry or Lobachevskian geometry. It differs in many ways to Euclidean geometry, often leading to quite counter-intuitive results. Some of these remarkable consequences of this geometry's unique fifth postulate include:

1. The sum of the three interior angles in a triangle is strictly less than 180°. Moreover, the angle sums of two distinct triangles are not necessarily the same.

2. Two triangles with the same interior angles have the same area.

===Models of Hyperbolic Space===

The following are four of the most common models used to describe hyperbolic space.

1. '''The Poincaré Disc Model'''. Also known as the conformal disc model. In it, the hyperbolic plane is represented by the interior of a circle, and lines are represented by arcs of circles that are orthogonal to the boundary circle and by diameters of the boundary circle. Preserves hyperbolic angles.

2. '''The Klein Model'''. Also known as the Beltrami-Klein model or projective disc model. In it, the hyperbolic plane is represented by the interior of a circle, and lines are represented by chords of the circle. This model gives a misleading visual representation of the magnitude of angles.

3. '''The Poincaré Half-Plane Model'''. The hyperbolic plane is represented by one-half of the Euclidean plane, as defined by a given Euclidean line ''l'', where ''l'' is not considered part of the hyperbolic space. Lines are represented by half-circles orthogonal to ''l'' or rays perpendicular to ''l''. Preserves hyperbolic angles.

4. '''The Lorentz Model'''. Spheres in Lorentzian four-space. The hyperbolic plane is represented by a two-dimensional hyperboloid of revolution embedded in three-dimensional Minkowski space.

===Defining ''Parallel''===

Based on this geometry's definition of the fifth axiom, what does ''parallel'' mean? The following definitions are made for this geometry. If a line ''l'' and a line ''m'' do not intersect in the hyperbolic plane, but intersect at the plane's boundary of infinity, then ''l'' and ''m'' are said to be '''parallel'''. If a line ''p'' and a line ''q'' neither intersect in the hyperbolic plane nor at the boundary at infinity, then ''p'' and ''q'' are said to be '''ultraparallel'''.

===The Ultraparallel Theorem===

For any two lines ''m'' and ''n'' in the hyperbolic plane such that ''m'' and ''n'' are ultraparallel, there exists a unique line ''l'' that is perpendicular to both ''m'' and ''n''.

== Elliptic Geometry ==


===Models of Elliptic Space===

Spherical geometry gives us perhaps the simplest model of elliptic geometry. Points are represented by points on the sphere. Lines are represented by circles through the points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dimensional analysis''' is a mathematical technique used to predict physical parameters that influence the flow in fluid mechanics, heat transfer in thermodynamics, and so forth. The analysis involves the fundamental units of dimensions MLT: mass, length, and time. It is helpful in experimental work because it provides a guide to factors that significantly affect the studied phenomena.

Dimensional analysis is commonly used to determine the relationships between several variables, i.e. to find the force as a function of other variables when an exact functional relationship is unknown. Based on understanding of the problem, we assume a certain functional form.

== Units/Dimensions ==
The defined units are based on the modern MLT system: mass, length, time.  All other quantities can be expressed in terms of these basic units.

For example,

{|
|-
|velocity||m/s||= L/T
|-
|acceleration||m/s&amp;sup2;||= L/T&amp;sup2;
|-
|force||kgm/s&amp;sup2;||= ML/T&amp;sup2;
|}

Where L/T, L/T&amp;sup2;, ML/T&amp;sup2;, etc. are referred to as the derived units.

Another system for dimensionless analysis is the FLT system, the force, length, time system.  In this case, mass &amp;equiv; F/a, which makes the units of mass as FT&amp;sup2;/L, since acceleration has units of L/T&amp;sup2;.

==Rayleigh Method==
An elementary method for finding a functional relationship with respect to a parameter in interest is the Rayleigh Method, and will be illustrated with an example, using the MLT system.

Say that we are interested in the drag, D, which is a force on a ship.  What exactly is the drag a function of?  These variables need to be chosen correctly, though selection of such variables depends largely on one's experience in the topic.  It is known that drag depends on

{|
|-
|&lt;u&gt;Quantity&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;Symbol&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;Dimension&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|Size||l||L
|-
|Viscosity||&amp;mu;||M/LT
|-
|Density||&amp;rho;||M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Velocity||V||L/T
|-
|Gravity||g||L/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
This means that ''D = f(l,&amp;rho;,&amp;mu;V,g)'' where ''f'' is some function.

With the Rayleigh Method, we assume that ''D=Cl&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''C'' is a dimensionless constant, and ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'', and ''e'' are exponents, whose values are not yet known.

Note that the dimensions of the left side, force, must equal those on the right side.  Here, we use only the three independent dimensions for the variables on the right side: M, L, and T.

===Step 1: Setting up the equation===
Write the equation in terms of dimensions only, i.e. replace the quantities with their respective units.  The equation then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ML}{T^2}=(L)^a\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^b\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{LT}\right)^c\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^d\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T^2}\right)^e&lt;/math&gt;

On the left side, we have ''M&amp;sup1;L&amp;sup1;T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;'', which is equal to the dimensions on the right side.  Therefore, the exponents of the right side must be such that the units are ''M&amp;sup1;L&amp;sup1;T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;''

===Step 2: Solving for the exponents===
Equate the exponents to each other in terms of their respective fundamental units:

:M: 1 = b + c                 since M&amp;sup1; = M&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;
:L: 1 = a - 3b - c + d + e    since L&amp;sup1; = L&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;-3b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;
:T: -2 = -c - d - 2e          since T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = T&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;-d&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;

It is seen that there are three equations, but 5 unknown variables.  This means that a complete solution cannot be obtained.  Thus, we choose to solve ''a'', ''b'', and ''d'' in terms of ''c'' and ''e''.  These choices are based on experience.  Therefore,

{|
|-
|From M:||b = 1 - c||(i)
|-
|From T:||d = 2 - c - 2e||(ii)
|-
|From L:||a = 1 + 3b + c - d - e||(iii)
|}

Solving (i), (ii), and (iii) simultaneously, we obtain

:a = 2 - c + e

Substituting the exponents back into the original equation, we obtain

:D = Cl&lt;sup&gt;2+e-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;1-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2-c-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

Collecting like exponents together,
:&lt;math&gt;D=C\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{-e}\displaystyle\left(\frac{Vl\rho}{\mu}\right)^{-c}{\rho}l^2V^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which means

:D = Cl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

For the different exponents,

:Terms with exponent of 1:     C&amp;rho;
:Terms with exponent of 2:     l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:Terms with exponent of e:     l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{lg}{V^2}\right)^e = \displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{-e}&lt;/math&gt; (iv)
:Terms with exponent of c:     l&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{l{\rho}V}{\mu}\right)^{-c}&lt;/math&gt; (v)

The right sides of (iv) and (v) are known as the dimensionless groups.

===Step 3: Determining the dimensionless groups===
Note that ''e'' and ''c'' are unknown.  Consider the following cases:

:If e = 1     then (iv) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{lg}{V^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If e = -1    then (iv) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If c = 1     then (v) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{\mu}{l{\rho}V}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If c = -1    then (v) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{l{\rho}V}{\mu}\right) = \displaystyle\left(\frac{lV}{\nu}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

::Where ''&amp;nu;'' is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

And so on for different exponents.  It turns out that:

:&lt;math&gt;{Reynolds\ Number}\equiv\frac{Vl}{\nu}=N_{R}=Re&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{Froude\ Number}\equiv\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}}=N_{F}=Fr&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''Re'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''Fr'' are the usual notations for the Reynolds and Froude Numbers respectively.  Such dimensionless groups keep reoccurring throughout Fluid Mechanics and other fields.

Choosing exponents of ''-1'' for ''c'' and ''-&amp;frac12;'' for ''e'', which result in the Reynolds and Froude Numbers respectively, we obtain

:D = g(Fr, Re)&amp;rho;l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:Where g(Fr, Re) is a dimensionless function

This can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}=g(Fr,Re)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is a dimensionless quantity, and a function of only 2 variables instead of 5.
This dimensionless quantity turns out to be the drag coefficient, ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''.

:&lt;math&gt;C_D\equiv\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Notes===
The Rayleigh Method has limitations because of the premise that an exponential relationship exists between the variables.

==The Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem/Method==
This method will be illustrated by the same example as that for Rayleigh Method, the drag on a ship.

Say that we have ''n'' number of quantities (e.g. 6 quantities, which are ''D'',''l'',''&amp;rho;'',''&amp;mu;'',''V'', and ''g'') and ''m'' number of dimensions (e.g. 3 dimensions, which are ''M'', ''L'', and ''T'').  These quantities can be reduced to ''(n - m)'' independent dimensionless groups, such as ''Re'' and ''Fr''.

Say that 

:''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f(A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)''

where ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are quantities such as drag, length, and so forth, as mentioned under the ''n'' number of quantities, and ''f'' implies the functional relationship between ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the other quantities.

Then re-arranging, we obtain

:''0 = f(A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) - A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f(A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Which can be further reduced, using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem, to obtain

:''0 = f(&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;)''

===Forming &amp;pi; Groups===
For each &amp;pi; group, take ''m'' of the quantities, ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', known as ''m'' repeating variables, and one of the other remaining variables.  Note that experience dictates which quantities make the best repeating variables.

The &amp;pi; groups, in general form, would then be

:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''
:&amp;#8942;
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''

which are all dimensionless quantities.

===Step 1: Setup &amp;pi; groups===

For the MLT System, ''m = 3'', so choose ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the repeating variables.

Using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem on the Drag Equation:

:''f(D, l, &amp;rho;, &amp;mu;, V, g) = 0''

Where ''m = 3'', ''n = 6'', so there will be ''n - m = 3'' &amp;pi; groups.

We will select ''&amp;rho;'', ''V'', and ''l'' as the repeating variables (RV), leaving the remaining quantities as ''D'', ''&amp;mu;'', and ''g''.  Note that if the analysis does not work out, we could always go back and repeat using new RVs.  Thus,

:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;D''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;g''

Which are all dimensionless quantities, i.e. having units of ''M&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''

===Step 2: Determine &amp;pi; groups===
For the first &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_1}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_1}(L)^{z_1}\displaystyle\left(\frac{ML}{T^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding and collecting like units, we can solve for the exponents:

:For M:     0 = x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1               &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For T:     0 = -y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - 2              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -2
:For L:     0 = -3x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3(-1) - (-2) - 1 = -2

Therefore, we find that the exponents ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' are -1, -2, and -2 respectively.  This means that the first dimensionless &amp;pi; group, &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is

:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;D = &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}V^2l^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For the second &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_2}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_2}(L)^{z_2}\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{LT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the exponents,

:For M:     x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 = 0               &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For T:     -y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - 1 = 0              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For L:     -3x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - 1 = 0   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - (-1) + 3(-1) = -1

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\rho^{-1}V^{-1}l^{-1}\mu=\frac{\mu}{{\rho}Vl}=\frac{\nu}{Vl}&lt;/math&gt;

However, we will now invert &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\frac{Vl}{\nu}=Reynolds\ Number&lt;/math&gt;

It is permissible to exponentiate any &amp;pi; group, e.g. &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;frac12;&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., to form a new group, as this does not alter the functional form.

For the third &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_3}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_3}(L)^{z_3}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the exponents,

:For M:     x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0                   &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:For T:     -y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - 2 = 0              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -2
:For L:     -3x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 = 0   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1 - (-2) = 1

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_3=\rho^0V^{-2}lg=\frac{lg}{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Raising it to the power of ''-&amp;frac12;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi_3}}=\frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}}=Froude\ Number&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the three &amp;pi; groups can be written together as

:&lt;math&gt;f\displaystyle\left(\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2},Re,Fr\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finally,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}=f(Re,Fr)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is the same result as obtained with the Rayleigh Method, but with the Buckingham &amp;pi; Method, we did not have to assume a functional dependence.

==Common &amp;pi; Groups==
Using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem, we will now examine the &amp;pi; groups which appear most frequently in fluid dynamics.  Most fluid flow situations depend on the following quantities:

{|
|-
|''l''||length
|-
|''D''||diameter
|-
|''&amp;epsilon;''||surface roughness
|-
|''V''||velocity of flow
|-
|''&amp;rho;''||density of fluid
|-
|''&amp;Delta;p''||pressure drop
|-
|''g''||gravity
|-
|''&amp;mu;''||absolute/dynamic viscosity
|-
|''&amp;sigma;''||surface tension
|-
|''K'' or ''E&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''||Compressibility/Bulk Modulus
|}

There are 10 quantities, ''n = 10'', and 3 dimensions, ''m = 3'', so this gives ''n - m = 7'' &amp;pi; groups.  Choosing ''V'', ''&amp;rho;'', and ''l'' as the repeating variables, performing the Buckingham &amp;pi; analysis, and using different exponents for some &amp;pi; groups, we obtain the following &amp;pi; groups, which are common in the study of Fluid Mechanics:

&lt;math&gt;\pi_1=\frac{{\Delta}p}{{\rho}V^2}=Pressure\ Coefficient=C_P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\frac{V}{\sqrt{gl}}=Froude\ Number=Fr&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_3=\frac{Vl\rho}{\mu}=Reynolds\ Number=Re&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_4=\frac{V^2l\rho}{\sigma}=Weber\ Number=We&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_5=\frac{V}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}}=Mach\ Number=Ma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_6=\frac{l}{D}=Length:Diameter\ Ratio&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_7=\frac{\epsilon}{D}=Relative\ Roughness&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control Volume Analysis ==
A fluid dynamic system can be analyzed using a ''control volume'', which is an imaginary surface enclosing a volume of interest.
The control volume can be fixed or moving, and it can be rigid or deformable.
Thus, we will have to write the most general case of the laws of mechanics to deal with control volumes.

===Conservation of Mass ===
The first equation we can write is the conservation of mass over time.
Consider a system where mass flow is given by ''dm/dt'', where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The term on the left denotes the rate of change of the mass of the system. The first term on the right describes the amount of flow across the control surface. The second term on the right refer to the condition within the control volume.
We have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \dot m = \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA +\frac{d}{dt}\int_{CV}\rho dV
&lt;/math&gt;

However, by definition of a system the mass of which is a constant; thus the left-hand side of the above equation equals to zero and it could be rewritten as: 

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA =-\frac{d}{dt}\int_{CV}\rho dV
&lt;/math&gt;

For steady flow, the time derivative of the quantity is zero, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA =0
&lt;/math&gt;

And for incompressible flow, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

If we consider flow through a tube, we have, for steady flow,

&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_1A_1V_1 = \rho_2A_2V_2
&lt;/math&gt;

and for incompressible steady flow,  ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Conservation of Momentum===
Law of conservation of momentum as applied to a control volume states that

&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} \!\mathbf{V} \mathbf{\rho} \,dV
  \right) + \int_{CS} \mathbf{V}\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the velocity vector and ''n'' is the unit vector normal to the control surface at that point.

The sum of the forces represents the sum of forces that act on the entirety of the fluid volume (body forces) and the forces that act only upon the bounding surface of a fluid (surface forces).
Body forces include the gravitational force.

===Conservation of Energy===
The law of Conservation of Energy in fluid mechanics is a specific application of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf{W}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} e\mathbf{\rho} \,dV
  \right) + \int_{CS} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the energy per unit mass.

== Conservation Equations of Mass, Momentum and Energy ==

=== Equation of Continuity ===

* A differential mass balance relating density change to velocity.
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot
  \left(
    \rho \mathbf{V}
  \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;


* For incompressible fluids the equation of continuity reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; 
  \rho 
  \left(
    \nabla \cdot 
    \mathbf{V}
  \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:since 
::&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
:for all incompressible fluids



=== Euler's Equation ===

* applies conservation of momentum to inviscid, incompressible flow.
: &lt;math&gt;
  \rho \mathbf{g} - \nabla p = \rho\frac{d\mathbf{V}}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stokes' Equation ===

* applies conservation of momentum in creeping flow limit (low Reynold's Number)

:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla p = \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{V}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fluid Kinematics ==

In this section fluid motion will be described without concern with the actual forces necessary to produce the motion.  The principles of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum permit some patterns of fluid motion, and exclude others.  Many important real-world situations can be analyzed using this approach, without considering friction.

== I.The Velocity Field ==

Fluids tend to flow easily, which results in a net motion of molecules from one point in space to another point as a function of time. Using the continuum hypothesis, fluids are broken down into fluid particles, which are composed of numerous fluid molecules. These particles interact with one another and with their surroundings. Thus the motion of a fluid, using a Eulerian model (continuum hypothesis), can be described in terms of the acceleration or velocity of fluid particles and not in terms of molecular motion. 

The continuum assumption allows for any fluid property (density,pressure, velocity, acceleration, ...) to be described as a function of fluid location. The representation of fluid parameters in terms of spacial coordinates is called a ''field representation''. 

Ex:       T = T(x,y,z,t)


=== Eularian &amp; Lagrangian Flow ===

''Eulerian analysis'' uses the field concept, derived from the continuum assumption.

''Lagrangian analysis'' involves following individual fluid particles as they move about, and determining how fluid properties vary as a function of time. 


(-See below)

=== Steady vs Unsteady Flow ===
When the flowing particle velocity, temperature and pressure do not change with respect to time is called steady flow. It should be noted that the conditions are different at different points, but at a particular point it is constant.

=== Streamlines, Streaklines, Pathlines ===
If in a flow field a curve is drawn in such a way that the tangent to the curve at any point represents the velocity to that point. Such imaginary curve in the flow field is known is stream line.
the curve along which a particle moves in a flow field for a given period of time is known as path line.
the curve drawn by the particles in a flow field that passes through the same point for a given period of time is known as streak line
 for a steady flow stream line, path line and streak line will be the same.

== II.Acceleration Field ==

The acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using the an Eulerian description for velocity, the ''velocity field'' '''V''' = '''V'''(''x,y,z,t'') and taking deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the ''acceleration field''. 

Now, consider a fluid particle A, moving along its pathline with velocity '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; 


'''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,t) = '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''y''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''z''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''t'']


Differentiate to obtain the acceleration: (chain rule)

'''(1)''' &lt;math&gt; \vec{a} &lt;/math&gt;= dV/dt + dV/dx dx/dt + dv/dy dy/dt + dv/dz dz/dt 

''Note: these are partial derivs, since velocity a function with several variables.'' 
Changing the partial velocity components u = dx/dt, v = dy/dt, w = dz/dt in EQ. 1 we obtain: 

&lt;math&gt; \vec{a} = {D\vec{V} \over Dt} = {\partial \vec{V} \over \partial t }+u{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial x}+v{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial y}+w{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial z } &lt;/math&gt;

=== Material Derivative ===

The material derivative is sometimes referred to as the substantial derivative, ...

=== Unsteady and Convective Effects ===
The material derivative, as seen above, contains two types of terms. Those involving the time derivative d()/dt and those involving spatial derivatives d()/dx, ... , ... . The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow. 

The portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the ''convective derivative''. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different.

=== Streamline coordinates ===

=== III. Reynolds Transport Theorem ===
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D}{Dt} \int_{V(t)} \mathcal{F}(\vec{x},t) dV = \int_{V(t)} \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial t} dV + \int_{S(t)} \mathcal{F} \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n} dS
&lt;/math&gt;

== Fluid Mechanics as a Subset of the Continuum Mechanics ==

== Frames of Reference in Fluid Mechanics==
There are two different frames of reference that are commonly used in the analysis of fluid mechanics problems: Fixed (Eulerian) reference frames and Material (Lagrangian) reference frames.

* In fixed reference frames fluid motion is defined with respect to a coordinate system that does not vary with time or fluid motion.  

* In material reference frames fluid motion is defined with respect to a coordinate system that follows the motion of the fluid so that the same volume of fluid remains enclosed throughout the analysis.  The Reynold's Transport Theorem (to be defined later) is used to solve fluid mechanics problems when the frame of reference is Lagrangian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== In a Nutshell ==

Success in the classroom has a lot to do with your personal attitude and self-control. 

Condition yourself to attend class, prepare, observe, listen, take notes, ask questions and discuss.

Make sure you are well rested. Try to have your A game on, but still have fun inside and outside the classroom.

== Introduction ==

The bulk of college courses are still taught through the medium of a classroom.

The effectiveness of classroom teaching can vary highly, and is highly dependent on your attitude, and somewhat on the tutor.

You have to quickly figure out two things:

1. Am I required to be in class? 
 
Attendance policies may vary.  Some instructors do not keep attendance records, and some instructors will count your attendance as part of your overall grade. It is always a good idea to attend class regularly.

2. Is attending class efficient?

Always attend class.  This is where you will learn what information is most important for exams, and it also serves as an opportunity to ask questions when you need to.  Your instructor has to be in class every day, so it is respectful to honor their time.  When you can show your instructors that you are serious about the class by showing up on time every day, they are more likely to work with you when you have an issue.

== When Attending Class ==

Make sure you can see visual material.  Make sure you can hear spoken presentations.  (It's worthwhile to go see an eye doctor once a year and have your ears tested AT LEAST once when you enter college)  

Arrive early and find a spot where you can see and hear everything.  The front of the class typically increases your odds of successfully hearing and seeing all relevant material.

Carry a notebook and pen and take notes.  Make sure you know how to take notes: [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/success/notes.html]

Maintain basic personal hygiene (bath, comb your hair, wash your clothes, brush your teeth) to make life bearable to those that attend class with you.

== Your Classroom Tutor/Teacher ==

Your professor/teacher (or other tutor) is a key factor in your success.
  
This is the person that you have to convince that you have sufficient command over a subject to get a successful grading. He or she is also a human with strengths, weaknesses, likes, fears, hangups and quirks.  Try to understand what those are and work around them. Listen carefully for clues about themselves when they speak. Talk to older students. Scan a few publications by that tutor, or look at web pages where the tutor is expressing him/herself. Take great care to always be courteous, respectful, and polite when talking to them, in spite of any quirks they might have. 

It's important to realize that even in a large class, a professor can typically see exactly what everyone is doing. Most people feel that in a class of 20+ people they kind of &quot;vanish&quot;. This is simply NOT true. The tutor can see exactly what you are doing, and especially so if you are doing something that differentiates you, such as talking to your neighbor, sleeping, doodling, playing games on your cell phone, and so forth. Activities such as these might earn you a mental note as a &quot;non-attention-paying&quot; member of the class and reduce your grade. When you are in class, mentally discipline yourself to pay attention, make eye contact, take notes and participate in class discussions.

If your tutor is good at explaining complex topics, you are fortunate and in for a treat. You will learn new things from an old salt that knows how to enlighten you. Unfortunately, this can be rare. That means you may have to ask questions to seek greater understanding. Not all teachers welcome questions, because it takes time to answer them well. If that's the case, go see the tutor in his/her office or after class and ask him/her to explain the issue, or ask via e-mail or via phone. If there is something you don't get, and your tutor can't explain it well, try other students (or teacher's assistants) or even other lecturers teaching the same subject, students that have successfully learned the material previously, or the Internet.

Your teacher wields a lot of power. Your success is literally in his/or her hands. Some students have a problem with that, mostly because they have a general problem with authority. Discipline yourself to view your tutor not as &quot;the enemy&quot; or an obstacle to your success, but a key partner on the road to success.

== Summary ==

The college classroom will have an incredibly strong impact on your future. 

Your mental attitudes before, during and after class will be a key contributor to your eventual success.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Akako. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Akako~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DbC ==

With all due respect, the treatment of Design by Contract 
is sloppy, to put in mildly, and somewhat bragging about
Ada's type system. In fact, DbC is formally specified,
see ECMA 367, 8.9. It is
integrated into Eiffel's vocabulary, and checked both
at runtime and at compile time, covering a lot more than
Ada can now hope to achieve. (See for example the discussion
of introducing pragma Precondition and pragma Postcondition
in the AI database.)

Ada's expressiveness is not the same in this regard, so I think it isn't
the best thing to establish and instrumentalize a fuzzy notion of precisely
defined concepts of DbC. (Except perhaps for anti-Ada
trolls.) It is appropriate to make a reference to DbC, though. 

It is true that the SPARK language and Eiffel have some common &quot;mechanics&quot;.
You can specify pre/post-conditions, you can have check-correctness and
loop correctness, at the Ada subprogram/Eiffel feature level, for example.
Of course, exception correctness is not needed in SPARK, but it would be
needed in Ada, were DbC introduced to Ada.

But where is the class consistency in Ada, provided by class invariants
in Eiffel?
Initialising an object of a tagged type must establish the class invariant
INVC, every call of a primitive operation must then reestablish 
INVC. This is of course integrated with the pre/postconditions of
subprograms. How do you express this in the Ada language.
I think it is fair to say that class correctness/package correctness is
not available in Ada.  What about package-scope operations
not bound to the tagged type, yet affecting object components?

Inheritance in DbC means that contracts are inherited in a similarly consistent
way that must follow formal rules. Failing that, the compiler will not
accept the program text. (Roughly, oring of the preconditions,
and anding of the postconditions, etc). I think talking about the pros
of Ada's type system is not the same as talking about DbC,
a formally specified, integrated part of a standardised language.

Last but not least, the notion of DbC includes a proof obligation. This thing
is present in SPARK, but not in Ada.

Yeah, I should write an example package demonstrating DbC in
Ada to match ECMA 367, 8.9 (plus visibility (= export status)
and inheritance).
Then we could demonstrate how Ada's type sytem and DbC can
synergetically produce programs with less bugs than usual.

Wait, isn't this what SPARK is about? :-)

=== It`s a Wiki ===

Well this is Wiki - you can allways improve the text and I would welcome that.

But note that this module originates from [[Computer programming/Error handling]]. [[Computer programming/Error handling]] is about error handling in generall - without  any particular language in mind. The aim is more about telling people that errors need to be handled - and preferly in the language - then pushing DoC. More for &quot;anti error handling trolls&quot; then &quot;anti Ada trolls&quot;. Yes they exitst. Programmers who belive that they can do it better then any sofisticated programming lanuguage.

[[Ada Programming/Error handling]] are only examples on how your can archive an particular technique in Ada. Have you seen the other page? Have you noticed how they share text and where they are different?

: seen them, and I disagree with what is said about DbC, and optimization for example.

Sad that there is no Eiffel or Spark book on Wikibooks. It would really be interesting have to have [[Eiffel Programming/Error handling]] or [[SPARK Programming/Error handling]] as better example of DoC.

And have you read [[w:Design by contract]]? Every time I look at it there are more DbC implementations.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:08, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

: I disagree. There is an increasing number of &quot;me too&quot;s, yes. How do they integrate inheritance and contracts? Where are the loop invariants? Can you write check-correct programs? Are they exception-correct? That is to  say, how can you specify that the postcondition is going to be true in case of a handled exception, using these wannabe DbC systems?

:: I never said I find them any good ;-) - as far as I see it only &quot;D&quot; and &quot;SPARK&quot; realy deverve to be called a DoC language. And even there I might be wrong. It seams that you know a lot about the subject - more then me for that matter. So could you write up an article about DbC? Wikibooks is still missing one. The appropiate place for a chapter would be [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]] or &lt;small&gt;(Not using a trademark)&lt;/small&gt; [[Computer_Programming/Programming by Contract]] with a link to that chapter at [[Computer_Programming#Paradigms]] and/or [[Computer_Programming#Key_concepts]]. Of corse you can allways start a new book as well if you have enough material. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I have now added [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]]. (Programming by contract reminds me too much of employer/employee) The page isn't very well connected yet, I'll try to inject some links in the proper places

::::And the page has moved to [[Computer programming/Design by Contract]], joining the other pages.

: Writing a function in a Hoare triple is not DbC yet.

: o.K. I'll have a try rewriting some of the remarks.

:: I tried, but where is the text??? After clicking the edit link (which takes me Computer_Programming/Error_handling/5), editing, previewing, and saving, the old text comes back. What am I doing wrong? The new text is still there when I do it again:

::: Nothing, the page cache has fooled you. You can either wait until the cache expires or click here http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_programming/Error_handling&amp;action=purge to purge the cache. 

 In Design by Contract (DbC) functions must be called with the correct parameters. This is the caller's
 part of the contract. If the types of actual
 arguments match the types of formal arguments, and if the actual arguments have values that make
 the function's preconditions True, then the subprogram gets a chance to fulfill its postcondition.
 Otherwise an error condition occours.
 Now you might wonder how that is going to work. Lets look at the example first:

=== Programming by Contract ===

Just read http://www.aechmea.de/html/german/Information01_e.htm. Since Eiffel has hogged the term &quot;Design by Contract&quot; they use the term &quot;Programming by Contract&quot; - Alltrue I hate it when companys hogg general terms for trademak it might be better to use the non protected term.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:37, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:In the case of Eiffel, they have created the thing. There was little O-O correctness theory of practical use before Eiffel AFAIK. Now everyone is trying to follow suit. If we, too, start using well defined terms in a sloppy manner, are we still doing it the Ada way? DbC is too valuable to be equated to just some checking in my view.

:[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 21:51, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== Please make any Programming by Contract book generic (language agnostic) ==

Most programmers do not have the luxury of choosing the language they use.  For several years I have been programming almost exclusively in VB6, next year I wil have to return to C++ for a while.  Neither include direct support for PbC but that doesn't mean that programmers who are forced to use them can't benefit from the ideas.  If PbC is introduced through the medium of a specific language, whether it is Eiffel, SPARK, or ADA busy programmers who use other languages will simply not be encouraged to apply the lessons of PbC even though quite a lot of them can be applied even in the absence of compiler support.  So please separate the concepts of PbC from the language specific implementation.  By the way I think that Programming by Contract is a better name than Design by Contract, especially if Betrand Meyer and co. have registered the latter as a trademark.   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:13, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:I have tried to follow your advice in [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]]. Since DbC is well thought out and integrated (criticism of arguably minor issues notwithstanding), I have stuck to DbC, in fairly general terms. Some pre/postcondition additions seem to miss quite a bit of DbC, however laudible they are. Comments etc. most welcome. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 04:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Error handling should be described as correctly as possible ==

I think that we should get this page correct,
or else there is a risk of looking a little foolish.

However, before crossing out half of the text
and adding another new half (which might not be
good enough either), I'd like to discuss this.

Example:

Add the following function to Error_Handling_5 and observe
that the compiler does indeed NOT help you to
fullfill your contractual obligation. You'd think
that calling Square_Root is all right, because
all parameters are &gt;= 0, but the compiler cannot
tell this! Add this function, and see the compiler
be happy:

   function &quot;**&quot;(X: Float; E: Integer) return Float is
   begin
      return -1.0;
   end &quot;**&quot;;

Then run the program and notice Constraint_Error.
Hence, as DbC requires, it is the programmer who MUST
pay attention to calling a function with proper
arguments. The Ada compiler cannot in general help
you, even though it does some (sub)type checking.

Even if this example seems silly, absent SPARK it should prove
that there is no a way for an Ada compiler to replace proper
obedience to preconditions with type based magic.

So at the very least, the presentation requires
rewording, and maybe a different theoretical model.

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 07:01, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

=== True ===

A propper error handling chapter is indeed very important. There are to many false claims floating about - mostly from C programmers which allways thing they don't need support from the compiler. And if that means that DbC is not Ada then we need to say so - correctness of [[Computer_programming/Error_handling]] is more important then showing of Ada as a jack of all trades.

However In DcB or Strong-Typing I believe it is important to stess that runtime checks can be minimized. In languages without automated runtime checks you often have either to many checks (paranoid programmers adding checks anywhere) or to little checks (lazy programmers adding checks only when the problem happened at least once.

:Could someone in the know please instruct how to edit the text and the examples ''after'' the first paragraphs of a section? There is a load of misinformation not just about DbC, but also about the pre/post of Sqrt, sorry, and I'd like to correct this. However, each time I try to edit, I get the first paragraph of the section and nothing else. What should I read/do? [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 20:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

::This page is made up using transclusion, that is, including the text of other pages in it, as if they were templates. When you are hitting the edit link, you are using the one of a section that is inside of one of those pages. For editing the text after that fragments, you have to use the edit tab of this page. You will see in the wiki source where are other pages transcluded (using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Page name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and then you can choose if you want to edit the text of this page, or the text of one of the transcluded pages.

This would be a poor fit in the Communication Theory textbook: that text is made up of intellectual biographies of communication theorists, while this module contains only a brief definition of terminology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''''''Communication''' is deeply rooted in human behaviors and societies.  It is difficult to think of social or behavioral events from which communication is absent. Indeed, communication applies to shared behaviors and properties of any collection of things, whether they are human or not.

We may turn to [[w:en:etymology|etymology]] for clues: &quot;communication&quot; (from the Latin &quot;communicare&quot;) literally means &quot;to put in common&quot;, &quot;to share&quot;. The term originally meant sharing of tangible things; food, land, goods, and property.  Today, it is often applied to [[w:en:knowledge|knowledge]] and [[w:en:information|information]] processed by living things or computers.

We might say that communication consists of transmitting information. In fact, many scholars of communication take this as a working definition, and use [[w:en:Harold Lasswell|Lasswell's]] maxim (&quot;who says what to whom&quot;) as a means of circumscribing the field of communication. Others stress the importance of clearly characterizing the historical, economic and social context. The field of [[w:en:communication theory|communication theory]] can benefit from a conceptualization of communication that is widely shared. 

[[w:en:communication theory|Communication Theory]] attempts to document types of communication, and to optimize communications for the benefit of all.

Indeed, a theory is some form of explanation of a class of observed phenomena. [[w:en:Karl Popper|Karl Popper]] colorfully described theory as 
&quot;the net which we throw out in order to catch the world--to rationalize, explain, and dominate it.&quot; The idea of a theory lies at the heart of any scholarly process, and while those in the social sciences tend to adopt the tests of a good theory from the [[w:en:natural science|natural sciences]], many who study communication adhere to an idea of communication theory that is akin to that found in other [[w:en:academic fields|academic fields]].

This book approaches communication theory from a biographical perspective, in an attempt to show theory development within a social context. Many of these theorists would not actually consider themselves &quot;communication&quot; researchers. The field of communication study is remarkably inclusionary, and integrates theoretical perspectives originally developed in a range of other disciplines.

==Theories and Models==
[[Image:Communication sender-message-reciever.png|thumb|250px|A simple communication model with a [[w:en:sender|sender]] which transfers a [[w:en:message|message]] containing [[w:en:information|information]] to a [[w:en:receiver|receiver]].]]

Many suggest that there is no such thing as a successful body of communication theory, but that we have been relatively more successful in generating models of communication. A [[w:en:model (abstract)|model]], according to a seminal 1952 article by [[w:en:Karl Deutsch|Karl Deutsch]] (&quot;On Communication Models in the Social Sciences&quot;), is &quot;a structure of symbols and operating rules which is supposed to match a set of relevant points in an existing structure or process.&quot; In other words, it is a simplified representation or template of a process that can be used to help understand the nature of communication in a social setting. Such models are necessarily not one-to-one maps of the real world, but they are successful only insofar as they accurately represent the most important elements of the real world, and the dynamics of their relationship to one another.

Deutsch suggests that a model should provide four functions. It should organize a complex system (while being as general as possible), and should provide an heuristic function. Both these functions are similar to those listed above for theories. He goes on to suggest that models should be as original as possible, that they should not be obvious enough that they fail to shed light on the existing system. They should also provide some form of measurement of the system that will work analogously within the model and within the actual system being observed.

Models are tools of inquiry in a way that theories may not be. By representing the system being observed, they provide a way of working through the problems of a &quot;real world&quot; system in a more abstract way. As such, they lend themselves to the eventual construction of theory, though it may be that theory of the sort found in the natural sciences is something that cannot be achieved in the social sciences. Unfortunately, while models provide the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;how,&quot; they are not as suited to explaining &quot;why,&quot; and therefore are rarely as satisfying as strong theory'''

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called MateoP. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name MateoP~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

==Contracting==
*Introduce myself to Mrs. Doe. Remind her that we met 2 days ago.
*How has Lil' John been doing? What are your concerns? How are you and your husband feeling about everything? empathy
*Remember that Lil' John was referred to us to see if there might be something in his genetic makeup that could explain why he was born with some of the problems he has.

==Give Results==
*I know it things are really crazy the day we met. Do you remember that we asked to take some of Lil' John's blood to look at his chromosomes?
*We talked a little about how chromosomes hold all our genetic information and are inherited from our parents, so we're supposed to have 2 copies of each one.
*We got Lil' John's test results back today. Unfortunately, they showed something different from what we would normally expect to see.
*Lil' John has 3 copies of chromosome #13. This means that he has a condition called Trisomy 13.
**silence
**&quot;I'm so sorry to give you this news&quot;
**respond to her reactions
**use empathy

==What is Trisomy 13?==
*Trisomy 13 is why Lil' John was born with his medical problems. Since our chromosomes have all the instructions that make our bodies develop and grow, when there is the wrong number (too many), our bodies are affected and don't develop correctly.
*This is why Lil' John is so small, why he has a cleft lip &amp; cleft palate, why he has a heart defect, and why he has extra fingers and holds his hands the way he does. This also means that Lil' John's brain didn't develop properly and he has profound mental retardation (why his head is so small).

==What does this mean?==
*I'm very sorry to tell you that Trisomy 13 is considered to be a lethal condition. 50% die in the first week, 95% die by 6 months. Males have a poorer prognosis.
*frequent causes of death: apnea, cardiopulmonary arrest, congenital heart disease, pneumonia
**shocked
**devastated

==How did this happen?==
*When Lil' John was created, either the sperm or egg that made him had an extra copy of this chromosome in it, so he has three copies. (this is rare)
*This is not anyone's fault. There is nothing you did to cause it &amp; nothing you could have done to prevent it from happening.

==What do we do now?==
*These children are usually not recommended for major medical intervention.
*Try to keep the child comfortable - provide food (g-tube) and supportive care.
*Decisions regarding prolonging life (ventilators), continued hospitalization, taking him home with support from Hospice Care (Starshine), residential home placement (St. Joseph's Home) - there are people who can help you take care of him.
*No decisions must be made today. We'll support what you decide.
**How are you feeling about everything? (overwhelmed, sad, angry)
**empathy
**normalize

==Support Group Info.==
*SOFT - Support Organization for Trisomy 18 &amp; 13
*fellow parent

==Follow-Up==
*Any other questions or things you would like to discuss?
*I would like to give you a call later to see how you, Lil' John, and your family are doing. Can meet with your husband later too.
*Here is my card - feel free to call me anytime if you have questions.
*I'll write you a letter that summarizes everything we talked about today, so you don't have to remember it all.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*How will you tell your husband? How will he react?
*Who else will you tell - friends and family?
*What kind of support do you have?
*Infertility - tried to conceive for 8 years . . . how has this affected your marriage?
*ART - 3 rounds of IVF and ICSI
*AMA - age 43
*declined prenatal testing because of miscarriage risk - how does that make you feel? would you have done anything differently?
*interested in future children?
*recurrence risk 0.5% - 1% (at 43, age related risk of CA is 3.23%)
*how will this affect your marriage?
*how have you and your husband dealt with difficult situations in the past?
**Listen
**ask more about her responses - why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Modern History}}

Spain already had difficulty controlling its vast territories in the Americas when the [[../French Revolution/]] aligned Spain with France, causing problems in the colonies. Eventually there were declarations of independence on the American continents.



=== Independence of Haiti ===
{{wikipedia|History of Haiti}}
Haiti had experienced the [[w:Haitian Revolution|Haitian Revolution]] in the 1790s. Haiti was a self-governing colony of France. Napoleon sent a force to attack Haiti in 1802 or 1803 (FIXME exact year?), with the intention of restoring slavery and resuming direct control of the colony. As a result, the indigenous forces overran the invading French force. The indigenous leader, [[w:Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], declared independence of Haiti on January 1, 1804.

Parts of Haiti opposed the rule of Dessalines. Someone assassinated him in 1806 and Haiti split into two governments.

{{Modern History/stub}}
=== Slave Revolts in the United States ===

=== British invasion of South America ===
{{wikipedia|British invasions of the River Plate}}
* Why did the British decide to attack South America? [C]
* Which South American cities were the targets of British action? [C]
* Who resisted the attack? [P]
* How was Spain involved in resisting this attack? [G]
(to do: What weapons were involved? [w])&lt;br&gt;

The British invasions of the Río de la Plata (Spanish: Invasiones Inglesas al Río de la Plata) were an unsuccessful series British attempts of military controlling the Spanish colonies located around the Río de la Plata basin in South America, between 1806 and 1807, as part of the global impact of the Napoleonic Wars. Spain was an ally of Napoleon at the time and, along with its South American colonies, cooperated in a trade boycott against the forces opposing Napoleon. The resistance of the local people and its active participation in the defence with no support from the Spanish Kingdom are seen as the penultimate step toward their independence.

In 1806, a British force of 1,000 to 2,000 men attacked Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate. In 1807, a second invasion with at least 10,000 men targeted Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The northern port of Montevideo fell and became a British base. A large force approached Buenos Aires with the intent of capture.

At this point, Spain seemed to weak to defend its colony. However, the people of Buenos Aires decided not to welcome the British forces. The local population engaged the British in urban combat. (FIXME find a good description of the battle, and discover whether Spain sent any force)

**Any other chronic illnesses?
***Migraines
**Information about your husband:
***Name, age, occupation?
***Any exposures?
***Any chronic illnesses?
*Psychosocial assessment
**Loss of prior pregnancy
***Guilt about termination
***Mourning for loss of fetus
***Anxiety about future pregnancies

==Elicit History==
*Construct pedigree:
**Abnormal # miscarriages, stillbirths, infant deaths?
**Previous children with chromosome abnormality, Down syndrome, birth defects, mental retardation?
**Consanguinity? Ethnicity? Other concerns/risk factors?

==What is AMA?==
*Woman is age 35 &amp; above at expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, risks of birth defects increase.
**Women do not make new eggs like males make sperm.
**They are born will all the eggs they will have in their life and these eggs mature with age.
*There are procedures that can be done to assess the risk, but there are also risks associated with the procedures.
**As women age, their risk of having a child with a chromosomal difference increases.  Advanced maternal age begins at 35 years of age because a woman's risk of having a child with a chromosomal difference at 35 is equal to the risk of having a miscarriage via an amniocentesis (both risks are equal to 1 in 200).
*The background risk for major birth defects for women of all ages is 3-5%.

==Explain Chromosome Abnormalities==
*Explain genes and chromosomes
*Show karyotypes
**Show karyotype of fetus
*Explain nondisjunction
**Be prepared to explain meiosis in males versus females
**Nondisjunction has not been found to be associated with environmental factors such as occupational exposures.
*Show abnormal karyotypes (trisomy 13)
*Give a general description of the clinical features and prognoses.
**Trisomy 18 &amp; 13 are most severe with most affected dying before the age of 1 year
**Trisomy 21 is more mild; characteristic physical features and mild to moderate MR
**Turner and Kleinfelter's syndromes are sex chromosome anomalies. Also usually mild.

==What is Trisomy 13?==
*A chromosomal disorder resulting in a syndrome characterized by specific (midline) dysmorphic features and organ malformations
*Pathogenesis:
**A single defect during the first 3 weeks of development of the mesoderm
**Leads to morphologic defects of the midface, eyes and forebrain
*Natural History
**Very poor prognosis
***Median survival is 2.5 days
***82% die within the first month
***5% survive the first 6 months
****Survivors show:
*****Severe mental defects
*****Seizures
*****Failure to thrive
**Life-sustaining emergency surgery to a newborn with trisomy 13 may be inappropriate
*Clinical Manifestations
**Dysmorphic Features
***Facial
****Microcephaly
****Wide sagittal sutures and fontanelles
****Microphthalmia or anophthalmia
****Cleft lip, cleft palate, or both
****Abnormal or low-set ears often with deafness
***Skeletal
****Thin posterior or missing ribs
****Simian crease
****Flexion of the fingers
****Camptodactyly
****Polydactyly
**Organ Malformations
***Central Nervous System
****Severe mental retardation
****Holoprosencephaly (lack of the septation of the forebrain)
****Apnea
****Seizures
***Cardiovascular
****Coarctation, ASD, PDA, VSD, dextroposition
***Gastrointestinal
****Inguinal or umbilical hernia
****Omphalocele
***Genitourinary
****Polycystic kidneys
****Males: cryptorchidism, abnormal scrotum, ambiguous genitalia
****Females: bicornuate uterus
*Etiology
**Trisomy 13
***Occurs in 75% of cases
***Due to meiotic nondisjunction
**Translocation
***20% of cases
***May be de novo or familial
**Mosaicism
***5% of cases
***Due to postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction
***Usually less severe than full trisomy 13, but is variable
*Incidence
**1/5000 - 1/12,000 live births
**AMA is a risk factor
**The prevalence of unbalanced chromosomal abnormality in the whole newborn population is about 1/250
*Recurrence
**Trisomy 13
***There is not accurate empiric recurrence risk data for trisomy 13
***It remains to be shown whether a true increased risk, taking maternal age into account, really exists
***But, presumed that likelihood for recurrence is of &quot;very low magnitude&quot; for full trisomy 13 cases
***Several studies have found no recurrences following approximately 100 pregnancies with trisomy 13
**Prenatal diagnosis may be offered for reassurance
***Maternal Serum Screening
***CVS
***Amniocentesis
***Level II ultrasound

==Quote Risks==
*Show charts to figure risk of chromosome abnormalities.
*Give age-specific risks:
**Age at EDD: ____________
**Trisomy 13: 1 in ________
**Down syndrome: 1 in _______ ( %)
**Any CA: 1 in ________ ( %)
Exposures in Pregnancy
*Types of studies done to assess safety in pregnancy
**Animal studies
**Case reports
**Population studies
***Explain what empirical data are
*Occupational
**Work with your employer to optimize safety conditions
***Proper ventilation
***Mask
***Gloves
***Lab coat
**Cidex (Glutaraldehyde)
***Chemical used in sterilization of medical instruments
***Animal data
****Was not teratogenic when administered in large doses to pregnant mice and rats
***Human data
****Questionnaire of women who sterilize instruments in hospitals found increase in miscarriage as compared to controls and compared to staff who were not involved in this activity during pregnancy
****16.7% in sterilizing staff, 10.6% in controls, 6.0% in sterilizing staff not exposed
****BUT…when adjusted for age and other exposures, the significant increase in the miscarriage rate did not persist for glutaraldehye (it did for ethylene oxide)
****No information on birth defects was reported
**Endozime
***Bacteriostatic dual enzyme cleaner produced by Ruhof Corporation
***No data on Reprotox
*Migraine Medication
**Must weigh the risk: benefit ratio
***Asses the potential fetal risks
***Determine the value of the medication to management of the mother's condition
***Should speak to prescribing physician for recommendations
**Imitrex (Sumatriptan)
***A sulfonamide derivative used as a vasoconstrictor
***Animal data
****RATS
*****Did not impair fertility or reproductive success in rats at unspecified dose
*****No embryolethality at plasma levels 50x those in humans
*****No increase in congenital anomalies at unspecified subcu dose
****Rabbits
*****Embryolethality occurred in pregnant rabbits treated at doses close to those producing maternal toxicity
**This is 3x higher than dose attained in therapy for humans
*****Fetal
***Human data
****15% of a single dose crosses the placenta as shown by in vitro studies
****GlaxoSmithKline has a registry for exposure during pregnancy
*****194 exposed pregnancies showed increase in adverse pregnancy outcome to be 3.1% which is the rate expected in the general population
****There is a low level of excretion in breast milk, but this should not pose a risk because it is administered as a single dose at infrequent intervals
**Zomig (Zolmitriptan)
***Serotonin 1D agonist used as an antimigraine drug
***Animal data
****Administration to rats did not impair fertility
****At plasma concentrations 5000x humans, there was an increase in embryolethality in rats
****At 11x human dose in rabbits, embryolethality was also seen
****Maternal toxicity occurred in these studies
***Human data
****There are no published references on human reproductive effects
****Method of action is similar to Imitrex
**Phenergan (Promethazine)
***A phenothiazine with antihistaminic activity
***Has been used as an antiemetic for morning sickness and an adjunct to narcotic analgesia during labor
***Human data
****Isolated reports of abnormalities have appeared, but have included other drugs and lacked proper control groups.
****Better designed studies have shown no association with birth defects
*****For example the Collaborative Perinatal Project
****Readily crosses the placenta when given near term
****There are conflicting reports on neonatal respiratory depression after administration
****There is no data on breast milk excretion
**Demerol (Meperidine)
***One of the most commonly used opioid analgesics
***Animal Data
****Increased incidence of exencephaly, cranioschisis, and other lesions in the hamster
***Human Data
****No association between use in the first trimester and abnormal morphologic development
****Crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation
****Commonly used during parturition to sedate parturient and neonate (inadvertently)
****Excreted into breast milk in small amounts; no adverse effects identified in nursing infants

==Discuss the Screening Options for Chromosome Abnormalities==

==Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)==
*What is it?
**The chorionic villi are wisps of fetal tissue or finger-like projections that attach the pregnancy sac to the uterine wall
**CVS is the technique in which this sample of placental tissue is obtained
**It is unique because it is used to diagnose certain birth defects in the 1st trimester of pregnancy rather than later in the pregnancy like amniocentesis
***It is usually performed at 10-12 weeks gestation
*What can it NOT tell me?
**CVS cannot detect neural tube defects such as spina bifida
***For this reason, it may be useful to measure the amount of AFP in the maternal serum at 15-18 weeks gestation
***Also, follow-up with US at 18-20 weeks is recommended
**It cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from CVS
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figures of CVS
**Transcervical CVS:
***Done at 10-12 weeks gestation
***Gentle suction is applied to the tube to remove the villi
***Discomfort is often minimal, perhaps similar to a pap smear
**Transabdominal CVS:
***Done at 10 weeks gestation or later
***Using US to guide, a spinal needed is inserted through the abdomen into the uterine wall and into the placenta
***The needle is moved back and forth several times through the placenta
***Suction is used to remove the villi sample
**CVS takes approximately 5-7 minutes (not including prep time)
**The baby's heartbeat is monitored by US
**The collected sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue and not maternal tissue was collected
**If maternal cells were collected, the CVS will be repeated
**The sample is sent to the lab
**Results are available in approximately 10 days
*What are the risks?
**The background rate of pregnancy loss at 10-12 weeks is 2-3%
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 1/100 (1%) in women with a normal uterus
***Reinforce that 99% of women will have a healthy baby
**Some studies indicate an increased risk for limb defects when CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation
***When performed at 10-12 weeks, most recent studies do not report an increased risk because limbs have already formed at this point
***The risk is approximately 1/3000 (0.0003%)

==Amniocentesis==
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

***Fetal and placental products can be detected in mother's blood serum during pregnancy
***Can be offered from 14-22 weeks but most accurate at 16-18 weeks
*Indirect measure of levels of three substances in mother's blood
**Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
***Produced by liver of fetus and excreted into amniotic fluid
***Passes into mother's bloodstream and concentration rises gradually throughout pregnancy
**Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
***Pregnancy hormone made by the placenta
***Level peaks at 10 weeks and declines throughout pregnancy
**Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
***Hormone made by fetus and placenta
***Level increases throughout pregnancy

==Risk assessment==
*Laboratory calculates a woman's risks based on levels of three substance plus other factors
**Gestational age
***Marker levels change throughout pregnancy
***Inaccurate dates are common reason for false positive
***Gestational age can be confirmed by ultrasound
**Maternal age
**Multiple gestations
**Maternal weight
***Increased weight means increased blood volume
***Markers will be diluted in serum and their concentration lower
**Maternal race
**Diabetic status
***Insulin-dependant diabetics have increased risk for neural tube defects
***Tend to have lower AFP levels, so use lower AFP cutoff
*Your specific results:
**Every pregnancy has 3-5% risk for congenital malformation
***Background risk
***Most of these problems cannot be detected prenatally
**As a woman's age increases, her risk for certain birth defects increases
**Risk figures for your pregnancy:
***ONTD: ________
***Down Syndrome: ________ compared to age associated risk _______
***Trisomy 18: ________ compared to age associated risk _______
**Screen positive for increased risk for Trisomy 18
***Occurs when AFP, hCG, and uE3 levels are all lower than expected
***Evaluation of screening performance
****Up to 100 of every 1,000 women who take test will have abnormal result (up to 10%)
*****Only 3 of those 100 women will have a baby with a birth defect
*****Most abnormal test results indicate dates are wrong or another factor above has not been accurately accounted for
*****Important to remember that test cannot identify all birth defects
****Abnormal result could be normal variation
****Sometimes no explanation for abnormal results - increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
****Test can detect:
*****60% of Trisomy 18
*****80% of ONTD
*****60% Down Syndrome

==Genes and Chromosomes==

==Trisomy 18==
*Clinical picture
**Can cause heart problems, kidney problems and other health issues
**Usually fatal within first year of life
**Children that survive have severe mental retardation
*Increased risk for pregnancy loss

==Options for further testing==
*Ultrasound
**Confirm gestational age or identify multiple fetuses to help interpret triple screen results
**Can detect many major birth defects - rule out 95% of NTDs if visualization is not limited
**Many fetuses with Trisomy 18 have certain &quot;markers&quot; that can be identified on ultrasound
***Growth retardation
***Single umbilical artery
***Heart problems
***Polyhydramnios
**Can't diagnose chromosomal abnormalities
*Amniocentesis
**Performed after 15 weeks
**Diagnostic test for some conditions
***99.7% accuracy for fetal chromosome analysis
***Detects 96% of open neural tube defects by testing AFAFP
***Cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
**Risk of pregnancy loss due to procedure is 0.5%
**Explain amniocentesis if interested
***Insert needle into abdomen through uterus to take sample of amniotic fluid that contains cells from fetus used for karyotyping
***Procedure:
****Ultrasound to locate fetus and placenta
****Abdomen cleaned with betadeine and local anesthetic (xylocaine) used to numb outer layer of skin
****Physician inserts needle in abdomen through uterus under ultrasound guidance
*****Needle inserted 1-2 minutes
*****May feel some discomfort similar to menstrual cramp
****Fluid is sent to lab and results ready in 1-2 weeks
***Recommendations
****No strenuous activity for 24 hours
****Notify doctor if severe cramping, bleeding or leakage of fluid because there is very small risk of infection
****Rh negative mothers should take RhoGAM

==Potential Psychosocial Issues==
*Emphasize the importance of choice
*Religious beliefs impact decisions about testing and termination
*Anger, distrust because of family physicians advice
*Anxiety, sadness, disbelief, fear concerning possibility of Trisomy 21
**Provide reassurance when possible
**Explain benefits of prenatal diagnosis to help prepare emotionally, mentally, and socially for birth of child with chromosome abnormality
*False positive may cause unnecessary anxiety

Notice that regardless of the way we notate this group, there is an element that generates the whole group.
 &lt;math&gt;1 + 1 \to 2 \quad 1 + 2 \to 3 \quad 1 + 3 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; 2{}\times{} 2 \to 4 \quad 2 \times 4 \to 3 \quad 2 \times 3 \to 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===The other group of order 4===
For the following example, image the number 0 through 3 written in binary, then add the digits without any carrying.  For example, 
  2 +  3 
 10 + 11
    01 
    1
Since binary addition (without carry) is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; we view this group as being two copies of &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; joined together.  That's where the name comes from.
{|
|+ &lt;math&gt;Z_2 \oplus Z_2 &lt;/math&gt;
|- style=&quot;background:gray;color:white&quot;

|- style=&quot;background:gray;color:white&quot;

==Familio (Family)==

===The Suffix -IN===

In most languages there are separate words for items of different sexes. For example, in English a female bovine creature is a &quot;cow&quot; and a male bovine creature is a &quot;bull&quot; or &quot;steer&quot;. This of course leads to much memorization of separate words, which is tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, Esperanto does away with this with two glorious letters: &quot;in&quot;. Adding ''-in'' to the end of a noun's root transforms that word into a female version of the root. For example, the Esperanto word for a bovine creature (&quot;bull&quot;, &quot;steer&quot; or &quot;cow&quot;) is ''bovo''. Adding ''-in'' to the root results in the word ''bovino'', which translates to &quot;cow&quot;. With only a few exceptions (those roots implicitly male or female), if a noun does not have the suffix ''-in'', then the sex of the noun is unspecified. If one wants to emphasize that something is masculine, one may use the root ''vir-'' as a prefix, but this is rarely done.

===The Prefix GE-===

In Esperanto, the prefix ''ge-'' is used 1) to indicate the presence of both sexes in a group described by a male or female root (Esperanto does have a very few such words) or 2) to emphasize the presence of both sexes in a group. For example, Pedro has two friends: Esmerelda and Johano. When referring to them, Pedro could call them either ''amikoj'' or ''geamikoj'', because ''amiko'' is simply a &quot;friend&quot;. But his brother and sister must be his ''gefratoj'', because ''frato'' is the word for &quot;brother&quot;).

Examples words using the prefix ''ge-'' :
*gelernejo - co-ed school
*gepatroj - parents
*geamikoj - friends
*gefratoj - siblings

==Contracting==
*What have you been told about why you were referred?
*What questions or concerns would you like us to address today?

==Disease characteristics and Etiology==
*Genetic disorder that causes tumors to form in such organs as brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, and lungs
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
**2/3 of affected individuals have new mutations
**Recurrence risks
***If one parent affected, each pregnancy has 50% chance of inheriting mutation
***If neither parent affected, recurrence risk is 1-2% to account for possible germline mosacism
**High mutation rate estimated at 1/25,000
**Penetrance 100%
*Two genes have been implicated
**TSC1
***Locus 9q34
***Gene product is hamartin
**TSC2
***Locus 16p13
***Gene product is tuberin
**Functions not fully understood but have tumor suppressor function
***Form heterodimers so may act together
***Regulate cell proliferation
*Incidence is about 1 in 6,000 live births
**50,000 affected in United States
**More than 100,000 affected worldwide
**Affects both sexes, all races and ethnic groups

==Clinical Features and Natural History==
*Extreme variability both among and within families involving any organ system

*Central Nervous System
**Lead to most morbidity and mortality
**Subependymal glial nodules (90%)
***Develop in walls of ventricles that contain cerebrospinal fluid
***Calcification occurs in first few years of life so can be detected on CT
***Not directly responsible for neurological problems
**Cortical or subcortical tubers (70%)
***Small areas on cortex that develop abnormally
***May be cause of seizures
***Cortical tuber count on MRI may predict severity of cerebral dysfunction (more than 7 in moderately to severely affected patients)
**Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (6-14%)
***Usually do not occur in young children and chance for growth decreases after age 20
***Can become large enough to block flow of fluid in ventricles causing nausea, vomiting, headaches, changes in appetite, behavior, and mood
***Brain imaging should be done every 1-3 years
**Seizures/epilepsy (60-90%)
***Can cause infantile spasm/hypsarrhtyhmia syndrome

[[File:Lydekker - Marbled Cat.JPG|250px|right]]
The '''marbled cat''' is the big cat that isn't big at all, only slightly larger than a domestic cat.  Scientists place it in the same closely related group as the lion, tiger and leopard, the ''Subfamily Pantherinae'', and even though it's much smaller than the clouded leopard it has the same long fangs and a very similar fur pattern.  Scientific examination of their blood (blood serum analysis) suggests that they are similar in form to the forest ancestors of the big cats some ten million years ago. However, they may have also decreased in size more recently due to competition with other big cats.

==Where do marbled cats live?==
[[File:Marbled Cat area.png|thumb|left|Places where marbled cats live are colored blue.]]
The marbled cat may be found in the forests of the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and some neighboring small islands.

==What do marbled cats look like?==
Marbled cats look similar to clouded leopards but they are smaller, have shorter faces more like a domestic cat, and have a fuzzier tail. Its beautiful, striking coat is pale brown, with irregular slightly darker brown blotches sharply outlined in dark brown or black. Its long cylindrical tail is full from rump to tip and carries its body pattern.

==What do marbled cats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Marbled cats spend a great deal of time in the trees and it is likely that they catch much of their prey there, hunting birds, squirrels, rodents, frogs and reptiles.  They have been seen hunting on the ground on the island of Borneo, and this may be a local habit.  Not much is known about their habits because they are rare in the wild and there are no specimens currently kept in zoos.

==Fun facts==
* Marbled cats make sounds similar to a domestic cat, but they purr rarely and their meow is somewhat like a twittering bird call.
* The longest a marbled cat lived in captivity was 12 years.

==Third Law of Thermodynamics==

The Third Law of Thermodynamics extends the definition of Entropy:

'''Entropy is zero only in a ''perfect crystal'' at absolute zero ( 0 kelvin [- 273.15 degree Celsius ]).'''

The Third Law of Thermodynamics can mathematically be expressed as 

lim ST→0 = 0 (1)

where 

S = entropy (J/K)

T = absolute temperature (K)

At a temperature of absolute zero there is no thermal energy or heat. At a temperature of zero Kelvin the atoms in a pure crystalline substance are aligned perfectly and do not move. There is no entropy of mixing since the substance is pure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tuberous Sclerosis'''

== What is Tuberous Sclerosis? ==
* Referred to both as tuberous sclerosis (TS) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The term TSC is used in scientific literature to distinguish tuberous sclerosis from Tourette's syndrome.
* Autosomal dominant disorder that causes benign tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs
* The disease affects some people severely, while others are so mildly affected that it often goes undiagnosed
* The clinical symptoms of TSC vary greatly and may often not appear until later in life
* Some people with TSC experience developmental delay, mental retardation and autism.
* Many people with TSC are living independent, healthy lives
* There are presently no cures and there is no way to predict how severely or mildly an individual may be affected by TSC
* There can be complications in some organs such as the kidneys and brain that can lead to severe difficulties and even death if left untreated.
* To reduce these dangers, people with TSC should be monitored throughout their life by their physician for potential complications.
* Most people with TSC will live an average life span.

== Who is affected? ==
* Prevalence of TSC is unknown, but its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 6,000 live births. This means approximately 50,000 individuals in the United States and more than 1 million worldwide have TSC
* It occurs in both sexes and in all races and ethnic groups
The tumors are not cancerous!
* The tumors resulting from tuberous sclerosis are benign, but may still cause problems.
* Tumors that grow in the brain can block the flow of cerebral spinal fluid in the spaces (ventricles) in the brain. This can lead to behavior changes, nausea, headaches or a number of other symptoms.
* In the heart, the tumors are usually at their largest at birth, and then decrease in size as the individual gets older. These heart tumors, called cardiac rhabdomyomas, can cause problems at birth if they are blocking the flow of blood or causing severe arrhythmia problems.
* The tumors in the eyes are not as common, but can present problems if they grow and block too much of the retina.
* The tumors in the kidney (renal angiomyolipoma) can become so large they eventually take over all of the normal kidney function. In the past, the patient was left until they developed kidney failure. Today, doctors are more aggressive and remove individual tumors before they get too large and compromise healthy kidney tissue. Very rarely (less than 2 percent of) individuals with TSC develop malignant (cancerous) kidney tumors.

== Inheritance and Recurrence Risks ==
* Approximately 33 percent, or one-third, of people with TSC inherit it from a parent who also has TSC
* A parent who is affected has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of having an affected child
* In the remaining 66 percent, or two-thirds of people with TSC, neither parent shows any symptoms or signs of TSC. It appears that one of the normal genes from either parent changes to the abnormal form, leading to a new (or sporadic) occurrence of TSC in the child
* Normally, these parents do not have another child with TSC because the mutation was sporadic, not inherited
* However, some families have more than one child with TS, even though neither parent showed symptoms or findings of TSC. This is due to germline mosaicism
* Germline mosaicism is relatively rare, and this explanation does not apply to most families with a sporadically affected child.
* However, due to germline mosaicism recurrence risk are quoted to be 1 to 3 percent
* There is no simple way to determine whether an unaffected parent of a child with TSC has germline mosaicism.

== Genes responsible ==
* Two genes have been identified that can cause tuberous sclerosis.
* Only one of the genes needs to be affected for tuberous sclerosis to be present.
* The TSC1 gene is located on chromosome 9 and is called the hamartin gene.
* The other gene, TSC2, is located on chromosome 16 and is called the tuberin gene.
* The functions of hamartin and tuberin are not fully understood.
* Hamartin and tuberin have been shown to form heterodimers, suggesting that these two proteins may act in concert to regulate cell proliferation
* Both the TSC1 and TSC2 genes are believed to suppress tumor growth in the body.
* When either of these genes is defective, tumors are not suppressed and tuberous sclerosis results.
* The genes also play a role in the early fetal development of the brain and skin.
* The genes (TSC1 and TSC2) are involved in approximately 70 percent of TSC diagnoses.
* It is still unclear where the mutation lies in the remaining 30 percent of people tested.

== Penetrance ==
* The penetrance of TSC, after careful, detailed evaluation of each person known to carry a TS mutation, is now thought to be 100%.
* Rare cases of seeming non-penetrance have been reported; however, molecular studies have resolved these cases, revealing two different sporadic TSC mutations in one family and the existence of germline mosaicism in others

== Variable expressivity ==
* The variability in expression exists because TSC is autosomal dominant at the level of the organism but recessive at the cellular level. (There is an element of chance involved)
* Both the TSC1 and TSC2 genes have properties consistent with tumor suppressor genes functioning according to Knudson's &quot;two hit&quot;
* The clinical variability occurs secondary to the random nature of the second &quot;hit&quot; in individuals carrying a germline mutation.

== Genotype-Phenotype Correlations ==
* The TSC1 and TSC2 phenotypes have been considered to be identical.
* The phenotype is different in cases of a contiguous gene syndrome involving large gene deletions and rearrangements of both the TSC2 gene and the PKD1 gene on 16p13
* One study found a greater risk of renal malignancy in patients with TSC2 and patients with TSC2 mutations have been found to have a higher frequency of mental
* Genotype and phenotype correlation studies provide statistical support of a milder phenotype in patients with a TSC1 mutation.
* A decreased proportion of individuals with TSC1 among sporadic cases of TSC has been reported. This might represent a true biologic phenomenon or decreased ascertainment of individuals with sporadic TSC1 because of a somewhat less severe phenotype.

== Diagnosis and testing ==
* The diagnosis of TSC is based on clinical findings (see clinical diagnosis in the category below)
* Molecular testing is presently available on a research basis only
* It is available on a clinical basis only to those families with a known TSC1 or TSC2 mutation identified through previous research studies.
* Development of clinically available DNA analyses of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes has been hampered by the large size of the two genes, the large number of disease-causing mutations, and the high rate of somatic mosaicism (10-25%)

== Prenatal Testing ==
* DNA-based diagnostic testing is possible for pregnancies at 50% risk in a family with a known TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation previously identified through a research study and confirmed in a clinical laboratory
* DNA extracted from cells obtained from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about 10-12 weeks' gestation* or amniocentesis at 16-19 weeks' gestation can be analyzed for the known familial disease-causing mutations.
* For other families, high-resolution ultrasound examination for tumors is available, but its sensitivity is unknown.
* The risk for TSC is 50% in a fetus without a known prior increased risk for TSC, in which cardiac lesions consistent with rhabdomyoma are identified on ultrasound examination. Mutation analysis is currently not clinically available to further evaluate a fetus with this prenatal finding.

== Clinical Diagnosis ==
* The diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were revised at the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus *Conference, July 1998
* Definite TSC: Either two major features or one major feature plus two minor features
* Probable TSC: One major feature plus one minor feature
* Possible TSC: Either one major feature or two or more minor features

== Major Features ==
* Facial angiofibromas or forehead plaque
* Non-traumatic ungual or periungual fibromas
* Hypomelanotic macules (three or more)
* Shagreen patch (connective tissue nevus)
* Multiple retinal nodular hamartomas
* Cortical tuber 1
* Subependymal nodule
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
* Cardiac rhabdomyoma, single or multiple
* Lymphangiomyomatosis 2
* Renal angiomyolipoma 2

== Minor Features ==
* Multiple randomly-distributed pits in dental enamel
* Hamartomatous rectal polyps
* Bone cysts
* Cerebral white matter radial migration lines 1
* Gingival fibromas
* Nonrenal hamartoma
* Retinal achromic patch
* &quot;Confetti&quot; skin lesions
* Multiple renal cysts
** When cerebral cortical dysplasia and cerebral white matter migration tracts occur together, they are counted as one rather than two features of TSC.
** When both lymphangiomyomatosis and renal angiomyolipomas are present, other features of tuberous sclerosis must be present before TSC is diagnosed.

== Clinical Manifestations ==
* We still cannot predict the severity of physical symptoms in a person with a new diagnosis of TSC.
* A person can have TSC and have very few or mild symptoms, while a family member with TSC can have more severe or extensive
 
== symptoms ==
* In most individuals, the disease affects only some of these organs.
* The severity of TSC can range from mild skin abnormalities to, in severe cases, mental retardation or renal failure.
* Many TSC manifestations also develop later in life.
* Most individuals who are mildly affected by TSC lead active and productive lives

== HEART INVOLVEMENT ==

=== Manifestations ===
* Echocardiogram can show rhabdomyomas, the most common primary cardiac tumor of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in infancy and childhood.
* The incidence of these tumors in TSC has been reported to vary from 47 percent to 67 percent.
* Childhood tumor regression is the rule. In other words, in most cases, cardiac tumors are their largest at birth and may shrink or disappear as the individuals grow older.
* A second peak in the incidence of these tumors may occur during puberty.
* If cardiac outflow obstruction does not occur at birth, the patient is unlikely to have health problems from these tumors later.
Treatment
* Cardiac rhabdomyomas are more likely to be the cause of heart failure in a newborn infant or young child than in an adult with TSC.
* Most rhabdomyomas of the heart are asymptomatic, but they should be treated by an experienced cardiologist if an arrhythmia or other cardiac problem is present.
* Cardiac arrhythmias infrequently have developed in children just after starting carbamazepine (Tegretol), used for the treatment of epilepsy. Reports have also shown a significant increase in the size of cardiac rhabdomyomas in infants with TSC with infantile spasms who are treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Therefore, echocardiograms and EKG baseline measurements should be obtained before initiating these treatments.

== BRAIN INVOLVEMENT ==
* CNS tumors lead to the most morbidity and mortality in TSC
* Brain and Neurologic Function: Several types of brain lesions are seen in individuals with TS; some people will have all the lesions, whereas others will have no brain involvement at all.
* Cortical tubers (from which TSC is named)
** Occur in 70% of patients
** thought of as a &quot;birth defect&quot; on the brain
** small areas in the cortex (the outer layer of the brain) that do not develop normally
** It is thought that the presence of cortical tubers, which disrupts the normal &quot;wiring&quot; of the brain, is what causes seizures in individuals with TSC.
* Subependymal nodules
** occur in 90% of patients
** develop near the walls of the cerebral ventricles (the cavities in the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid)
** Typically, these nodules accumulate calcium within the first few months or years of life.
** Because of this calcification, they can be easily detected with a computed tomography (CT) scan.
** The subependymal nodules are not directly responsible for neurological problems.
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs).
** occur in 6-15% of all patients
** Typically, SEGAs do not occur in very young children, and the chance for their growth decreases after age 20.
** If a giant cell astrocytoma grows large enough, it can block the flow of fluid inside the ventricles of the brain, can result in significant morbidity and mortality, the tumor will have to be removed and/or the ventricles shunted to relieve fluid buildup and pressure.
*** Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, and headaches as well as changes in appetite, behavior, and mood.
*** These symptoms may or may not signal growth of a tumor, but they do signify that there may be a problem and that the child should be seen by a physician.
Brain imaging should be done at the time of diagnosis to get a baseline image and then every 1 to 3 years afterwards. A brain scan can sometimes show growth of a tumor even before symptoms develop.

== EPILEPSY/SEIZURE DISORDERS ==
* Seizures occur in 60 percent to 90 percent of individuals diagnosed with TSC
* They are often the first symptom of TSC.
* Early in life, the seizures may consist only of brief head nodding or staring, or they may be more generalized, with spasms of the limbs and flexion and extension of the head and trunk.
* In older children and young adults, the seizures sometimes occur less often or cease.
* If seizures are suspected, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is usually conducted.
* Seizure control in a child with TSC is important.
* There appears to be a direct relationship among the age of the child at the onset of seizures; their frequency, duration, and severity; and the degree of mental handicap.
* Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), properly administered, may control the seizures completely, although in some people the seizures return or cannot be controlled.
* Some children with TSC have &quot;infantile spasms.&quot; During this type of seizure, the child brings his legs up to his chest in a repeated motion.
* Infantile spasms can sometimes be eliminated by the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone from the pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisone. This medication is not used for long periods of time because of adverse side effects.
* Valproic acid (Depakene) has also been used to treat infantile spasms.

== COGNITIVE, PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL INVOLVEMENT ==
* The behavior of a child with TS can often be the most difficult and trying problem for parents and family.
* Aggression, sudden rage, hyperactivity, attention deficit, acting out, obsessive-compulsive behavior, repetitive behaviors, staying in their &quot;own world,&quot; being nonverbal even at an age when most children are speaking, and other autistic behaviors have all occurred in children with TSC.
* At least 50% of patients have developmental delay or mental retardation
* Some children with TSC, usually those who have a mental disability, are also diagnosed with autism.
* There appears to be a connection between TSC and autism that is not understood, and active research is exploring this link
* Occasionally, individuals with TSC are also diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disease (manic depression), depression, or other psychiatric disorders.

=== Manifestations ===
* lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) - pulmonary cystic disease
** estimated to occur in 1-6% of cases
** primarily affects women between the ages of 20 and 40 years
* The first symptoms of lung involvement in an individual with TSC may be shortness of breath after mild exercise, spontaneous pneumothorax, or coughing.
* Progression to pulmonary failure may develop, but not usually until the third or fourth decade of life, if at all.
* Pulmonary involvement in TSC can be severe, and some individuals will require lung transplantation.

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up ===
* Recent studies have shown that many women with TSC have minor, asymptomatic lung involvement.
* The Consensus Conference Panel on Lung Involvement recommended that female patients should have a chest CT scan (not an x-ray) sometime before age 18 or at the time of diagnosis for women older than 18.
* A CT scan of the lung is superior to an X-ray because the early signs of lung involvement may easily be missed on an X-ray.
* If pulmonary involvement is noted, the individual should be monitored closely and should have repeated chest CT scans as needed.

=== Treatment ===
* Pulmonary involvement in TSC can be severe, even fatal.
* Recently, tamoxifen and progesterone have been used to treat pulmonary TSC with encouraging results.
* Any individual with TSC with lung involvement should see a pulmonologist who is knowledgeable about LAM.
* National Institutes of Health is also conducting clinical research of LAM
* Call the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance or the LAM Foundation for more information.

== KIDNEY INVOLVEMENT ==
* The second leading cause of early death (27.5%) in patients with TSC is renal disease
* In a recent study, an estimated 80% of children with TSC were found to have an identifiable renal lesion by the mean age of 10.5 years

=== Manifestations ===
* TSC can present itself as five different lesions in the kidneys:
** benign angiomyolipomas-(occurring in 70 percent to 80 percent of adults and older children with TSC)
*** Renal angiomyolipomas-made up of vascular tissue (angio), smooth muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma)
*** They are benign hamartomas.
*** These hamartomas are well circumscribed groups of cells that multiply excessively, growing as benign tumors that may or may not cause symptoms.
*** The prevalence of TSC-related renal angiomyolipomas increases with age, and in adults bilateral tumors or multiple tumors in one kidney are common.
*** Angiomyolipomas begin in childhood in many individuals with TSC, but they usually grow very slowly and may not be problematic until young adulthood.
*** Individuals with TSC should have their kidneys imaged at the time of diagnosis and then regularly throughout their lives.
*** Accurate noninvasive ultrasound, CT, or MRI diagnosis of these benign lesions is highly dependent on their fat content
*** It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a small or low-fat-content angiomyolipoma and a malignant tumor.
*** When tumors become larger than 4 cm, bleeding of the angiomyolipoma, the primary complication of this lesion, increases in frequency.
*** Pain may also become a significant problem with angiomyolipomas.
** Cysts (occurring in 20% of patients)
*** TSC renal cysts are commonly multiple and bilateral.
*** They are the second most frequently occurring kidney manifestation of TSC.
*** Single or multiple renal cysts occur less often in individuals with TSC than do angiomyolipomas, but they may appear earlier.
*** Some cysts may collapse and disappear.
*** One important research finding was the discovery of the TSC2 gene in close proximity to the gene for polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) on chromosome 16.
*** A small group of individuals with TS have a large segment of chromosome 16 deleted, which means that both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes are removed.
** malignant angiomyolipoma (&lt;1%)
*** Malignant angiomyolipomas should be removed as soon as possible after their detection.
** oncocytoma (benign adenomatous hamartoma) (&lt;1%)
*** Oncocytomas are benign tumors only occasionally seen in individuals with TSC.
** renal cell carcinoma (&lt;1%)
*** rarely seen in individuals with TSC, but when these tumors are present, they often are multi-centric and bilateral.
*** These tumors should also be removed as soon as possible after their detection to prevent metastasis.

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up ===
* Both renal angiomyolipomas and cysts are often asymptomatic and may not require treatment
* Both should be followed closely with imaging every 1 to 2 years because aggressive treatment can preserve kidney function with minimal trauma to the individual or the kidney.
* If the tumors are allowed to grow, they may lead to obstructive uropathy or displacement of much of the normal kidney tissue.
* There is also a significant risk of hemorrhage if the angiomyolipomas or cysts grow larger than 4 cm.
* Hematuria, back or abdominal pain, or internal hemorrhage may be the initial signs of kidney problems.
Treatment
* The renal lesions that appear in many individuals with TSC may remain stable and require no specific treatment.
* Renal tumors must sometimes be removed, however, if they grow rapidly, if there is an indication that they may be malignant (i.e., a solid tumor with little or no fat content), or to alleviate obstruction.
* With more frequent imaging of the kidneys and good clinical care, an individual with TSC should not have to lose an entire kidney or experience hemorrhaging from an angiomyolipoma.
* Early and aggressive treatment is much better for most individuals with TSC
* Unfortunately, some individuals with TSC who also have polycystic kidney disease will also have problems maintaining normal blood pressure levels.
* Their blood pressure usually can be controlled with medication early in the disease process; however, dialysis, and sometimes even renal transplantations, may eventually be necessary.
* Renal transplantation has been performed successfully in individuals with TSC; there does not appear to be a recurrence of angiomyolipomas in transplanted kidneys

== SKIN INVOLVEMENT ==
* The skin is affected in virtually 100% of patients.
* Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often see the disease manifested on the face, body and nails.
* In some cases, skin growths can become obtrusive but in most cases, the growths themselves are harmless.
* However manifestations such as facial angiofibromas can have a social impact and treatments are available.

=== Manifestations ===
* hypomelanotic macule
** (87-100% of patients)
** patches of skin lighter than the surrounding skin (can be any size or shape or may be the classic &quot;ash-leaf&quot; shape)
* shagreen patch-(20-80%)a patch of skin that is tough and dimpled like an orange peel
* periungual or subungual fibromas-(17-87%) fibrous growths that appear around the fingernails and toenails
* facial angiofibromas-(47-90%)
** cause the most disfigurement
** benign tumors of the face
** may not be present at birth; do not usually appear until between the ages of 3 and 5 at the earliest
* Fibrous plaquessometimes appear on the forehead of individuals with TSC. There may also be fibrous, hairless scalp plaques surrounded by thin, white tufts of hair.
* Occasionally an individual with TSC coincidentally will have café au lait spots (areas of skin darker than the surrounding skin, but lighter and usually larger than a mole)
** these skin lesions are not diagnostic of TSC.
** A child with three or more or an adult with five or more café au lait spots may be diagnosed with neurofibromatosis

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up treatment ===
* At the initial testing, the physician uses a Wood's lamp (an ultraviolet light) to better visualize the hypomelanotic macules-white patches on the skin that often are difficult to see, especially on infants and people with very pale skin.
* The entire body should be examined.
* The skin should be carefully examined for the other skin manifestations of TSC as well.

== EYE INVOLVEMENT ==

=== Manifestations ===
* The appearance of retinal lesions varies from the classic mulberry lesions adjacent to the optic disk to the more common
plaque-like hamartoma.
* Retinal hamartomas
** occasionally noted in individuals without other manifestations of TS and in individuals with other disorders.
** although they are suggestive of TSC, single lesions are not diagnostic of TSC.
** The frequency of retinal hamartomas in individuals with TSC has varied in reports from almost negligible to 87 percent of individuals (a difference probably reflecting the technique used and the expertise of the examiner)
* Although less common than the retinal hamartoma, a defect in the pigment of the iris has also been observed in some individuals with TSC.
* In addition, white depigmented patches, reminiscent of the hypopigmented macules on the skin, have also been observed on the retina of some individuals with TSC.

=== Diagnostic testing and follow-up ===
* Retinal lesions may be difficult to identify without pupillary dilation and indirect ophthalmoscopy, particularly difficult to examine in uncooperative children.
* Most retinal hamartomas remain dormant, although occasionally individuals with TSC have visual impairment resulting from a large hamartoma in the macular region.
* Instances of visual loss following retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, or hamartoma enlargement are rare.

=== Treatment ===
* For the most part, treatment of the retinal lesions and repeated ophthalmologic examinations are unnecessary.
* Normal eye care should be maintained.

== OTHER ORGAN INVOLVEMENT ==
* Cysts and tumors similar to those observed in the kidney sometimes appear in the liver, lung, pancreas, and other organs. These lesions are not usually seen until later in life and are rarely symptomatic.
* Bone cysts can also develop but usually do not cause problems until later in life.
* In addition, pits have been noted in both baby and adult teeth in over 90 percent of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but their significance is not known.
* Rectal polyps have also been reported but do not appear to cause problems.

=== Initial Evaluation ===
* It is recommended that individuals suspected of having TSC have the following initial evaluation to establish the diagnosis and to identify potential complications for timely treatment. The evaluation and management plan described below was developed by the Clinical Issues Panel, Panel 1, at the Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Conference in July, 1998
* Medical history, especially for features of TSC
* Family history, especially for features of TSC
* Physical examination with use of a Woods lamp (ultraviolet light) in a darkened room and special attention to dermatologic findings
* Cranial CT/MRI
* Renal ultrasonography
* Ophthalmologic examination
* Electrocardiography and echocardiography, if cardiac symptoms indicate
* Electroencephalography, if seizures are present
* Neurodevelopmental and behavioral evaluation
* Chest CT for adult females

|+Surveillance Screening in TSC
* At the time of diagnosis, many medical tests are performed. Patients
and parents should also be aware of routine testing that needs to be
performed. Patients are advised to share this diagram with their
physicians.

== Differential Diagnosis ==
* Many of the features of TSC are nonspecific and can be seen as isolated findings or as a feature of another disease.
* Depigmented patches have been reported to occur in up to 8 per 1000 newborns and in most cases have no medical significance.
* Other diseases that have hypopigmented macules as part of the phenotype include
** Vitiligo
** nevus depigmentus
** nevus anemicus
** piebaldism
** Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome
* acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, or multiple trichoepithelioma can be mistaken for angiofibromas
* shagreen patchrd are rare but can be seen in families or sporadically
* Ungual fibromas can result from trauma but generally these are single lesions and their presence can be explained
* Renal cysts are seen in 1-2% of population, but not usually in people under 30 years of age
* Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are rare tumors sometimes observed in individuals with no other medical problems. They show loss of heterozygosity TSC2.
* 50 % of Infants with cardiac rhabdomyomas are affected with TSC and the others are an isolated finding

== Psychosocial Issues ==
* Denial is a common reaction when a parent first learns of the diagnosis
* They may feel overwhelmed, sad, fearful, angry, guilty
* A survey of families associated with a TS support group in North Carolina
o Most parents reported that their concerns were initially ignored
o It took a median of 3 physicians before a diagnosis established in children with infantile spasms
o Infantile seizures were not diagnosed correctly in 40% of the TS patients
* The disfigurement caused by the tumors can lead to social isolation and self-esteem issues
* Stress and anxiety may persist due to health concerns

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Turner Syndrome'''

(Ullrich-Turner syndrome or Bonnevie-Ullrich-Turner syndome)

==Incidence==
*1/2,500 - 1/5,000 liveborn females based on screening newborn pop.
*perhaps 1% -2% all conceptions (occurs more often in preg. losses)
*95-99% miscarried most in 1st trimester
*usually sporadic not associated with AMA
*recurrence risk not increased for subsequent pregnancies

==Prognosis==
*Prematurity more common in preg. with Turner
*mean birth weight in full term between 25-50 %ile
*mean length in 5%ile of normal female
*by 18 mths most growing at or below 3%ile height
*Most consider standard of care to treat with growth hormone (although not deficient) differences in height appear to be a few centimeters (some studies not confirm this)
*most adults adjust to petite stature
*Feeding problems common including freq. spitting, vomiting and difficulty sucking and latching on also can have gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive
*Obesity can be problem in later childhood and adult (excess calorie intake decrease expenditure -- short girls less likely to physical activity not intrinsic metabolic abnormality

==Treatment/screening==
*encourage physical activity
*educate about nutrition
*hormone replacement (family informed decision appears safe, but not much long-term data) begin at age 4
*treat age appropriately not according to height
*annual echo recommended
*begin at years thyroid function screening every other year and yearly in adults
*periodic urinalysis for glucose
*ovarian hormone therapy initiated at about 14 years
*eye exam in infancy and refer at any time if concerns

==Life expectancy==
*one population 156 with Turner's found 5 fold increase (15 deaths) in death rate over expected and 3 fold when congenital heart disease excluded
*series of 500 liveborn patients, 25 died 10 due to complications of CHD.
*Among 215 adults 5 cardiac, 2 accident, 1 malignant hyperthermia, 1 AML, 1 acute febrile syndrome, 3 old age

==Physical Features==
*short stature
*high arched palate
*prominent ears
*webbing of neck
*low posterior hairline:trident configuration
*increased carrying angle of arm
*puffy hands and feet (lymphedema) may take months to several years to go away
*hypoplastic nail beds
*multiple pigmented nevi

==Possible Health Concerns==
*frank gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive also noted
*ear infections and sensorineural hearing loss is seen
*structural renal malformations found in ~40%: horseshoe kidney, duplication of ureters
*minority can have recurrent UTI and hydronephrosis
*cardiac anomalies: estimated 17-45% coarctation of aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, hypoplastic left heart, VSD (risk of aortic dissection may be increased)
*hypertension and mitral valve prolapse
*streak gonads w/ absent oocytes, normal uterus but may be small
*90% require estrogen to initiate puberty and est. progest. to maintain menses
*lack pubertal development and no onset of menses (97%)
*infertility 99%
*frequent dislocation of patella and knee pain common
*Increased incidence of autoimmiune disorders
*hypothyroidism common 15-30% of adults

==Development and Behavior==
*Usually have ave IQ within normal range shifted to left 10-12 points, compared to sibs
*~10% have significant delays need special education and may need ongoing assistance in adult life with job or living
*discrepancy between verbal and performance IQ (verbal usually normal performance 10-12 points lower)
*visual spatial weaknesses: copy designs, memory visual patterns, left-right directions, math
*some studies show increased anxiety in younger girls, social withdrawal and depression in older girls
*Some girls may have hyperactivity, immature behavior, difficulty focussing
*later to date, leave home, and marry than age-matched cohorts
*surveys show: most well educated, most function in employment BUT problems with methodology

==Reproductive options==
*IVF with donor oocytes (has been successful) expensive not always covered by insurance &gt; 230 pregnancies in 93 women (1995) risk of SA (if fertile higher risk of trisomy 21)
*adoption

==Possible psychosocial concerns==
*difficulty having a child with multiple medical problems
*balancing the care of two children can be difficult anyway without added concerns
*disappointment at prospect of child not being able to have biological children

'''Serves &gt; 1'''

== Ingredients ==
* 1 large, ripe tomato
* 1 large, or 2 small culinary mushrooms
* 1 sliced onion slab, or coin, approx 1/4th inch (0.5cm) thick.
* 4 fresh basil leaves, or 2 tsp dried basil
* 2 Tbls fresh parsley, or 2 tsp dried parsley flakes
* 1 tsp dill weed
* 2 dashes black pepper
* 1 dash of garlic powder
* 1 dash salt
* 5 drops cooking oil

== Procedure ==
# On the head of a fresh tomato, cut two concentric rings, one near the stem, the other near the slope of the tomato's shoulder. 
# Remove this ring to expose the juicy seed compartments. 
# Slice the mushrooms into small, flat slabs, and cut the onion coin in quarters, like a pie or quiche. Separate the layers.
# In the open ring sprinkle the dried spices. 
# Force the mushrooms and small arcs of onion through the spices and into the seed compartments, pushing the basil/dill/parsley/etc in with them. Stuff in as many as possible without forcing out tomato pulp. If using fresh basil leaves, fold them over the slices of mushrooms and push them in together.
# Drizzle five or so drops of cooking oil in a spot on a baking sheet or small roasting flat. Rub in a small circle with a diameter equal to the foot, or butt of the tomato. 
# Place the tomato on the oil and the pan into an oven preheated to 350° (180c). 
# Roast for 15 to 20 minutes.

'''Note:''' the onion slice will produce enough pieces for at least four stuffed tomatoes. If making several, one should be all you need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The influence of The Assent is not limited to personal values and rituals, but in public as well. Some law makers call the influence of The Assent in public policy as &quot;Islamic law&quot;, some just call it &quot;law&quot;. Even when it is called Islamic Law, the exact legislation may differ from country to country. In Malaysia, it is even different from state to state.

Such difference is expected, since each country or state has different goals and different history. Koran only regulates upper and lower Theoretical Legal Limits as mentioned in [[s:Quran/4#11-14 | Koran 4:13-14]]. This allows every nation to pick any point or range within The Theoretical Legal Limits to be their legislation. As an example of lowering the maximum limit, Brunei Darussalam abolished the death penalty [http://web.archive.org/web/20060210235322/http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/brn-summary-eng]. Another, the Queen of Jordan does not cover her hair. Its neighbor, Saudi Arabia has raised the minimum limit, so it is a crime not cover a female hair. So, please maintain that this chapter will only cover the theoretical legal limits and not the various actual local legislation of the same law.

Koranic concept of public policy is mentioned in [[s:Quran/3#102-109 | Koran 3:104]]. In this book, the policy of acceptable and unacceptable is called legislation. In [[s:Quran/42#30-43 | Koran 42:38]], mutual consultation is the best way to decide the legislation and leadership between people but without violating the Koranic Legal Limits. Therefore the Koranic concept of consultation is somehow comparable to the concept of Democracy. At the same time, Koranic concept of Legal Limits is somehow comparable to the concept of Human Rights. These legal limits are designed to guarantee not only freedom but also fairness (justice).

Scholars differs on the role of Islam in the public policy. Scholars like Ayman Dhawahiri in Afghanistan/Pakistan does not accept any other source of law outside Koran and Hadith. Scholars like Muhammad Shahrour from Syria takes Koran as Legal Limits and Hadith as example, while allowing their implementation as wide as allowed by the Legal Limits imposed by God. Scholars like Yusuf Qaradhawi in Qatar, also the head of the European Council for Fatwa and Research, takes the middle road. However, they all are agreed on the importance of The Assenter's charter and The Believer's charter in the private life.

=== Civil Law Limits ===
NOTE: 
# Bible are referred for comparison only.
# These are limits. The actual law may differs significantly but does not violates the limits, for example actual dress-code law may be much more restricted than God's limits.
# Some of these limits are restricted only to a specialized group. But legislation can be made to extend it, for example limits only for prophets wives can be extended to all believing women, or even to all women.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Turner Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and acknowledge prior contact
*Forewarning to provide an opportunity for cognitive and emotional preparation
**When we met two weeks ago, Dr. Doktour ordered a chromosome test to see if you had any missing or extra genetic material that might explain why you have a shorter stature and why you haven't started menstruating.
*Acknowledge previous visit- discussion of Turner syndrome
**As we discussed last time, individuals with Turner syndrome only have one X-chromosome instead of the expected two copies (show visual aid to reinforce).
**Women that have Turner syndrome are unable to reproduce because ovulation does not occur.
*Acknowledge her pain
**I know that you and your fiancé were really looking forward to having children, I'm so sorry it turned out this way.

-An edit from someone with experience receiving this diagnosis: A very helpful thing to say instead in that moment is something along the lines of, &quot;If you want to be a mother, you will be.&quot;

==Discuss agenda==
(Assess understanding throughout discussion)
*There are many areas that we can discuss today. We can talk about as much or as little about Turner syndrome as you would like.
*Areas we can discuss today
**How this happened, what the diagnosis means for you, reproductive options.
*What would you like to talk about?
**How did this happen?
***Genes and chromosomes- less specific if needed
***Some of your genetic material is missing- you only have one X-chromosome instead of the expected two copies.
***The X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes and two copies are required for sexual development in a female to occur as expected.
***Reinforce (considering family hx. of short stature and &quot;late bloomers&quot;) that Turner syndrome does not run in families

==What this diagnosis means for you and your health==
*Mild physical differences: short neck, low hairline, broad chest, small fingernails, and often have many moles.
**Women with Turner syndrome do not look very different from women that do not have Turner syndrome. In most cases, you and I would not be able to tell the difference-usually only someone that is trained to look for these differences would be able to do so.
*Medical complications:
**Endocrine:
***Ovaries do not develop properly therefore the hormones produced by the ovary, estrogen and progesterone, are not produced.
***These hormones are required for:
****Development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics
****Preparation of the uterus for pregnancy
****Development of the mammary gland
*****Hormone replacement regimen- to promote 2ndary sexual characteristics and to initiate menses.
***Hypothyroidism (insufficient thyroid secretion of T3 and T4) is common in Turner syndrome
**Renal anomalies-
***Sometimes the kidneys fuse together or there is a duplication of the ureters (this just means that you are at a higher risk of UTI's)
***Order renal ultrasound
**Cardiac anomalies-
***Coarctation of the aorta, VSD, bicuspid aortic valve
***Some are born with heart defects- (about 15-20%)
***Risk for other complications (aortic aneurysm) in those that have coarctation or bicuspid aortic valve.
***Hypertension is also commonly seen in individuals with Turner syndrome.
****Risk increases with age and obesity
****Will need routine blood pressure checks
***We will need to order an echocardiogram (type of ultrasound that we can use to visualize all of the internal parts of the heart)
**Hearing
***Increased frequency of chronic ear infections (80%)
***Some hearing loss may be due to chronic infections
**Ophthalmologic:
***Ocular problems are present in ½ of girls
****Strabismus
****Ptosis
****Hyperopia (far-sightedness)
****Myopia (near-sightedness)
****Cataracts
****Nystagmus
***Musculoskeletal:
***Short stature (100%)
***Cubitis valgus (increased carrying angle at the elbow)
**Lymphadema-
***Puffiness in utero is a major feature of Turner syndrome
*TAKE HOME MESSAGE: we will want to schedule some tests for you:
**Echocardiogram
**Renal ultrasound (also evaluate ovaries and uterus)
**Routine blood pressure checks- monitor hypertension
**See an endocrinologist for hormone replacement
**Screen for thyroid function annually
***Family planning options:
****(Spontaneous pregnancies have occurred in mosaics-some cells have both X's and some only have one X)- don't discuss unless client wishes to do so.
****Artificial reproductive therapy (ART)- although ovulation does not occur, the uterus is usually structurally normal, which means that women with Turner's syndrome are capable of carrying a child.
****In-vitro fertilization: donor egg + fiancé's sperm, create embryo in the laboratory and then implant the embryo into your uterus.
*****Expensive though
*****Treat with hormones, estradiol and progesterone early in pregnancy until sufficient placental production of hormones
****Adoption
*****Can provide information on centers in the area, if you decide this is an option for you.
***Life Expectancy:
****Studies have shown that individuals with Turner syndrome have a normal life expectancy if no heart or renal defects are present.

==Psychosocial Counseling/ Questions==
*How are you feeling right now?
*What questions do you have?
*Am I making sense to you?
*Tell me what you are feeling right now…..
*Normalize…it is very normal to feel this way
*Acknowledge the patient's reaction to the news
**This must be very overwhelming for you
**I can see that this is very hard for you….I'm sorry for your pain
*How have you handled difficult situations in the past?
*Do you have family/friends in the area?
*Provide hope…discuss family planning options….no decreased lifespan…a lot of the medical problems associated with TS, we know that you do not have.

==Planning and following through==
*I'm going to call you tomorrow afternoon, is that ok?
*I have scheduled an appointment to meet next week. Will your fiancé be back in town?
*I will schedule appointments for you to have testing done and will notify you with those dates.
**These are not urgent tests that have to be done tomorrow. You have lived 27 years with Turner syndrome. Nothing has changed, except that now you know why you have short stature and haven't begun menstruating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''VATER Association'''

==What is VATER Association?==
*VATER association is an acronym for a sporadic constellation of findings that occur together more often than by chance alone.
*The major anomalies associated with this constellation are: Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, and Renal/Radial defects.
*The term VACTERL association is sometimes used in place of VATER because two additional features (cardiac and limb/radial) are more specifically identified in the acronym.

==Diagnosis==
*The VATER/VACTERL association represents a core group of 7 anomalies (see above), but very few patients have all 7 features.
*The average number of features per patient is 3 to 4, but no minimum criteria have been agreed on regarding which of these features or what combination of these constitutes a secure diagnosis.
*Some propose that at least 1 anomaly in each of the 3 geographic regions of involvement (limb, thorax, and pelvis/lower abdomen) should constitute a &quot;secure&quot; diagnosis.
*Thus, qualification as &quot;probable&quot; VATER/VACTERL association requires at least 2 anomalies in each of 2 geographic areas to qualify.
*VATER/VACERL represents a classic example of a &quot;diagnosis of exclusion.&quot; There is no facial gestalt to aid pattern recognition, and its core features are commonly found in other situations and syndromes.
*Thus, clinicians need to exclude all other similar clinical entities, to have obtained a normal chromosome analysis, and to exclude teratogenic exposure during early gestation.

==Prognosis==
*The long-term prognosis for children with the VATER/VACTERL association is variable.
*Each surgical anomaly seems, prognostically, independent of the other.
*If each surgical defect can be satisfactorily repaired and/or medically treated, the prognosis is excellent. If some defects cannot be totally repaired or persist with sequelae, then the prognosis is the sum total of the residual problems.
*There is generally a good prognosis for intelligence.

==Features of VATER Association==
*Other anomalies and abnormalities that occur in the VATER/VACTERL association are:
o Single umbilical artery
o Cleft lip
o Polydactyly (preaxial)
o Small intestinal atresia
o Auricular aberrations
o Genital/urogenital defects
*Rare instances of caudal regression and lower extremity defects have also been reported.
*Intrauterine growth retardation of unexplained etiology is occasionally present.
*The differential diagnosis list when considering the VATER/VACTERL association is long because so many anomalies can be found as components of other syndromes.
*Congenital heart failure, renal dysfunction, or gastrointestinal disorder can cause poor growth; therefore adequacy of caloric intake should be assessed. Gastrostomy tube feedings may be necessary.
*Early psychomotor delay, and behavioral problems can occur.
*Poor body image may be noted especially in children with limb deficiencies, short statures, complicated anal atresia with persistent intestinal problems, or external genital abnormalities.
*Vertebral anomalies are generally not extensive and most often occur in upper to mid thoracic and lumbar regions, with sacral and lower cervical defects being less common. Hemivertebrae are most common, but dyssegmented and fused vertebral bodies can also be found.
*Limb anomalies are restricted to the upper limbs and are usually preaxial, involving underdevelopment or agenesis of the thumbs and radial bones. These defects are usually bilateral but often asymmetric in degree.
*50-60% of patients with VATER/VACTERL association have either tracheoesophageal fistula or esophageal atresia. The majority of children with these abnormalities survive if their other associated anomalies are amenable to therapy.
*Approximately 37% of patients with tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia have cardiac defects.
*Anal atresia (imperforate anus) requires immediate attention. The presence of anal atresia is associated with an increased incidence of external anomalies of the genitalia, internal anomalies of the urinary and reproductive tracts, and vertebral defects of the lumber and sacral spine.

==Management==
*VATER/VACTERL association is very complex from the clinical management standpoint because all 7 of its core features may necessitate surgical intervention.
*There are potentially an impressive number of specialists that could be required for any one child including a geneticist, orthopedist, urologist, cardiac surgeon, nephrologist, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, and more.
*The need for long-term follow-up by most of the specialists is labor intensive for the child and family.
*Physical therapy and infant stimulation are important because of the frequent and prolonged hospitalizations.

==Prevalence and Inheritance==
*VATER association is a relatively common, nonrandom multiple-malformation condition.
*The incidence is reported to be 1.6 in 10,000 (Cassidy).
*No consistent or recurring etiology has been established for the VATER/VACTERL association. It has been more frequently reported in the offspring of diabetic mothers.
*Most cases occur as sporadic events with low recurrence risk.
*It is generally felt to be a heterogeneous disorder with the various yet-to-be established etiologies working through a common embryological pathway.

==Recurrence Risks==
*The pattern of malformation has generally been a sporadic occurrence; thus, there is probably a low recurrence risk (&lt;1%).

==Definitions==
*Esophageal atresia: congenital failure of the esophagus to develop
*Anal atresia: imperforate anus, anus without an opening
*Tracheoesophageal fistula: congenital defect linking the trachea and the esophagus, resulting from failure of the lungs to separate from the GI tract during development. Surgery is needed to prevent recurring episodes of aspiration pneumonia in the newborn.
*Hypospadias: abnormal congenital opening of the male urethra upon the undersurface of the penis.
*Anoplasty: reconstructive surgery of the anus
*Colostomy: opening of a portion of the colon through the abdominal wall to its skin surface.
*Nissen fundoplication: surgical correction of esophageal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux, by wrapping the gastric cardia with adjacent portions of the gastric fundus. The procedure re-establishes the gastroesophageal angle and prevents intrathoracic displacement of the stomach.

==Introduction==
*Who referred you here today?
*What specific questions would you like to have answered today?
*What information have you already been given?

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is VCF?==
*VCF is an alternate name used in past literature for the condition currently referred to as 22q11 Deletion Syndrome.
*A highly variable syndrome of associated anomalies including congenital heart disease, dysmorphic features, palate anomalies, and some degree of learning disabilities or mental retardation
*Children with VCF often have feeding problems and speech problems

==Etiology and Natural History==
*VCF occurs in about 1/4000 live births
*About 90% of people with VCF have a deletion at 22q11.2
*Most cases are a result of a new mutation
*In 10-20% of cases one parent also has a deletion and VCF phenotype

==Recurrence Risk==
*Children of those with VCF have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion
*Parents of a child with a new mutation have a very low risk of having another child with the mutation

==Clinical Features==
*Heart Defects
**Congenital heart disease occurs in about 74% of patients
**These defects are generally conotruncal defects
*Tetrology of Fallot - 22%
*Interrupted Aortic Arch - 15%
*Ventral Septal Defect - 13%
*Truncus Arteriosus - 7%
*Other Defect - 17%
*Palate
**Palatal Defects occur in 69% of patients
**Velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) is the most common defect (27%)
*Disorder of the velopharyngeal valve which is required for normal speech
*Can lead to hypernasal speech, nasal air emission, or other speech problems
**Submucosal and overt cleft palate are also common
*Feeding
**30% of patients have feeding problems
**nasal regurgitation is the most common problem
**many feeding problems are a result of the palate defects
*Thymus
**Many patients (specifically those with diGeorge sequence have a dysplastic or absent thymus)
**This results in a decrease in T-cells leading to decreased immune response
**Absent thymus can also cause hypocalcaemia which may lead to seizures
*Dysmorphology
**A variety of dysmorphic features are associated with VCF
*Microcephaly
*Narrow palpebral fissures
*Wide nasal root
*Bulbous nasal tip
*Thin upper lip
*Micrognathia
*Short stature
*Eye and ear abnormalities
*Neurological Defects
**Most patients have some degree of learning disabilities or mental retardation
**Intelligence generally in low normal range
**Often have language difficulties
*Specifically with reading comprehension and expressive language
*Other associations
**Kidneys: may be polycystic or dysplastic
**Growth: may be smaller in some cases due to lack of growth hormone
**Rheumatoid Arthritis: more frequent than general population

==Molecular Testing==
*Chromosomal region is called DGCR
*FISH analysis can be used to identify a deletion on chromosome 22
*Chromosome analysis should be run at the same time in order to locate the occasional disruption caused by a translocation of part of 22

==Management==
*Monitor heart function
**Repair defects if necessary
*Evaluate palate
**Intervention for feeding problems
**Repair of palate if necessary
*Monitor blood calcium levels
*Renal ultrasound to check kidneys
*Monitor lymphocytes
**Prevent use of live virus vaccines in patients with reduced immune response
*Provide speech therapy early in development
*Provide early intervention for school

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Concern over what problems to anticipate with VCF
*Parents may feel guilt or anger over diagnosis
*Confusion if mutation not found
*Self-esteem issues for children with VCF due to learning disabilities
*Social stigma due to speech difficulties

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Velopharyngeal Inadequacy (VPI)'''

==Contracting==
*What have you been told about VPI?
*What concerns would you like to address today?
*Discuss the agenda for the appointment
**Dr. Doktour - geneticist
**Dr. Doktour2 - ENT
**Dr. Doktour3 - speech pathologist

==Intake and family history==
*Important because we need to determine if VPI is isolated or is part of a genetic syndrome
**To ensure best medical treatment of any possible effects of a genetic condition
**To determine inheritance pattern and recurrence risks
*Ask about exposures/medications/illnesses during pregnancy
*Elicit medical history
*Ask about family history of clefts, birth defects, heart problems, learning problems, early deaths, miscarriages

==Genetic etiology and natural history==
*Caused by inadequacy of velopharyngeal valve to close during speech
**The velum (soft part of palate in back of mouth) separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity
**Normally the valve is open to allow air to flow, but it should close during speech
**Muscles in pharynx (throat) also contract to move its walls inward
**VPI occurs if velum is not long enough to cover the hole, the pharynx is too wide, or the muscles in the velum or pharynx are not strong enough to close
*Terminology
**Velopharyngeal Inadequacy - general term for velopharyngeal dysfunction
**Velopharyngeal Insufficiency - anatomical or structural defect that prevents adequate velopharygeal closure
**Velopharyngeal Incompetence - neuromotor or physiological disorder resulting in poor movement of structures
**Velopharyngeal mislearning - inadequate closure secondary to faulty learning of appropriate articulation patterns
*Occurs often in individuals with history of cleft palate or with a submucous cleft
*May be associated with genetic syndrome or underlying congenital anomaly
**Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF)
***About 20% of individuals with VPI are diagnosed with VCF in this clinic
***Highly variable condition:
****Conotruncal heart defects (50%)
****Tortuosity and medial displacement of carotidarteries
****Characteristic facies:
*****Microcephaly
*****Narrow palpebral fissures
*****Wide nasal root
*****Bulbous nasal tip
*****Vertical maxillary excess
*****Thin upper lip
*****Long face
*****Micrognathia
*****Minor auricular anomalies
****Short stature (below 10th percentile)
****Kidney or urinary tract anomalies
****DiGeorge sequence
****Hypotonia
****Learning problems or mental retardation
****Behavioral problems
***FISH studies find deletion of 22q11 for 90% of patients
**Stickler syndrome
***Most common cause of cleft palate
***Autosomal dominant with various expressivity
****Classical presentation
*****Pierre Robin sequence
*****Early onset osteoarthiritis
*****Severe myopia and retinal detachments
****Sensorineural and conductive hearing loss
****Characteristic facies
*****Micrognathia in infancy
*****Flat facial profile
*****Epicanthal folds
*****Midface hypoplasia
*****Flat nasal bridge
****Development usually normal
***Diagnosis usually made clinically because genetically heterogeneous
*May be due to teratogenic exposure during pregnancy
***Critical period for palatal development from weeks 8-11
***Includes viruses, drugs, infections, and radiation

==Clinical features==
*Hypernasality
*Nasal air emission
*Weak or omitted consonants
*Short utterance length
*Altered rate and speech segment durations
*Compensatory and obligatory articulation productions
**Nasalization of oral consonants
**Glottal stop
**Nasal sniff
**Breathiness

==Assessment==
*Done by multidisciplinary team
*Perceptual speech assessment
**Listen to speech and observe facial movements during articulation
**Detect abnormal air flow through nose
***Nasometry
***Airflow measures
*Endoscopy
**Allows visualization of valving mechanism during speech
**Pass flexible tube through nasal passages
*Multiview videofluoroscopy
**For children too young for endoscopy
**May require barium for contrast

==Management==
*Nonsurgical
**Mild VPI cases
**Speech therapy to improve articulation and strengthen closure patterns
**Prosthetic devices
***For patients who cannot undergo surgery or are not helped by repeated surgeries
***Obturator (dental prosthesis) that extendsinto velopharyngeal space and closes valve when pharyngeal walls move inward
***Palatal lift lifts soft palate into position so that velum is close to pharyngeal walls if palatal motion is not sufficient
*Surgical
**Recommended when possible
**Usually performed around 4-5 years old
**To prevent abnormal leakage of air through faulty valve
**Pharyngeal flap
***Create flap of mucous membrane and muscle from back of throat to soft palate
***Small openings remain on either side to allow air to move through nose
***Must be careful of abnormally placed carotid arteries in kids with VCF
*Sphincter pharyngoplasty
***Repositioning muscles that run vertical from soft plate to sides of pharynx
***Not as common
**Children require close monitoring after surgery
***Healing takes about 1 year
***Still may require speech therapy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Feelings about the diagnosis (anxiety, fear, guilt, depression, relief)
*Support - family, friends
*Disruption of school, family life for management

      <text xml:space="preserve">Framing walls begins with cutting the top and bottom [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_plate plates] to the desired lengths.  If the wall is to be sheathed, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_plate plates] should be cut on 16&quot; intervals, for example, the total length of the wall will be 26', the first plates should be cut at 16' and then the second set at 10', attached together at the ends. This ensures that once the stud spacing is laid out for the wall (every 16&quot; on center in our example) a stud will land on the joint in our plates therefore supporting the joint. Having the plates together on edge and ensuring they are flush at one end, we hook our tape measure on to that end of our 16' set of plates and begin placing a mark every 16&quot;.  This mark represents the center of our studs when we secure them.

Secure the studs to the one plate (perpendicularly) and then secure the other plate to the other end of the studs.  A second top plate is often required.  This second top plate will strengthen the joint in our original top plate and aid in securing our wall to other walls by overlapping as well as ensuring a proper load distribution from the trusses or joists above them to the studs of the wall being framed.

If sheathing or diagonally bracing the wall prior to raising, you must &quot;square&quot; the wall first.  Secure the bottom of the wall(permanently or temporarily). Given that the length of the wall is the same at the top and bottom, and that the height is the same at both ends, a diagonal measurement is taken from one corner to the other, switch corners, shift the top of the wall side to side until both corner to corner measurements are equal. Secure top of wall temporarily to keep it square.

Begin sheathing from the same end you started laying out your studs so that the sheets break on the studs, or if the wall does not require sheathing, brace diagonally. Unsecure top of wall and raise wall until vertical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vitamin C Deficiency'''

(Ascorbic Acid Deficiency, Scurvy)

==General Information==
*Vitamin C is reducing agent that is easily oxidized or destroyed by heat
*Deficiency can cause defects in collagen formation
*Adrenal glands and lenses have high concentrations of Vitamin C

==Etiology==
*Infants born with adequate stores of Vitamin C if mother's intake was good
**Breast milk also provides adequate source of Vitamin C
**Infants not breastfeeding or whose mothers are deficient require supplements
*Majority of cases occur from 6-12 months
*Febrile illnesses increase need for Vitamin C
**Particularly infectious or diarrheal diseases
**Iron deficiency, cold exposure, protein depletion, and smoking also increase need for intake of Vitamin C

==Pathology==
*Collagen formed during deficiency is low in hydroxyproline
**Leads to hemorrhage, defective tooth dentin, and loosening of teeth
**Endochondral bone formation ceases
**Bones may become brittle and fracture easily
*Periosteum becomes loosened and hemorrhages in femur and tibia common
*Degeneration in skeletal muscles, cardiac hypertrophy, bone marrow depression, adrenal atrophy if severe.

==Clinical Manifestations==
*Begins with irritability, tachypnea, digestive disturbances, and loss of appetite
*General tenderness, especially in legs
**Pain causes pseudoparalysis with legs in &quot;frog position&quot;
**Swelling and hemorrhage along legs
*Face appears apprehensive, gums swollen
*Depression of sternum
*Petechiae in skin or mucous membranes
*Hematuria, melena, orbital, or subdural hemorrhages
*Anemia due to inability to utilize iron or impairment in folic acid metabolism
*Swollen joints

==Roentgenographic Manifestations==
*Usually basis of diagnosis of Vitamin C deficiency
*Changes in long bones especially at knee
**Begin as simple atrophy
**Zone of well calcified cartilage appears as thick, irregular white line around bone
**Difficult to diagnose at this stage
*Subperiosteal hemorrhages at ends of bone may become more intense as deficiency becomes more severe

==Diagnosis==
*Based mainly on clinical findings and history of poor intake of Vitamin C
*Laboratory tests not very good index
*Can get estimate from amount of urinary excretion of Vitamin C after test does of ascorbic acid
**Children with deficiency secrete less ascorbic acid than those without
**Check concentrations 3-5 hours after administration of test dose

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Arthritis or acrodynia due to pain in limbs exacerbated by movement
*Rheumatic fever - rare in children under 2 years of age
*Suppurative arthritis and osteomyelitis
*Syphilis due to pseudoparalysis - usually occurs at earlier age and has other symptoms
*Polio - doesn't cause tenderness in limbs
*Henoch-Schonlein purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia, meningococcemia, nephritis also may be considered

==Prognosis==
*Recovery rapid when treated correctly
**Pain ceases within few days
**May take months for subperiosteal hemorrhage to disappear
**Body growth resumes quickly
*Unrecognized/untreated cases may lead to death
**From malnutrition, exhaustion, intercurrent disease
**Uncommonly have permanent deformity

==Treatment==
*Can be prevented by providing formula fed infants 25-50 mg ascorbic acid daily
**Lactating mothers should have minimum intake of 80 mg per day
**Children and adults need 50 mg per day
*Therapeutic dose of ascorbic acid is 100-200 mg daily

==Description==
*Pathway= The body needs sugar in the form of glucose to function. Glucose is what give sall of our cells the energy they need to function properly. In ordet o get it, it has to be broken down from larger molecules that store it (glycogen). It is primarily stored in the liver and muscles. Ths disorder has achnage in the genes that make the pieces that break down the larger molecules into sugar = the levels of sugar are too low and the large molecules start to build up.
*Deficiency in the breakdown of glucose. G6Pase activity requires 2 components of the microsomal membrane: (1) a glucose-6-phosphate specific transport system that shuttles G6P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (a G6P translocase), and (2) an enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase, bound to the luminal surface of the membrane.
*Three types
**GSD Ia = the basic defect in glucose-6-phosphatase activity ion the liver, kidney and intestinal lining.
**GSD Ib = defect is in the glucose-6-phosphate transfer gene so you can see activity of glucose-6-phosphatase when testing.
**GSD Ic = defect is in the pyrophosphate transfer - RARE
**GSD Id = defect in glucose transport - RARE

==Characteristics==
*Type Ia (most commonly associated with vGD.
**Short stature &amp; growth delay
**Abdomen protrusion
**Build up of glycogen and fat in the liver
**Enlarged liver and malignant/benign growths in the liver
**Yellow plaques on skin (xanthomas)
**Spider-like arteries, gout in the ear or kidney
**Bleeding disorders
**Hypoglycemia
**Hypertension
**Doll-like faces with large cheeks
*Type Ib
**All of the above
**Small numbers of nuetrophils in the blood (neutropenia)
**Bacterial infections
**Oral and intestinal sores.

==Genetics==
*Type Ia maps to chromosome 17q21.
*Type Ib maps to chromsome 11q23
*All are autosomal recessive

==Diagnosis==
*Based on variety of lab results
**G6PD
**Increase in lipids in blood (lipidemia)
**High levels of uric acid in blood (hyperurcemia)
**High levels of ketones in blood (ketonemia)
**Metabolic acidosis (increase of acids or decrease in water fluid)

==Treatment==
*Glucose drinks during the day
*Infusion at night through a nasogastric tube
*Cornstarch throughout the day for older children
*Dietary restrictions on fructose and galactose = need to supplement with calcium and multivitamins.
*Add Allopurinol to reduce uric acid levels which occurs because of the decrease in renal clearance and the increased production of uric acid as glycogen is not broken down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome'''

==Overview of Cancer==
*Cancer is caused by a mixture of genes and environment
**All cancer is genetic, but not all cancer is hereditary
**Most cancers are sporadic
*Cells in our bodies are always growing and dividing
**Genes control and regulate cell growth
**Changes in these genes result in a cell that grows out of control
***Uncontrolled cell growth is cancer
***Changes in DNA occur due to damage to genetic material
****DNA contains instructions for making proteins
****Proteins determine how cells work and regulate our development
****DNA must be copied each time a cell divides, and mistakes can occur in this process
*Hereditary cancer occurs when a person inherits one non-working copy of a gene
**One step closer to developing cancer than person with two working copies
**Features of hereditary cancer:
***Earlier age of onset
***Multiple generations affected
***Bilateral or multiple primary cancers
***Siblings both affected with related cancers

==Etiology of VHL==
*VHL gene located on chromosome 3p26-25
**Tumor suppressor gene
**Normal gene product has several functions:
***Transcriptional regulation by interaction with elongin
***Post-transcriptional repression of genes induced by hypoxia
***Regulation of p27 (cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor)
**Over 150 mutations have been identified
*Incidence is 1/35,000 to 1/40,000
**5-20% of mutations are de novo
**Penetrance is 80-90%
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*There is genotype-phenotype correlation

==Clinical Features==
*Hemangioblastoma
**CNS hemangioblastoma
***Characteristic lesion of VHL
***80% develop in brain and 20% in spinal cord
***Clinical symptoms
****Headache, vomiting, and gait disturbance or ataxia if in brain
****Pain, sensory and motor loss, or asymptomatic if in spinal cord
***Generally slow growing but may also be rapidly enlarging cysts in brain causing hydrocephalus and papilledema
**Retinal
***Found in about 70% of patients and are often initial manifestations
***May be detected on ophthalmoscopy
***Clinical symptoms
****Asymptomatic in some individuals
****Visual field defect
****Loss of visual activity due to retinal detachment or hemorrhage
***Number of hemangiomas doesn't increase with age but probability of vision loss does
*Renal lesions
**Multiple renal cysts are common
**Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 40% of patients
***Usually clear cell type
***Develop within cyst or in surrounding parenchyma
***Leading cause of mortality
*Pheochromocytoma
**May cause sustained or episodic hypertension or be asymptomatic
**Located on one or both adrenal glands usually but may be in other places
**Rarely cause malignant degeneration
*Pancreatic lesions
**Most are simple cysts and are usually multiple
**Rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency
***Cysts in head of pancreas can cause biliary obstruction
***Neuroendocrine tumors of pancreas can develop and become malignant
*Endolymphatic sac tumors (10% of patients)
**Cause deafness of varying degrees of severity
**Vertigo or tinnitus may be presenting complaint
**Large tumors can invade other cranial nerves
*Epididymal tumors
**Relatively common in males
**May cause infertility if bilateral
**Women may develop equivalent papillary cystadenoma of broad ligament - uncommon
*Natural history
**Wide variation in age of onset of symptoms
**Organ system involvement and disease severity also vary greatly

==Genotype - Phenotype Correlation==
*Type 1 - no pheo
**Partial gene deletion
**Small insertions or deletions (frameshifts)
**Nonsense mutations
**Splice site mutations
*Type 2 - with pheo
**Missense mutations
**Type 2A
***Without renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cysts
***Y98H, Y112H, V116F, L188V
**Type 2B
***With renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cysts
***R167Q and R167W
**Type 2C
***With pheos only
***V155L and R238W

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnosis
**Features needed for diagnosis
***Isolated case with two or more characteristic lesions
***Asymptomatic individual with positive family history with one or more of following
****Retinal hemangioblastoma
****Spinal or cerebellar hemangioblastoma
****Pheochromocytoma
****Multiple pancreatic cysts
****Epididymal cystadenoma
****Multiple renal cysts
****Renal cell carcinoma before age 60
**Tests used to make diagnosis
***CT scans or MRI to look for CNS and visceral tumors
***Ultrasound exam of epididymus, broad ligament, and possibly kidneys
***Radioiodine labeled MIBG if extra-adrenal tumors are susected
***Urinary catecholamine metabolite analysis
****VMA, metanephrine, and total catecholamine
****Suggest presence of pheos even if hypertension not present
*Molecular genetic testing
**Available clinically
**For cases that meet strict clinical criteria, mutation detection nears 100%
***Southern blotting
****Detects complete or partial gene deletions
****Responsible for about 28% of cases
***DNA sequence analysis
****Of all three exons to detect point mutations
****Missense mutations not previously characterized must be interpreted with caution
**Indicated in all individuals with known or suspected VHLdiagnosis
**Prenatal testing
***For pregnancies at 50% risk if mutation identified in affected parent
***Typically adult-onset so requires careful genetic counseling

==Treatment/Management==
*Surveillance
**DNA testing in at-risk family members can reduce need for costly screening in those who test negative
**Early recognition of manifestations may allow for improved outcome
**Ophthalmological screening beginning at age 5
**Annual blood pressure monitoring and measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites beginning at age 5 in families with pheos
**Annual abdominal ultrasound beginning at age 16
**CT or MRI of suspicious lesions in kidney, adrenal gland, or pancreas
**Possible baseline MRI of brain and spine in young adults
*Management of tumors
**CNS hemangioblastoma
***Some advocate early surgical removal while others follow lesions with imaging
***Most lesions eventually require intervention
***Gamma knife surgery can be used for small tumors or those in inoperable sites
***Surgical complications include paraplegia and operative mortality (10%)
**Retinal hemangioblastoma
***Laser and cryosurgery used with varying degrees of success depending on location, size, and number of lesions
***Recurrent tumors have been noted
**Renal cell carcinoma
***Early surgery is best option
***Renal transplantation in patients who require bilateral nephrectomy
**Pheochromocytoma
***Surgically removed
***Preoperative treatment with alpha-adrenergic blockade for 7-10 days
**Endolymphatic sac tumors
***Slow growing
***Possible deafness if removed
**Epididymal or broad ligament papillary cyst adenomas usually don't require surgery

      <text xml:space="preserve">Email began as an experiment by the military to be able to send to and from the battlefield.  Thus was born email or electronic-mail

The first email was sent in 1972 using two machines by an engineer named Ray Tomlinsin. Later he wrote a mail program for Tenex, the BBN-grown operating system that, by now, was running on most of the ARPANET's PDP-10 machines. (Heliomedia)
The mail program was written in two parts (1)to send messages, you would use a program called SNDMSG; (2)to receive mail, you would use the other part called READMAIL.(Heliomedia)

In 1972, the commands MAIL and MLFL were added to the FTP program and provided standard network transport capabilities for email transmission. FTP sent a separate copy of each email to each recipient, and provided the standard ARPANET email functionality until the early 1980's when the more efficient SMTP protocol was developed. Among other improvements, SMTP enabled sending a single message to a domain with more than one addressee, after which the local server would locally copy the message to each recipient. (Livinginternet) 

Over the years the email has evolved with many different programs put with it and many people working to improve the email systems.

In 1993, the large network service providers America Online and Delphi started to connect their proprietary email systems to the Internet, beginning the large scale adoption of Internet email as a global standard. (Livinginternet)

[[Category:Internet Technologies]]

The first important email standard was called SMTP, or simple message transfer protocol. SMTP was very simple and is still in use - however, as we will hear later in this series, SMTP was a fairly naïve protocol, and made no attempt to find out whether the person claiming to send a message was the person they purported to be. Forgery was (and still is) very easy in email addresses. These basic flaws in the protocol were later to be exploited by viruses and worms, and by security frauds and spammers forging identities. Some of these problems are still being addressed in 2004.

(Category: Net History)

Ian, Peter; http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/email.html


E-mail predates the Internet; existing e-mail systems were a crucial tool in creating the Internet. 1965 as a way for multiple users of a time-sharing mainframe computer to communicate. Although the exact history is murky, among the first systems to have such a facility were SDC's Q32 and MIT's CTSS. E-mail was quickly extended to become network e-mail, allowing users to pass messages between different computers. The early history of network e-mail is also murky; the AUTODIN system may have been the first allowing electronic text messages to be transferred between users on different computers in 1966, but it is possible the SAGE system had something similar some time before. The ARPANET computer network made a large contribution to the evolution of e-mail. There is one report [1] which indicates experimental inter-system e-mail transfers on it shortly after its creation, in 1969. Ray Tomlinson initiated the use of the @ sign to separate the names of the user and their machine in 1971 [2]. The common report that he &quot;invented&quot; e-mail is an exaggeration, although his early e-mail programs SNDMSG and READMAIL were very important. The first message sent by Ray Tomlinson is not preserved; it was &quot;a message announcing the availability of network email&quot;[3]. The ARPANET significantly increased the popularity of e-mail, and it became the killer app of the ARPANET.


((Origins of E-mail)

http://www.lookforemails.com/EmailFacts.aspx



BBN was the first company to send an e-mail. BBN stands for Bolt Beranek and Newman. BBN was hired by the US Defense Department and created what is known as the ARPANET. The ARPANET helped to evolved into what is known today as the internet. The first e-mail was sent three years later in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson. Ray Tomlinson eventually was the first to use the @ symbol in his emails to show which message was sent at which computer to show that it wasnt a local host.

http://www.mailmsg.com/history.htm

One of the first new developments when personal computers came on the scene was &quot;offline readers&quot;. Offline readers allowed email users to store their email on their own personal computers, and then read it and prepare replies without actually being connected to the network - sort of like Microsoft Outlook can do today. (Net History)

This was particularly useful in parts of the world where telephone costs to the nearest email system were expensive. (often this involved international calls in the early days) With connection charges of many dollars a minute, it mattered to be able to prepare a reply without being connected to a telephone, and then get on the network to send it. It was also useful because the &quot;offline&quot; mode allowed for more friendly interfaces. Being connected direct to the host email system in this era of very few standards often resulted in delete keys and backspace keys not working, no capacity for text to &quot;wrap around&quot; on the screen of the users computer, and other such annoyances. Offline readers helped a lot. (Net History)

The first important email standard was called SMTP, or simple message transfer protocol. SMTP was very simple and is still in use - however, as we will hear later in this series, SMTP was a fairly naïve protocol, and made no attempt to find out whether the person claiming to send a message was the person they purported to be. Forgery was (and still is) very easy in email addresses. These basic flaws in the protocol were later to be exploited by viruses and worms, and by security frauds and spammers forging identities. Some of these problems are still being addressed in 2004.  (Net History)

But as it developed email started to take on some pretty neat features. One of the first good commercial systems was Eudora, developed by Steve Dorner in 1988. Not long after Pegasus mail appeared. (Net History)

When Internet standards for email began to mature the POP (or Post Office Protocol) servers began to appear as a standard - before that each server was a little different. POP was an important standard to allow users to develop mail systems that would work with each other. (Net History)

These were the days of per-minute charges for email for individual dialup users. For most people on the Internet in those days email and email discussion groups were the main uses. These were many hundreds of these on a wide variety of topics, and as a body of newsgroups they became known as USENET. (Net History)

With the World Wide Web, email started to be made available with friendly web interfaces by providers such as Yahoo and Hotmail. Usually this was without charge. Now that email was affordable, everyone wanted at least one email address, and the medium was adopted by not just millions, but hundreds of millions of people. (Net History)</text>

== What is the Cookbook?==
The cookbook is a collaborative effort to document all aspects of cooking from recipes to culinary techniques. As a Wikibook, anyone is free to add, edit, or change content. A wiki is an ideal forum for communicating information such as recipes because it allows users to give feedback about recipes they have tried themselves. Consult the [[Help:Wikibooks|Wikibook help]] page for a well-organized and comprehensive overview of Wikibooks.

==How is the Cookbook organized?==
The Cookbook is organized around [[Categories]] and types. Category pages are useful as tables of contents, but do not have additional content written about them. When a new recipe is created, a category, e.g., Italian_Recipes, can be added to the bottom of the new recipe page. By doing so, this new recipe is added to that category page, which is simply an automatically generated listing of all pages referring to that Category. Cookbook entries are also organized by types. Types are groupings that are substantial enough to have additional content written about them. For example, the page for the type [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy]] has information about Italian cooking techniques, historical information, and a selective listing of the most important Italian recipes. When a new Italian recipe is created, its type is entered into the top of its page and the user has the option of manually linking to that recipe from the type page if they deem the new recipe important enough.

==How can I add a recipe?==
Consult the [[Cookbook:Policy|Policy page]] for an explanation of how pages are formatted.

==How do I keep track of recent changes to the Cookbook?==
First, select the recent changes module in the left-hand navigation. By default, the module displays changes made to all of the Wikibooks. You can then filter the listing by namespace, such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentChanges&amp;namespace=102 Cookbook] or [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentChanges&amp;namespace=103 Cookbook talk], using the drop-down list and then clicking on the Go button.

Alternatively, you can use the watchlist to keep track of a particular entry. On the top of the page, when you are logged in, there is a tab that says &quot;watch&quot;. When you click that button, the page will go onto your personal watch list. (In the mobile view, this is the outline of a 5-pointed star, &amp;#x2606;. When you click it, it becomes  a solid green star, &lt;span style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2605;&lt;/span&gt;.) Then, to see your watchlist, you can click the &quot;My Watchlist&quot; link in the upper right-hand corner (near your user name). Alternatively, when you edit a page, there is a check box labelled &quot;Watch this page&quot;, which has the same effect. If you want to automatically watch every page you edit, you could click on the &quot;preferences&quot; link (right next to &quot;my watchlist&quot;), and under the &quot;editing&quot; button, click the checkbox labeled &quot;Add pages and files I edit to my watchlist&quot;. Then, every time you edit any page in Wikibooks, it will add that page to your watchlist.

|By pushing or pulling the silver rabbit away from the f3 trap, Gold can capture the silver elephant.
}}

As the strongest Arimaa piece, the elephant is unique in its value. Although it cannot be pushed or pulled, an elephant is not entirely immune from capture&amp;mdash;if it voluntarily enters a trap square, it needs an adjacent friendly piece to keep it alive. With a game still in progress, an elephant loss will almost always be devastating. A strong elephant blockade can also be ruinous. 

The only thing worth more than an elephant is a guaranteed goal&amp;mdash;an elephant may need to be sacrificed to help a friendly rabbit reach goal, but since the game has been won there is no problem.  In rare circumstances, such as move 38s of [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=181966&amp;s=w this game], giving up one's elephant may be the only way to stop an enemy goal.

==Value of Other Pieces==

The practical value of each piece depends on its strength relative to the opponent's remaining forces. If both silver horses are gone, a gold camel and horse are nearly equal in strength, since a silver dog is the strongest piece which either can threaten. The absence of enemy horses also makes friendly dogs stronger, as they face few threats. Without silver horses, the only difference between a gold camel and dog is that the gold camel can threaten a silver dog, and a gold dog can be threatened by the silver camel.

As the board clears, the functional difference between pieces diminishes, and thus ''quantity'' of material becomes increasingly important. Try not to trade two pieces for one moderately stronger piece. 

In the endgame, ''goal threats'' are often worth more than material&amp;mdash;when an enemy rabbit has a path to goal, goal defense must take priority over captures. A strong goal threat of your own may also be preferable to a material lead.  At the end of [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=43158&amp;s=w this game], Silver gave up his camel but created a strong goal threat, which Gold was unable to stop. Although it is generally good to have your elephant near the enemy camel, in this case the silver camel kept the gold elephant away from where it was most needed.

== &quot;Even&quot; Exchanges ==

Often an ''even exchange'' (the capture of identical forces on each side) will benefit one player more than the other. In chess, the player with stronger pieces usually benefits from even trades, but in Arimaa the weaker side often benefits. Consider a situation in which Gold has lost a dog and a cat while Silver has lost his camel, with all other pieces remaining. Gold is poised to overload the silver elephant, now the only piece which can threaten a gold horse. Gold's horses are now functionally stronger than Silver's, and thus an &quot;even&quot; horse trade would favor Silver. Two such trades, removing all horses from the board, put Silver in the driver's seat; Silver is still up two-to-one in dogs and cats, pieces which now face fewer threats. As long as the silver elephant keeps the gold camel in check, Silver has a large advantage in free pieces despite his own camel's absence. After falling behind, Silver has by two &quot;even&quot; exchanges gained a decisive advantage. 

Some general rules of thumb:

* When material is identical, a player holding a blockade, frame, or hostage usually attempts to win material outright, because even exchanges can diminish such an advantage:
** A player whose elephant is blockaded will normally benefit from even trades, which will leave the opponent fewer pieces to spare for blockade duty.
** A player whose elephant is pinned to the defense of a framed piece will usually benefit from even trades, because with fewer pieces the opponent will have a harder time maintaining the frame.
** A player holding a hostage should avoid even trades of pieces weaker than the hostaged piece, as such trades would diminish the value of the hostage.  
* When material is not identical, the exchange of a weak piece reduces the relative value of every stronger piece, whereas the exchange of a strong piece increases the relative value of every weaker piece.
** A player who has won a dog for nothing in the opening, and thus retains two dogs to the opponent's one, will then benefit by exchanging camels or horses, as this will leave fewer pieces which can threaten a dog. Cat-for-cat or rabbit-for-rabbit trades, however, will weaken the dog advantage, as one has given up equal material for pieces which a dog might have captured outright.
** A player who has won a camel for nothing in the opening, and thus has the only remaining camel, should try to win further material outright; elephants are never traded, and any other &quot;even&quot; trade would weaken the camel. However, if he can take another piece or two without losing anything himself, he has then gained a significant edge in quantity of material. Even trades then become more favorable, since they maintain the quantity advantage while diminishing the functional difference between pieces.  
** Whenever a player has the only remaining camel on the board, a friendly horse is almost a second camel, and thus generally shouldn't be traded for any single piece. 
*The fewer the total number of pieces, the more important quantity becomes.
** If one player has stronger pieces and the other has more numerous pieces, the player with more numerous pieces usually benefits from an even exchange.
** On a mostly equitable board, the side with more Rabbits will usually benefit from any exchange which is roughly equal, such as two Dogs for a Horse and a Cat.

Finally, when a human plays a bot, &quot;even&quot; exchanges give the bot fewer possible positions to evaluate, which is an advantage for the bot on an otherwise equitable board.

With all of this having been said, a trade would always be better than losing a piece outright. If a friendly piece cannot be rescued, get whatever you can in return.

== Uneven Trades ==

When material is traded for non-identical material, the implications likewise depend on what has happened beforehand. Some rules of thumb '''when the board is full''':

* A Cat is worth more than a Rabbit, but not by much
* A Dog is worth approximately two Rabbits
* A Horse is worth approximately a Dog and a Rabbit
* A Camel is worth approximately a Horse and a Cat

These values correspond to opinions as of April 2011, and are subject to change as strategy is further refined.  

When even material has already been exchanged, such a two-for-one trade would likely favor the side capturing two pieces. 

== Sacrifices ==

Sometimes, material can be sacrificed to gain an overall advantage in the position. In a common example, you may find that you can take a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage|camel hostage]], but using your turn to that end would leave a friendly piece vulnerable to capture. Holding the enemy camel hostage does not automatically put one in control; in general, a hostage is only of benefit when one has an advantage in free pieces, which will be somewhat diminished by any material sacrifice. Moreover, if the enemy elephant chooses to abandon its camel, it may get something in return, having a head start while you make the capture. Add that to an initial sacrifice, and your opponent could come out fully compensated for his camel loss. A camel hostage is rarely worth sacrificing more than a cat for, and may not even be worth a rabbit. Such a dilemma requires you to carefully consider the entire position, thinking ahead to how you could capitalize and how your opponent could counter.

In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=32065&amp;s=w this game], Silver sacrificed a cat to gain a camel hostage.

== Conclusion ==
In Arimaa, it is not always clear which side has the ultimate advantage. Even an apparently favorable position depends on the player knowing how to capitalize; the real advantage is with the one who best understands the situation at hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''[[Federal Rules of Evidence]]''' are a staple of American legal education. Almost all law students learn the rules in their first or second year of law school. An understanding of the rules is critical when arguing a case in the courtroom, and important for any lawyer seeking to protect their client when a suit is filed.

Article I of the Federal Rules sets forth some basic laws which govern the application of the other rules of evidence.

==Rule 101. Scope==
:''These rules govern proceedings in the courts of the United States and before United States bankruptcy judges and United States magistrate judges, to the extent and with the exceptions stated in rule 1101.''

The purpose of this rule is to define when the Federal Rules of Evidence are authoritative.  Most generally, the rules apply in federal courts at any level.  However, the rules are also germane to proceedings in state courts because as of January 1, 2004, 41 states and Puerto Rico had adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Each state likely made several moderate and some substantial changes to the rules before they were officially codified by the state legislature.

There is no direct mention of rule 104, and there probably should be because while the rules generally govern proceedings in the district courts, they do not govern preliminary questions on the admissibility of evidence, except for rule 501.  
[[../Miscellaneous Rules|Rule 1101]] specifically states when the rules are applicable or inapplicable. Military courts use the evidence rules of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

==Rule 102. Purpose and Construction==
:''These rules shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.''

Rule 102 is rarely cited by lawyers, but it quietly grants judges a huge deal of authority over trials, inviting them to &quot;eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay&quot; and &quot;grow&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; the law of evidence through their administration of the rules.

==Rule 103. Rulings on Evidence==
:'''''(a) Effect of erroneous ruling.''' Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and''

::'''''(1) Objection.''' In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or''
::'''''(2) Offer of proof.''' In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.''

:''Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.''

If you've ever watched a courtroom drama on TV or in the cinema, you've probably seen lawyers make &quot;objections&quot; in the courtroom. Lawyers raise and argue issues of evidence through these objections. Objecting is important because '''if a lawyer fails to object to evidence, they cannot appeal''' their case on the grounds that the evidence was improperly admitted. Rule 103(a) forces lawyers to object to any evidence they think might unfairly decide their case, so as to &quot;preserve error.&quot;

Objections come in many forms. Many objections are raised &quot;''in limine'',&quot; before the trial even starts. This keeps attorneys from having to argue about sensitive evidence in front of the jury. Some objections are made when one side's attorney asks a witness a question that makes the other side uncomfortable. Objections can even be made after the evidence is heard by the jury: such an objection is called a &quot;motion to strike,&quot; and while it won't keep the evidence away from the jury, it will preserve error.

:'''''(b) Record of offer and ruling.''' The court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.''

:'''''(c) Hearing of jury.''' In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.''

After an objection is made, an attorney or the judge will often request to speak &quot;at sidebar,&quot; meaning out of the jury's earshot.

:'''''(d) Plain error.''' Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.''

While an objection is usually necessary to preserve error, appeals courts occasionally take notice of truly egregious errors by trial judges, even when there is no objection. However, such cases are rare: it's always important to object to any evidence that might become an issue of contention on appeal.

==Rule 104. Preliminary Questions==

:'''''(a) Questions of admissibility generally.''' Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.''

When a judge decides whether or not to admit evidence, they usually do so under Rule 104(a), with only two exceptions (noted below). A 104(a) determination is fairly straightforward: the attorneys present arguments for and against admissibility, often supported by extrinsic evidence, and the judge determines whether the contested evidence should be admitted. The arguments and evidence heard by the judge need not be admissible in front of the jury, with the caveat that privileged information (such as attorney-client communications) cannot be considered. (Privileges are discussed in further detail in [[../Privileges|this chapter]].)

:'''''(b) Relevancy conditioned on fact.''' When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.''

Rule 104(b) is used in determining two types of evidentiary questions: authentication of evidence (Rule 901) and prior bad acts (Rule 404(b)). When these issues are being considered, the attorney must &quot;tie up&quot; the admissibility by presenting extrinsic evidence that proves admissibility. This can be done either before or after the evidence is presented, at the judge's discretion.

:'''''(c) Hearing of jury.''' Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and so requests.''

Although judges have leeway to conduct evidentiary arguments in the presence of the jury, they will usually hear arguments at sidebar if either side requests it.

:'''''(d) Testimony by accused.''' The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.''

:'''''(e) Weight and credibility.''' This rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility.''

==Rule 105. Limited Admissibility==
:''When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.''

Almost every trial contains at least one &quot;limiting instruction,&quot; where the jury hears a damaging piece of evidence and the judge tells them they may only consider it for one purpose. Many lawyers argue against limiting instructions, claiming that &quot;the bell cannot be unrung&quot;&amp;mdash;once the evidence has been heard, the jury will want to consider it for any end that seems relevant. However, appeals courts usually assume that the jury will follow the limiting instruction, except in rare cases where the evidence is powerfully incriminating in a patently unfair way.

As with objections, a lawyer must request a limiting instruction in order to preserve error on appeal. If they do not request the instruction, they cannot fault the trial judge for not imposing the instruction.

==Rule 106. Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements==
There are two basic types of evidence: '''testimony''', evidence provided by the statements of witnesses in court, and '''exhibits''', evidence provided in physical form.

Exhibits have to have a '''foundation''' that makes their admissibility valid. One key part of this foundation is '''authentication''', or proving that the exhibit is what the proponent claims it is. For example, to show a &quot;murder weapon&quot; to the jury, the prosecutor must first establish that the weapon is the one used to commit the murder. Authentication rules are covered in depth in [[../Authentication|Article IX]].

Writings and recorded statements follow additional rules on top of authentication, and Rule 106 is one such rule, requiring that writings and recorded statements be presented in '''context''' if the other side demands it.

:''When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article II of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''judicial notice'''.

==Rule 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts==
:'''''(a) Scope of rule.''' This rule governs only judicial notice of adjudicative facts.''

:'''''(b) Kinds of facts.''' A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.''

Judicial notice is a very simple way to introduce a fact as evidence, but it is not frequently invoked.

The best-known example of judicial notice comes from the 1858 trial of [[w:William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong|&quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was charged with murder and defended by [[w:Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], then a Chicago railroad lawyer. An eyewitness claimed that Armstrong was able to see the victim in the moonlight. Lincoln produced a copy of the ''Farmers' Almanac'', and asked the judge to take judicial notice that the moon was too low in the sky to produce moonlight on the night in question. The judge agreed, and Armstrong was acquitted.

Judicial notice may be based on &quot;sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,&quot; such as Lincoln's almanac. Judicial notice can also be based on local general knowledge. A lawyer trying a case in New York may ask the judge to take judicial notice that the East River is located between Manhattan and Brooklyn, or that the Empire State Building is the tallest building in the city. In such a case, no extrinsic evidence would be necessary. However, if the New York lawyer wanted the judge to take judicial notice that the river is forty-five feet deep, or that Minneapolis is located west of St. Paul, the lawyer would probably need extrinsic evidence.

:'''''(c) When discretionary.''' A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.''

Rule 201(c) is often implied when dealing with the validity of scientific tests. &quot;Radar guns&quot; are a common example. When they were first introduced to measure the speed of cars, many judges would require attorneys to establish the validity of their readings before the readings could be considered as substantive evidence. Today, most judges take judicial notice of the reliability of these readings whether counsel asks for it or not, since radar gun evidence is common in the courtroom. Opposing counsel can object, but judges need not obtain evidence to overrule the objection.

:'''''(d) When mandatory.''' A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.''

Note that Rule 201(d) does not mean that all requests for judicial notice will be granted. Any judicial notice must be of a fact that falls under Rule 201(b). The judge may (and legally, should) refuse to take judicial notice of any fact that is not generally known or readily verifiable.

:'''''(e) Opportunity to be heard.''' A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.''

:'''''(f) Time of taking notice.''' Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding.''

:'''''(g) Instructing jury.''' In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed. In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.''

Rule 201(g) differentiates criminal cases from civil cases. Its practical effect is on the jury instructions that come near the end of the trial. In the ''Armstrong'' case above, the judge's instruction would be:

* &quot;You '''may''', but '''are not required to''', accept as a fact that there was no moonlight on the night in question.&quot;

If ''Armstrong'' were a civil case (e.g., for wrongful death), the instruction would be:

* &quot;You '''must accept''' as '''conclusively true''' the fact that there was no moonlight on the night in question.&quot;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Article III of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''presumptions''' and '''burdens of proof'''. It applies to civil actions&amp;mdash;cases arising under non-criminal laws, such as contract, property and tort.

==Rule 301. Presumptions in General Civil Actions and Proceedings==
:''In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.''

The term &quot;burden of proof&quot; is often used in legal discourse, but for a technical analysis of the law, it is too vague. There are actually two forms of the burden of proof, commonly referred to as the '''burden of going forward''' and the '''burden of persuasion'''. Both of these burdens are addressed by Rule 301.

===Burden of going forward===

At any given time, one party is obligated to produce evidence regarding a claim or defense. This is the burden of going forward. When a presumption of fact is triggered, the other side has the burden to prove the non-existence of that fact.  Yet the committee notes and house judiciary report for Rule 301 rejects a '''bursting bubble approach''' to the burden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_301, Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, even if a party introduces adequate evidence contrary to the presumed fact, the presumption does not simply vanish--the presumption remains a part of the fact-finder's calculus.

For example, take a hypothetical civil case where one element of the claim is that it was raining on a given night. The plaintiff introduces evidence that the ground was wet the next morning. Imagine this creates a presumption that it rained the night before. The defendant must then rebut this presumption with other evidence: maybe eyewitnesses who say it wasn't raining, maybe evidence that a truck dumped water on the ground overnight. If a preponderance of the evidence disproves the presumption, the defendant has met his burden of persuasion.  However, the presumption that it rained the night before remains may still be considered by the jury or finder of fact, and alone may be sufficient evidence of the rain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_301, Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nevertheless, some Federal Courts still apply the bursting bubble approach.  Under this approach, in the above example, the eye-witness testimony that it did not rain would entirely negate the presumption that it rained, and the presumption could not be considered by the finder of fact.

This approach is unique to civil cases. Presumptions are not found in criminal cases because of the due process guarantees of the Constitution. The prosecution must always prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

===Burden of persuasion===

'''Beyond a reasonable doubt''' is one example of a burden of persuasion. That particular burden is the burden that applies when proving a criminal charge. In civil cases, the usual burden of persuasion is either '''preponderance of the evidence''' (&quot;more likely than not&quot;) or '''clear and convincing evidence'''.

Unlike the burden of going forward, the burden of persuasion never shifts. Allowing it to shift would make no sense, because it only applies in the context of the factfinder's final decision&amp;mdash;to the reasoning of the judge or jury in reaching their verdict. The plaintiff always has the burden to persuade the factfinder that their claim is valid; the civil defendant always has the burden to persuade the factfinder that their defense is valid.

Note that in criminal cases, the burden of persuasion rests with the prosecution at all times, even when the burden of going forward shifts to the defendant. For example, if the defendant raises an affirmative defense, the prosecution must persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is invalid.

==Rule 302. Applicability of State Law in Civil Actions and Proceedings==
:''In civil actions and proceedings, the effect of a presumption respecting a fact which is an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision is determined in accordance with State law.''

Rule 302 applies to civil cases brought to federal court under diversity jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction is a complex issue of civil procedure that merits little discussion here, except to say that it involves federal courts interpreting the law of states. Whenever a federal court is considering an issue of state law, Rule 302 requires the court to apply that state's law on presumptions to the proceeding. This means that the burden of going forward in such cases may not necessarily follow Rule 301.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article IV of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''relevancy'''&amp;mdash;the first consideration in determining the admissibility of evidence.

==Rule 401. Definition of &quot;Relevant Evidence&quot;==

:''&quot;Relevant evidence&quot; means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.''

Relevancy is the notion that every piece of evidence admitted in the courtroom must be &quot;tied&quot; to the case somehow. Any probative value will make evidence relevant. Note that relevancy is different from credibility. If evidence is merely unbelievable, the presumption is that it should be admissible, and the jury should decide whether or not to believe it.

Relevant evidence need not be probative of the core issues of the case, or of a disputed issue. Matters &quot;of consequence&quot; can include the background of parties and witnesses, or any other matter which weighs for or against the case of one of the parties.

==Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible; Irrelevant Evidence Inadmissible==

:''All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.''

Rule 402 makes relevancy the first consideration when objecting to evidence. If evidence cannot be tied to a matter of consequence, it cannot be admitted at all, regardless of whatever rules might indicate its validity. If evidence is relevant, then the other rules of evidence come into play.

==Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time==

:''Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.''

Rule 403 provides a &quot;balancing test&quot; for excluding relevant evidence. The balancing test is strongly weighted toward admission; there must be a danger of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. &quot;Unfair prejudice&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;prejudice&quot;&amp;mdash;almost all relevant evidence is prejudicial to one side or the other. Proving unfair prejudice is often difficult; proving the balance is even moreso.

Ordinarily, a 403 objection is the ''last'' objection a lawyer makes when seeking to exclude evidence. Besides the burden of tipping the balance, another key problem is that a 403 objection concedes the relevance of the evidence.

==Rule 404. Character Evidence Not Admissible To Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes==
===Rule 404(a). Character evidence generally===

:''Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:

::(1) Character of accused - Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or if  evidence of  a trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime is offered by an accused and admitted under Rule 404 (a)(2),  evidence of the same  trait of character of the accused offered  by the prosecution;

::(2) Character of alleged victim - Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the alleged victim was the first aggressor;

::(3) Character of witness - Evidence of the character of a witness, as provided in rules 607, 608, and 609.

===Rule 404(b). Other crimes, wrongs, or acts===

:''Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.

==Rule 405. Methods of Proving Character==
===Rule 405(a). Reputation or opinion===
:''In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.''

===Rule 405(b). Specific instances of conduct===
:''In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be made of specific instances of that person's conduct.

==Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice==
:''Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.''

This is a cleverly worded rule, in the sense that it’s unique for a reason.  It states that habit evidence is ''relevant'' for a particular reason, to prove conformity on a particular occasion.  Normally, the rules specify a theory of relevance for which the evidence can or cannot be admitted; this rule does neither.  By specifying that the evidence is relevant for a particular purpose, the rule does not preclude exclusion by any other rule.  By not stating that it is ''admissible'' for that purpose, the rule does not preclude admission for other purposes by the principle of ''expressio unius est exclusio alterius''.   
	The rule's application and effect depends on how ‘habit’ is defined.  Habit is difficult to distinguish from character.  Usually, the trait must be proven to be a conditioned response and not otherwise inadmissible under rule 404(a).  A habit is the person’s regular practice of meeting a particular kind of situation with a specific type of conduct, such as the habit of going down a certain stairway two stairs at a time; a habit action is semi-automatic.  Still, it can be difficult to separate from character.  Routine practice, as it relates to more commercial and mechanical actions, does not pose the same problem.  Both are highly persuasive evidence.  To be properly admitted, it must directly relate or be connected to the conduct which it purports to prove.
	At common law, habit evidence wasn’t admissible unless corroborated and there were eye witnesses.  Obviously, the federal rule has changed this.

==Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures==
:''When, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event, measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for a warning or instruction. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.
''

This rule is constructed along familiar lines: it excludes evidence (the undertaking of subsequent remedial measures) when it is presented under specified theories of relevance.  However, the rule only bars subsequent remedial measures that would have prevented the harm that is the subject of the litigation.  The rule incorporates language that clearly indicates the arena of products liability; the reasoning behind this is parallel to the foundational policy behind the rule: the judiciary does not want to dissuade manufacturers, or anyone else, from taking remedial measures that might prevent future harm.  However, some courts allow it in products liability cases on the theory that the greater risk of liability, if admitted, would trigger the change, which is somewhat of a circular argument as it is designed to encourage improvements.

	The purposes for which the evidence may be admitted are limited by the requirement that the offer is made to prove a ''controverted fact''.  It can’t be offered to prove ownership or feasibility of precautionary measures unless the opponent has denied ownership or that taking remedial measures was possible.

	The rule does not bar evidence that measures have not been taken, but this might not be relevant unless the defense is lack of knowledge of the dangerous condition or product.  Evidence of subsequent remedial measures made by someone other than the instant defendant, like a peer corporation, is not excluded by the rule.  Firing an employee is a widely considered a subsequent remedial measure.

==Rule 408. Compromise and Offers to Compromise==
(a) '''Prohibited uses'''.--Evidence of the following is not admissible on behalf of any party, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction:

(1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish--or accepting or offering or promising to accept--a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and

(2) conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim, except when offered in a criminal case and the negotiations related to a claim by a public office or agency in the exercise of regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.

(b) '''Permitted uses'''.--This rule does not require exclusion if the evidence is offered for purposes not prohibited by subdivision (a). Examples of permissible purposes include proving a witness's bias or prejudice; negating a contention of undue delay; and proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.

==Rule 409. Payment of Medical and Similar Expenses==
:Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.

==Rule 410. Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements== 
:Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:

::(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;
::(2) a plea of nolo contendere;
::(3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or comparable state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or
::(4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.

:However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel.

==Rule 411. Liability Insurance==
:Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.

==Rule 412. Sex Offense Cases; Relevance of Victim's Past Behavior or Alleged Sexual Predisposition== 
:'''(a) Evidence generally inadmissible.''' The following evidence is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c):
::(1) Evidence offered to prove that any alleged victim engaged in other sexual behavior.
::(2) Evidence offered to prove any alleged victim's sexual predisposition.

:'''(b) Exceptions.'''
::(1) In a criminal case, the following evidence is admissible, if otherwise admissible under these rules:
:::(A) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim offered to prove that a person other than the accused was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence;
:::(B) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim with respect to the person accused of the sexual misconduct offered by the accused to prove consent or by the prosecution; and
:::(C) evidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.
::(2) In a civil case, evidence offered to prove the sexual behavior or sexual predisposition of any alleged victim is admissible if it is otherwise admissible under these rules and its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.  Evidence of an alleged victim's reputation is admissible only if it has been placed in controversy by the alleged victim.

:'''(c) Procedure to determine admissibility.'''
::(1) A party intending to offer evidence under subdivision (b) must&amp;mdash;
:::(A) file a written motion at least 14 days before trial specifically describing the evidence and stating the purpose for which it is offered unless the court, for good cause requires a different time for filing or permits filing during trial; and
:::(B) serve the motion on all parties and notify the alleged victim or, when appropriate, the alleged victim's guardian or representative.
::(2) Before admitting evidence under this rule the court must conduct a hearing in camera and afford the victim and parties a right to attend and be heard.  The motion, related papers, and the record of the hearing must be sealed and remain under seal unless the court orders otherwise.

==Rule 413. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Sexual Assault Cases== 
:(a) In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault, evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.

:(b) In a case in which the Government intends to offer evidence under this rule, the attorney for the Government shall disclose the evidence to the defendant, including statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of any testimony that is expected to be offered, at least fifteen days before the scheduled date of trial or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause.

:(c) This rule shall not be construed to limit the admission or consideration of evidence under any other rule.

:(d) For purposes of this rule and Rule 415, &quot;offense of sexual assault&quot; means a crime under Federal law or the law of a State (as defined in section 513 of title 18, United States Code) that involved--

::(1) any conduct proscribed by chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code;
::(2) contact, without consent, between any part of the defendant's body or an object and the genitals or anus of another person;
::(3) contact, without consent, between the genitals or anus of the defendant and any part of another person's body;
::(4) deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on another person; or
::(5) an attempt or conspiracy to engage in conduct described in paragraphs (1)-(4).

==Rule 414. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Child Molestation Cases==

::(5) deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on a child; or
::(6) an attempt or conspiracy to engage in conduct described in paragraphs (1)-(5).

==Rule 415. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Civil Cases Concerning Sexual Assault and Child Molestation Cases==
:(a) In a civil case in which a claim for damages or other relief is predicated on a party's alleged commission of conduct constituting an offense of sexual assault or child molestation, evidence of that party's commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation is admissible and may be considered as provided in Rule 413 and Rule 414 of these rules.

:(b) A party who intends to offer evidence under this Rule shall disclose the evidence to the party against whom it will be offered, including statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of any testimony that is expected to be offered, at least fifteen days before the scheduled date of trial or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article V of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with privileges. It consists of one rule.

==Rule 501. General Rule==
:''Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of the United States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.''

Privilege is an important evidentiary rule, and there was a movement to codify key privileges in the Federal Rules of Evidence. But this movement did not succeed, and today's rules do not expressly state which privileges are recognized and which are not. The privileges themselves remain '''common law'''&amp;mdash;traditional rules which are periodically redefined by the courts.

The privileges that may be invoked in federal court include:

===Attorney-client privilege===
Covers all communications between an attorney, their client, and any other associates within the scope of the attorney's representation of the client. The client waives the privilege if they disclose the privileged information to a third party. There are several exceptions: the attorney may break privilege to prevent the client's commission of a dangerous criminal offense, and should break privilege when he or she knows that the client is lying to the court. The attorney can also use privileged information to rectify any fraudulent or criminal behavior perpetrated by the client with the attorney's unknowing assistance. Attorney-client privilege can also be broken when there is an issue of the attorney breaking his or her duty to the client (malpractice) or of the client breaking his or her duty to the attorney (failure to pay fees). See [http://www.law.harvard.edu/publications/evidenceiii/rules/503_proposed.htm Proposed Rule 503], which was rejected by Congress but contains good guidelines to the scope of the attorney-client privilege.

===Spousal privilege===
Confidential communications between spouses within the martial context are subject to spousal privilege.

===Priest-penitent privilege===
Under common law, a penitent may keep their disclosures to their priest under privilege. (The privilege belongs to the priest under Catholic canon law, and may only be broken with a dispensation from the cardinal, which can only be obtained with the permission of the Pope.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VI of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] focuses on the competency and credibility of '''witnesses'''. The rules in this article come up often in ''impeachment''&amp;mdash;when one side seeks to discredit the other side's witness.

==Rule 601. General Rule of Competency==
:''Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the competency of a witness shall be determined in accordance with State law.''

The second sentence of Rule 601 is another reference to diversity jurisdiction, or the application of state law in federal court. When state substantive law is being applied to an issue, witnesses testifying to that issue must meet that state's legal standards for witness competency. These are sometimes identical to the federal standards and usually not significantly different, although there are some exceptions.

==Rule 602. Lack of Personal Knowledge==
:''A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness' own testimony. This rule is subject to the provisions of [[../Opinions#Rule 703. Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts|rule 703]], relating to opinion testimony by expert witnesses.''

The most important prerequisites to be a witness are '''memory''' and '''perception'''. To be a witness, a person must have perceived the matter in question, and they must remember it. If they do not remember, or did not perceive, the matter, then their testimony is '''speculation''' and it is inadmissible.

==Rule 603. Oath or Affirmation==
:''Before testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that the witness will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken the witness' conscience and impress the witness' mind with the duty to do so.''

The requirement of an &quot;oath&quot; or &quot;affirmation&quot; is misleading, because a formal oath or affirmation is not strictly necessary. Some witnesses, like small children and the mentally disabled, may not understand the meaning of an oath or affirmation. In these cases, it is enough to demonstrate, through testimony, that the witness understands the concept of truth, and the penalties for not telling the truth on the witness stand.

==Rule 604. Interpreters==
:''An interpreter is subject to the provisions of these rules relating to qualification as an expert and the administration of an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.''

==Rule 605. Competency of Judge as Witness==
:''The judge presiding at the trial may not testify in that trial as a witness. No objection need be made in order to preserve the point.''

==Rule 606. Competency of Juror as Witness==
:'''''(a) At the trial.''' A member of the jury may not testify as a witness before that jury in the trial of the case in which the juror is sitting. If the juror is called so to testify, the opposing party shall be afforded an opportunity to object out of the presence of the jury.''

:'''''(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment.''' Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror's mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may a juror's affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.''

==Rule 607. Who May Impeach==
:''The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.''

==Rule 608. Evidence of Character and Conduct of Witness== 
:'''''(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.''' The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.''

:'''''(b) Specific instances of conduct.''' Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness' character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified. The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by any other witness, does not operate as a waiver of the accused's or the witness' privilege against self-incrimination when examined with respect to matters that relate only to character for truthfulness.''

==Rule 609. Impeachment by Evidence of Conviction of Crime== 
Rule 609 is the second rule that deals with the admissibility of prior convictions. It differs from [[../Relevancy#Rule 404(b). Other crimes, wrongs, or acts|Rule 404(b)]] in that the conviction can only be used to impeach the witness's credibility, not as substantive evidence. Because of the limited purpose for which the conviction is offered under this rule, only two types of convictions fall under its scope.

:'''''(a) General rule.''' For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,''

::''(1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to [[../Relevancy#Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time|Rule 403]], if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused; and''

::''(2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.''

A 609(a)(1) conviction is relevant because of its severity, and is presumptively admissible unless it fails the Rule 403 balancing test for unfair prejudice. The key term is &quot;punishable&quot;&amp;mdash;a conviction can be admitted under Rule 609(a) even if it was not punished at all, so long as there was a prospect of the death penalty or an extended prison sentence.

If a criminal defendant is being attacked with a 609(a)(1) conviction, a &quot;reverse 403&quot; balancing test applies. Note that the balancing test weighs toward inadmissibility.

A 609(a)(2) conviction is relevant because it is probative of the witness's honesty or truthfulness. Convictions that might be admissible under this rule include fraud, theft, perjury and insider trading. But many crimes&amp;mdash;even heinous crimes like murder, assault and kidnapping&amp;mdash;are not necessarily dishonest or untruthful.

While a conviction itself might be admissible under Rule 609, its details are not. Evidence under Rule 609 is usually limited to (1) the offense, (2) the conviction, (3) the date of the conviction, and (4) the sentence. A conviction admitted under Rule 404(b) may be fleshed out in much more detail. But remember: fewer convictions are admissible under Rule 404(b).

:'''''(b) Time limit.''' Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than 10 years old as calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.''

Although the &quot;ten-year rule&quot; appears to be quite bendable, it is usually a complete bar to the admissibility of convictions. Some judges will, however, allow convictions beyond the ten-year rule if they pass the balancing test within the rule, and these decisions are usually not overturned on appeal.

Note that &quot;confinement&quot; does not include parole or probation: the ten-year clock begins on the date of conviction or release from prison, whichever is more recent.

:'''''(c) Effect of pardon, annulment, or certificate of rehabilitation.''' Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent crime which was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence.''

:'''''(d) Juvenile adjudications.''' Evidence of juvenile adjudications is generally not admissible under this rule. The court may, however, in a criminal case allow evidence of a juvenile adjudication of a witness other than the accused if conviction of the offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult and the court is satisfied that admission in evidence is necessary for a fair determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.''

:'''''(e) Pendency of appeal.''' The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.''

==Rule 610. Religious Beliefs or Opinions==
:''Evidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the witness' credibility is impaired or enhanced.''

==Rule 611. Mode and Order of Interrogation and Presentation==
:'''''(a) Control by court.''' The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.''

:'''''(b) Scope of cross-examination.''' Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.''

Examination of witnesses is often said to follow an &quot;inverted funnel&quot; pattern. On direct examination, any relevant matter can be brought up in questioning. The cross-examiner is limited to the scope of the direct examination and to credibility issues. On re-direct, the examiner is limited to the scope of the cross-examination. If the cross-examiner wishes to re-cross, they will be limited to the scope of the re-direct. And so on. When a lawyer crosses outside the permitted subject matter under Rule 611(b), it is called &quot;exceeding the scope,&quot; and is objectionable.

:'''''(c) Leading questions.''' Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.''

Leading questions are banned on direct examination to keep lawyers from &quot;feeding&quot; their witnesses the answers to each question.

The orthodoxy among courtroom lawyers today is that ''only'' leading questions should be used on cross-examination, because the witness can be counted on to give an unfavorable answer if they are given any room to respond. This principle is also why lawyers are allowed to lead hostile or adverse witnesses. An example of &quot;a witness identified with an adverse party&quot; is a police officer from the perspective of a criminal defendant.

In some cases, the direct examiner may need to lead the witness for reasons unrelated to hostility. Small children, for instance, are often confused by open-ended questions. In such situations, the examiner will usually ask the judge for permission to lead.

==Rule 612. Writing Used to Refresh Memory==
:''Except as otherwise provided in criminal proceedings by section 3500 of title 18, United States Code, if a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either:''

::''(1) while testifying, or''
::''(2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice,''

:''an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial.''

In some situations, a witness has first-hand knowledge of relevant facts, but cannot recall them when questioned in court. If this happens, the lawyer questioning the witness can use Rule 612 to &quot;jog their memory&quot; by showing them a record of their prior statement. The witness cannot get their testimony from the record itself: under Rule 612, the record is only shown to them to refresh their recollection. The questioning might go like this:

*Q. Do you remember the license plate number?
*A. KX... uh, no, I'm afraid I don't.
*Q. I'm showing you Defense Exhibit A. ''(hands over a copy of the witness's statement to the police)'' Please read it to yourself.
*A. All right.
*Q. Now turn it over and set it aside. Do you remember the plate number?
*A. Yes... it was KX4-56F.

In the above example, the witness has to ''remember'' the plate number, not just repeat what is on the paper in front of them. However, if they cannot remember independently, the exhibit can be offered into evidence under Rule 803(5), discussed in the chapter on [[../Hearsay|hearsay]].

==Rule 613. Prior Statements of Witnesses== 
:'''''(a) Examining witness concerning prior statement.''' In examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the same shall be shown or disclosed to opposing counsel.''

:'''''(b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness.''' Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in rule 801(d)(2).''

Rule 613 is about '''prior inconsistent statements'''. When a witness says one thing out of the courtroom and then says something else on the witness stand, the opposing party can use their inconsistency to attack their credibility. Rule 613(a) allows a lawyer to &quot;ambush&quot; their opponent's witnesses with a prior inconsistent statement: Rule 613(b) forces the lawyer to ambush the witness on cross-examination, not later when they are unable to respond.

Prior inconsistent statements ''given under oath'' are also admissible as substantive evidence under [[../Hearsay#Prior inconsistent statements|Rule 801(d)(1)(A)]]. The key difference between the two rules is that 613 statements are only useful for impeaching a witness, while 801 statements can be used for any relevant purpose. 801(d)(1)(A) statements can be thought of as a subset of 613 statements; all prior inconsistent statements are admissible to impeach, but only some are admissible for their truth. 801(d)(1)(A) admissibility also overcomes the 613(b) restriction on extrinsic evidence.

Although Rule 613(a) does not specifically apply to &quot;inconsistent&quot; statements, prior ''consistent'' statements are irrelevant for the purposes of impeachment: they can, however, be admitted as substantive evidence under [[../Hearsay#Prior consistent statements|Rule 801(d)(1)(B)]].

==Rule 614. Calling and Interrogation of Witnesses by Court== 
:'''''(a) Calling by court.''' The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.''

:'''''(b) Interrogation by court.''' The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.''

:'''''(c) Objections.''' Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.''

==Rule 615. Exclusion of Witnesses==
:''At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause, or (4) a person authorized by statute to be present.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VII of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with the '''opinions''' of witnesses&amp;mdash;both '''lay opinions''' and the opinions of '''expert witnesses'''.

==Rule 701. Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses== 
:If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.

==Rule 702. Testimony by Experts==
:If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

==Rule 703. Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts==
:The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted. Facts or data that are otherwise inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's opinion substantially outweighs their  prejudicial effect.

==Rule 704. Opinion on Ultimate Issue==
:(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.

:(b) No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto. Such ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone.

==Rule 705. Disclosure of Facts or Data Underlying Expert Opinion== 
:The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give reasons therefor without first testifying to the underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.

==Rule 706. Court Appointed Experts==
:'''a) Appointment.''' The court may on its own motion or on the motion of any party enter an order to show cause why expert witnesses should not be appointed, and may request the parties to submit nominations. The court may appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon by the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own selection. An expert witness shall not be appointed by the court unless the witness consents to act. A witness so appointed shall be informed of the witness' duties by the court in writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference in which the parties shall have opportunity to participate. A witness so appointed shall advise the parties of the witness' findings, if any; the witness' deposition may be taken by any party; and the witness may be called to testify by the court or any party. The witness shall be subject to cross-examination by each party, including a party calling the witness.

:'''(b) Compensation.''' Expert witnesses so appointed are entitled to reasonable compensation in whatever sum the court may allow. The compensation thus fixed is payable from funds which may be provided by law in criminal cases and civil actions and proceedings involving just compensation under the fifth amendment. In other civil actions and proceedings the compensation shall be paid by the parties in such proportion and at such time as the court directs, and thereafter charged in like manner as other costs.

:'''(c) Disclosure of appointment.''' In the exercise of its discretion, the court may authorize disclosure to the jury of the fact that the court appointed the expert witness.

:'''(d) Parties' experts of own selection.''' Nothing in this rule limits the parties in calling expert witnesses of their own selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VIII of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''hearsay'''&amp;mdash;the rule that a statement made out of court may not be admitted for its truth. Hearsay is a complicated rule fraught with exceptions, and hearsay issues are a common point of argument in the courtroom.

==Rule 801. Definitions==
:''The following definitions apply under this article:''

:'''''(a) Statement.''' A &quot;statement&quot; is (1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.''

:'''''(b) Declarant.''' A &quot;declarant&quot; is a person who makes a statement.''

===Rule 801(c). Hearsay===

:''&quot;Hearsay&quot; is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.''

Rule 801(c) defines hearsay, and also opens up the first &quot;hole&quot; in the rule: to be hearsay, a statement must be offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. '''An out of court statement can be admitted for any purpose other than showing that it is true, so long as that purpose is relevant''' and not barred by another rule of evidence.

This means that commands, questions, and other statements that do not assert anything as true can never be hearsay. Even a matter-of-fact statement can be admitted for purposes other than its truth. Some examples:

* '''Legal fact'''. An old man says &quot;I am the Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; If offered to show that the man is senile or otherwise mentally incompetent, the statement is not hearsay: it is being offered to prove a separate, relevant fact. The statement ''is'' hearsay if offered to show that the man is actually the Lord Jesus Christ. Statements of permission and consent are not hearsay to show permission or consent.
* '''Effect on the listener'''. A caller to 911 says &quot;Someone's breaking into a house on Elm Street!&quot; The statement is hearsay if offered to show that there was a break-in on Elm Street. It is not hearsay if offered to show why the police rushed to Elm Street.

===Rule 801(d). Statements which are not hearsay===

Rule 801(d) makes several types of out-of-court statements admissible for their truth. Rule 801(d)(1) focuses on the statements of witnesses; Rule 801(d)(2) focuses on the statements of parties, which are known as '''admissions'''.

:''A statement is not hearsay if--''

::'''''(1) Prior statement by witness.''' The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition, or (B) consistent with the declarant's testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive, or (C) one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person; or''

::'''''(2) Admission by party-opponent.''' The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party's own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity, or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth, or (C) a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, or (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).''

====Prior inconsistent statements====

Under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), '''prior inconsistent statements''' are not hearsay when the declarant testifies at the trial, is subject to cross-examination, and gave the prior statement under oath subject to perjury.

Prior inconsistent statements under this rule are a subset of prior inconsistent statements under [[../Witnesses#Rule 613. Prior Statements of Witnesses|Rule 613]]. Rule 613 allows all of a witness's prior inconsistent statements to be admitted for the sole purpose of ''impeachment'', or discrediting their testimony. But 613 statements are limited: they can only be used to impeach, and their existence cannot be proven with extrinsic evidence unless the declarant is given an opportunity to explain the discrepancy.

Once a statement qualifies under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), on the other hand, it can be used for any purpose for which it is relevant. The statement's existence can be proven with extrinsic evidence if the declarant denies having made the statement. The statement can also be admitted as ''substantive'' evidence of its truth. Where possible, lawyers usually attempt to admit prior inconsistent statements under 801(d)(1)(A), simply because of the greater leeway they have to use the statement.

====Prior consistent statements====

Under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), '''prior consistent statements''' are also not hearsay if the declarant testifies at the trial, is subject to cross-examination, and the statement is introduced to rebut a charge that the declarant fabricated their testimony or has an improper influence or motive.

====Statements of identification====
Rule 801(d)(1)(c) It's a statement that is not hearsay. It allows witness' previous identification of a defendant to be used as substantive evidence against defendant during trial.

====Party admissions====

Rule 801(d)(2) stands for the proposition that a party &quot;owns their words.&quot; Out-of-court statements by a party to a case are almost always admissible against that party, unless the statements are irrelevant or violate another rule of evidence.

==Rule 802. Hearsay Rule==

:''Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority or by Act of Congress.''

===Constitutional hearsay: ''Roberts'' and ''Crawford''===

Before continuing further, it is important to point out a further qualification to the hearsay rule. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that &quot;in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.&quot; This '''confrontation clause''' has been interpreted as a further restriction on the admissibility of statements by out-of-court declarants in criminal cases.

''Ohio v. Roberts'', 448 U.S. 56 (1980), established that a hearsay exception must meet one of two Constitutional standards: it must have been &quot;firmly rooted&quot; at the time the Sixth Amendment was written, or it must have &quot;particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.&quot;

''[[w:Crawford v. Washington|Crawford v. Washington]]'', 541 U.S. 36 (2004), established a rule that testimonial statements made out of court are inadmissible against a criminal defendant unless the defendant has an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Although the Supreme Court in ''Crawford'' did not give a clear definition of a testimonial statement, it can be understood as any statement which the declarant would understand would eventually be used in a courtroom. Examples of such statements probably include statements to police and official reports during a criminal investigation. Unless the defendant can (or could) cross-examine the declarant, the statement is inadmissible, ''even if'' it meets a hearsay exception under the Federal Rules.

==Rule 803. Hearsay Exceptions; Availability of Declarant Immaterial==
:''The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:''

Rule 801 establishes which statements are considered hearsay and which statements are not. Rules 803 and 804 deal with ''exceptions'' to the hearsay rule&amp;mdash;statements which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; hearsay, but are nevertheless admissible. The 803 exceptions are preferred to the 804 exceptions, as they generally carry greater credibility.

:'''''(1) Present sense impression.''' A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.''

A present sense impression can be thought of as a &quot;play by play.&quot; The witness makes the statement as the event is unfolding; the doctrine assumes that the witness does not have the time or the motivation to make up a story in such a situation. Calls to 911 are a good example of a present sense impression.

:'''''(2) Excited utterance.''' A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.''

An excited utterance may be made immediately after the startling event, or quite some time afterward. The key factor is that the declarant must still be under the stress of excitement. Cries for help to police are a good example of an excited utterance, although depending on their content, they may not be admissible against a criminal defendant under the &lt;em&gt;Crawford&lt;/em&gt; rule. 

:'''''(3) Then existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.''' A statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will.''

A statement of a then-existing condition must be &quot;self-directed&quot;: either describing what the declarant is feeling or what the declarant plans to do. The statement is only admissible to prove the declarant's condition: if others are included in the statement, the statement will not be admissible to prove anything related to the others.

:'''''(4) Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.''' Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.''

803(4) statements do not have to be made to medical professionals; the declarant may make the statement to any caretaker figure. A child's statement to a parent, or an elderly person's statement to the younger relative taking care of them, could both be 803(4) statements. They also do not need to be made to a ''treating'' physician; a statement to a doctor hired in preparation for litigation can still be admissible under 803(4). Evaluating an 803(4) statement requires both a subjective determination that the declarant was contemplating diagnosis or treatment, and an objective determination that the statement was pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

:'''''(5) Recorded recollection.''' A memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.''

Rule 803(5) is a close relative of Rule 612, discussed in the [[../Witnesses/]] chapter. If a witness cannot recall something when a document is shown to them to &quot;jog their memory&quot; under Rule 612, the content of the document can be directly introduced under Rule 803(5), so long as the witness can testify that they once had personal knowledge of its contents.

:'''''(6) Records of regularly conducted activity.'''  A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting certification, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The term &quot;business&quot; as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.''

:'''''(7) Absence of entry in records kept in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6).''' Evidence that a matter is not included in the memoranda reports, records, or data compilations, in any form, kept in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6), to prove the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of the matter, if the matter was of a kind of which a memorandum, report, record, or data compilation was regularly made and preserved, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.''

:'''''(8) Public records and reports.''' Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.''

:'''''(9) Records of vital statistics.''' Records or data compilations, in any form, of births, fetal deaths, deaths, or marriages, if the report thereof was made to a public office pursuant to requirements of law.''

:'''''(10) Absence of public record or entry.''' To prove the absence of a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was regularly made and preserved by a public office or agency, evidence in the form of a certification in accordance with rule 902, or testimony, that diligent search failed to disclose the record, report, statement, or data compilation, or entry.''

:'''''(11) Records of religious organizations.''' Statements of births, marriages, divorces, deaths, legitimacy, ancestry, relationship by blood or marriage, or other similar facts of personal or family history, contained in a regularly kept record of a religious organization.''

:'''''(12) Marriage, baptismal, and similar certificates.''' Statements of fact contained in a certificate that the maker performed a marriage or other ceremony or administered a sacrament, made by a clergyman, public official, or other person authorized by the rules or practices of a religious organization or by law to perform the act certified, and purporting to have been issued at the time of the act or within a reasonable time thereafter.''

:'''''(15) Statements in documents affecting an interest in property.'''

The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.''

:'''''(23) Judgment as to personal, family or general history, or boundaries.''' Judgments as proof of matters of personal, family or general history, or boundaries, essential to the judgment, if the same would be provable by evidence of reputation.''

==Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable==

:'''(a) Definition of unavailability.''' &quot;Unavailability as a witness&quot; includes situations in which the declarant--

::(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or

::(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of the court to do so; or

::(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or

::(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or

::(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant's attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant's attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.

:A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.

:'''(b) Hearsay exceptions.''' The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:

::'''(1) Former testimony.''' Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.

::'''(2) Statement under belief of impending death.''' In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made by a declarant while believing that the declarant's death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death.

::'''(3) Statement against interest.''' A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.

::'''(4) Statement of personal or family history.''' (A) A statement concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared.

::(5) [Transferred to Rule 807]

::'''(6) Forfeiture by wrongdoing.''' A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.

==Rule 805. Hearsay Within Hearsay==
:''Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.''

Rule 805 is also known as the &quot;food chain&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; rule. It is invoked when the declarant makes a statement to a third party, who then retells the statement to the reporter. There can be any number of intermediaries in the chain, so long as each statement between declarant and reporter corresponds to a hearsay exception.

For example, a patient complains to their doctor (803(4)), and the doctor writes down the complaint in a medical record (803(6)), which frightens a nurse and causes him to run to tell an orderly (803(2)), who writes another medical record (803(6)), which is introduced as evidence. Since each statement in the chain falls under a hearsay exception, the statement is admissible.

''If any one of the above links constituted inadmissible hearsay, the statement would be inadmissible.'' Each witness in the chain must also be competent, and each piece of physical evidence has to be authenticated.

==Rule 806. Attacking and Supporting Credibility of Declarant== 
:When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness. Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or explain. If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the declarant on the statement as if under cross-examination.

==Rule 807. Residual Exception==
:A statement not specifically covered by Rule 803 or 804 but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, is not excluded by the hearsay rule, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article IX of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''authentication''' and '''identification''' of evidence.

==Rule 901. Requirement of Authentication or Identification==
:'''''(a) General provision.''' The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.''

When a piece of physical evidence is presented in the courtroom, other evidence must often be presented to prove that the evidence is what it is claimed to be. Rule 901(b) provides an incomplete list of many ways to do this.

:'''''(b) Illustrations.''' By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:''

::'''''(1) Testimony of witness with knowledge.''' Testimony that a matter is what it is claimed to be.''

Such testimony can be very simple. &quot;I'm showing you what has been marked as Exhibit A. Do you recognize it?&quot; &quot;Yes. It's a picture of my cat. I can recognize the spot on her tail.&quot; Or it can be very complicated, depending on the nature of the evidence and the attitude of opposing counsel.

::'''''(2) Nonexpert opinion on handwriting.''' Nonexpert opinion as to the genuineness of handwriting, based upon familiarity not acquired for purposes of the litigation.''
::'''''(3) Comparison by trier or expert witness.''' Comparison by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which have been authenticated.''
::'''''(4) Distinctive characteristics and the like.''' Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.''

Although only Rule 901(b)(2) mentions handwriting specifically, handwriting can also be authenticated by comparison under Rule 901(b)(3), or by expert opinion under Rule 901(b)(4).

::'''''(5) Voice identification.''' Identification of a voice, whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.
::'''''(6) Telephone conversations.''' Telephone conversations, by evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if (A) in the case of a person, circumstances, including self-identification, show the person answering to be the one called, or (B) in the case of a business, the call was made to a place of business and the conversation related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
::'''''(7) Public records or reports.''' Evidence that a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recorded or filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where items of this nature are kept.
::'''''(8) Ancient documents or data compilation.''' Evidence that a document or data compilation, in any form, (A) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (B) was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be, and (C) has been in existence 20 years or more at the time it is offered.
::'''''(9) Process or system.''' Evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result.
::'''''(10) Methods provided by statute or rule.''' Any method of authentication or identification provided by Act of Congress or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.

==Rule 902. Self-authentication== 

:Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to the following:

::(1) Domestic public documents under seal. A document bearing a seal purporting to be that of the United States, or of any State, district, Commonwealth, territory, or insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or of a political subdivision, department, officer, or agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an attestation or execution.

::(2) Domestic public documents not under seal. A document purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1) hereof, having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.

::(3) Foreign public documents. A document purporting to be executed or attested in an official capacity by a person authorized by the laws of a foreign country to make the execution or attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (A) of the executing or attesting person, or (B) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the execution or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the execution or attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of official documents, the court may, for good cause shown, order that they be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification or permit them to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.

::(4) Certified copies of public records. A copy of an official record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office, including data compilations in any form, certified as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this rule or complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.

::(5) Official publications. Books, pamphlets, or other publications purporting to be issued by public authority.

::(6) Newspapers and periodicals. Printed materials purporting to be newspapers or periodicals.

::(7) Trade inscriptions and the like. Inscriptions, signs, tags, or labels purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating ownership, control, or origin.

::(8) Acknowledged documents. Documents accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment executed in the manner provided by law by a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments.

::(9) Commercial paper and related documents. Commercial paper, signatures thereon, and documents relating thereto to the extent provided by general commercial law.

::(10) Presumptions under Acts of Congress. Any signature, document, or other matter declared by Act of Congress to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.

::(11) Certified domestic records of regularly conducted activity.  The original or a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian  or other qualified person, in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, certifying that the record:

:::(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters;
:::(B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and
:::(C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.

::A party intending to offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.

::(12) Certified foreign records of regularly conducted activity.  In a civil case, the original or a duplicate of a foreign record of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration by its custodian  or other qualified person certifying that the record:

:::(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters;
:::(B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and
:::(C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.

::The declaration must be signed in a  manner that, if falsely made, would subject the maker to criminal penalty under the laws of the country where the declaration is signed. A party intending to offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.

==Rule 903. Subscribing Witness' Testimony Unnecessary==
:The testimony of a subscribing witness is not necessary to authenticate a writing unless required by the laws of the jurisdiction whose laws govern the validity of the writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article X of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''writings, recordings and photographs'''&amp;mdash;documentary evidence.

==Rule 1001. Definitions==
:For purposes of this article the following definitions are applicable:
:'''(1) Writings and recordings.''' &quot;Writings&quot; and &quot;recordings&quot; consist of letters, words, or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation.
:'''(2) Photographs.''' &quot;Photographs&quot; include still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes, and motion pictures.
:'''(3) Original.''' An &quot;original&quot; of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An &quot;original&quot; of a photograph includes the negative or any print therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an &quot;original&quot;.
:'''(4) Duplicate.''' A &quot;duplicate&quot; is a counterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical or electronic re-recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduces the original.

==Rule 1002. Requirement of Original==
:''To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by Act of Congress.''

Rule 1002 is commonly known as the '''original document rule''' or '''best evidence rule'''. It states that an original document should be produced in court when its terms are material to the argument&amp;mdash;when it is the &quot;best evidence&quot; available.

==Rule 1003. Admissibility of Duplicates== 
:A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.

==Rule 1004. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Contents==
:The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing, recording, or photograph is admissible if--

:'''(1) Originals lost or destroyed.''' All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith; or
:'''(2) Original not obtainable.''' No original can be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure; or
:'''(3) Original in possession of opponent.''' At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing; or
:'''(4) Collateral matters.''' The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.

==Rule 1005. Public Records==
:The contents of an official record, or of a document authorized to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in any form, if otherwise admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with rule 902 or testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If a copy which complies with the foregoing cannot be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given.

==Rule 1006. Summaries==
:The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court.

==Rule 1007. Testimony or Written Admission of Party== 
:Contents of writings, recordings, or photographs may be proved by the testimony or deposition of the party against whom offered or by that party's written admission, without accounting for the nonproduction of the original.

==Rule 1008. Functions of Court and Jury==
:When the admissibility of other evidence of contents of writings, recordings, or photographs under these rules depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the condition has been fulfilled is ordinarily for the court to determine in accordance with the provisions of rule 104. However, when an issue is raised (a) whether the asserted writing ever existed, or (b) whether another writing, recording, or photograph produced at the trial is the original, or (c) whether other evidence of contents correctly reflects the contents, the issue is for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact.

# Grind the spelt coarsely (if you have entire corns).
# Soak the spelt with oat flakes in some water, in order to get a viscous substance. The burgers will be more compact if you add more oat flakes. 
# Cut onions and leek in small pieces.
# Fry onions and leek with some oil.
# Mix the substance with onions, leek and spices of your choice (cumin is a good choice).
# Form flat burgers in a hot, oiled pan.

== Hints ==
* The burgers are also quite tasty when they are cold and on the next day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Automator is a powerful app for quickly accomplishing a set of repetitive or time-comsuming tasks. It allows the user to automate actions for other apps to take. The user does this by creating &quot;workflows,&quot; sets of commands for the automator to take.
[[Image:Apple_automator_.app_fullscreen_1.png|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1:The Automator interface]]
=When to Use Automator=
One should use Automator if one must accomplish a series of simple, repetitive tasks and UI (user interface) is not an issue. The Automator should generally be used only for very simple actions, for creating a complicated workflow can take longer than the time saved.
=Creating a Workflow=
To create a workflow, simply drag the desired actions from the left pane to the central one. One will notice that the inputs and outputs of each action link. These show where information flows from one action to the next. This can be turned off by clicking on the input then clicking &quot;Ignore results from previous action.&quot;
[[Image:Apple automator app closeup run.png|frame|right|200px|Fig 2:The &quot;run&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; buttons, located in the upper-righthand corner of the main Automator window (see Fig 1).]]
=Using a Workflow=
After a workflow has been created, it can be run by clicking the &quot;run&quot; button in the &lt;!--Can someone please correct the hyphen?--&gt;upper-right hand corner. The workflow will then execute all specified actions. A workflow can be canceled at any time by clicking &quot;stop&quot; (next to &quot;run&quot;)
=List of Actions=
This section lists all actions that can be taken by Automator. They are grouped by application of origin, as they are in Automator.

[[Image:Tiger DVD Player Window.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 1 - DVD Player playing a movie.]]
Soon after audio CDs and CD-ROM discs took the world by a storm, the world's largest technology corporations began work on next-generation discs capable of holding over eight times as much information as their predeccessors. Two rival disc types were developed, but the companies producing them agreed to merge them together into one unified format: the DVD.

While everyone knew from the start that DVD-ROM discs would catch on for storing computer data, the primary use of this breakthrough storage technology would be storing video. And unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you'll know that the DVD disc has completely replaced the VHS tape, which is often no longer sold in stores.

The most popular place to play a video DVD will probably always be in a standalone DVD player plugged into a TV. However, every Mac that Apple has shipped this decade includes a built-in DVD Player for convenience. Simply insert a video DVD into your disc drive, and watch as its icon appears on your desktop. But if you double-click this icon, you're greeted by a confusing mess of unusable files containing the movie. 

To navigate this mess of files, you need Apple's DVD Player application. It's easy enough to find; it's in your applications folder along with every other app you have in your collection. In fact, since there's not much you can do with a video DVD without DVD Player, &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;your Mac will automatically open DVD Player when you insert a video DVD (assuming you haven't adjusted the settings in the CDs &amp; DVDs pane of System Preferences)&lt;/font&gt;.


{{Mac Note Box|If your Mac came with an Apple Remote, you have a second way to play a DVD: with Apple's Front Row feature. Please refer to the wikibook [[iLife]] for information on Front Row and how to use its DVD Player.}}

=Playing a DVD=
When DVD Player loads, the movie should begin to play automatically. Most movies start by displaying a menu with options. Each DVD has a different menu, and menus can vary dramatically in appearance and layout.

=Region Codes=
[[Image:DVD-Regions with key.png|830px|thumb|center|Fig. 2 - A map of DVD regions.]]
If you are ever confronted by a dialog box asking you about changing a region code, then you've just had an encounter with one of the big movie studios' favorite tricks for regulating how their content is distributed. What exactly ''are'' these region codes, you ask?

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Region codes are embedded into every DVD player, and some (but not all) DVD discs.&lt;/font&gt; In general, big-budget movies are more likely to contain a region code than smaller, less professional productions. The specific code inside is different depending on the country in which the player or disc was purchased. For example, american DVDs and DVD players have the code &quot;1&quot; embedded in them. DVD players are programmed to refuse discs with different codes. British DVDs (which contain the code &quot;2&quot;) '''do not play''' in american DVD players (which contain the code &quot;1&quot;).

Here's a simple scenario that shows why movie studios use region codes. Let's say that an english movie studio has just finished running its latest movie in theaters. The movie was a hit, so now they want to show it overseas in american theaters. Meanwhile, they also want to release it on DVD in England around the same time.

Without region codes, retailers in England would immediately export the DVD version to America, and people in America would be able to buy the movie on DVD while it was still in theaters. But since region codes exist, the british DVDs would contain the code &quot;2&quot;, and american DVD players couldn't play them.

Problem solved for the movie studio, and extra hassle created for the consumer.

The DVD Player application is just a standalone DVD player in software form, so it adheres to the same rules. However, the DVD Player app comes without a region code set. The region code is automatically set when you first insert a region-protected DVD. That is, if the first DVD you play contains the code &quot;1&quot;, then the DVD Player application turns into a Region-1 DVD player. But what if you move? Yes, you can change the region code. This takes us full circle to the dialog box asking about the region code.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;If you ever insert a DVD with a different region code than the DVD Player application, you get a dialog box asking if you'd like to change DVD Player's region code to match the DVD. However, you can only do this five times.&lt;/font&gt; Sorry, but it's how things work! If you choose not to change the code, then you will not be able to play the DVD. It is not reccomended that you change the region code just to watch one DVD and then change it back - the five changes allowed will go by very quickly this way.

To see which DVD region you live in, please refer to the map in figure 2. Region 7 has been reserved for future use, and Region 8 is for airplanes and cruise ships.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maintaining a strong back will reduce pain and injury to people with back problems

Exercises should have the tingling sensation of a stretch, but shooting or painful burning indicate that you should stop the exercise. While a personal trainer is useful, it is good enough if you use common sense and exercise with a friend. A personal trainer is not a doctor, if you hurt yourself, the personal trainer cannot snap you back into place. They will do exactly what an exercise partner or friend would do, call for help. But these exercises are not dangerous, and if you mind your conditions and be cautious, they are completely safe.

==Exercise One==

Get on your hands and knees. Now, lift your right arm and your left leg. Straighten them up in the air. Hold for 2 seconds or as long as you are comfortable holding. Get back on all fours, then lift your left arm and your right leg. Repeat this process always using opposite sides of legs and arms. If you are tense, you might not be able to completely extend your leg or arm, in this case do not push it, just go as far as you comfortably can and repeat the exercise. Over many repetitions over several days, you should be able to get closer to extending those arms and legs straight.
Also, do not forget to breathe. Either because of the difficulty of the activity, or because of the percieved difficulty of it, some people hold their breath, sometimes out of a habit of holding breath or not breathing naturally when exercising. In general, it is a good idea to breathe through your nose if you can. This will be less tiring than breathing through your mouth. 

If you like, you can do this exercise on top of a towel, or a stiff foam mat. It is important not to do exercises like this on a bed or other springy, non solid surface. But it can irritate your knees to be on all fours, so you can do this exercise on a blanket, towel or camping mat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Characteristics==
Egyptian deities are often portrayed as having animal heads in art; as an example, Anubis is often portrayed in statuary as having the body of a human, but the head of a canine. Many gods were portrayed with different animal heads, depending upon the situation. The Egyptians did not actually believe that most of their gods had animal heads; rather, they portrayed them that way as artistic symbolism. This may have been for the benefit of the illiterate.

==Descriptions and Unique Traits==

[[File:Anubis_standing.jpg | thumb | left | 80px |  | Anubis]]; Anubis : God of Embalming, Friend of the Dead, originally god of the dead 

: '''Details : ''' The son of Ra and Hathor, Anubis was the first god of the underworld. He was most often portrayed as a man with the head of a jackal but sometimes appeared as fully human or jackal. In later mythology he was replaced as king of the dead by Osiris. Instead he became the gatekeeper to the underworld and protector of souls. One of Anubis's duties was to weigh the heart of the dead against the feather of Ma'at. If the heart weighed the same as the feather, the person being subjected to the test would enter the Field of Reeds, and could enjoy the afterlife. If not they would suffer destruction, and would not exist.

; Neith : goddess of war, then great mother goddess 
; Nephthys : mother of Anubis

; Osiris : god of the underworld, fertility and agricultural, maternal brother of Anubis 
: '''Details : ''' Osiris was the second king of the underworld and one of the four children of the earth (Geb) and the sky (Nuit), and was the husband of Isis, who represented life. As god of the dead, Babi, the god who devoured unworthy souls, was described as his first-born son.In art, since he was representative of death, Osiris was usually depicted as a mummified man, with a beard, and, as ruler of the underworld, was also given the symbols of kingship - the crown, flail, and crozier. Usually, he also was depicted as having green skin, a reference to rotting flesh, and thus to death.

; Ptah : a creator deity 
: '''Details : ''' Ptah, in Egyptian mythology (specifically Memphite), is the creator god. He existed before time was time and began the world. His creation of the world was seen as procreative, although he initially existed alone. Due to this fact, his hand was assigned feminine qualities, and was in itself worshipped as a goddess. Ptah was the patron deity of craftsmen, as everything he created was created by his mind alone.

; Ra : the sun, possible father of Anubis 
: '''Details : ''' For much of Egyptian history, Ra was the chief of gods. He controlled day and night, the passage of time, and the continual cycle of death and rebirth. However, his appearance as the sun god was just one of his many aspects. He was worshipped as a creator, as an ancestor to the pharaohs, and as many other things. He was also called amun ra.

; Sekhmet : goddess of war and battles 

; Sobek : Crocodile God 
: '''Details : ''' In Egyptian mythology, Sobek was the crocodile-god who symbolized the fertility of the Nile River. He was also the god of pharaohs and leaders and so was viewed as immensely powerful.

; Set : God of Storms, possible father of Anubis, later became god of evil 
: '''Details : ''' As the god of the desert, Set was associated with sandstorms, and desert caravans. Due to the extreme hostility of the desert environment, Set was viewed as immensely powerful, and was consequently regarded from time to time as the chief god. In art, Set was mostly depicted as a mysterious and unknown creature, referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal, with a curved snout, square ears, forked tail, and canine body, or sometimes as a human with only the head of the Set animal. It has no complete resemblence to any known creature, although it does resemble a composite of an aardvark, and a jackal, both of which are desert creatures.

; Taweret : Goddess of pregnant children and protector at childbirth 
; Tefnut : goddess of order, justice, time, Heaven and Hell and weather 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;G26-t:Z4&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
; Thoth : god of the moon, drawing, writing, geometry, wisdom, medicine, music, astronomy, and magic 
: '''Details : ''' Thoth is the Egyptian God of the moon and Wisdom. He is credited in ancient egyptian mythology as the creator of writing and the scribe of the gods.

; Wepwawet : a wolf deity, worshipped in Lycopolis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Back to [[US Corporate Law]])

This chapter introduces the subject of corporate law.

==What is a corporation?==

A corporation is an entity created by people as a method to pool capital and socialize liability. This text focuses on '''business corporations''', which are created for profit. A corporation can also be created for other reasons. Many churches and charities are established as non profit corporations. Many government entities take a corporate form. Whatever its purpose, a corporation has several unique features under the law.

# '''Individuality'''. Corporations are legal entities. They can theoretically last forever: some corporations have been in continuous operation for hundreds of years. A corporation is also treated like an artificial person for many (but not all) legal purposes. It can enter into contracts under its own name, it can sue or be sued, and it has many of the same constitutional rights enjoyed by '''natural persons'''.
# '''Separation of ownership and control'''. A corporation used to be owned by '''shareholders''', but, as it increased in size and shareholders became dispersed at the turn of the 20th century, it became controlled by a '''board of directors'''. While shareholders vote on the board of directors, in practice, board members are selected by other board members who then manage the corporation.  The board has a fiduciary duty to the corporation as a whole, not just shareholders. Shareholders can also freely transfer their interest in the corporation, which is known as '''stock'''.
# '''Limited liability'''. Under normal circumstances, shareholders cannot lose any more than the amount of their investment in the corporation. If creditors demand more than the corporation can pay, the shareholders' personal assets are usually safe.

==Corporations versus other business entities==

While corporations are perhaps the archetype of a business entity, they are by no means the only way to form a business. The choice to form a corporation is not always an easy one.

===Sole Proprietorship===

Rather than start a corporation, an entrepreneur can go into business under their own name as a '''sole proprietor'''. This has the advantage of simplicity: there is no need to file paperwork with the government or hold meetings and elections, all of which must take place in a corporation.

A sole proprietor, however, is &quot;one with their business.&quot; Their profits and losses are treated as personal income on their taxes. If they accumulate business debts, creditors can go after their personal assets. If a sole proprietor dies, their business is treated like any other personal asset, and ends up in the hands of whomever they will it to. Most importantly, a sole proprietorship is just one person: if more than one person wants to start a business, they need a more complex form.

===Partnership===

The '''partnership''' is the most basic form of collaborative business. Like a sole proprietorship, it has the advantage of simplicity.

Two or more people can start a business with no special formalities, and their business will be treated as a '''general partnership'''. They directly control the partnership and can make binding decisions with a simple majority vote. Assets of the business will be listed in their names individually, and the partners will jointly be liable for any debts incurred by the partnership. The partners are also entitled to take home any profits made by the partnership. They are taxed individually on their share of the partnership's profits, regardless of whether they keep these profits or reinvest: the partnership is not taxed separately, which offers a huge advantage over corporate taxation.

'''Limited partnerships''' (LPs) allow individuals to invest as &quot;limited partners,&quot; which gives them the limited liability of shareholders at the expense of relinquishing their right to participate in management of the partnership. A partnership can also file with the state to be treated as a '''limited liability partnership''' (LLP), which offers some of the limited liability benefits of a corporation. A few states allow the general partners in an LP to file for LLP status, creating a '''limited liability limited partnership''' (LLLP), but such organizations are still rare. (See, e.g., [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0620/SEC1102.HTM&amp;Title=-%3E2005-%3ECh0620-%3ESection%201102#0620.1102 Fla. Stat. § 620.1102(10)], [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+50-73.78 Va. Code § 50-73.78].)

Regardless of type, all partnerships are considered to be an aggregate of their partners, rather than a separate entity. Unlike corporations, in which stock can be freely traded (assuming a willing buyer), a partner involved in the management of the partnership can only transfer their interest with the consent of the other partners. If the mutual consent to form a partnership breaks down, the partnership breaks down as well. This means that partnerships do not last as long as corporations, and the form is unsuited for larger businesses, especially those that wish to take advantage of public equity markets, like stock markets, to seek new investors.

===Limited liability companies===
A Limited Liability company (LLC), or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), is an entity that limits liability to its owners. In this way, it is similar to a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, an LLC is not subject to double-taxation. In this way, an LLC is similar to a partnership or an S-Corporation. An LLC differs from a partnership in that it continues to exist if one of the owners dies. An LLC differs from an S-Corporation in that it does not require that profits be paid evenly to share holders.

==History of corporate law==

:''This section incorporates text from Wikipedia, &quot;[[w:Corporation|Corporation]].&quot;''

Early corporations of the commercial sort were formed under frameworks set up by governments of states to undertake tasks which appeared too risky or too expensive for individuals or governments to embark upon. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the Stora Kopparberg mining community in Falun, Sweden, reportedly obtained a charter from King Magnus Eriksson in 1347. Many European nations chartered corporations to lead colonial ventures, such as the Dutch East India Company, and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of corporate colonialism.

In the United States, government chartering began to fall out of vogue in the mid-1800s. Corporate law at the time was very restrictive and very closely regulated by the states. Forming a corporation usually required an act of legislature. Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance, and the corporation's activities were tightly restricted to its express purposes. Many private firms in the 19th century avoided the corporate model for these reasons (Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership, and John D. Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a trust).

Eventually, state governments began to realize the economic value of providing more permissive corporate laws. New Jersey was the first state to adopt an &quot;enabling&quot; corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state. Delaware followed, and soon became known as the most corporation-friendly state in the country; even today, most major public corporations are set up under Delaware law.

The 20th century saw a proliferation of enabling law across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. After World War II, and especially starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward privatization, the selling of publicly-owned services and enterprises to private, normally corporate, ownership. Deregulation - reducing the public-interest regulation of corporate activity - often accompanied privatization as part of an ideologically laissez-faire policy. Another major postwar shift was toward conglomerates, in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base. Japanese firms developed a horizontal conglomeration model, the keiretsu, which was later duplicated in other countries as well. 

While corporate efficiency (and profitability) skyrocketed, small shareholder control was diminished and directors of corporations assumed greater control over business, contributing in part to the hostile takeover movement of the 1980s and the accounting scandals that brought down Enron and WorldCom following the turn of the century.

==Sources of corporate law==
===State statute===
Most corporate law comes from state statutes. Under the '''internal affairs doctrine''', every corporation is internally governed by the law of the state in which it is '''incorporated''', or formed. As a result, many larger corporations are incorporated in states that are known for having a business-friendly corporate legal structure. The state best known for this is '''Delaware''', which houses more than half of the Fortune 500: Delaware is known for having a favorable franchise fee structure and highly specialized courts (one court, the '''Court of Chancery''', deals primarily with corporate issues). Smaller corporations usually find it advantageous to incorporate in the state where they do most of their business.

State statutes are all subtly different, but many follow the structure of the '''Model Business Corporation Act''', a &quot;model statute&quot; drafted by the American Bar Association. The MBCA is associated with smaller states which might not have the time or the motive to develop their own corporate statutes. Larger, more economically important states, like New York and California, have more unique corporate statutes, incorporating rules from many sources. The '''Delaware General Corporation Law''' is the most important statute because of the number of corporations it governs. Most American lawyers study the MBCA and DGCL in law school, and this text will focus on the provisions of those two statutes.

===Federal statute===
State laws govern the mechanics of corporations, but many federal laws are applicable to corporations as well. Publicly-traded corporations must comply with federal securities laws, the most important of which are the '''[http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/33act/index1933.shtml Securities Act of 1933]''' (1933 Act) and '''[http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/34act/index1934.shtml Securities Exchange Act of 1934]''' (1934 Act). The '''[http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/SOact/toc.html Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]''' (SOXA) imposed many new rules on public corporations. Corporations must also comply with the wide variety of federal laws governing employment, environmental protection, food and drug regulation, intellectual property and other areas.

===Common law===
Much of corporate law comes from common law - the judge-made law based on tradition, which governs where statutes are silent. Common law principles of agency, contracts and torts are all important in the corporate context.

The common law of corporate governance has not been the subject of a Restatement, but the American Law Institute has compiled a set of suggested rules called the ''ALI Principles of Corporate Governance''.

===Internal law===
Corporations also make their own internal laws. They chiefly do this through two documents: the '''articles of incorporation''' and the '''bylaws'''.

Articles of incorporation can be thought of as the &quot;constitution&quot; of a corporation. The articles, sometimes known as the '''charter''' or '''certificate of incorporation''' depending on the state, contain a few provisions required by statute, such as the name of the corporation and the location of its registered agent, as well as other provisions that regulate the corporation's affairs. The articles of incorporation bind the board of directors and can only be altered with the approval of the shareholders.

Bylaws are &quot;statutes&quot; written by the board of directors and can usually be amended by the board of directors without first obtaining shareholder approval. The bylaws generally establish internal rules for the governance of the corporation, such as officer positions and meeting procedures.

The articles of incorporation must comply with the statute under which the corporation is incorporated, and the bylaws must comply with the articles of incorporation as well as the statute.

The accumulator is a temporary storage space for arithmetic operations. Without it, the result of every operation would have to be written to main memory, and then read back into the ALU, which is very slow. For example, to add up a list of numbers, they are loaded one by one from main memory and added into the accumulator. The final answer is then copied back to main memory.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Back to [[US Corporate Law]])

Forming a corporation is generally considered a simple matter, however if it is done incorrectly this can have severe consequences for all involved. Many corporations are formed with the help of a lawyer (or several) - usually through a service company or directly through a business entity service company. The actual process of forming a corporation is usually a matter of filling in a few blanks on a form, but the process can sometimes be complex depending on what the persons or entities incorporating wish to accomplish. ''For example, some jurisdictions have statutes that grant liability protection to the officers and directors but these statutes need to be specifically invoked before they apply to the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] and this is not always available on a generic form provided by the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] filing agency in the jurisdiction where one is incorporating.''


Chapter 2 of the MBCA and Subchapter I of the DGCL outline how a corporation is formed. There are three main steps in the process:

# An '''incorporator''' files '''articles of incorporation''' with the '''secretary of state''''s office. (Note that although the filing office in most United States jurisdictions for corporate filings is the Secretary of State, many United States jurisdictions use other agencies. [[Wikipedia:Alaska|Alaska]], for instance, uses the [http://www.dced.state.ak.us/ Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development] and [[Wikipedia:Michigan|Michigan]] accepts new corporate filings through the [http://www.michigan.gov/cis/ Department of Labor &amp; Economic Growth].)
# The corporation holds an '''organizational meeting''' to select a '''board of directors'''.
# The board of directors meets to adopt '''bylaws''', appoint '''officers''', and other tasks.


==Considerations when incorporating==

All of these things should be considered when choosing what entity type to use, what jurisdiction to incorporate in and how the articles should be drafted - or if a stock form should even be used. This is why this is a process and decision generally considered best left to an attorney or service company specializing in such matters - just as you would likely have a dentist to pull a tooth even though this is also considered a simple matter. ''Note that some jurisdictions require by statute that an official state form be used when filing a [[Wikipedia:Business Entity|business entity]], additional provisions can generally be attached.''

* The laws of the individual state where the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] is to be filed
* Whether or not the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] may be ever conducting business in other jurisdictions
* The [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] type
* The business entity's projected revenue
* The business entity's number of shareholders
* The likelihood that the business entity will be sued (in the case of a high-risk business).
* Other variables

==Articles of incorporation==

The articles of incorporation can be very minimal. Many states provide a one or two-page form for the articles of incorporation: the incorporator can simply fill out the form, provide the filing fee, and their corporation will be chartered. MBCA § 2.02 only requires four elements:

# corporate name
# number of authorized shares
# name and address of the corporation’s [[Wikipedia:Registered Agent|registered agent]]
# name and address of each incorporator

[http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102] also requires:

# a statement of the &quot;nature of the business&quot; of the corporation ''(Note that most jurisdictions allow the articles to simply state &quot;Any Legal Purpose&quot; or a variation of this statement).''
# the par value of each share, or a statement that all shares are to be without par value (see the chapter on Securities)
# name and address of each director, if the incorporator's duties are to end upon filing

===Corporate name===

Under MBCA § 4.01, a corporate name must include the word “corporation,” “incorporated,” “company,” or “limited,” or an abbreviation or foreign equivalent thereof. [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102] allows the corporation to choose a number of other signifying terms, including &quot;association,&quot; &quot;society,&quot; and &quot;syndicate.&quot; The point of this rule is to place other parties on notice that they are dealing with a limited liability entity.

===Authorized shares===

===The registered agent===
The [[Wikipedia:Registered Agent|registered agent]] (AKA &quot;RA&quot;, [[Wikipedia:resident agent|&quot;Resident Agent&quot;]] or [[Wikipedia:Statutory Agent|&quot;Statutory Agent&quot;]]) is a person or company designated to receive [[Wikipedia:service of process|service of process]] within the state of incorporation.  (Service of process is the act of serving a defendant with court papers in the event of a lawsuit.) The registered agent must provide a physical address to which a process server may personally go to deliver the complaint. Some states require that the registered agent accept his or her appointment by signature, other states do not. The state Articles of Incorporation form will indicate whether the registered agent's signature is required.

Most commonly, a registered agent service company is the designated registered agent. In some cases, the entity's attorney is the designated registered agent. If there is no attorney, the entrepreneur him or herself may be the registered agent, however there are numerous very good reasons for the entrepreneur to NOT serve as the registered agent.

===The incorporator===
Traditionally, corporations had to have three individual incorporators, who had to meet a number of legal requirements, such as being residents of the state of incorporation. Nowadays, one is the norm. The incorporator is usually inconsequential to the company they incorporate. An incorporator might be a lawyer, a secretary, a bicycle messenger, or any other competent adult; other corporations are also allowed to be incorporators in many jurisdictions. Besides having to sign the articles, an incorporator may also (depending on local law):

*Receive the corporate charter in the mail from the secretary of state
*Call the first meeting of the board of directors
*Dissolve the corporation before the board meets
*Amend the articles of incorporation before the board meets

===Purposes and the ''ultra vires'' doctrine===

Traditionally, corporations had to list their purposes in the articles of incorporation. Some states, such as Delaware, retain this requirement, but those states which have such a requirement are very lax about it: the corporation can be formed for &quot;any and all lawful purposes,&quot; or list a few primary purposes with the &quot;any and all&quot; clause tacked on the end. Before this was legally possible, corporate lawyers would load up articles of incorporation with every conceivable purpose for a corporation up to mining cheese on the moon.

''Ultra vires'', Latin for &quot;beyond the powers,&quot; is a legal doctrine stating that corporations cannot act beyond the purposes for which they were incorporated. Many English common law courts applied a dramatic form of ultra vires: any such act of a corporation was legally void. Other courts applied an estoppel theory to force corporations to follow their contracts even if the deal was ultra vires: this is the approach taken by MBCA § 3.04, which provides that &quot;the validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the  ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.&quot; Compare [http://www.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/ez-nylaw?BSC+203 NYBCL § 203].

Although ultra vires is rare due to the lack of fixed corporate purposes, the issue still comes up in states that restrict the powers of corporations by statute. In some jurisdictions, for instance, corporations cannot enter partnerships or make contributions to a non-profit organization. The MBCA comments suggest that ultra vires can be applied:

*When the corporation or its shareholders sue former directors, to recover damages
*When shareholders sue directors to get an injunction against an ultra vires act
*When the state's attorney general wants to dissolve the corporation

===The birth of the corporation===

While rules vary from place to place, the usual law is that the existence of the corporation begins at the time the articles are filed, even though they have not been reviewed or accepted by the government at that point. This means that a corporation can begin operations while its articles are pending approval. If something goes wrong during this period and the articles are later rejected by the state, the corporation's limited liability generally protects the shareholders and directors, so long as they were acting in good faith.

On the other hand, if they knew the corporation was invalid to begin with, they can be personally liable for anything the corporation does during its period of presumptive validity.

'''Securities''' represent a financial interest in a corporation.

==Equity vs. debt financing==

Generally, a corporation receives capital in exchange for '''equity''' securities or '''debt''' securities or a combination of the two. Equity securities are also known as '''stock'''. Debt securities are commonly known as '''bonds''': although they are formally divided into '''bonds''' and '''debentures''', the word &quot;bond&quot; is often used to refer to both.

A bond evidences a loan to the company, rather than a share of the company's equity. The money or other consideration received in exchange for a bond becomes both an asset and a liability to the company. In contrast, the consideration received for stock becomes an asset of the company without becoming a liability; it adds to the company's equity (the difference between assets and liabilities).

==Bonds and debentures==
Life is full of surprises, and even more so when it comes to finances. A person having a good income today may face financial crisis in future. To avoid these unforeseen financial crises everyone invests in different instruments that can fetch extra income. There are many options available in the market that can be classified as risky and non risky. It is very well understood that risky options yield higher gains but non risky ones can give very low returns. Debentures and bonds are two such options that can be taken for good returns on ones investment. Debenture is an instrument issued by a company that can be convertible or non convertible into equities. Bonds are issued by companies or by government and can be seen as a loan taken by them to meet their financial needs. These two instruments are basically loan taken from the investor but have very different repayment conditions.

Debentures

Debentures are issued by a company to raise short to medium term loan needed for expenses or for expansions. Just like equities these can be transferred to anyone, but does not give right of voting in the company’s general meetings. Debentures are simply loans taken by the companies and do not provide the ownership in the company. These are unsecured loans as company is not bound to return the principal amount on the maturity. Debentures are of two types convertible and nonconvertible. The convertible debentures are the ones that can be converted into equity shares at a later time. This convertibility provides attraction to the investor but yield lower interest rates. Non convertible debentures does not convert into equity shares thus can yield a higher interest rate.

Bonds

Bonds are actual contract notes issued by the borrower to pay interest at regular intervals and return the principal on the maturity of the bond. These bonds are issued by the companies for their expenses and future expansions. The bonds are also issued by the government for its expenses. A bond is seen as loan taken by a borrower from the investor so unlike equity share it does not give stake in the company but he is seen as a lender. These bonds are redeemed at a definite time. These are secured loans and can yield low to medium interest rate.

Difference between bonds and debentures

Both bonds and debentures are instruments available to a company to raise money from the public. This is the similarity between the two, but on closer inspection, we find that there are many glaring differences between the two.

Bonds are more secure than debentures. As a debenture holder, you provide unsecured loan to the company. It carries a higher rate of interest as the company does not give any collateral to you for your money. For this reason bond holders receive a lower rate of interest but are more secure.

If there is any bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first and the liability towards debenture holders is less.

Debenture holders get periodical interest on their money and upon completion of the term they get their principal amount back.

Bond holders do not receive periodical payments. Rather, they get principal plus interest accrued upon the completion of the term. They are much more secure than debentures and are issued mostly by government firms.

In Brief: 

• Bonds are more secure than debentures, but the rate of interest is lower

• Debentures are unsecured loans but carries a higher rate of interest

• In bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first, but liability towards debenture holders is less

• Debenture holders get periodical interest

• Bond holders receive accrued payment upon completion of the term

• Bonds are more secure as they are mostly issued by government firms

==Stock==

Holders of stock have two key rights: '''voting rights''' and '''residual rights'''. Voting rights enable stockholders to elect the board of directors and approve or reject certain fundamental transactions. Residual rights allow the stockholders to share the company's profits, as well as recover some of the company's assets in the event that it folds, although they generally have the lowest priority in recovering their investment.

===Types of stock===

====Common and preferred stock====

By default, stock in a corporation is '''common stock'''. Common stock is generally accompanied by a voting right and residual right proportional to the number of shares held in the corporation. If a corporation only offers common stock, an owner of 25 percent of the common stock would control 25 percent of shareholder votes, receive 25 percent of any dividend payout and be entitled to 25 percent of any post-liquidation assets after creditors are paid in full.

Stock can also be designated as '''preferred stock''', which gives it a higher level of residual rights. Generally, common stockholders cannot be paid until preferred stockholders are paid. Preferred stock often, but not always, comes with restricted voting rights, or sometimes with no voting rights at all. It is commonly used by investors such as venture capitalists who wish to invest in new companies but also seek to minimize risk.

Preferred stock can be designated as '''convertible''', meaning that it can be converted into common stock at a certain time or times (e.g. at the holder's option). This gives the preferred stockholder the ability to exercise more control over the business later in exchange for giving up their dividend and liquidation preference. Common stock can also be convertible into preferred stock, although such cases are rare.

====Classes of stock====

The articles of incorporation may also designate various '''classes''' (or '''series''') of stock. Generally, this is done to apportion voting rights and liquidation preferences between various types of investor.

For instance, in a small company, the founders may have Class A common stock, one group of investors may have Class B preferred stock, and another group may have Class C preferred stock. Class A stock may be allotted a certain number of seats on the board so that the founders always have the power to remain on the board. Class B and Class C stock can be given separate allotments of board seats as the shareholders agree, and can be given different levels of liquidation and dividend preference as the shareholders agree.

===Par value and legal capital===

A simple way to define par value is as the &quot;face value&quot; of each share. This is a misleading definition, though: if you buy a share of stock for $75, its par value could theoretically be just about anything. If it has a par value at all, the value is probably low, maybe $1. In most cases, the par value will be completely irrelevant to the shareholder.

Par value comes from an era when small corporations were the norm. Three people might have gotten together and agreed to contribute $10 apiece to form a corporation. When the articles of incorporation were drawn up, the number of shares and par value of each share would be included. For three people investing $10 each, the corporation might issue three shares with a par value of $10, six shares with a par value of $5, or thirty shares with a par value of $1. Whichever numbers its owners chose would be recorded in the articles.

In the beginning, the promoter of a corporation (i.e. the person soliciting investments) would almost always set a fixed ratio between amount invested and number of shares received in exchange for that investment. Par value turned this into an absolute legal requirement. There were several reasons to do this: for one, it ensured that shareholders received equal treatment, as they would get equity and dividend rights proportional to their investment.

The '''legal capital''' (also called '''stated capital''' and '''paid-in capital''') of the corporation would be determined by multiplying par value by the number of shares issued. Lenders were theoretically supposed to use this figure to know how much the corporation was worth at its outset. In practice, this didn't work. Some people learned to contribute property to a new corporation in return for stock at an inflated par value. On the balance sheet, the property would be the corporation's only capital, and because legal capital was fixed, the value of the property would magically go up. While the promoter had $10,000 in stock, the corporation might only have $5,000 worth of assets, but would still be worth $10,000 on paper.

Stocks sold at inflated par values were called '''watered stock''', because the assets of the corporation were &quot;watered down&quot; to increase the apparent value of the stock. Holders of watered stock could be in trouble if a creditor foreclosed on the corporation's assets. If they had received $10,000 in stock for a $5,000 capital contribution, they would not only lose their $5,000 investment but would also be personally liable for the additional $5,000, whether they were the aforementioned promoter lying about the value of their contribution, or an innocent investor relying on par value to gauge the true value of the corporation.

Because par value was such an unreliable indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high par values could create liability for investors if the corporation went belly up, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low par values. The legal capital of the corporation would still be determined based on par value, but the balance sheet would include the investment over par value as a capital surplus, and everything would still balance. In 1915, New York got wise and authorized corporations to issue &quot;no par stock&quot; with no par value at all, in which case the board of directors would allocate the incoming capital between stated capital and capital surplus.

Thanks in large part to a proliferation of low par and no par stock, watered stock is less of an issue these days. The last major American court case dealing with watered stock was in 1956. (Most corporate statutes also provide that the board of directors exercises conclusive judgment of the value of any property it exchanges for stock, as long as the directors do so in good faith; watered stock still comes up in the context of fraud, though.)

In most places, par value is optional. Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102(a)(4)], a corporation can choose between par or no par stock, but must make the election in the articles of incorporation. MBCA § 2.02 does not mandate par value, but allows corporations to voluntarily place par value on their stock. For lawyers, one of the most important considerations surrounding par value is: &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; States often charge a franchise fee for corporations based upon the par value of the outstanding stock, with no par stock given an arbitrary par value for purposes of the calculation.

===Distributions===

A '''distribution''' is a transfer of the corporation's wealth to its shareholders. There are two types of distribution: '''dividends''' and '''stock repurchases'''. From the corporation's standpoint, the two transactions are very similar: they both involve a payment from corporate funds to the shareholders.

====In par value states====

Under par value regimes, distributions can only be made from the &quot;surplus&quot; of the corporation. The exact definition of &quot;surplus&quot; varies from place to place, but Delaware defines it as the assets that exceed the legal capital of the corporation—the aggregate par value of its shares. This means that in such states, creditors can only rely upon recovering a fraction of the corporation's assets: the rest are free to be distributed to shareholders at any time.

A few other states impose a further restriction: that distributions have to come from earned surplus, the money that comes from corporate profits. This means that companies cannot pay dividends that would bring their assets below the amount of paid-in capital, the total amount that has been directly paid in by shareholders since the company's incorporation.

====Under the MBCA====

The Official Comments to the MBCA suggest that a corporation must meet two tests before it makes a distribution. These are:

*'''Equity insolvency test''' - After the distribution, the corporation must be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business.
*'''Balance sheet test''' - After the distribution, the corporation's total assets must be greater than or equal to its liabilities plus the amount needed to buy out all of the holders of preferred stock.

Some states have adopted these tests verbatim. Others have gone further: in California, for instance, the balance sheet test under [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=3555011204+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve CCC § 500] requires the corporation to have assets greater than 125% of its liabilities after the distribution.

Compliance with these rules falls upon the directors themselves. If they break the rules, they can be individually liable to the company's creditors. The Official Comments indicate that the decision to make a distribution should be treated as any other business decision, and therefore should be subject to the business judgment rule. This means that as long as the directors make the decision in good faith, on an informed basis, and absent a conflict of interest, they will usually be safe.

==Securities in public corporations==
Publicly-traded corporations are subject to a number of additional regulatory regimes, most of them federal:

*'''Securities Act of 1933''' - Regulates the public issuance of securities.
*'''Securities Exchange Act of 1934''' - Regulates the public trading of securities.
*'''Glass-Steagall Act of 1933''' and '''Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 2000''' - Bar banks from dealing in corporate securities;
*'''Investment Advisers Act of 1940''' - Regulates professional investment advisors with more than $25 million in managed assets.
*'''Investment Company Act of 1940''' - Regulates securities investment companies respectively. Many investment-related companies fall under these acts, even those engaging in the trade of &quot;securities&quot; not defined as such under the Securities and Securities Exchange Acts. The main target of these laws is mutual funds and similar companies. Foreign investment companies may not publicly offer in the US without making ICA registrations first.
*'''Commodity Exchange Act''' - Covers trading in all types of futures contracts, expansively defined. Forward contracts and derivatives are not included, but many securities-based futures contracts are.
*'''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002''' (&quot;Sarbanes-Oxley&quot; or &quot;SOXA&quot;) - Adds additional rules to prevent fraud and unfair advantage.
*Rules of the '''Securities and Exchange Commission''' (SEC) passed under the above laws.

In addition, most public corporations must follow the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) or whichever entity is responsible for listing their securities. These exchanges are known as '''self-regulatory organizations''' (SROs), as they can regulate listed companies independently of the federal government.

===Securities Act of 1933===

The Securities Act of 1933 (also known as the '33 Act) is essentially a consumer protection law for &quot;retail&quot; investors (i.e. not money managers, foundations, pensions, etc.)  Its objectives are to provide investors with material financial and other corporate information about issuers of public securities (i.e. stocks and bonds), and to prevent fraud in the offering of such securities. 

Many transactions are exempt from regulation under the Securities Act. [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/sec4.html Section 4] of the Act limits its application to '''public offerings''' (according to SEC guidelines, more than 25 offerees) by '''issuers''' and their '''underwriters''' (i.e. investment banks). This means that the Act primarily applies to companies offering securities to the public, and ''not'' to transactions between investors or to sales of stock to small groups of investors (i.e. private placements.)

For public offerings, the main requirement of the Securities Act is '''registration'''. An issuer must prepare an extensive statement describing the securities to be offered and detailing the nature of the issuer's business. Once this statement is registered with and approved by the SEC, its data and forecasts are placed in a '''prospectus''' for potential investors. Any offering of the securities by the issuer or underwriter must thereafter be accompanied by the prospectus.

===Securities Exchange Act of 1934===

While the Securities Act is very limited in scope, the Securities Exchange Act (also known as the Exchange Act or 1934 Act) is much broader. It regulates stock exchanges, brokers, dealers, and even private traders.

===SEC Rule 10b-5===

One of the most important provisions in securities law is '''Rule 10b-5''', a general provision against fraud:

:It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange, 

::a. To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,

::b. To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or

::c. To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, 

:in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

The rule, along with [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec10.html Section 10(b)] of the Exchange Act, is used to punish a variety of activities, most notably '''insider trading'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Back to [[US Corporate Law]])

Control over a corporation is vested in a '''board of directors'''. The board of directors have great leeway to operate the corporation as they see fit, but they owe duties to shareholders, and often to others as well.

==The board==

===Board meetings===

The '''meeting rule''' states that directors cannot act unless they meet as a board. See ''Baldwin v. Canfield'', 1 N.W. 261 (Minn. 1879) (board members each individually signed a deed on behalf of the corporation; transfer deemed invalid because board never met). There are legal ways for boards to act without actually meeting, but the general rule is that they must meet if possible.

Although the prototypical board meeting takes place in a &quot;board room,&quot; hidden away inside a skyscraper, board meetings can take place anywhere and at any time. Under MBCA § 8.20 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(i)], the entire board does not even have to physically meet: a meeting can take place by teleconference or any other method in which the directors can simultaneously hear each other. This permissive rule has caused some courts to take a harder line against board action without a meeting, on the grounds that boards ''should'' be able to meet in just about any situation.

====Notice====
MBCA § 8.22 provides that notice is not necessary for regular board meetings, and that special meetings may be called on two days' notice. The DGCL contains no provisions for statutory notice. The articles or bylaws may fix a different notice requirement. If the board acts at a meeting held without the required notice, the action is invalid. See ''Schmidt v. Farm Credit Svcs.'', 977 F.2d 511 (10th Cir. 1992).

====Quorum====

A quorum must be present at the meeting in order for the board's action to be legally effective. The statutory quorum is a majority of the total number of directors, but can be increased or reduced to as low as one-third under MBCA § 8.24 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(b)].

====Voting====

Each director has one vote, and the majority of the quorum rules. Directors may not vote by proxy; they must be &quot;present&quot; (i.e. communicating) at the meeting. See MBCA § 8.24; ''Lippman v. Kehoe Stenograph Co.'', 95 A. 895 (Del. Ch. 1910).

===Board decisions without a meeting===

====Written consent====

Under MBCA § 8.21 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(f)], a board may act by unanimous written consent without a meeting. The idea behind this rule is that forcing unanimous consent ensures that opposing argument will not be silenced during the decision-making process: if a director opposes the action, they can force a meeting by refusing to sign the consent.

====Emergency powers====

If a quick decision is necessary to prevent great harm or take advantage of great opportunity, and a quorum of the board cannot be assembled in time, the directors who are available may make the decision.

====Shareholder consensus====

If the shareholders meet and reach a unanimous agreement, that agreement can bind the corporation. See ''In re Kartub'', 152 N.Y.S.2d 34 (Sup. Ct. 1956).

====Majority approval====

If a majority of directors owning a majority of the corporation's stock reach an agreement, that agreement can bind the corporation. See ''Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Rock Creek Mining Co.'', 449 F.2d 664 (9th Cir. 1971).

==Duties of directors==
Directors' duties are primarily a matter of common law. The DGCL does not address directors' duties at all. MBCA § 8.31 codifies a simplified version of the common law '''business judgment rule'''.

===Business judgment rule===

The business judgment rule is a safe harbor for directors. A director's decision is not subject to review in court so long as it is made in good faith, on an informed basis, and in the best interest of the corporation (i.e. absent a conflict of interest). So long as the director's decision is mere &quot;business judgment,&quot; they will not be personally liable for it.

In ''Shlensky v. Wrigley'', 237 N.E.2d 776 (Ill. App. 1968), a shareholder of the Chicago Cubs' holding company attempted to sue Cubs president Philip Wrigley. At the time, the Cubs were the only Major League Baseball team that didn't have lighting at its home field, Wrigley Field. The court refused to force Wrigley to install lights for night games, stating that &quot;there must be fraud or a breach of good faith which directors are bound to exercise... in order to justify the courts entering into the internal affairs of corporations.&quot;

The business judgment rule has been set aside when directors approve a criminal act in the interest of maximizing profit. See ''Roth v. Robertson'', 118 N.Y.S. 351 (Sup. Ct. 1909) (&quot;strict accountability&quot; for director who paid &quot;hush money&quot; to individuals claiming illegal operation of business); ''Miller v. AT&amp;T Co.'', 507 F.2d 759 (3d Cir. 1974) (directors not insulated from liability on ground that illegal campaign contribution was made in exercise of business judgment).

===Duty of loyalty===

Directors are required to deal fairly in any transaction that creates a conflict of interest, such as when the corporation is dealing with the director himself, or another corporation upon whose board the director sits. Directors cannot take personal windfalls from corporate transactions, and if they run a business that competes with the corporation, they must do so in good faith. They cannot use corporate assets for their personal business.

===Duty of care===

===Duty of oversight===

====Business activities====
A director cannot be a &quot;dummy&quot; on the board. Each director has a duty to attend meetings on a regular basis and to keep track of what is happening in the corporation, including its financial status. Directors who do not fulfill this duty breach their fiduciary duty to the shareholders, and potentially to others; see ''Francis v. United Jersey Bank'', 432 A.2d 814 (N.J. 1981) (holding negligent director of reinsurance broker liable to clients).

====Legal compliance====

Some courts have held that a director need only investigate possible criminal misconduct within the corporation if a &quot;red flag&quot; comes up to alert them to the problem. See ''Graham v. Allis-Chambers Mfg. Co.'', 188 A.2d 125 (Del. 1963).

Others have held that the board must have a reasonable information gathering process in place to monitor the corporation's compliance with the law. See ''In re Caremark Intl., Inc.'', 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996).

===Duty to become informed===

Somewhat more problematic than the duty of oversight is the '''duty to become informed'''. Many courts have imposed a duty upon directors to actively seek information on any major transaction. One of the most controversial cases regarding the duty to become informed is ''[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Smith_v._Van_Gorkom Smith v. Van Gorkom]'', 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985), described below.

====The Trans Union case====

Van Gorkom was chairman and CEO of the Trans Union Corporation, which made much of its revenue from leasing out railway cars. Due to tax issues, Trans Union needed to boost its revenues in order to stay competitive. In September of 1980, Van Gorkom sat down with a friend, Pritzker, who specialized in corporate takeovers. He proposed a sale of Trans Union to Pritzker at $55 a share, and Pritzker accepted this offer a couple of days later. They worked out a deal over the next couple of days in which Trans Union's shareholders would receive $55 cash for each of their shares, and Pritzker would have the option to buy one million shares of Trans Union's unissued treasury stock at $38 per share, 75 cents above market price. Pritzker demanded a response from the board by September 21, just three days away.

On September 20, Van Gorkom called a senior management meeting. Almost all of the other managers thought the idea was ridiculous. The CFO objected to the $55 per share price and to the option to buy treasury shares. Immediately after the management meeting, Van Gorkom summoned the board. He outlined the deal to them without handing over the actual agreement. He brought in a lawyer from an outside firm, who instructed the board that they might face a lawsuit if they didn't take the offer; after all, it was for a shareholder meeting to decide. The CFO told the board that $55 was &quot;at the beginning of the range&quot; of a fair price. The board approved the merger offer after two hours, on the condition that Trans Union would be able to accept any better offer brought within the next 90 days. Van Gorkom signed the merger agreement that night at a party. Neither he nor any members of the board had actually read it.

After the deal was made public on September 22, many officers threatened to resign. Van Gorkom quieted them down by negotiating amendments that would allow Trans Union to solicit other bids through its investment banker, Salomon Brothers. The board approved these amendments on October 8. Two other offers came in, but neither could be completed within the 90-day window. On December 19, a derivative suit was filed. The Delaware Supreme Court overturned the Court of Chancery's ruling for defendants, stating that:

:Under the business judgment rule there is no protection for directors who have made &quot;an unintelligent or unadvised judgment.&quot; A director's duty to inform himself in preparation for a decision derives from the fiduciary capacity in which he serves the corporation and its stockholders. Since a director is vested with the responsibility for the management of the affairs of the corporation, he must execute that duty with the recognition that he acts on behalf of others. Such obligation does not tolerate faithlessness or self-dealing. But fulfillment of the fiduciary function requires more than the mere absence of bad faith or fraud. Representation of the financial interests of others imposes on a director an affirmative duty to protect those interests and to proceed with a critical eye in assessing information of the type and under the circumstances present here. Thus, a director's duty to exercise an informed business judgment is in the nature of a duty of care, as distinguished from a duty of loyalty.

:...In the specific context of a proposed merger of domestic corporations, a director has a duty under (the law), along with his fellow directors, to act in an informed and deliberate manner in determining whether to approve an agreement of merger before submitting the proposal to the stockholders. Certainly in the merger context, a director may not abdicate that duty by leaving to the shareholders alone the decision to approve or disapprove the agreement. Only an agreement of merger satisfying the requirements of (the law) may be submitted to the shareholders.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court of Chancery with instructions to determine the fair market value of the plaintiffs' shares in Trans Union, and award damages to the extent that the fair value exceeded $55 per share. Before this could happen, the directors agreed to settle the claim for $23.5 million, $10 million of which was paid from liability insurance taken out by the directors, and the remaining $13.5 million paid by Pritzker.

Chicago school academics were up in arms over the case. How could directors be liable for approving a deal where shareholders got a 50% premium over the market price of their stock? And what business did the court have second-guessing the directors' judgment? Ira Millstein contended that &quot;99% of boards didn't think that anything wrong had happened. Most everybody wrote about the decision as 'the Delaware courts are going nuts.'&quot;

On the other hand, the decision put board members on notice that they had to be careful not to rush to judgment, especially in deals where there's a lot of money involved. Millstein again: &quot;If you went into a board room before Van Gorkom and tried to talk about legal obligations, they'd say 'We have more important things to do...' When it came down, you were able to walk into a boardroom for the first time and really be heard.&quot;

==Shareholder governance==

===Powers of shareholders===

Shareholders have limited powers over the corporation. The only powers they generally exercise are the powers to elect directors, approve amendments to the articles of incorporation and approve &quot;fundamental transactions.&quot; Some states grant shareholders additional powers, such as approval of &quot;gifts&quot; from corporate funds, and the power to enact bylaws.

====Removal of directors====

Shareholders have an inherent power to remove directors for cause. They must serve specific charges on the director and provide adequate notice and a full opportunity to meet the accusation. See ''Auer v. Dressel'', 118 N.E.2d 590 (N.Y. 1954); ''Campbell v. Loew's, Inc.'', 134 A.2d 852 (Del. Ch. 1957).

[http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(k)] allows a majority vote of shareholders to remove directors with or without cause, unless the corporation has opted for a staggered board or cumulative voting.

====Amendment of the articles of incorporation and bylaws====

Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc08/index.htm#P21_1808 DGCL § 242] and MBCA § 10.03, shareholders must approve any substantive amendments to the articles of incorporation, but such amendments must be proposed by the board first. The board may make minor amendments and corrections to the articles without shareholder approval.

In Oklahoma, which has a statute similar to the DGCL, shareholders have the power to amend the bylaws. ''Intl. Brotherhood of Teamsters Gen. Fund v. Fleming Cos.'', 975 P.2d 907 (Okla. 1999). Delaware has not made a conclusive ruling on this issue, but ruled that a bylaw depriving the board of its inherent power is legally invalid in ''Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. v. Shapiro'', 721 A.2d 1281 (Del. 1998), leading many to believe that shareholder-originated bylaws may not pass under Delaware law.

====Approval of fundamental transactions====

Shareholders have the statutory power to approve '''fundamental transactions'''&amp;mdash;those which fundamentally change the nature of the corporation. The three basic types of fundamental transaction are '''dissolution,'''  '''merger''' and '''sale of substantially all assets'''.

=====Dissolution=====

=====Merger=====

=====Sale of substantially all assets=====

Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc10/index.htm#P11_143 DGCL § 271(a)], shareholders must approve any sale of &quot;all or substantially all&quot; of the corporation's assets. &quot;Substantially all&quot; was defined by the Court of Chancery in ''Gimbel v. Signal Cos., Inc.'', 316 A.2d 599 (1974):

:If the sale is of assets quantitatively vital to the operation of the corporation and is out of the ordinary and substantially affects the existence and purpose of the corporation, then it is beyond the power of the Board of Directors.

====Right of inspection====

===Shareholder meetings===

The shareholders of a corporation generally exercise their limited powers of control at a '''shareholder meeting'''. There are two kinds of shareholder meetings: the '''annual meeting''' usually happens once a year, and a '''special meeting''' may be called for particular purposes from time to time.

The board of directors has great control over shareholder meetings. The actual date for the annual meeting is fixed in the bylaws of the corporation: since the bylaws are written by the board, the board picks when and where the meeting takes place.

There are some legal restrictions on the board in this respect. Under MBCA § 7.03(a), if the board does not call an annual meeting within 15 months of the last one, any shareholder can force the company to call a meeting. The board also has to send written notice of each shareholder meeting to every shareholder, usually between 10 and 60 days before the meeting.

Special meetings can be called by the board, or by any other party named in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Many statutes also allow shareholders to call special meetings, but they have to have a certain percentage of the stock in order to do so: 10 percent under MBCA § 7.02(a). [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc07/index.htm#P11_141 DGCL § 211(d)] does not allow shareholders to call a meeting unless authorized by the articles. (Delaware makes up for this by making it comparatively easy for shareholders to vote in writing without a meeting: see below.)

There has to be a quorum at the meeting for its actions to be effective. The quorum is usually a majority unless the articles of incorporation state otherwise. Some corporations might have a quorum of one-third or two-thirds.

The actual voting can be very complicated. In corporations with more than one class of stock, each class votes separately, and the approval of every class might be required to pass a measure. Many states practice a further convolution: cumulative voting, where a holder of more than one share can &quot;spread their votes&quot; across multiple choices.

The only thing that has to be discussed at an annual meeting is the election of directors.

====Proxies and proxy statements====

In larger corporations, shareholders usually don't attend the meetings: instead, they get a form in the mail which authorizes a proxy to vote on their behalf.

===Shareholder action outside meetings===

Most states allow shareholders to act by &quot;written consent&quot; without calling a meeting. Under MBCA § 7.04(a), every shareholder entitled to vote must give their consent. [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc07/index.htm#P231_45170 DGCL § 228] is more liberal: a simple majority of shareholders entitled to vote can give their written consent.

==Transfer of control==

==Derivative litigation==


==Shareholder liability: piercing the corporate veil==

'''Piercing the corporate veil''' is a metaphor for ignoring the limited liability of a corporation. When a corporate veil is pierced, the corporation's creditors can go after the assets of its shareholders.

There are no hard and fast rules for determining when the corporate veil should be pierced. The determination is left largely to the determination of judges, who look at the totality of the circumstances to make their ruling, and choose to pierce the veil if it's necessary to prevent fraud or achieve equity.

===Undercapitalization===

===Equitable ownership===

===Alter ego doctrine===

===Enterprise entity doctrine===

===Misrepresentation===

===Piercing other entities===

Limited liability companies are similar enough to corporations that many courts have been willing to pierce their veils as well. Piercing a limited liability partnership has been more problematic. Partners in LLPs are generally liable for any torts they commit. The tougher issue involves huge LLPs, like accounting firms, and whether the assets of partners can be used to satisfy the demands of the many people claiming against the firm. The ongoing litigation against Arthur Andersen and other big LLPs may shed more light on this issue in the near future.

==Officer positions==

Neither the MBCA nor the DGCL mandates any specific officer positions. Traditionally, there were four officers in every corporation: the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. Under most traditional statutes, one person could hold more than one of these positions, with the caveat that the president and secretary must be different people. A few jurisdictions allowed all four positions to be held by one person.

*The president is the person given general supervision and control over the corporation's daily affairs. They are responsible for signing contracts and other documents on behalf of the corporation. The president is often, but not always, chairman of the board as well.
*The vice president takes over for the president if the president is unavailable. There can be more than one vice president: they take priority in an order the corporation designates, or lacking such an order, in the order in which they were appointed.
*The secretary is responsible for corporate documents, such as minutes from the board meetings and annual shareholder meetings, and contact records for each shareholder. They also co-sign certain documents, such as stock certificates, with the president.
*The treasurer is in charge of the corporation's finances.

Most small corporations still use the traditional job descriptions. Most big corporations, on the other hand, use &quot;C level&quot; designations: the president becomes a CEO, or chief executive officer; the treasurer becomes a CFO, or chief financial officer, and so on. Many companies have scores of vice presidents, sometimes in several tiers: senior vice president, executive vice president, and so on.

==Authority of managers==

==Executive compensation==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Fate of Our Solar System==

Just as the Solar System relies on the Sun as its source of energy, so too is its fate linked to that of the Sun.

The Sun is right now a middle-aged star. It has existed for about 5 billion years, and will go on shining, pretty much unchanged, for about another 5 billion more. At that time, it will go through major changes that will bring an end to the Solar System as we know it. To understand these changes, we must first understand where the Sun's energy comes from.

==The Power of Fusion==

Like all stars, the Sun is made mostly of hydrogen. This is the simplest of all atoms. Because the Sun is so large and its gravity is so strong, the hydrogen atoms near the center of the Sun - at its core - are under extreme pressure, and are squeezed very close together. Sometimes, four of these atoms are squeezed so tightly together that they collide with enough force to stick together permanently, forming a new, larger, and more complex atom: helium. This process is called '''nuclear fusion''', and when it happens, a small amount of energy is released in the form of heat and light. Due to the massive size of the sun, those small amounts of energy add up to an enormous amount and nuclear fusion is what powers the Sun. (The energy output at the sun's core per cubic meter is about the same as common reptiles, so it IS size that matters here!)

==Out of Gas==

Eventually, the Sun will burn all of the hydrogen in its core, and the fusion will stop. Once this happens, the core will shrink under its own gravity, until it becomes so dense that the helium atoms will begin to collide to form carbon (from three helium atoms) and oxygen (from four helium atoms). These collisions produce much more energy than the hydrogen fusion that powers the Sun today.

The extra energy will cause big changes in the Sun. The core will become much hotter, causing the Sun to swell to over one hundred times its present size, swallowing up the planets Mercury and Venus. Even though the core will be hotter, the surface will be cooler than it is today, changing in color from yellow to red. A star at this stage is called a '''red giant'''.

What about here on Earth? When the Sun expands, the Earth will not be spared. Like Mercury and Venus, Earth will probably be absorbed by the expanding Sun. But even if it is not, it will be no place to live. The oceans will boil, and the atmosphere will be blown away. What is left will be a charred, barren cinder, unable to sustain life.

==An Unstable Ending==

[[Image:M57 The Ring Nebula.JPG|right|thumb|320px|A Planetary Nebula]]Meanwhile, the helium-burning reaction in the Sun will produce '''solar wind''' much stronger than it is today. As it leaves the Sun's surface, it will carry with it some of the hydrogen in its outermost layers, forming a '''planetary nebula'''.

As more matter is carried away from the Sun, the solar wind will continue to strengthen. Eventually, it will blow away so much of the Sun's matter that there will no longer be enough pressure at the core to keep the helium fusion going. At that point, what's left of the Sun will contract under its own gravity, becoming a much smaller, very dense star called a '''white dwarf'''. The white dwarf will radiate off heat that is left over from the earlier nuclear fusion, but it will no longer generate any new energy. 

==A New Beginning==

But will this really be the end? As bleak as this future might sound, there is a silver lining. All of that matter blown away from the Solar System during will eventually be compressed again by gravity, along with the remains of other long-gone stars, into a cloud of gas and dust much like the one that gave birth to our Solar System. In this cloud, many new stars will form with planets of their own, and just possibly, some of these planets may one day produce living beings who will look at the sky and wonder: where did we come from?

}}

== Overview ==

'''''Fleur Isabelle Delacour''''' was once a student at the French magical school, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons Academy]]. She was chosen to be her school's Champion in the Triwizard Tournament that was held at Hogwarts in book 4. A stunningly beautiful witch, she has wavy silver-blonde hair that seems to float behind her as she walks. Many males seem unnaturally attracted to her. 

Fleur's rosewood wand is among the few seen in the series that was crafted by someone other than Mr. Ollivander. Its core contains a Veela hair.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Fleur Delacour enters our story as the students from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] arrive to take part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. She visits the Gryffindor table that first evening to ask for bouillabaisse, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is stunned by her beauty. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] seems somewhat nettled by this, Ron suggests that there might be some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] in her ancestry. 

The next evening, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|the Goblet of Fire]] selected her to participate in the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts, competing against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]. She is openly contemptuous of Harry being selected, saying that &quot;'E cannot compete. 'E is too young!&quot; She is, however, overruled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]]'s interpretation of the rule book.

At the Weighing of the Wands, it is revealed by Mr. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] that Fleur's wand has, as its core, the hair of a Veela. Fleur says that it is her grandmother's, confirming Ron's earlier belief that she has Veela ancestors.

Although the First Task was intended to be a surprise, Fleur Delacour was forewarned of its nature by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Olympe Maxime]], headmistress of Beauxbatons, who discovered what was coming when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] allowed her to see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]]. Fleur's first task was to seize a golden egg from the nest of a mother Welsh Green dragon. She attempted to put it in a trance, but her plan backfired when the dragon snored, lighting her skirt on fire and forcing her to put out the flame with a jet of water from her wand. She did however, manage to collect the egg.

As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] approaches, Ron, desperate, asks Fleur to the ball; she does not even deign to notice him. Utterly crushed, he retreats to the Gryffindor common room. Harry reveals Fleur's Veela ancestry to him at this point, but he is so defeated that he does not seem to notice. At the Ball, Ron spends some time hiding from Fleur; he is so embarrassed that he does not even want to be seen by her. Fleur, however, is keeping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]] entranced, and again does not seem to notice him.

In the Second Task, Fleur had to rescue her sister from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|merpeople]] at the bottom of the lake at Hogwarts. She used an excellent Bubble-Head Charm, giving her a supply of air, but she was attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grindylow|grindylows]] and was forced to forfeit. She earned twenty-five points. Like Harry, she had thought that the song of the merpeople was to be meant literally and was afraid that her sister, Gabrielle, would die or be kept underwater forever. So when Harry brought Gabrielle to the surface, Fleur was overjoyed, and ended up kissing him on both cheeks, twice, which left Harry feeling rather as if there was steam coming out his ears. Ron got kissed also, for helping, and seemed extremely pleased about it.

Being in last place, Fleur was the last to enter the obstacle course/maze of the Third Challenge, which was full of enchantments to break and magical creatures to fight. She lost her chance to reach the Triwizard Cup when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] to force Victor Krum to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] her.

As the Beauxbatons carriage is prepared for departure, Fleur comes up to Harry and Ron on the steps at Hogwarts to say goodbye. Ron becomes somewhat tongue-tied when she approaches, which seems to vex Hermione.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Fleur is largely off-stage here, although it is mentioned that she has stayed in England to &quot;eemprove 'er Eenglish&quot;, tutored by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill_Weasley|Bill Weasley]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In the Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that Fleur will marry Ron's brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]]. The other characters dislike this, mostly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who refers to her as 'Phlegm'. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], though, is delighted at this news; he seems to still secretly have a bit of a crush on her.

When Bill is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 29|attacked]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and is disfigured, Mrs. Weasley laments that he won't be getting married now. Fleur passionately declares that she loves Bill and will marry him despite his disfigurement and that the scars will just show that her husband is brave. This statement seems to change Mrs. Weasley's feelings for Fleur and she even offers to persuade her great aunt to lend Fleur a goblin-made tiara for the wedding.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

The plan to extract Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']] involves multiple simulacra of Harry, each one traveling to a separate safe house, each with a protector. One of the mock Harrys is Fleur, who will be traveling on a broomstick with Bill as her protector. They are the last pair to arrive at The Burrow, as they were apparently detained by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]], and missed the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that would have brought them to the Weasleys'.

At The Burrow, Harry finds himself in the midst of the chaos that is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]'s preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding, set for the first of August. While both Bill and Fleur are present, and are occasionally being set tasks to assist in the preparations, we see very little of them until two days before the wedding, when Fleur's parents and sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] arrive. It is mentioned then that Gabrielle is following Fleur around.

As Fleur walks up the aisle at the wedding, she is radiantly beautiful; and the radiance seems to make her attendants, Gabrielle and Ginny, especially beautiful as well. And they are wed, and they dance, and everyone dances... and then the Trio must make a hasty exit.

When Ron rejoins the Trio after Christmas, it turns out that he had been staying with Bill and Fleur at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]. He does not say much about what had been going on there.

When the Trio escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], they end up going to Shell Cottage. Fleur is present at the burial ceremony for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. Then, Fleur takes care of the wounded, specifically [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]]. She is not terribly happy about caring for Griphook, as she feels that he is treating her as a servant in her own home.

Fleur is part of the celebration that ensues when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] arrives to report that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] has had her baby.

A month or so later, Bill and Fleur are among the people who arrive at Hogwarts for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at the school]]. They are still in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrives; the ensuing awkward moment, as Percy has been estranged from the rest of his family for years, is somewhat defused by Fleur, who asks Lupin how their child is doing. Lupin, in response, produces a photo, which he drops when Percy loudly proclaims his stupidity and begs forgiveness.

While we don't see much of them in the battle, we do see the entire Weasley family after the battle; and in the epilogue we hear mention of Victoire, who we assume to be Bill and Fleur's daughter.

== Strengths ==

By being selected as Beauxbatons' Tri-wizard Champion alone, we can assume that Fleur Delacour was a reasonably talented student. Not only does she have this advantage over others at Beauxbatons, but, being part-Veela, she has a charm that brings many men to their knees. As Fleur's younger sister is chosen as the person Fleur will miss the most it could be said she is family oriented; particularly as she is greatly relieved when Harry rescues her sister.

== Weaknesses ==

Fleur appears standoffish during Goblet of Fire, she makes underhand comments about the food at Hogwarts. Fleur comes across as a cold character.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Ron Weasley accidentally asks Fleur to attend the Yule Ball with him; she ignores him. Harry suggests that this because she has turned on the charm to try to ensnare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]], and Ron had been caught in the flux of her spell. Fleur attends the Yule Ball with Roger Davies of Ravenclaw. Fleur is attracted to Bill Weasley and in Half Blood Prince it is announced they are to marry. Fleur has a younger sister Gabrielle who the Merpeople choose as the thing she will miss the most during the 2nd Triwizard Test. Hermione, Ginny, and (initially) Mrs. Weasley all dislike Fleur.

Fleur, because of her Veela background, will tend to have some of the glamour of the Veela, and so will be extremely attractive to almost all males. Presumably, she will have learned that the only way to cut down on the number of admirers is to appear cold, to not be open to approach. This will make her seem aloof and uncaring, and yet she will still leave a trail of attracted men (and boys) behind her. This is bound to incite jealousy in other women, and it is likely this that we see in Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley.
