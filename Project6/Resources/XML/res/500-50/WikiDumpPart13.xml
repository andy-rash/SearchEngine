Taco is an American food, more specifically a Tex-Mex border food. If we are going to call this a Mexican recipie we should at least have the decency to call it Tortilla (the Mexican word/food most analagous to the American concept of a &quot;soft taco&quot;).

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian Cuisines]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese Cuisine]]

Properly known as &quot;Jiaozi&quot;, is a popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] restaurant fare, the '''[[Cookbook:Potsticker|potsticker]]''' ('''鍋貼'''), although derived from a Chinese recipe, is more closely associated with the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] Gyôza or Pan-Fried Dumpling. Its contrast between filling and crispy exterior is a very pleasing sensation and, like many dishes, it can be melded to incorporate almost any flavour.

==Ingredients==

*1 package of at least 50 [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrappers]] (See '''Note''' below)
*1/4 to 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (1/10 to 1/2 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] (1/2 pound of pork per ~50 dumplings)
Optionally:

''The following amounts are approximate ranges for each 1/2 pound of pork. The first amount listed is the recommended amount and the second amount given is the recommended maximum or minimum. Of course any of the below may be omitted.'':

*prepared [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] (1 to 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]) {15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] to 2 mL}
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] (1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]]) {15 mL to 30 mL}
*[[Cookbook:Onion|green onions/spring onion]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] or other [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] (1 or 2 tablespoon {15 mL to 30 mL} each, diced) 
*Anything you like, as you like it. Pork plays well with others. Just keep in mind that a filling that is too wet may expand too much during cooking and cause the dumpling to split open, while a filling that is too dry will become drier during cooking. Any filling should easily maintain its shape if moulded into small balls.

==Procedure==

The best way to combine any additives with the pork for the filling is to simply throw everything in a bowl and mix with your (clean!) hands. When your filling is ready get out your skins (wonton wrappers), cover them with a damp tea-towel or paper towel to prevent them from drying out and begin filling. Each dumpling should hold about 1/2 - 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] of filling. Packaged skins should have sealing instructions. One sealing method is to wet two edges of a square (or one half of a circle) with water and fold over so that the dry edges meet the wet, pressing around the filling to ensure that all of the air has been removed from the dumpling then crimping the edges to ensure a tight seal. When your dumplings are all filled they can be frozen on a sheet pan then placed in plastic bags and kept frozen for up to six months.

==Cooking==

#Heat a heavy pan (NOT A NON-STICK SURFACE!) over medium to medium high heat.
#Brush lightly with vegetable oil.
#Add 8 to 10 dumplings, making sure not to crowd the pan.
#Let these dumplings cook without touching them for at least two minutes. They will sizzle and pop but do not touch them until they have stuck to the pan (usually about two minutes).
#When they have browned on the bottom (watch the edges near where the dumpling touches the pan) check for sticking.
#When the dumplings have stuck pour on 1/3 cup of stock, broth or water (about a 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch deep in the pan) and clamp on a tight lid.
#Cook until all the liquid has been converted to steam (once again, usually about two minutes. This is one of the more difficult parts of this process. You may have to adjust the amount of liquid used based on the liquid and your pan)
#Carefully remove the dumplings from the pan. Serve while hot.

==Dipping Sauces==
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (mix to taste)
*[[Cookbook:Black Bean Paste|black bean paste]]
*[[Cookbook:Peanut_Sauce|peanut sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Plum Sauce|plum sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] with some [[Cookbook:Saki|rice wine]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*Anything you can imagine. Look Beyond The Recipe!

==Note==

On Gyôza Skins: The primary difference between packaged gyôza skins and packaged wonton skins is shape (round for gyôza skins, square for wonton skins) this is a matter of preference, if both are available try both and decide which you prefer. You can also make these skins yourself but it is a time-consuming process and the dough has to be rolled quite thin (it is almost translucent) and in the end unless you're the Iron Chef of gyôza cookery it won't make much difference.

That said, here's a recipe for [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton skins]]

Ada [[Wikipedia:Compiler|compilers]] are available from several vendors, on a variety of host and target platforms. The [http://www.adaic.com Ada Resource Association] maintains a [http://www.adaic.com/compilers/comp-tool.html list of available compilers].

Below is an alphabetical list of available compilers with additional comments.

== AdaMULTI from Green Hills Software ==

Green Hills Software sells development environments for multiple languages and multiple targets (including [[w:Digital signal processor|DSP]]s), primarily to embedded software developers.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

GHS claims to make great efforts to ensure that their compilers produce the most efficient code and often cites the [http://www.eembc.com EEMBC] benchmark results as evidence, since many of the results published by chip manufacturers use GHS compilers to show their silicon in the best light, although these benchmarks are not Ada specific.

GHS has no publicly announced plans to support the two most recent Ada standards (2005 and 2012) but they do continue to actively market and develop their existing Ada products.

== DEC Ada from HP ==

DEC Ada is an Ada&amp;nbsp;83 compiler for [[w:OpenVMS|OpenVMS]]. While “DEC Ada” is probably the name most users know, the compiler is now called “[http://h71000.www7.hp.com/commercial/ada/ada_index.html HP Ada]”. It had  previously been known also by names of &quot;VAX Ada&quot; and &quot;Compaq Ada&quot;.

== GNAT, the GNU Ada Compiler from AdaCore and the Free Software Foundation ==

[[Wikipedia:GNAT|GNAT]] is the free GNU Ada compiler, which is part of the [[Wikipedia:GNU_Compiler_Collection|GNU Compiler Collection]]. It is the only Ada compiler that supports all of the optional annexes of the language standard.  The original authors formed the company [http://www.adacore.com AdaCore] to offer professional support, consulting, training and custom development services.  It is thus possible to obtain GNAT from many different sources, detailed below.

GNAT is always licensed under the terms of the [[Wikipedia:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]].

However, the run-time library uses either the [[Wikipedia:GNU General Public License|GPL]], or the [[Wikipedia:GNAT Modified General Public License|GNAT Modified GPL]], depending on where you obtain it.

Several optional add-ons are available from various places:

* ASIS, the [[w:Ada Semantic Interface Specification|Ada Semantic Interface Specification]], is a library that allows Ada programs to examine and manipulate other Ada programs.
* [[Ada Programming/Platform/POSIX|FLORIST]] is a library that provides a POSIX programming interface to the operating system.
* GDB, the GNU Debugger, with Ada extensions.
* GLADE implements Annex E, the Distributed Systems Annex.  With it, one can write distributed programs in Ada, where partitions of the program running on different computers communicate over the network with one another and with shared objects.
* GPS, the GNAT Programming Studio, is a full-featured integrated development environment, written in Ada.  It allows you to code in Ada, C and C++.

Many Free Software libraries are also available.

=== GNAT GPL Edition ===

This is a source and binary release from AdaCore, intended for use by Free
Software developers only.  If you want to distribute your binary programs
linked with the GPL run-time library,
then you must do so under terms compatible with the GNU General Public License.

==== GNAT 3.15p ====

This is the last public release of GNAT from AdaCore that uses the [[Wikipedia:GNAT Modified General Public License|GNAT Modified General Public License]].

GNAT 3.15p has passed the [[Wikipedia:ISO 18009|Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite]] ([[Wiktionary:ACATS|ACATS]]).  It was released in October 2002.

The binary distribution from  AdaCore also contains an Ada-aware version of the GNU Debugger ([[Wikipedia:GDB|GDB]]), and a graphical front-end to GDB called the GNU Visual Debugger (GVD).

|}

==== GCC ====

GNAT has been part of the [http://www.fsf.org/ Free Software Foundation]'s [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] since October 2001. The Free Software Foundation does not distribute binaries, only sources. Its licensing of the run-time library for Ada (and other languages) allows the development of proprietary software without necessarily imposing the terms of the [[Wikipedia:GNU General Public License|GPL]].

Most GNU/Linux distributions and several distributions for other platforms include prebuilt binaries; see below.

For technical reasons, we recommend against using the Ada compilers included in GCC 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 4.0. Instead, we recommend using GCC 3.4, 4.1 or later, or one of the releases from [http://www.adacore.com AdaCore] (3.15p, GPL Edition or Pro).

Since October 2003, AdaCore merge most of their changes from GNAT Pro into GCC during [http://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html#stage1 Stage 1]; this happens once for each major release.  Since GCC 3.4, AdaCore has gradually added support for revised language standards, first Ada 2005 and now Ada 2012.

GCC version 4.4 switched to [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html version 3 of the GNU General Public License] and grants a [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html Runtime Library Exception] similar in spirit to the [[Wikipedia:GNAT Modified General Public License|GNAT Modified General Public License]] used in all previous versions.  This Runtime Library Exception applies to run-time libraries for all languages, not just Ada.

As of GCC 4.7, released on 2012-03-22:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Languages supported
| Ada&amp;nbsp;83, Ada&amp;nbsp;95, Ada&amp;nbsp;2005, parts of Ada&amp;nbsp;2012, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C, Objective-C++ (and others)

=== The GNU Ada Project ===

The [http://gnuada.sourceforge.net GNU Ada Project] provides source and binary packages of various GNAT versions for several operating systems, and, importantly, the scripts used to create the packages. This may be helpful if you plan to port the compiler to another platform or create a cross-compiler; there are instructions for building your own GNAT compiler for [http://ada.krischik.com/index.php/Articles/CompileGNAT GNU/Linux] and [http://forward-in-code.blogspot.com/2011/11/building-gcc-again.html Mac OS X] users.

Both [[w:GNU General Public License|GPL]] and
[[w:GNAT Modified General Public License|GMGPL]] or [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html GCC Runtime Library Exception] versions of GNAT are available.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

=== A# (A-Sharp, a.k.a. Ada for .NET) ===

This compiler is historical as it has now been merged into [[#GNAT GPL Edition|GNAT GPL Edition]] and [[#GNAT Pro|GNAT Pro]].

A# is a port of Ada to the [http://www.microsoft.com/net/|Microsoft .NET Platform].  A# was originally developed at the Department of Computer Science at the United States Air Force Academy which distribute A# as a service to the Ada community under the terms of the GNU general public license. A# integrates well with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, AdaGIDE and the RAPID open-source GUI Design tool. As of 2006-06-06:

The Real-Time Research Group of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM, ''Universidad Politécnica de Madrid'') wrote a [[w:Ravenscar profile|Ravenscar]]-compliant real-time kernel for execution on [[w:LEON|LEON processors]] and a modified run-time library. They also provide a GNAT cross-compiler.  As of version 2.0.1:

=== GNAT for Macintosh (Mac OS X) ===

[http://www.macada.org/ GNAT for Macintosh] provides both FSF (GMGPL) and AdaCore (GPL) versions of [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] with [[w:Xcode|Xcode]] and [[w:Carbon (API)|Carbon]] integration and bindings.

Note that this site was last updated for GCC 4.3 and Mac OS X Leopard (both PowerPC and Intel-based). Aside from the work on integration with Apple’s Carbon graphical user interface and with Xcode 3.1 it may be preferable to [[#The_GNU_Ada_Project|see above]].

There is also support at [https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/gnat-gcc MacPorts]; the last update (at 25 Nov 2011) was for GCC 4.4.2.

=== Prebuilt packages as part of larger distributions ===

Many distributions contain prebuilt binaries of GCC or various public releases of GNAT from AdaCore.  Quality varies widely between distributions.  The list of distributions below is in alphabetical oder. ''(Please keep it that way.)''

==== AIDE (for Microsoft Windows) ====

[http://sr.sriviere.info/aide/aide.html AIDE &amp;mdash; Ada Instant Development Environment] is a complete one-click, just-works Ada distribution for Windows, consisting of GNAT, comprehensive documentation, tools and libraries.  All are precompiled, and source code is also available.  The installation procedure is particularly easy.  AIDE is intended for beginners and teachers, but can also be used by advanced users.

==== Cygwin (for Microsoft Windows) ====

[http://www.cygwin.com Cygwin], the Linux-like environment for Windows, also contains a version of the [[#GNAT, the GNU Ada Compiler from AdaCore and the Free Software Foundation|GNAT]] compiler. The [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin]] version of [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] is older than the [[w:MinGW|MinGW]] version and does not support DLLs and Multi-Threading &lt;small&gt;(as of 11.2004)&lt;/small&gt;.

==== Debian (GNU/Linux and GNU/kFreeBSD) ====

There is a [http://people.debian.org/~lbrenta/debian-ada-policy.html Debian Policy for Ada] which tries to make Debian the best Ada development ''and deployment'' platform.  The development platform includes the compiler and many libraries, pre-packaged and integrated so as to be easy to use in any program.  The deployment platform is the renowned ''[http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/ stable]'' distribution, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads and enjoys long life cycles, typically 3 to 4 years.  Because Debian is a binary distribution, it is possible to deploy non-free, binary-only programs on it while enjoying all the benefits of a stable platform. Compiler choices are conservative for this reason, and the Policy mandates that all Ada programs and libraries be compiled with the same version of GNAT.  This makes it possible to use all libraries in the same program.  Debian separates run-time libraries from development packages, so that end users do not have to install the development system just to run a program.

The GNU Ada compiler can be installed on a Debian system with this command:

 aptitude install gnat

This will also give you a list of related packages, which are likely to be useful for an Ada programmer.

Debian is unique in that it also allows programmers to use some of GNAT's internal components by means of two libraries:
* libgnatvsn (licensed under GNAT-Modified GPL) and
* libgnatprj (the project manager, licensed under pure GPL).
Debian packages make use of these libraries.

In the table below, the information about the future Debian 8.0 ''Jessie'' is accurate as of October 2014 and will change.

==== DJGPP (for MS-DOS) ====

DJGPP has [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] as part of their [[w:GCC|GCC]] distribution.

[http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/ DJGPP] is a port of a comprehensive collection of GNU utilities to MS-DOS with 32-bit extensions, and is actively supported (as of 1.2005). It includes the whole [[w:GCC|GCC]] compiler collection, that now includes Ada. See the [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/ DJGPP] website for installation instructions.

DJGPP programs run also in a DOS command box in Windows, as well as in native MS-DOS systems.

==== FreeBSD and DragonFly ====

[http://www.freebsd.org FreeBSD]'s [http://www.freebsd.org/ports ports collection] has an Ada framework
with an expanding set of software packages.  The Framework is currently built by FSF GCC 5.3, although FSF GCC 4.9 is still available as the basis of GnatDroid.  The AdaCore GPL compilers are not present.  There are several reasons for this, not the least of which is the addition maintenance of multiple compilers is significant.  There are no non-GCC based Ada compilers represented in ports either.

While FreeBSD does have a snapshot that goes with each release, the ports are updating in a rolling
fashion continuously, and the vast majority of users prefer the &quot;head&quot; of ports which has the latest
packages.

There are two ways to install the software.  The quickest and easiest way is to install prebuilt binaries using the command &quot;pkg install &lt;pkg name&gt;&quot;.  For example, to install the GNAT Programming Studio and all of its dependencies including the GNAT compiler, all you need is one command:

 pkg install gps-ide

If a specific package is not available, or the user just prefers to build from source (this can take a long time), then a typical command would be:

 cd /usr/ports/devel/gps &amp;&amp; make install clean

As with the binary installation, if any dependencies are missing they will be built first, also from source.

==== Gentoo GNU/Linux ====

The GNU Ada compiler can be installed on a Gentoo system using emerge:

  emerge dev-lang/gnat

In contrast to Debian, Gentoo is primarily a source distribution, so many packages are available only in source form, and require the user to recompile them (using emerge).

Also in contrast to Debian, Gentoo supports several versions of GNAT in parallel on the same system.  Be careful, because not all add-ons and libraries are available with all versions of GNAT.

==== Mandriva Linux ====

The GNU Ada compiler can be installed on a Mandriva system with this command:

 urpmi gnat

==== MinGW (for Microsoft Windows) ====

[http://mingw.sourceforge.net MinGW &amp;mdash; Minimalist GNU for Windows] contains a version of the GNAT compiler.

The current version of MinGW (5.1.6) contains gcc-4.5.0.  This includes a fully functional GNAT compiler.  If the automatic downloader does not work correctly you can download the compiler directly: pick gcc-4.5.0-1 from MinGW/BaseSystem/GCC/Version4/

===== old instructions =====
The following list should help you with the installation. (I may have forgotten something &amp;mdash; but this is wiki, just add to the list)

# Install &lt;var&gt;MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe&lt;/var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;binutils-2.15.91-20040904-1.tar.gz&lt;/var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;mingw-runtime-3.5.tar.gz&lt;/var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;gcc-core-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz&lt;/var&gt;

# Install &lt;var&gt;mingw32-make-3.80.0-3.exe (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
# Install &lt;var&gt;gdb-5.2.1-1.exe (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
# Install &lt;var&gt;MSYS-1.0.10.exe (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
# Install &lt;var&gt;msysDTK-1.0.1.exe (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;msys-automake-1.8.2.tar.bz2 (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;msys-autoconf-2.59.tar.bz2 (Optional)&lt;var&gt;
## extract &lt;var&gt;msys-libtool-1.5.tar.bz2 (Optional)&lt;var&gt;

I have made good experience in using &lt;var&gt;D:\MinGW&lt;/var&gt; as target directory for all installations and extractions.

Also noteworthy is that the Windows version for GNAT from Libre is also based on MinGW.

In gcc-3.4.2-release_notes.txt from MinGW site reads:
''please
check that the files in the /lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.2/adainclude and adalib
directories are flagged as read-only. This attribute is necessary to
prevent them from being deleted when using gnatclean to clean a project.''

So be sure to do this.

==== OpenCSW (for Solaris on [[w:SPARC|SPARC]] and [[w:x86|x86]]) ====

[http://www.opencsw.org OpenCSW] has binary packages of GCC 3.4.6 and 4.6.2 with Ada support.  The package names are gcc3ada and gcc4ada respectively.

==== pkgsrc: NetBSD, DragonFly and Solaris  ====

The [http://www.pkgsrc.org pkgsrc] portable package file system has a small Ada framework.
It is based on FSF GCC 4.9 currently, although FSF GCC 5 is available.  
The AdaCore GPL versions are not present, nor are non-GCC based compilers.

The pkgsrc system is released in quarterly branches, which are normally recommended.  However,
a user could also choose the &quot;head&quot; which would the very latest package versions.  The pkgsrc
system supports 21 platforms, but for Ada this is potentially limited to 5 due to the bootstrap
compiler requirement: NetBSD, DragonFly, SunOS (Solaris/Illumos), OpenBSD/MirBSD, and FreeBSD.

==== SuSE Linux ====

All versions of SuSE Linux have a GNAT compiler included. SuSE versions 9.2 and higher also contains ASIS, Florist and GLADE libraries. The following two packages are needed:

 gnat
 gnat-runtime

For SuSE version 12.1, the compiler is in the package 
  gcc46-ada
  libada46

For 64 bit system you will need the 32 bit compatibility packages as well:

 gnat-32bit
 gnat-runtime-32bit

==== Ubuntu ====

Ubuntu (and derivatives like Kubuntu, Xubuntu...) is a Debian-based Linux distribution, thus the [[#Debian (GNU/Linux and GNU/kFreeBSD)|installation process described above]] can be used. Graphical package managers like Synaptic or Adept can also be employed to select the Ada packages.

When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simple language would work.

== Major Questions ==

These major questions appear in every module:

#How big is this planet?
#What is its surface like?
#What are its moons like? Only for planets with moons.
#How long is a day on this planet?
#How long is a year on this planet? ''For moons:'' How long is its orbit around the planet?
#What is it made of?
#How much would this planet's gravity pull on me?
#Who is it named after?&lt;!--incorporate Angela's idea of different kinds of texts, perhaps a box about the relevant god/goddess.--&gt;
#How was it discovered? Only for Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and several moons.

Some pages replace &quot;it&quot; with the planet's or moon's name and some don't.

== Other topics ==

Other topics in this book could be: 
#[[/About gravity, mass, and weight/]] (alternate version at [[/About weight and gravity/]]) {{stage short|50%|}}
#[[/How the Solar System was born/]] {{stage short|25%|}}
#[[/What will happen to the Solar System in the future/]] {{stage short|25%|}}
#[[/The Mystery of Space/]] {{stage short|00%|}} just a general overview about how people have regarded space differently in different cultures throughout time
#[[/Is there life out there?/]] {{stage short|25%|}} looking at the old question; the possible Mars microbes are of note, sci-fi and speculation might be interesting to touch on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Danny, [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikibooks!

I see you've been adding pages for the wikijunior project, and might have run up against a possible module naming issue. The [[Wikijunior Solar System]] page links to [[Mercury]], which is currently not a page I'd suggest we send 10 year olds to.  Additionally, all of the chemistry wikibooks, both of the existing astronomy wikibooks, and perhaps the medicine wikibooks might also desire a link to that page. For that reason we generally like it if some form of disambiguator is assigned to each book's modules preemtivly.  Having said that, we've never established a standard system, but &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Book Title:Module Title]], [[Book title: Module title]], [[Module title (book title)]], and [[Book title - Module title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are some of the more common conventions used.  I prefer the psudo-namespace options, as there are talks of assigning every wikibook its own namespace. (see [[Help:Pages#Namespaces]])

You also might like to checkout some of the content we have already developed.  For example, the [[GAT]] book may have some useful modules for the Solar System project.

== Wikijunior Solar System ==

Hello Danny,
Thanks for your comments on WikiJunior Solar System.
At the rate things are going, I'd be surprised if the magazine material were
ready in 3 weeks.  But I am making an effort to encourage people to stop adding content and start whipping it into shape.  I am not certain there will even be a decision on the Kiki character by then, let alone the drawings we need.

Are you Danny Wool?  WikiMediaFoundation Grantwriter?  Can you give us some more information about the grant?  Like telling us all more about who the Beck Foundation is, why they want these booklets, who they will be distributed by and how?  Even at this stage of the project, I think it would help understand what to do with the book.  The information at [[meta:Wikijunior|Wikijunior]] is not complete.

I stumbled onto the project a bit late, but I am still wondering why we didn't contact NASA about turning [http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm their solar system website] into an educational booklet.  I imagine that NASA might be willing to do that sort of thing if we could give them concrete information about the grant and the grantor.

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 12:43, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for contributing to the module [[Wikijunior Solar System/Venus|on Venus]].  Would you have any interest in signing up for any of the tasks on the proofreading plan?  Do you think anyone will be interested in following a plan like that?  Should I ditch the plan as a bad idea?  Thanks for your thoughts on the proofreading process.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 02:20, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Danny. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Danny~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hi. I hope I don't sound like I'm obstructing your progress to adminship, but I would like to see a slightly more clear consensus (one or two more votes perhaps) before I do, and then I'd be happy to do so - I hope you understand this. In the meantime, if there are any admin duties you need to perform, just let me know, and I'll try to take care of them as soon as possible. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:31, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Hi. I see you are contributing to the Optics book and I have a question (I am working of FHSST Physics) about the link to the course notes at the top of the page. Have the notes been released so that they can be transcribed directly into WikiBooks under the GFDL?

If not - do you know if anyone has asked the author? FHSST Phyiscs is short its Optics chapter and I am relatively desparate to get something in and so am considering asking the author of the course notes if he will release them under the GFDL to us but I just wanted to check the status first.

== Ivyboy needs to be banned ==

Since you seem to be around right now and I still can't take care of this myself...

Please ban [[User:Ivyboy]] ASAP. He has:

#repeatedly removed legit (justified, etc.) VfD notices
#repeatedly removed VfD discussion instead of participating in it
#moved the [[User:Bulbaboy]] page over his own, making the users appear to be the same

I think you can consider all this to be his vote against the pages he has created (copyright violation), so that all can be quickly dealt with too.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:34, 22 May 2005 (UTC)


Regarding your comment on [[User talk:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan's talk page]]: Sure, go ahead and give Ivyboy a chance to redeem himself, if you think he should have one.  Personally, I find it hard to believe (now) that he's just oblivious, but hey, you're the admin. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 06:24, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

Just now, after you warned him:
#He wiped VfD discussion for a 3rd time.
#He made Bulbaboy's page a redirect to his own.
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:59, 23 May 2005 (UTC)



[[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] has been [[Special:Contributions/Ivyboy|causing trouble]] again:

1)  He removed the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copyvio}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag from Wikibooks Pokédex:Ruby Sapphire Walkthrough 1|his walkthrough]] page. He masked this as a minor edit on one of the sections of his page, thinking we wouldn't look for changes elsewhere.
:Note that this page is practicly identical to the pages I've listed in this &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copyvio}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. I've quoted the copywrite notice from the original walkthrough at the votes for deletion.

2)  He deleted [[User talk:Ivyboy|his own talk page]]. He masked this as a minor edit.

3)  He copied all the text from [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]]'s page over to [[User:Ivyboy|his]], and changed Bulbaboy's page to a redirect. He masked this as a minor edit.

4)  He deleted the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#[[Wikibooks Pokédex:Ruby Sapphire Walkthrough 1]]|votes for deletion]] for his walkthrough, masking this as a minor edit on one of the sections of his page, thinking we wouldn't look for changes elsewhere.

I reverted all his changes (no other changes have been made to these pages in the middle).

For your information, since you're dealing with him now.

[[User:User142|User142]] 15:10, 23 May 2005 (UTC)


Hey, thanks for registering the username Ivyboy on Wikipedia for me - and I don't need the password, all I want to know is that nobody's gonna use the account.  I think I'll register Venuboy on both projects, too - it would be his last chance to get me with a similar name.  Oh, and what's the policy on asking an admin to protect your own user page?  I think I'd rather not have him redirecting it again... - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 20:47, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== The brittish boycott on Bar Ilan ==

I've succeeded in my goal to get Bar Ilan University to be unable to edit pages on Wikibooks for a day. You won't be seeing '''&lt;U&gt;me&lt;/U&gt;''' again. (You may see some of my friends, and they may cause you to block out Bar Ilan indefinitely if they have enough patients...)[[User:Ivyboy|Ivyboy]] 16:41, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

Well, looks like we've just had the first of his friends come (see edit history: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frazzydee&amp;oldid=132897]).  He even tried a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Bulbaboy|Ivyboy]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - oh joy!  We should probably contact Bar Ilan University so we can work this thing out (which would probably involve restricting computer access to these guy).  And yes, I know you say not to revert the page, but I figured it'd be okay in this case (rather blatent case of malicious vandalism)...  Oh, and to Ivyboy's friends: tell him to work on spelling, it's spelled &quot;patience&quot; in this case. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 19:25, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, he isn't the only Wikipedian/Wikibookian at Bar Ilan. I am an other user here, and I hope that his friends don't cause any long term proiblems with editing, since this is where most of my edits are from. The I.P. address 132.70.50.117 seems to be a computer through which all the computers at Bar Ilan, including some which '''&lt;U&gt;anyone&lt;/U&gt;''' can use (there are rules which aren't enforced which say they are only to be used by students and for matters related to their studies).

:By the way, I was involved with exposing Ivyboy's behavior (Starting with May 17th, when I found the illegal walkthrough, and put a comment on the talk page and asked at the study desk what to do) - I was the first to mention this anywhere in Wikibooks; I mentioned to Bulbaboy at Wikipedia that I believe Ivyboy tried to copy his name; I found the actual source of Ivyboy's walkthrough; I've restored the VfD/copyvio tag to the top of his walkthrough page twice; I recomended that Bulbaboy take the name Ivyboy at Wikipedia (I did this a bit over an hour before you reported taking that name there; I didn't think it it was right for someone other than Bulbaboy to take the name, since it's based on his).

:I hope Ivyboy and his friends don't succeed in causing long term problems here for me. 

:[[User:User142|User142]] 09:29, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

::Looks like Dittoboy form Wikipedia has found the time to lock up edits there to Bar Ilan, the same way Ivyboy did at Wikibooks. As soon as his block is up, he will probably be writing about the fact that you allowed him to do this.

::By the way, I think the reason he didn't do it for the first 12 hours is that he is doing this from the university, and he maybe wasn't here at 9:17pm at night. (Classes here end at 7:30pm at the latest.) He did it this morning shortly after 10:00am.[[User:User142|User142]] 07:19, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

::I've just checked on the list of users of Wikibooks. There is a Dittoboy here to.[[User:User142|User142]] 11:36, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

You've got ''*65536*'' IP addresses, and all it takes to prevent most of Bar Ilan from editing is banning ''one'' of those?  Sheesh.  Maybe you should complain to the staff, and try and get the guy(s) punished.  Or at least have the university use the other IP addresses... - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 22:15, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

Frazzydee, I know they've got the range from 132.70.0.0 to 132.70.255.255 - but the thing is, the way I'm reading User142's comment, it seems they ''are'' using the same IP address for most of the school.  Which would be quite odd, of course, as that'd mean they wouldn't be using 65535 of them.  Maybe 132.70.50.117 is the only address they let non-faculty use? - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 00:53, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

:See my comments on [[User Talk:User142|my talk page]].[[User:User142|User142]] 11:08, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

==[no title]==
This page belongs to an idiot who believes in the academic boycott on Bar Ilan University.

&lt;s&gt;[[User:Bulbaboy|Ivyboy]] 17:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:''I added the strikethroughs myself, because bulbaboy did not leave this message here.  See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFrazzydee&amp;diff=132897&amp;oldid=132843]''

== [[User:Dittoboy|Dittoboy]] at Wikibooks ==

I've just reverted several edits of [[User:Dittoboy|Dittoboy]]'s. He added the following text to several pages, including the [[User:Jimbo Wales|user page]] and [[User Talk:Jimbo Wales|talk page]] of Jimbo Wales:

 == Important Request ==
 Unban the user JoeM from Wikipedia. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Dittoboy|Dittoboy (formerly Bulbaboy - 
I untransformed)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 16:50, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I've checked out who JoeM from Wikipedia is, and he had 24 sockpuppets, some of which did nothing other than ask that he be unbanned. One of those is Jimbo.Wales, a name to which [[User:Dittoboy|Dittoboy]] moved [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]'s page to.

This is the second time he did this - the first time it was reverted by [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]].

He also reported himself on the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism in progress]] page.

In addition, he copied over the text from [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]]'s page over to his own. Similarly, look at his signature.

I think he will do everything to get himself blocked for good, and bring Bar Ilan with him. We have to do something to make him fail. I'm sure he's thinking that you have given him the autority to do something that most users can't - to block any IP address he has access to.

[[User:User142|User142]] 09:00, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Complain to the faculty?  That might stop him.  I mean, they ''are'' running all the computers through a proxy (I think); all they'd have to do is start using more of their IP addresses (a few proxies, perhaps?), and they could narrow down the possibilities of who it might be.  Or at least let ''some'' of the people there edit Wikipedia. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 23:52, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

'''Celestia''' provides photo-realistic, real-time, three-dimensional viewing of the Solar System, the galaxy and the universe. It is an easy to use, freely-distributed, multi-platform, open source, software package which has become a valuable tool for astronomy education. Used in homes, schools, museums and planetariums around the world, it also is used as a visualization tool by space mission designers. Versions are available for computers running Windows, Macintosh (Mac OS X) and Linux operating systems.

Although it is optimized for 3D astronomical visualization, Celestia can be used to display and explore other 3D environments, too.

And, for some reason, many people seem to find exploring with Celestia to be a lot of fun.

==About this guide==
This ''Guide to Celestia'' is intended to be a comprehensive source of information for students, educators, and other users of Celestia. It will include instructions for obtaining, installing, using, customizing, and troubleshooting the Celestia software, as well as explanations of concepts and techniques from astronomy and computer graphics as needed to fully explore and understand Celestia and its universe. It is intended to address the needs of novice, casual, and advanced users.

The ''Guide to Celestia'' is just beginning development and is very far from complete. '''You''' can help by adding useful content. Members of the Celestia community are encouraged to be bold in editing this WikiBook to provide the additions and corrections needed to make it useful for themselves and others. Please share your knowledge here.

&lt;br&gt;Icons indicate approximate development status.
&lt;br&gt;Of course, all pages are subject to improvement at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scribd==

The current scribd version looks terrible in both Firefox and Chrome.  The kerning is all off on the headings and the placement of text and images is wrong in some cases.  The forward on pg 5 had text cut off on the right hand side.

==Style for Younger Readers==

To appeal to younger readers, it would be useful to avoid a dry style and include true stories and &quot;amazing&quot; factoids. And lots  of pictures.

== Measurements ==

I am not sure weights and lengths (let's say 250kg and 3 metres, respectively) mean much to Juniors. What if we have a practical equivelency - &quot;250kg, about the weight of 5 men&quot;, and &quot;3 metres, roughly the height of [insert everyday object - bus maybe?]&quot;. --[[User:OldakQuill|OldakQuill]] 23:18, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Just what I was thinking. I'm not a junior, and I still find things like '250 kg' and '3 meters' mean almost nothing to me.  
[[User:Mihoshi|Mihoshi]] 02:01, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Vocabulary &amp; Age Level ==

What age level are we aiming for here?  I have a feeling words like &quot;captivity&quot;, &quot;sleeker&quot;, and &quot;prey&quot;, along with the generally dry writing style (as mentioned earlier) make this inappropriate for children in, say, early elementary school.  Is there any way we could ease back on the difficult words (or, alternatively, explain the terminology thoroughly along the way) in order to reach a younger audience?  Also, the question &quot;How do they raise their young?&quot; doesn't seem like it would be of much interest to kids.  [[User:Buggi22|Buggi22]]

Actually. Non-fiction children's books is a rapidly increasing genre. It is highly sought-after these days in elementary schools as an over-looked genre in the past and of great interest to some children who are not interested in fiction. &quot;How do they raise their young&quot; is also an important element of the elementary school curriculum and it would be advisable to keep this book as useful as possible to schools and students. I don't advocate using difficult words but I don't believe in dumbing down either. It should be a learning experience but, obviously, not an overwhelming one.  &quot;Captivity&quot; and &quot;prey&quot; are somewhat usable for primary school-aged children, especially with a glossary as I have recommended. They are definitely usable within a primary school where help and discussion is available. [[User:DoubleBlue|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;'''Double'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:DoubleBlue|Talk)]] 22:30, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
I think that vocab is good, but we do have a problem with writing style.  It varies wildly from article to article, with some employing massive number of circumlocutions to avoid a word that our age group should get.  My strategy has been to always replace a circumlocution by the appropriate word, and then explain that if I'm certain it's a tough one.  I think that's better for kids than if they feel talked down to due to our vocabulary.

== Panther ==

According to [[w:Black Panther]], a Panther is a varient of several species of Balck Cats. For this reason I think it deserves its own article, not just a mention in Leopard (which is misleading). --[[User:Bjwebb|Bjwebb]] 12:35, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

::All I can suggest here is to simply '''be bold''' and start making the changes.  Wikijunior Big Cats can certainly use a few more articles, so adding a &quot;Black Panther&quot; article really is no big deal at all.  I'll go ahead and add the link, but make sure that you fill it with reasonable content.&lt;p&gt;From both reading this series of articles as well as other sources, it appears as though genetically the cats are quite closely related, and the speciation (distinguished between different species) is in many ways harder to define with the cat family.  Almost like the different breeds of dogs (although apparently a bit larger extreme).  Don't sweat the fine stuff... just make it something that would be interesting to kids and be as factually accurate as you can be.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:23, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== List of Contributors ==

I'm working on a PDF version of Big Cats, and it appears that I need a list of the contributors for the copyright information. Could someone please provide this? --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 02:42, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

:[[Wikijunior Big Cats/Authors|I hope you look at this page]] (the list of authors) for this information.  BTW, there is a MediaWiki feature that for some weird reason has been &quot;turned off&quot; that would make collecting this information far more easier.  It would have put a &quot;credits&quot; button at the top of the page, and I've seen it working in the demo versions of Media Wiki.  Perhaps someday it will be added.  In the meantime, I'm going to try and do some more searching of the list of authors and update this page.  This certainly should not be considered an exaustive list at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Okay... I have the preliminary PDF version. [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/c/cc/Big_Cats.pdf Click Here] to see it. Make sure to change your Page Layout to &quot;Facing&quot;. --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 01:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Lynx and bobcats ==

The title of the section &quot;[[Wikijunior Big Cats/Lynx and bobcats|Lynx and bobcats]]&quot; is misleading and contains false information. It would be like saying &quot;Canines and wolves&quot;. This is because bobcats are actually a ''type'' of Lynx (see the [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568386/Lynx.html Encarta article]. ) Therfore, all the information about the differences between lynxes and bobcats is false. --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 04:13, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

:Ultimately we need to separate the lynx species because they bridge the ocean and cause problems with OLD WORLD and NEW WORLD cats.  Bobcats are famous in their own right, much more widely known than the other lynx.  I don't mind doing this since, as we say at my work, those who gripe about a problem automatically appoint themselves as chairman of the correction committee. [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 15:03, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== One quick thing... ==

What should the standard units of measurement be? Metric or other? I propose standardising the units of measurement to whatever country the Beck Foundation is based in. If America, us feet, miles, etc. and if in a country that uses metric, meters, kilograms, etc. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] 16:08, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
:It appears the Beck Foundation is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA, so might I suggest using feet, miles, etc. as the main untis with metric in parentheses? We should try to keep &quot;the money&quot; happy. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] 17:39, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

== Deadline ==

:''I moved this discussion from [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] because it was getting really long and I got tired of scrolling past it all the time. &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 03:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)''

Folks I will do anything and everything possible to get this project COMPLETELY wrapped by the 10th, no matter what it takes or what favors I have to reel in.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 02:12, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:Printing [[Wikijunior Solar System]] first instead was discussed ([[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Archive 2]]), but I guess that went nowhere.  The grant proposal does say that our first printed one would be on animals &amp;mdash; too bad we actually specified that before finding out participation levels.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 02:24, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

::Is there anyplace anywhere (preferably on-line, but even in print format that could be photocopied or scanned into a PDF file would be good) where the actual text of the grant is located at for ordinary folks like myself to be able to read what needs to be accomplished?  Frankly, for a project involving a fairly substantial amount of money ($10,000 is enough to make an impact with this whole thing) the leadership for the whole of Wikijunior really stinks at the moment, especially when I read statements like that listed above.  Had actual deadlines been listed more than just a few days before they were to come up there would have been much more effort to get this accomplished.  As it stands, I see that this whole book is about 3-4 months from being ready for publication, at least to the standards that [[Wikijunior Solar System]] has been moving toward.  It will not be done in 3 days, at least with the current group of volunteers.  There is a very decided disconnect between those administering the grant money and those who are trying to work on Wikijunior itself.  Feel free to add messages on my talk page.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:::[[m: Wikijunior/proposal to Beck Foundation]].  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 15:36, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::::Is this honestly the whole grant proposal?  Was there any sort of reply from the Beck Foundation?  While I see a tentative deadline listed on the page listed above, where does the December 10th deadline come from as mentioned in this section heading?  While I don't mind working on the Big Cats Wikijunior book, the general concensus was to finish the Solar System book first mainly because it was already complete in terms of content and we had an abundance (indeed an overabundance) of multimedia content for the sections needed.  Many images for this Wikibook have a questionable pedigree as the zoo that many of them were taken at is asserting copyright on the images of their animals (I know, I don't think that is legal anyway) and has filed a cease and desist judicial order against the original photographer, who did release them through copyleft principles earlier.  There are some huge issues that still need to be worked out with this book.  Still, I am willing to dive in and try to help out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::I have done everything humanly possible to finish this thing today that I can think of.  Anything else anyone notices that needs to be fixed?  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 20:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Reading Level ==

We should check the reading level of every section (see tools at [[Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading]]) and then make sure everything that should be is in the glossary along with thorough proofreading in general.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 20:54, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

: My journalism class has a list of things to do every time we edit an article/page. Here are a few of them:
* Make sure every phrase is as &quot;small&quot; as it could possibly be. Most of the phrases in this book are overly wordy.
* There should not be a single word repeated in a headline.
* Think up better introductions or leads
* Check basic grammar and spelling rules 
* Make the paragraphs flow.

Remove redundant phrases and sentences; read them outloud to yourself. Sentences next to each other should not start with the same word for instance. This is a big one, probably because we all can edit a single paragraph, we add our 2 cents and are done with it. But now is the time to make it all &quot;flow&quot;, and the book isn't flowing as much as I'd like to at this moment. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:30, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

:Let me just add that as one of the side effects of a group-edited project, one of the big grammar problems is number and tense agreement.  I've found a lot without even checking carefully, so that's something to keep an eye out for.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 01:17, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

==Proofreading==

I starting using [http://www.usingenglish.com/resources/text-statistics.php this reading level tool] to check our modules, and most sections end up with around a 10-12 Fog Index (supposedly corresponds to years of education needed to understand a text).  Most is apparently from really long sentences with lots of relative clauses, so I've been concentrating on cutting those up right now rather than doing any serious replacement of long words.  I might be done for tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow to do lots more.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 03:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

==Status==
Gang, I've really enjoyed working on this Wikijunior book with you.  At the moment I'm unsure what its status is.  Has it been finalized, and what is the proper way to make edits at this late date with, presumably, a PDF floating about to secure our grant funds?  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 01:38, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:So far as your additions, we do have a policy to [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]], and this book needed more length anyways.  Besides, I think it's fun to teach kids about cats they haven't seen in every zoo and book and movie.  So far as communicating with someone who knows what they're doing, we have been having severe issues.  Currently we can't even get the Wikimedia Grant Coordinator to respond to our questions.  My two cents is that we've done the best we could at the last minute, and should simply work on this book at a normal pace until we think it's really the best we can make it.  This is also my first wikibook (I'm much more used to the wikipedia style where nothing is ever really done) so I'm not really sure where to go from here.  The book did tend to move slowly before you came along, John, so perhaps we should all agree on a realistic deadline to get it done right by. Any suggestions?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 10:18, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

: Angela says that the whole matter will be discussed at a board meeting this week. Continue being bold for a couple more days, hack away and add at will. I'd personally like everything to be wrapped up soon, because I can only design the thing at school, and I'm only at school until Friday.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

== Revised PDF file for &quot;published&quot; version of WIkijunior Big Cats ==

For those that are interested, I have just created a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/c/cc/Big_Cats.pdf revised version of the PDF file] for this Wikijunior book.  If this were computer software, I would call this an early beta-test release, but it is IMHO good enough to take to the printer in term of doing some preliminary hard copies that could be sent to either the Beck Foundation or presented during Wikimania as an actual book produced through this project.

For those that are interested, I can provide a printed copy of this book as well for a relatively modest fee (just for the printing... I won't make any money off of the deal).  E-mail me on my user page if you are even remotely interested.  Based on my costs for the Wikijunior Solar System, it would be about USD $15 to USD $20 per copy in limited numbers... substantially cheaper if done in large quantities.  I would love to set up some sort of Wikibooks press to get this into the hands of other people as well, but that is going to take some up front captial and some people interested in setting up a web site for selling this.

I have the whole system for putting this together worked out now, so if there is a need I can easily get another updated/revised edition with just a little bit of work.  It would be nice to have this automated, but in some ways it is nice to not rely on automated procedures quite yet.  I did fix up a couple of things that need to be rolled back into the Wiki text, although I didn't do any spell checking (I need to do that).

Thanks to everybody who has put in so much work to get this Wikibook to its current state.  We really have made some incredible progress, and I am certain that there will be some kids who will use this information in a very positive way.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:29, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

: Robert, this is a kids' book. Pictures should be much bigger. Secondly, the PDF you made is way too low resolution to print in real life. Thirdly, are the images CMYK? Otherwise they won't rip properly, and the printer will charge us a service fee. Books, magazines, etc., their pages are generally divisible by four. Can kids actually click on a interwiki link in a print publication? If not, why are the Wikipedia &quot;For more information&quot;s like that. You can waste your money at the printer's, but Wikimedia isn't going to waste their's.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

:: I am reasonably print savvy.  I can do a markup in Pagemaker and export it to PDF with nice banners for the sections. Let me take a stab at addressing these concerns. [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 16:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

::: Personally, I've got InDesign and Quark, and they're a bit more sophisticated and up to date.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

::Where is the issue of resolution involved?  PDF uses scaleable fonts, so other than for the images this is not going to be that much of an issue.  A larger issue regarding images is that they will have to be converted to B&amp;W images for most of the printing unless you can find a good cheap color printing service that charges less than $0.25 per page.  To do this very inexpensively we need to drop the costs down to less than 3 cents per page.  I know of no color printing service that does low-volume printing (less than 10,000 copies) that can do it that cheaply.  As far as conversions from RGB to CMYK, that is a trivial detail that I can even write an automation program for it there is a huge need for it.  If a printer charges extra for that conversion they are just trying to milk you for more money.  Seriously.  Or they are simply incompetent and don't understand digital images.

::Keep in mind that all I did was simply take the existing web pages and copy them directly from the current content on the web pages, with the existing resolution that is found on the wiki as it has been defined by the people editing each of the pages.  Not the best, but it is the best way I know to make a book quickly.  If you want higher resolution images, that is going to require some considerable amount of hand labor and in some cases recreating the image with a high-quality digital camera and of course in this case expenses of actually going to a zoo or to the natural habitat locations to take new photos to get that higher resolution.  I was working with the material that we have at hand.

::As far as having pages divisible by four... yes, I knew about that.  Actually, the number is either a multiple of four, eight, sixteen, or sometimes thrity-two pages.  That is what is called in printing as a &quot;key&quot;, and in high-volume printing they usually print several pages of a book at once on a huge sheet of paper and then fold it up to make a part of the book.  Mass printed Bibles sometimes even use a key of 64 pages at once (which is why you sometimes have a bunch of &quot;blank&quot; pages at the end of some mass-printed bibles... that are often filled with personal hand-written footnotes and family history information).  For low-volume printing that I've been used to, you only have to deal with individual pages... or at least facing pages where you print on the front and back and is done with what is generally a high-speed laser printer generating the image directly from the digital file (the PDF in this case).

::As far as Wikimedia wasting their money... who even suggested that any money from the Foundation be used for this?  I have simply provided a PDF file of this Wikibook as a volunteer service to the community.  If you don't like it, make your own.  Good luck at that, because you are going to need it.  Especially with trying to get higher resolution images into this Wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:05, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

[[Image:Fossildude for book.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Enlarged screenshot of an image in the most recent PDF, split-screened with an image from Wikicommons.]]
:::Yes, the fonts are fine. We don't need a conversion program to convert the images, it's a simple job in Photoshop. If a printer charges you for that, they're charging you for wasting their time. I'm afraid ''you're'' the one that doesn't understand digital images, in terms of proper prepress. RGB are fine with laserjet, but I was expecting we'd print something more than laserjet.

:::Putting the thumbnails in is just a no go. Put in the actual full size uploads. Look at the comparison of the image used in the fossil section.

::: TeX is all I know, and I only have used it for reports... I doubt TeX is suitable for the job however, as we probably want some &quot;magazine&quot; style pages, background pictures and stuff of that nature, correct? Although... I think it would be possible to create PDFs and then modify the PDFs to have a background image? If that is possible, then maybe we get a basic outline going in TeX, create several page layouts, and then it would be trivial to create a program for wikitext to tex.

:: The current version as of my sig-date has 14657 words, including headings, glossary, and so forth. Assuming 8 pages for intro, index, and GFDL (out of a total of 48 pages, or 32 + 16) we got between 366 and 367 words per page on average. I'd say thats room for improvement, considering that intro to parents is 323 words long. Taking that basis, we probably should be aiming at 250 words per page.

==Title Change==
I see that you all have put a lot of work into this project and that it is coming along nicely.  However, I am concerned that the title is misleading.  Many of the animals listed in the book are not commonly referred to as &quot;big cats,&quot; such as the ocelot, serval, and bobcat.  Instead, a title like &quot;Wild Cats&quot; might better describe the contents of the book, without being misleading.  Also, many common non-domestic cats are missing from the book, such as the fishing cat, leopard cat, margay, sand cat, jaguarundi, pallas cat, and the wildcat.  (I'm sure I'm missing a few.) These are animals that children would commonly come across in any quality zoo.  This is my first time visiting this sight, so I apologize if this has already been addressed. 

Also, children begin studying concepts of predator and prey, animal life cycles, animal reproduction, animal behavior, along with concepts such as camouflage, savannah, rain forest, ect. as young as second and third grade. I am concerned that many authors are trying to unnecessarily &quot;dumb&quot; the material down. Especially with the popularity of animal related programming on television, kids are much more knowledgeable about the subject than many might think.

:You are SO RIGHT about the boundary between &quot;big cats&quot; and &quot;wild cats&quot; being crossed.  For instance, an ocelot but no margay.  Maybe it should be &quot;Wild Cats&quot; rather than &quot;Big Cats&quot;.  I added two missing &quot;official&quot; big cats myself (marbled cat, clouded leopard), but gang, there are 37 species of cats all told... [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 01:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

::I support the name change as well, with a bit of history thrown in.  The name &quot;Big Cats&quot; was chosen only to limit the scope of the initial set of projects for Wikijunior.  As it turns out, the Big Cats book seems to have less overall conent than the rest of the current Wikijunior books, and I myself lead to an expansion of the Wikijunior Solar System to include the larger moons of the Solar System like Callisto and Europa.  In this case, simply '''be bold''' and make the changes.  I personally would like at least a little bit more input from the current development community of this Wikibook before the change is made, but I certainly would support such an action and include the defintely finite number additional cat species not already covered.  The Disney movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; certainly has introduced the [[w:Meerkat]], and would be something kids would like to know more about beyond the Disnified version displayed on that movie.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:::The book cover would need to be changed, as well as all of the links, but the meerkat isn't really a cat (I don't think... it's been awhile since I've looked at anything regarding meerkats). So should we start with the change?

:::: You are correct in your assumption; a meerkat is not actually a cat. It belongs to the family Viverridae, along with civets and genets. But, their are definitely additional popular cats to be covered, as stated above.[[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 22:36, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Suggestion: We should consider grouping some of the more obscure pages the way LYNX covers the Canadian, European, Spanish Lynx and Bobcat.

::Changing the name to &quot;wild cats&quot; isn't going to make kids any more informed. If you want kids to know the difference between a big cat and a small cat, then we can just say on the bobcat page &quot;The bobcat is not a true Big Cat...&quot;. Perhaps the small cats should have their own section. As for including the other cats you listed, I'd love to see more species, but the book is already much to big and wordy. Perhaps a page of pictures with minimal text so kids can just know they exist, and find out more about them on their own (we live in the age of the internet after all). As for coming across the cats you lited at &quot;any quality zoo&quot;: of the last seven zoos I've visited (all of which had lions and tigers), only one had the wildcat, and I saw none of the others. &amp;mdash;[[User:Pengo|Pengo]] 00:14, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

::I fully support a change in the name for Big Cats to Wild Cats, with the way this book is heading. I disagree that we should keep the title &quot;Big Cats&quot; and put a note on small cat pages saying they are not because the number of small cats greatly exceeds the number of large cats. I also support grouping the smaller, lesser known cats into single articles as a lot of the pages do not have much information in the first place.

==The Structure==
We need to change the structure of the book.  I could handle this.  Frankly it's a little annoying to have the same fact &quot;This is one of the four cats that can roar&quot; on Tiger, Lion, Leopard and Jaguar separately.  Much rather I should write a chapter to introduce them and have a short discussion of what makes a big cat big (and it's not size!).  
Soon to come:

* Focus on the most endangered cat of all, the Iberian Lynx
* Fossil History will be more fun with references to the sabertooth and cave lion.  It reads too technically for kids.

Fact is, you can't write a 40 page book about 37 species of cats and do them justice.  Let's condense where it is necessary, but geez, there is a lot of things to know about cats, even at the most basic level possible.  Perhaps we should work on less detailed discussions of where cats live and how they raise their young.  Concentrate more on warm and fuzzy.

==Size of Page==
Erm, I downloaded scribus (pagemaker clone for linux) so I can start getting a complete layout done, and I'm wondering; what should the size of the pages be?

[[Image:PageFromYourAmazingBody.jpg | 100 px]]
[[Image:PageFromKnowItAll.jpg | 100 px]]
[[Image:LayoutFromPaintAndPainting.jpg | 100 px]]

As a summary on what is on those pages; Know It All is the style we should aim for at least (heck, it could be automatically generated from the pages easily); Your Amazing Body seems dead on, with exception of the 2x headlines on the same lines (kinda makes the whole thing seem like 1 topic) but in terms of quality, it is good. Paint and Painting seems almost overdone in terms of layout, but if we can hit it, then lets go for it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

: Oh, and there are a few consistancies I should note between these 3 pages. They all use a serif font for body text, and a sans-serif font for headings and captions. And 2 of the 3 have questions for headlines. And although you can't see it; the topics are not repetative from page to page; that is, the same questions are not asked over and over again; and the questions seem to be tailored specifically for that paragraph.

: I think it is too late to change the layout of the heading of this book; but perhaps it is possible to correct the next book; the Dinosaurs book, to have a better layout. IMO, it is a minor thing anyway, so it isn't anything that is glaringly bad. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:18, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Images ==

Hello. This looks really impressive, obviously a lot of work has gone into it so far, so congratulations guys. However... is it right to include images in the PDF with no attribution or source/licensing information? Maybe you need to append another page with this information. eg. &quot;p7. Graphic: Lion. Available at: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Lion.jpg . Author: Foo (English Wikibooks User:Foo). License: Bar (see http://blahblah.com for full terms and conditions).&quot;

Also, can I suggest you please tighten the belt wrt images. From going through the wiki-version of this book, these images have some problems: 

* [[:Image:Rockylion.jpg]] Little bit suspect, very low res for a &quot;self&quot; created image. Images with &quot;-self&quot; licenses should always be the high-res originals.
* [[:Image:Leoni-cuccioli.jpg]] License on Flickr is &quot;all rights reserved&quot;. It is possible that the uploader lied/made a mistake, or that the Flickr person changed the license.
*[[:Image:Female lion.jpg]] This lists en.wikibooks as the source but there is no such file at en.wikibooks. If it got deleted, the source information should be recovered and transferred to the Commons.
* [[:Image:Lion zoo antwerp 1280.jpg]] The source is a website in Dutch, so I can't be certain, but it certainly has a lot of copyright symbols on it. The condition &quot;Inform the photographer before any use of this image.&quot; is also a non-free condition - it is fine to request to be informed, but you can't require it.
* [[:Image:White tigers drinking.jpg]] Same Flickr problem, tagged CC-BY, flickr says CC-BY-NC-SA (NC is non-free)
* [[:Image:Tigercub.jpg]] has no source, thus its license cannot be verified.
* [[:Image:Tigers playing in water.jpg]] non-free license (&quot;notify&quot; - as I mentioned above, requiring notification before use is not free). I asked the uploader if she would consider changing it.
* [[:Image:Panthers.jpg]] no source.
* [[:Image:Young leopard.jpg]] the source website has taken down their images due to legal threats from the zoo! the author also explicitly disallows commercial use.
* [[:Image:Leopard on the tree.jpg]] incomplete source information (only lists another Wikimedia project - though the info is there, it just should be transferred)
* [[:Image:Jaguarcub.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Snowcub.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Cloudedleopard.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Cloudcub.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Swiftcheetah.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Marbledcat.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Huntcheetah.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Cheetahcub.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Puma.jpg]] needs an exact source
* [[:Image:Puma lying.jpg]] non-free condition (notification required)
* [[:Image:Calvinkleinobsession.jpg]] well this is copyrighted... I would not think putting it in a book would be a great idea. Perhaps you could use a generic kind of cologne-looking-bottle image instead?
* [[:Image:Ocelotkitten.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Rustyspottedcat.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Caracalkitten.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Servalcat.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Servalkitten.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Manul.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Manulkitten.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:European wild cat.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Sandcat.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Bertramliger.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Proailurus.jpg]] assrted as self-made but I would like to see a bit more information about how exactly it was made...
* [[:Image:Egyptcat.jpg]] very low-res for a &quot;self-made&quot; photograph
* [[:Image:Balicolor.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Clearcutforest.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Likecameras.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Tuckingin.jpg]] no source
* [[:Image:Nalaplaying.jpg]] no source

These &quot;no source&quot; images are obviously the most pressing. Most (all?) of them are uploaded to Wikibooks directly. Some, it's possible the author just forgot to say &quot;I took this image/self-made/Taken with [X camera]&quot; etc. Others look very much just &quot;grabbed off the net&quot;.

To prove &quot;self-made&quot; images (images with &quot;-self&quot; licenses), I ask the uploader to upload the original high-resolution image over the top of the thumbnail. Maybe you should consider doing the same. 

Regards, [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 14:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:A couple points of observation here.  First of all, some &quot;self-made&quot; photographs may be from a very cheap camera and therefor may be low-res as well... or be cropped from some other image that was owned by the contributor.  By itself low-res images shouldn't be dismissed although I do think questioning the attribution is appropriate.

:The other thing to consider is that this Wikibook is older (indeed the oldest of all Wikijunior books) and some of the images listed above predate the attribution requirements.  While not an excuse that can be used for newer images, but it was presumed that all image uploads, like text contributions, conformed with the GFDL in some way.  This has proven to be problematic and that unfortunately users couldn't be trusted to make this sort of determination.  I agree that this sort of image should be still questioned, as you have done above, and if an appropriate substitute can be found, it should be.  Any images that have been uploaded more recently than about a year ago should definitely be questioned and even have a {{tl|copyvio}} notice put on them.

:Apparently some Wikibooks content has been deleted by a certain overzealous Wikibooks admin for things like [[:Image:Female lion.jpg]].  I've tried to be more careful about stuff like this, but this has indeed turned into a circular reference that goes to nowhere.  For this particular image, I found the source of the image, which was the Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Government, which puts the image into the public domain.  I wonder how many images like this have been culled from Wikibooks accidentally?  Please drop me (or other admins) a line if you need help looking through the edit history for deleted images like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

== How do cats raise their young? ==

In following the idea of being bold, I have created a whole page dedicated to talking about how cats raise their young. The reason I did this is because, in many ways, the method is similar over all cats. So rather than have one or two sentences under some species where actual reproductive information is limited, we can generalize and talk about all of the cats. Of course, there are some exceptions to these generalizations. In some cases, these can be mentioned on this page. (In the case of lions, I believe that the pride behavior of the lions would be best talked about on the lions page, so this page does not talk about them in detail. The lions page may have to be reconstructed more than the rest of the other pages due to this change.)

I have not removed the corresponding parts from the rest of the pages yet, as I'm waiting for everyone else to give their feedback. However, if you compare this ONE page to the sum of all the corresponding parts that answer this question, it is about a third of the current amount of text used. On top of that, many of the pages do not have very complete information about how cats raise their young in the first places. But because, as I said before, we can generalize over many of the cat species, a child can learn about ALL the cats, rather than a good amount about some cats and almost nothing about others. 

Of course, it is not finished yet. It's not formatted to the rest of the book (I don't know what order to put it in the pages, anyway). It might benefit from some more information, and it also doesn't have an introduction to the section. I also didn't include any pictures, but I assume we can use some of the images from the other pages. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 03:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

== So how is this book being distributed? ==

Everyone did a great job--but are there going to be any readers?

== With still missing ==

I don't know if you guys missed the previous anon's comments, or what, but the PDF version of the book is still missing the word &quot;with&quot; in several places, and there may be other words missing.  I hope you don't (didn't)? go to print with such obvious mistakes.  [[User:128.227.68.119|128.227.68.119]] 15:46, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

I'd like to echo the previous comments. The pdf has repeated blatent word omissions, which is quite unsatisfactory. Whoever is taking ownership of the pdf, please fix this. The text appears correct in the articles.

Examples:
*&quot;Their [bite] is very strong...&quot; under &quot;What do pumas eat and how do they catch their prey?&quot;
*&quot;All of them have [white] bellies.&quot; under &quot;What do lynx look like?&quot;

Saying &quot;All of them have bellies.&quot; makes Wikibooks look idiotic.

== move protection ==

the page is move-protected, but should now be moved to [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]] // [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[:meta:user talk:tsca|[re]]] 20:20, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== Browser Display Problem ==
This page does not display nicely in Firefox. Near the end where the 'PROPOSAL FOR FRONT COVER' is the page all merges and runs off to the right of the browser. Simple attempts to correct did not bring success.

== Putting WikiJunior Books up at Hindi Wikibooks for translation ==

The Hindi Wikibooks community at hi.wikibooks.org is very inactive right now.

I guess translating already completed wikijunior books and working on such well defined projects might allow the community to develop over time. Any thoughts/comments/suggestions/words of advice before the said translation request is put up on Hindi Wikibooks?

== Proofreading of [[Wikijunior Solar System/Pluto|Pluto]] Completed by [[User:Shanel|Shanel]] ==

[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] has checked off all of the tasks for [[Wikijunior Solar System/Pluto|Pluto]].  Could everyone please review this module?  Did the proofreading process work?  Is [[Wikijunior Solar System/Pluto|Pluto]] now ready to be read by our target audience?

Let's hear a big cheer for [[User:Shanel|Shanel]]!

== Proofing and getting ready for publication ==

[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] has pointed out that it is time to start proofreading this book.  We need to come up with a sensible process for the entire proofreading process, not just the fact checking.  I have boldly moved the discussion, because I think it is going to get long.

[[/Proofreading|Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading]]

==Important -- Books for Evacuees by October 3==
Hi. This book looks absolutely wonderful right now, and I think that with a concentrated effort, we can get it ready for publication and printed within 3 weeks. I am going to suggest the following time table:
* September 10 - missing pieces identified
* September 18 - all material written
* September 22 - all material fact checked, edited, and copyedited
* October 1 - professional layout completed.
* October 3 - printing
This can serve as a model copy, which can then be distributed to children in shelters across the southeastern US. Comments are welcome. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 03:12, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:In terms of what content needs to be proofed, let's just stick to the standard 9 planets, comets, asteroids, the Sun, and the intro sections alone.  In other words, leave the seperate sections of the moons (except for the Earth's moon perhaps) out as well as the extended appendix sections.  The Glossary really needs to be fixed up quite a bit, particularly with the hyperlinks removed and a systematic inclusions of a '''bolded''' words in the text of the articles that need definitions.&lt;p&gt;I would still like to see a &quot;full&quot; Wikijunior Solar System with all of the larger moons, perhaps even a few asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects added in with updated knowledge due to advanced exploration of those worlds, but that is going to have to be a version &quot;2.0&quot; update, IMHO.  It will be easier if we try to stick to the basics here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

Well, that's a LOT of work.  In order to meet that timeline, we will have to
* Stop adding material and start the proofreading process
* Recruit lots of help
* Use the GAT to compile our glossary.
I don't think we can meet Danny's proposed schedule without LOTS of help.
LOTS. 
I propose putting ALL of our modules immediately into the &quot;Proofreading&quot; mode without doing any consensus-checking.  Certainly not for a WEEK.
And recruiting for help at Wikipedia's fact-checking project.
--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 13:33, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:What's the big rush? Why not allow a year to pass and let this work mature? :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 22:12, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

It's about the grant money.  I have been asking for somebody (anybody!) to post the complete PRIMARY SOURCE MATERIAL of the Beck Foundation grant SOMEPLACE (on WikiMediaFoundation, on the wikijunior page, wherever).  But I think the grant is contingent on a December deliverable.  (Don't quote me on that.  I don't know anything.)  So if we push to get it out 3 October we have 2 months of slip.  

Which we would likely need, at the rate we are moving.  The facts have not been checked.  The copy needs to be edited, and brought down to an appropriate reading level.  Great quantities of material need to be removed.  Every time I turn around, somebody is adding material.  The &quot;Kiki&quot; task force needs to choose an artist, who then needs to get started on selected illustrations.

I wonder who it was that decided to apply for the grant, and how they came up with a timeline predicting that an as-yet-undetermined group of Wikizens would colonize the project and complete a book by December 2005?

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:57, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:Grant? Okay. Well I hope you don't mind but I went through and updated the little completion icons on the main page. There are still a few that are far from completion, particularly the moons of Jupiter (about which we know a fair amount.) Some of the terminology I'm seeing tossed around is bordering on college level (palimsest, synchronous rotation, arachnoid, regolith, and siderial day, for example.) :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 19:21, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

I don't mind at all.  Whatever you can do to advance the book is good.  Though we probably don't need to add a lot of content right now.  The book is already &gt; 48 pages.  I hope the proofreading process I proposed is well-designed to catch all of these things.  Any input you can give on that is appreciated, as well. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 22:48, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:Well I guess if I were looking to shorten it, I would consider merging all of those separate moon pages together. For example &quot;Moons of Saturn&quot; and &quot;Moons of Mars&quot;. Each moon could then just have a single section, instead of lots of somewhat sparse pages. (But a few moons probably deserve their own pages, such as Io, Europa, and Titan.) :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 20:36, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, merging the moon pages together is a great idea. Alot of the pages aren't very full, but the moons still deserve some mention. And some information, like &quot;What is it made of?&quot; and &quot;Who discovered it?&quot; is repetitive for alot of moons. Hopefully, if we ever get to do a version 2.0 Wikijunior Solar System, we'll have alot more information from Cassini and we can include all the moon pages. :)--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 01:08, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

I think there is officially no way to make the deadline [[User:Danny]] has set us.  Why October 3?  I wish I could get more information about this grant ...--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 23:04, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

== Beck Foundation proposal ==

This is more of an FYI about the Beck Foundation Grant.  Details can be found here: [[m:Wikijunior/proposal to Beck Foundation]]

The Beck Foundation can be found here:  &lt;strike&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ahbeck.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/beckbio.html (the previous link...plasterd all over Meta...has nothing to do with the Beck Foundation that is dealing with this proposal)

Yet more details can be found here: [[m:WQ/2/grants]]

I hope this help out.  There was a little bit of discussion on Foundation-l, but I think it is rehashing the content listed above, as well as what can be found on [[m:Wikijunior]].  I don't know who wrote the grant, or when the terms need to be completed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:17, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

[[m:Wikijunior/proposal to Beck Foundation]] Says that they're hoping to print a booklet on the topic of animals in December. Seeing as how we're proofreading Solar System and not Big Cats, that's not happening anymore? --[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 21:48, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

:Based on user participation and the fact that the Big Cats volume seems to be struggling right now, I would have to say that the Solar System Wikibook is going to be the first one out of the gate.  Wikijunior South America is struggling as well, with a couple of countries that havn't even had any real substance added to them, while the Big Cats does seem to be coming together, but with not nearly as many articles overall.  The Big Cats book may have been just too narrow of a topic compared to the other topics for Wikijunior.&lt;p&gt;Assuming that we get it done and ready, I'm still not sure exactly who is going to do the printing and the specifics on where everything is going to go.  Those details (critical in terms of how the grant money is supposedly going to be given to the Wikimedia Foundation) are conspicuously missing right now.  On the other hand, this Wikibook seems so close to a publishable state that the status of the Beck Foundation is irrelevant, and I would like to see this published anyway and offered to some elementary schools.  If we can get the quality of this up, there are a couple of other companies that I am thinking of hitting up myself to seek funding.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:03, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

Which Beck foundation is funding this grant?  [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] here says it is the [http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/beckbio.html Lewis H. Beck foundation], while [[meta:User:Sj]] suggested on the[[wikimediafoundation:Talk:Benefactors#Beck foundation full name|Benefactors talk page]] that it is the [http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:-CbA3epNgucJ:www.thebeckfoundation.org/ John and Frances Beck Foundation].

:It's the John and Frances Beck Foundation. This was confirmed today by Michael Davis who checked the name on the $10,000 check they sent us. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 19:21, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== zodiacal symbols ==

Do we really want to explain the origins of the symbols for Venus and Mars?  We could bowdlerize and talk about mirrors and spears, but from what I understand they symbolize genitals...which might cause trouble if the book is given out in the Bible belt.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 07:11, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
:There is a lot more to the world than the bible belt. I don't think we should worry too much. Tasteful rather than bowdlerised is the way to go when writing for children. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 19:38, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

The symbol for Venus -- isn't it the fertility figure?  Much like the African fertility figure with the large head, small torso, and small arms?  But that's not important right now.  Any discussion of fertility symbols and genitals would add nothing to kids' understanding of the solar system, any more than any discussion of any of the other zodiacal symbols would.  Would we have to include (considering that some of the readers are 4th graders) an explanation of what genitals are used for?  It's all a bit off-topic.  I don't think Bowdlerisation is at issue.  We are not removing the sexy bits from a great work of literature.  We are trying to write a book about the solar system.  And the book is already too long.  We can write &quot;questions and answers about sex&quot; another time.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 22:56, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:The symbol for Venus is a woman's mirror (the cross on the bottom is the handle).  Mars is a &quot;warrior&quot; carrying a shield (hence the arrow to the right... or the left.  The Moon is obvious.  The Earth is the geographic globe with prime meridian and equator.  Jupiter is a stylized lightning bolt.  Mercury has the &quot;wings&quot; on the head from Hermes.  Pluto is actually the initials for Perceval Lowell, the discover of the planet (actually Tombaugh, but Lowell got credit back elsewhen).  As for Bible belt objections, I think we need to worry more about the images of the dieties themselves.  I got some strong objections to a printed version of this Wikibook with the image of Venus and Neptune.  Neptune shows everything but genitalia, and you can almost pick out pubic hairs.  Good classical art, but this isn't an art book, nor should it be.  Some suggestions were made to simply crop out the crotch and breast areas, as the Venus picture is already cropped from the original.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
::The symbol for Venus is based on the [[w:Ankh]], though.  I know that a lot of ankh shaped mirrors were produced in Egypt way back when, but it's a pre-bronze age symbol.  I've seen a lot more big-hipped fertility figures than big-headed ones, btw...the Ankh article, anyway, says that the top two competing theories are &quot;womb&quot; and &quot;sandal strap&quot;, and I for one think the former is a lot more feminine.  But if you don't want to dig too deeply into the origins of those symbols, it's probably best both from a standpoint of length and of focus.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 05:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== What Wikipedia Means to Me==

Hey there fellow [[Wikipedia:Wikipedian|Wikipedians]]. I stumbled onto wikipedia sometime in [[September]] of [[2004]] and have been an active member ever since. Obviously the idea of what we are creating here is something really special even though some may not realize it. The idea of creating a society of so many unique individuals and to share the wealth of knowledge that these individuals posess is really extraordinary. To be a member of such a society makes one feel important as they are a part of something so tremendously large. Hopefully there are others who feel the same way, and can understand the importance of what we are doing and creating.

I am also a co-owner of [http://www.curbmasterenterprises.com]

Ok, so in case you havn't guessed my real name is Lars which comes from a Danish backgound. I have in fact lived in Denmark for short periods of time throughout my life (hence the editing on [[Cuisine of Denmark]]). In addition to Denmark I have spent quite a bit of time in southern France and happen to currently live in British Columbia, Canada. My major interest is biology but my passion is food. I currently am employed in the wireless telecommunications industry.

Other things i like: novels, the natural and super-natural, scary/horror films, geography, the universe, technology, Civilization III for pc, and oh ya, Wikipedia.

2|Sun Facts&lt;br&gt;WARNING: Never look directly at the Sun; it can hurt and damage your eyes.|=

*If you looked at the Sun in a telescope, you could risk blindness
*The Sun is 150,000,000 km (93 million miles) away from Earth.
*The Sun's light takes 8 minutes to reach us on Earth. That means that if the Sun blew up, we wouldn't see it blow up until 8 minutes later!
*Every second, the Sun turns over 4 million metric tons of gas into energy. That's 881,849,000,000 pounds!
*The Sun is as wide as 109 Earths.
}}
The Sun is a star &amp;mdash; the closest star to Earth.  It is a large ball of very hot gas in a (plasma) state.  The air we breathe and the helium in a balloon are both gases. It is over 5,500 °C at the surface, and much hotter at the center, about 15 million °C.  The Sun is made of mostly hydrogen (70%) and helium (28%).  It turns many tons of hydrogen into helium every second, thus creating heat and light.

The Sun makes light and heat that warms the surface of the Earth and allows plants to grow.  We can get food from plants, and we can burn wood and other parts of plants to cook, warm our houses, and make cars go.  Without the Sun there could not be any life on Earth. 


===How big is the Sun?===
The Sun is very big &amp;mdash; much, MUCH bigger than the Earth!  Even the mighty planet Jupiter is small by comparison.  It is more than a million km (109 Earths) across and contains about 99.86% of the Solar System's mass.  If you could stand on the surface of the Sun, you would weigh 28 times as much as you do on Earth because the Sun has more mass and therefore more gravitational pull than earth.

More than a million Earths could fit beneath the surface of the Sun.  It doesn't look that big from Earth, though.  That's because the Sun is so far away.  Compared to other stars, the Sun is about average-sized.  There are much bigger stars, and much smaller stars.

A very thin ''solar wind'' of charged particles blows from the Sun all the way to the edge of the Solar System.  When it gets there, the gases mix with those coming from other stars.

===What is the surface like? ===
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole Sun is made out of gases, fire, and plasma. The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun. The outer-part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means &quot;ball of light&quot;.  We call it the surface of the Sun because that's where most of the light we see comes from. There is actually a lot of material from the Sun above the photosphere, and some of the gas is even blasted away to great distances.

==How does the sun make light and heat?==

The Sun is the main source of energy for the Earth. This energy is made deep inside the Sun in a process called ''nuclear fusion''. Four hydrogen &lt;b&gt;atoms&lt;/b&gt; are fused together to make one helium atom. Some of the leftover matter turns into energy. This is the same way energy is released in a hydrogen bomb.

[[Image:Inside the sun.PNG|380px|What is going inside the Sun.  The different colors show the different regions.]]

'''Core''': The center of the Sun is very dense.  It's about 12 times as dense as lead.  That means that a gallon of the gas from the core of the Sun would weigh half a ton.  It's also very hot &amp;mdash; about 15,000,000 °C.  This region is where most of the nuclear reactions are taking place.

'''Radiative zone''': In this zone the light and heat produced in the core fight their way out towards the surface. The gases that make up the zone are very dense and keep absorbing and emitting the rays. Have you ever tried to run through water? That's what it's like for light waves in this region of the Sun. Light can't go very far at all before it runs into something. Then it bounces off in a different direction. The light doesn't get very far this way. It can take a single ray of light a million years to get out of this zone.

'''Convection zone''': Have you ever seen the air shimmer above a fire? Perhaps you've been told it's because heat rises? Actually, it is the hot air that is rising. Hot gases get less dense and rise.  Cold gases get denser and sink. In this zone, the gases are less dense.  They behave like air in a fireplace.  Gas at the bottom of the zone gets heated up from below.  It rises to the surface, gives off its heat to space, and sinks again.  The gas in the convection zone forms currents like those in Earth’s oceans and atmosphere.  The currents are called ''convection cells''.

==What are sunspots?==

[[Image:Sunspot.gif|thumb|200px|The dark areas are sunspots]]
Sunspots are dark spots on the Sun, but they are still brighter than lightning.  Sunspots look darker than the rest of the Sun because they are a little cooler.  Even though sunspots are cooler than the rest of the Sun, they are still hot &amp;mdash; about 4000 °C (7000 °F). Sunspots are caused by changes in the Sun’s magnetic field. The magnetic field stops convection, which causes the sunspot areas to cool off and become darker. Sunspots usually form in groups which are carried around the Sun as it rotates.

The number of sunspots we see goes up and down in a cycle of average length about 11 years.

==What is the Solar Atmosphere like?==

Above the photosphere, the Sun’s gases are not very dense at all.  There are two layers that we can see with special telescopes.  Above that, gases stream out as ''solar wind'' that reaches to the edge of the Solar System.

[[en:Image:Sunspot_TRACE.jpeg|left|200px|thumb|A closeup view of a sunspot and prominences]]

=== Prominences and solar flares ===

If you have a telescope with special filters, you can see bumps around the edge of the Sun.  Each one of these is called a ''prominence''.  They look like volcanoes erupting.  They are hundreds or thousands of kilometers long.  Some are bigger than the Earth.  They often seem to come from sunspots.  Sometimes they get so far away from the Sun that they fly away from it.  Then they are called ''solar flares''.

=== Chromosphere ===

''Chromosphere'' means &quot;color ball&quot;.  It is just above the photosphere.  It is not as bright as the photosphere, and you can’t normally see it.  But you can see it just before a solar eclipse (only with special filters!).  It looks like a flash of all the colors of light.  Surprisingly, the Chromosphere is even hotter than the photosphere, at some parts over 20,000 °C. 

=== Corona ===
[[Image:Solar_eclipse_1999_4.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Sun's corona during an eclipse]]
''Corona'' means &quot;crown.&quot;  That is what pictures of the corona look like.  It is just above the chromosphere.  It is hotter than the photosphere, and it glows.  It is made of thin gases, and blows away as solar wind.  It shifts and changes, but it is hard to see, even with special telescopes.

=== Solar wind ===
At the top of the corona, some of the gas blows out as solar wind.  It blows fast &amp;mdash; about 60 km per second (more than 100,000 miles per hour).  But there isn’t very much of it. The solar wind is strong enough to push dust and gas away from a comet to make a tail.

The solar wind can even push big things.  In 1960, the satellite Echo I was put into orbit.  It was a large balloon.  Since it was so large and light, the solar wind pushed it around in its orbit.  In the future, some space craft may use the solar wind to travel between planets using ''solar sails'' similar to the way sailboats use the Earth's wind in their sails to cross the ocean.
=== Heliopause ===
[[en:Image:Heliopause_diagram.png|thumb|left|200px|Heliopause: where the solar wind hits the edge of the Solar System]]
''Heliopause'' is where the solar wind hits the wind from other stars.  Near here, the solar wind slows down suddenly.  In May 2005, the Voyager I spacecraft went through this region and felt a big bump.  It is now just inside the heliopause.  Because this happens so far from Earth, it is hard to study!
&lt;br&gt;

== What is solar weather? ==

Did you know the Sun has weather?  Earth weather is what is going on in Earth’s atmosphere.  ''Solar weather'' is what’s going on in the Sun’s atmosphere.  Solar weather affects us on Earth.  Solar weather (also called space weather) includes sunlight and the solar wind.

Solar flares shoot a lot of very hot gas out from the Sun.  If a solar flare is aimed towards Earth, protons &amp;mdash; subatomic particles with positive electric charge &amp;mdash; might be shot at Earth at high speed, and a ''solar storm'' could result.  That could cause electrical blackouts or block radio signals.  It could damage satellites in orbit.  Radiation from a bad solar storm could be very dangerous for astronauts, so they must be protected.  The Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere usually protect us from flares.

[[Image:Aurora1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Northern Lights]]
Solar flares can also cause an ''aurora''.  Auroras look like beautiful curtains of shimmering light.  They are called Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) if they are near the North Pole.  They are called Southern Lights (Aurora Australis) if they are near the South Pole.  Solar weather affects other planets, too.  We have pictures of auroras on every planet except Mercury and Pluto.

Just like we can get Earth weather forecasts, we can get Solar weather forecasts.  Forecasters study the Sun to figure out when flares will happen.  They try to tell when solar storms will hit Earth.  They also try to tell when solar storms will go to other parts of the Solar System.

== The life cycle of a star ==
[[Image:Solar Life Cycle.svg|600px|thumb|left|Life Cycle Of Our Sun]] 
A forming sun's life starts out as a nebula; this is a cloud of gas made up mostly of hydrogen. Over time the nebula contracts; its core becomes more and more compact and hotter until it can fuse hydrogen to helium.  This fusion becomes its power source. After this, the star will look very much like our sun. They fuse hydrogen atoms together to make helium atoms. 
[[File:Sun red giant.svg|200px|thumb|right|A comparison between the sizes of the Sun as it is now, and how it will be as a red giant.]]
After billions of years, this star will die. The star will exhaust its supply of hydrogen in its core, so that there will no longer be any source of heat to support the core against gravity.  The core shrinks, and the hydrogen starts to burn in a shell around the core.  The outer layers of the star swell and cool, creating a red giant. This is all with an ordinary star and will be the life cycle of our sun, although the process may vary from star to star. When our sun becomes a red giant it will consume Mercury and Venus, and possibly the Earth. The sun will then begin a cycle of expansion and contraction, puffing away its outer atmosphere as the solar system becomes a planetary nebula. Once the sun can not longer sustain fusion, it will collapse down and condense into a white dwarf star. At this stage the light it emits is the left over energy of our dead sun, radiating the residual heat until eventually the white dwarf cools and darkens.

==Exploration of the Sun==
Early space probes designed to collect information about the sun were NASA's Pioneers 5 through 9 and the Helios 1 and 2.  Those were in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.  They collected a lot of data about the Sun.  Other projects observed the Sun from Earth orbit, such as a Japanese satellite launched in 1991 called Yohkoh, which means ''Sunbeam'' in English.  It told scientists more about solar flares, and activity on the sun's surface.  Thanks to Yohkoh, they knew more about how to classify solar flares, and whether or not they will cause electrical disturbance on Earth or not.  Two important missions to study Sun are called the ''Solar and Heliospheric Observatory'' (SHO) and the ''Solar Dynamics Observatory'' (SDO).  They have taken many pictures of the Sun, along with discovering many comets near the Sun. All of these observations were across the Sun's equator.  The first space probe to observe the Sun's poles was named ''Ulysses'', after a famous Greek king who traveled on a very, very long voyage.  The Ulysses probe went all the way to Jupiter before approaching the Sun.  It took a famous picture of the comet ''Shoemaker-Levy-9'' colliding with Jupiter.

A. Poland&lt;br&gt;
B. Czechoslovakia&lt;br&gt;
C. Spain&lt;br&gt;
D. Hungary&lt;br&gt;
E. Austria&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

'''Practice Essay topic (40 min. recommended writing time):'''&lt;br&gt;
During the period of 1918-1939, dictatorships came to power in many countries around the world.  Select TWO of the following and discuss the causes and effects of these dictatorships during this period.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Soviet Union&lt;br&gt;
Germany&lt;br&gt;
Italy&lt;br&gt;
Spain
----

1. '''C''' While the Nazi Party did help bring about the end of the Weimar Republic, the real problem was the inability of coalition governments to form, not their failure to control the Nazis.

2. '''D''' Remember that Joseph Stalin hoped to collectivize the entire agricultural sector of the Soviet Union as a means of increasing production (which, incidentally, had the complete opposite effect).

3. '''B''' Only Nazi Germany, as part of fascism, practiced a policy of racial discrimination, and therefore needed to convince their people that they were right to do so.

4. '''B''' Remember: Joeseph Piludaski in Poland, Francisco Franco in Spain, Richard Dreyfuss in Austria, and - in Hungary.

Essay: '''Soviet Union'''-discuss the policies of Lenin, but concentrate on Stalin and the five-year plans.  Include information concerning Stalin's methods of pitting allies against each other and switching sides, and discuss her terror tactics and mass murder and imprisonment of Soviet citizens.  '''Germany'''- discuss the Weimar Republic and the disatisfaction with its policies, the Great Depression, and the hatred caused by the Treaty of Versailles.  Discuss Hitler's domestic policies, including remilitarization, racial policies, and political liberties.  Make sure and discuss the how Hitler's dictatorship ignited World War II and/or appeasement.  '''Italy'''- discuss Mussolini's radical agenda, the ineffective coalition governments (extra points if you mention proportional representation), and his Blackshirt's bullying techniques and how he played on the fear of communism.  Also discuss domestic policies, especially the stress on having large families and expanding agricultural production to feed them.  Relate this policy with Italy's military buildup and its invasions of Ethiopia (especially) and possibly Albania.  '''Spain'''- discuss the weakness of the Republican government and support for Franco among the military and private business.  Discuss his domestic changes, the cost of the civil war, and Spain's foreign policy.  Good essays will mention ''Guernica'' by Picasso.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The appearance of any object we see is determined in large part by the light that reaches your eye from each point on the object's surface. It is affected by the characteristics of the light reflected from the surface, the coloration of the surface, and any intervening translucent media (such as an atmosphere). Celestia uses mathematical models to calculate these effects, manipulating data which describe the relevant characteristics of each light source, and each point on the surface of each illuminated object. In reality, that's an enormous amount of data, and for Celestia compromises must be made.

In many cases, Celestia uses images as &quot;maps&quot; to provide the needed information describing the characteristics of the object's surface. Each point on a map corresponds to a point on the surface. Celestia uses image files to determine how the corresponding point on the surface of the object should appear. This process is called '''texture mapping'''. If you see an analogy here with the kinds of maps you're familiar with from school, it's no coincidence. The term ''map'' is used here with something very close to its conventional meaning. 

The term ''texture'' may seem a bit puzzling in this context. It comes from the original usage of the technique in early computer graphics. At that time, because of hardware limitations, only very small images could be used, and so they could cover only a very small part of the surface of an object. However, a single small image could be used repeatedly to cover a large area of an object, giving it a textured appearance. Celestia generally uses a single texture image to cover the entire surface of an object, some of which are the size of planets. Technology has come a long way!

==Image basics==
===Concepts===
Since texture mapping relies on image data, we'll begin with a brief review of basic image concepts. A digital image is essentially a rectangular grid of cells, called pixels (short for &quot;picture element&quot;). Each pixel has a specific digital value. The pixel values are commonly used to represent colors, but can be used for any kind of information. The number of possible values which any pixel can have is called the &quot;depth&quot; of the image. The depth of an image is usually expressed as a number of bits. The more bits provided, the greater the precision of the data representation. The (spatial) resolution of an image is determined by the number of rows and columns of pixels it contains. The more rows and columns, the higher the resolution of the image. Unfortunately, the more rows and columns of pixels, and the more bits per pixel, the greater the amount of storage needed for the image. Image file formats often include compression techniques to reduce the storage requirements, but this can lead to a loss of information, resulting in reduced quality.

===Artistic development of textures===
Since textures actually are pictures, you can use your favorite paint program to create them. Often public domain photographs by NASA can be used as starting points for surface textures of imaginary planets.

===Preserving quality===
It's usually best to work at a resolution that's at least twice the resolution that you'll be providing in an Addon. When scaled down, the results look much better than if you'd been working at the final resolution. Also, be sure to save your intermediate results using an image format that preserves the detail. Do not use either DDS or JPEG formats for anything other than the final released product.

==Texture File Formats==
Celestia supports three image file formats for textures: PNG , JPEG and DDS. Because of their differing characteristics, the different file formats are more suitable for some applications than others.
=== PNG ===
PNG, short for Portable Network Graphics, is a lossless compression format, i.e. it reproduces the original image without change. PNG images can contain an 8-bit alpha layer, which is used to determine where the image is transparent (think of a cloud-layer). Because it offers perfect quality and alpha layer, PNG can be used for all purposes in Celestia. However it typically has the biggest filesizes and may be a bad choice for textures offered for download. PNG is supported by all but the oldest image manipulation programs.

=== JPEG ===
JPEG (initials of Joint Photographic Experts Group, often shortened to JPG) is designed for a good visual appearance and a high compression ratio. It introduces small differences compared to the original image, but this is rarely visible when using default or better quality when saving the JPEG image. The JPEG format is well suited for surface textures, especially when the filesize has to be kept small, as for downloads. JPEG is supported by practically all image manipulation programs. Unfortunately, JPEG does not support an alpha channel, so it cannot be used for textures that require transparency.

=== DDS ===
DDS, short for Direct Draw Surface, supports several different specialized formats. Most relevant for Celestia are DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5. DDS is different from JPEG and PNG in several ways, as it's not a format typically used to store pictures. Instead it's designed to be used by 3D hardware,  and is directly loaded into your graphics card. Very old graphic cards don't support DDS textures, so not everybody can use them. In some circumstances, DDS can have the worst quality of the supported image formats, considerably worse than JPEG with default compression. It also is not highly compressed, e.g. 1:6 for DXT1.

Why is it used then? Because the compression of DDS textures also works after the image was loaded. Let's take a 2048x1024 image as an example. When stored as PNG or JPEG, an image may take little space on the harddisk (200 kB for JPEG, 1-2 MB for PNG), but once  loaded into memory, it would expand to width*height*3 Bytes = 6MB. A DDS image will take only 1/6th of this, on disk as well as in memory. So you can use more or higher-resolution textures without hurting performance. Furthermore, DDS images don't have to be decompressed by the CPU, so loading is considerably faster too. This is very important when approaching planets which haven't had their textures loaded yet, and for Virtual Textures.

Because of their relatively low quality and the kind of artifacts the compression causes, DDS textures are generally unsuited for Normalmaps. Nevertheless, a specialized NormalMap format has been defined by Nvidia which uses a special DXT5 encoding. Celestia calls this format DXT5nm.

A DDS file usually includes several texture images, called &quot;mipmaps&quot;. They are progressively lower-resolution versions of the primary image, automatically created by the software used to create DDS file. The graphics hardware chooses the mipmap that best fits the size of the object on the screen, minimizing the number of pixels that have to be rescaled and thus improving the graphics frame-rate.

(additional details of the DXT formats is needed here)

==Celestia Texture Map Types==
The following are some of the different types of texture maps used by Celestia:

===Surface Texture Maps===
A '''Texture''' is like a photograph of the surface, looking much like a conventional map of the world. If the image file used as surface texture contains an Alpha layer (usually used to indicate transparency), this layer is used by Celestia as the object's specular texture map.

===Specular Texture Maps===
A JPG, PNG or DDS '''SpecularTexture''' controls which parts of a planetary surface seem to be shiny and which do not by causing a bright highlight to be drawn. In the texture image, white indicates areas which will display a highlight. Black indicates areas with no highlights. It can be very effective in showing a watery surface on an Oceanic planet.

When using a '''SpecularTexture''', both '''SpecularColor''' and '''SpecularPower''' must also be specified. See the chapter on [[Celestia/SSC_File|SSC Catalog files]] for more information.

Specular reflection highlights are visible only in Celestia's OpenGL Vertex Program and OpenGL 2.0 render paths. The graphics hardware must support OpenGL v1.4 or better.

===Normal Texture Maps===
A '''NormalMap''' is not &quot;normal&quot; in the sense of being a conventional map. Rather, it defines surface normal vectors: it contains information about the slope of the surface at each point in the texture image. This makes it possible for Celestia to draw shadows on what actually is a smooth surface, making it look like it contains bumps and creases due to mountains and valleys. This usually is much easier than actually molding craters and mountains into the model.

Shadows drawn by '''NormalMap'''s are visible only in Celestia's OpenGL Vertex Program and OpenGL 2.0 render paths.

Tools for creating these normal maps are available on the [http://www.celestialmatters.org/cm//hosts/home_t00fri/projects/nmtools/ Celestial Matters Website].

===Bump Maps===
A '''BumpMap''' is an alternative to a '''NormalMap'''. It specifies the relative heights of positions on the surface of an object. A pixel corresponding to a position which has the highest altitude is colored white, while the lowest is black. BumpMaps often are created from heightmaps. Internally, Celestia translates BumpMaps into NormalMaps.

When a '''BumpMap''' is used, '''BumpHeight''' must also be specified.

Shadows drawn by '''BumpMap'''s are visible only in Celestia's OpenGL Vertex Program and OpenGL 2.0 render paths.

Also keep in mind that a black &amp; white copy of a texture is NOT a bump map and should not be used as one. Bump maps contain height or altitude data, while a texture is a &quot;photo&quot; with shadows caused by the sun.

For more information, see:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumpmap
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping

=== Cloud Layer Texture Maps===
A '''CloudMap''' is a transparent, or semi-transparent image drawn above the surface '''Texture''', used to render clouds.
A '''Cloudmap''' must be in either png or dds (dtx3 or dxt5) format with an Alpha channel to provide its transparency.
In an [[Celestia/SSC_File|SSC catalog file]] (the properties declaration for the object), one can define the cloud´s height above ground, and the speed at which the clouds move relative to the Surface Texture.

If the '''CloudMap''' is a Virtual Texture, '''CloudSpeed''' must be 0, or the image will appear to be broken.

=== Cloud Layer Normal Maps===

''This feature requires Celestia v1.5.0 or later.''

A '''CloudNormalMap''' adds shadows to the surface of a cloud image, making it appear to be bumpy.

=== Night Light Texture Maps===

A '''NightTexture''' shows what the nightside of an object looks like, with lighted areas caused by cities, erupting volcanoes, forest fires, etc. It should include an Alpha channel to allow the surface Texture map to be seen through the NightTexture, but that isn't required.

==Texture resolution==
The (spatial) '''resolution''' of a texture image is determined by the number of rows and columns of pixels it contains. The more rows and column, the higher the resolution of the image. Most importantly, the higher the resolution of the texture, the more detail it contains, and the closer the distance you can view it from. If you view a texture too closely, it will appear blurry because it does not contain sufficient detail. The higher the resolution of the texture, the closer you can get with a clear view, and the more detail you can see. If a texture is mapped to a planet's surface, the size of the planet together with the resolution of the texture determines how close you can view the planet from with a satisfactory view. A larger planet will require a higher-resolution image to provide comparable detail at the same viewing distance.

As many as three images with identical names but different resolutions can be used for textures if they're put into the subdirectories &lt;tt&gt;textures/lores, textures/medres&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;textures/hires&lt;/tt&gt;. The keyboard commands &quot;r&quot; and &quot;R&quot; can then be used to select among them.

It is common to refer to the texture resolution as 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k &lt;i&gt;et cetera&lt;/i&gt;.

'''What this means is:'''

- a 1k texture has a width of 1024 pixels and a height of 512 pixels

- a 2k texture is 2048 x 1024 pixels

- a 4k texture is 4096 x 2048 pixels

... And so on.

Any texture used in Celestia must be a power of two on each side, like the dimensions shown in the above example. This restriction is lifted in Celestia v1.5.0, but works best with graphics cards which support &quot;non-power-of-two&quot; texture sizes. Celestia will shrink textures to fit into cards that don't have that feature, possibly damaging the image significantly.

When a texture becomes very large, it can be advantageous to cut it up into smaller parts, thus creating a Virtual Texture - this economizes on the memory Celestia needs to draw it.

==Virtual Textures==
A '''virtual texture''' is a special texture format used by Celestia to handle very large textures. It is made up of many little textures showing the small details on planets, moons etc.

There are different levels to a virtual texture. The levels are numbered 0 to 10 (12 for v1.4.0 and later). Level 10 is for very fine details and Level 0 is pretty much a global view showing all the major features of Celestia's worlds. Level 0 is made up of 2 images, Level 10 can be made up of thousands of close-up images showing great detail.

A ctx file defines the virtual texture and its filename is used when referring to the virtual texture in ssc files.

For the details of creating a Virtual Texture, see the documentation on the [http://celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/documentation.html Celestia MotherLode].

[[Image:Panthera tigris tigris.jpg|thumb|right|A Bengal tiger]]

Their speed and agility give the '''tiger''' the title of &quot;Top Predator,&quot;  over the larger but slower grizzly bear.  The tiger is the largest and most powerful cat species living today.  A well rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human. The tiger is in the same group ''(Genus Panthera)'' as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.  The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarly, shouted words.

==Where do tigers live?==

[[Image:Tigers.png|thumb|left|Places where tigers live are marked in dark green]]

Tigers live in forests and grasslands of eastern and southeastern Asia. They live in countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, Indonesia (Sumatra), and the Russian Far East.  The Bengal Tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India.

==What do tigers look like?==

[[Image:White_tigers_drinking.jpg|thumb|right|White tigers]]

Like the other big cats, tigers are built much like the much smaller domestic cats that people often have as pets; they are just much bigger and more powerful.  

Tigers are usually orange or reddish orange with very bold, uneven black stripes and white areas on the chest, neck, belly and inside of the legs.  Their stripes act as camouflage, making it difficult for them to be seen when they are among the trees and shrubs of the jungle. The stripes will vary with each individual tiger. 

A tiger usually is about 6 ft to 9 ft in length from nose to tail tip. A large tiger might be 10 ft (3 meters) long. The tail is about 36 inches (91 cm or 3 ft). Tigers weigh about 350 to 550 pounds (160 to 250 kg).

Tigers have very strong teeth and jaws. Their paws are soft and heavily padded, sheathing large, very sharp claws. They also have short, thick, and soft fur and thick long whiskers.

White tigers are those who are born with a certain genetic defect causing loss of pigment in their skin, eyes and fur. These tigers can be white with black, grey, very dark blue, or no stripes; they are not albino.

This loss of pigment is unfortunate for tigers in the wild because their camouflage becomes inadequate. However, this trait may be even more unfortunate for tigers held in captivity. White tigers held in captivity are often forced to breed with their mothers, fathers, siblings, etc. This is usually done to assure that another white tiger cub will be born due to the fact that they are rare and draw in large crowds to zoos, circuses and magic shows.  Because these unusually colored tigers are so beautiful and rare, the majority of the public is oblivious to the horrible effects that inbreeding causes in tiger cubs.

These effects may include: an elevated incidence of recessive genetic diseases; reduced fertility both in litter size and in sperm viability; increased congenital defects such as cryptorchidism, heart defects, cleft palates, fluctuating asymmetry (such as crooked faces, or uneven eye placement and size); lower birthweight; loss of immune system function; slower growth rate, smaller adult size; mental retardation, and an increased risk of infant mortality.

==What do tigers eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Tiger chasing a deer cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Siberian tiger chasing a deer]]
[[Image:Tigergebiss.jpg|thumb|left|Tigers have very strong jaws and dagger-like canine teeth]]
Tigers mostly feed on plant-eaters, or '''herbivores''', like elk, deer, wild pigs, and buffalo.  Like the majority of cats, they are solitary hunters, meaning they hunt alone.  When a tiger has spotted its prey, it may seek out a good location where it can hide, staying close to the ground, and wait for the perfect moment to pounce and ambush its prey. But when prey becomes scarce tigers also hunt peacocks and rabbits.

People who traditionally live in areas where tigers hunt have learned to avoid tiger attacks by wearing a face-mask on the backs of their heads.  Tigers prefer to approach other animals from behind and think twice about pouncing when they can see a face.  Fortunately, they rarely attack humans unless they are too ill to hunt their normal prey. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2980784.stm]. Tigers that attack humans are called ''man-eaters''. Jim Corbett was a famous hunter and conservationist who killed many man-eating tigers in India.

==Fun facts==
* Tigers are striped through and through.  If you were to shave a tiger, and few ever have, you would see the stripes on the skin.  

* Tigers are superb swimmers, unlike most other cats. They have been known to board fishing boats from the waters in which they swim. Usually they swim because they want to cool off.

* No two tigers have exactly the same pattern of stripes.

* The Siberian tiger is the world's largest naturally occurring cat.

* A tiger was once measured to be 13 feet long.

* Although the tiger is best known for killing with its jaws and teeth, a tiger is strong enough (like bears) to kill animals as large as cattle with a swipe of its paw.

* A tiger named Shere Khan is the arch-villain of Rudyard Kipling's ''The Jungle Book'' as the nemesis of the &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli.

* A Bengal tiger named &quot;Richard Parker&quot; is a key character in the novel (and highly-successful movie) &quot;The Life of Pi&quot; who must share a boat with a young man cast adrift at sea after the sinking of a ship during a hurricane.

Before you can use plug-ins, you will either need to download a plug-in or write it yourself.

==Downloading Plug-ins==

A number of plug-ins (plus their source code) can be downloaded off the main OsiriX website at:

&lt;center&gt;http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Plugins.html&lt;/center&gt;

Plug-ins currently available at this location include:

* '''Image Filters'''
** Invert &amp; Web browser
** Duplicate 
** Fill Gaps
** T2 Fit Map

* '''ROI Tools'''
** ROI Enhancement
** ROI Creation
** Ejection Fraction Calculation
** Pixel Normalization

* '''Fusion Filters'''
** CT Angio Subtraction
** Ratio T2 Map

* '''Other Filters'''
** OpenGL

Additionally, some plug-ins are only available as source from the main OsiriX SVN repository over at SourceForge.

* '''Image Filters'''
** [[Online OsiriX Documentation/Using OsiriX Plugins/Align|Align]] ''Tools for the construction of EM image mosaics by manual registration''

* '''ROI Tools'''
** [[Online OsiriX Documentation/Using OsiriX Plugins/Spine Counter|Spine Counter]] ''Label dentritic spines by type and export to text files''
**

==Developing Your Own Plug-ins==

If you are interested in developing your own plug-ins, you may download Osirix [[Online OsiriX Documentation/OsiriX Anonymous and Developer SVN access| source code]] which includes sample plug-ins as well as the [http://osirix.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/osirix/plugins/_help/PluginsManual.pdf OsiriX Plug-ins Developer Toolkit manual].

As Antoine says:

''Writing a plug-in for OsiriX is a really easy process, and it's totally free! The development environment (XCode) is available with any Macs, you just need to install the Developer CD-ROM. You will have to use Objective-C language to write a plug-in. Objective-C is really a great object-oriented and dynamic language (like Java, but much faster!).'' (note: Xcode can also be downloaded for free by becoming a free ADC member at) http://developer.apple.com/membership/

For further details on writing plug-ins, please refer to the step-by-step manual that comes with the Plugin Developer Toolkit, or contact the OsiriX Developers [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/osirix-dev/ Discussion Group].

==Installing Plug-ins==

Once you have a plug-in, the next step is to put your plug-in in an appropriate place where OsiriX can find it.

OsiriX looks in 3 places:

* /Library/Application Support/OsiriX/plugins

* homeDirectory/Library/Application Support/OsiriX/plugins

* OsiriX/Contents/Plugins (This is the application package)

The first location (/Library/Application Support/OsiriX/plugins) is recommended, as this will allow all of the users on your system to use that plug-in.

== Renaming of most of the pages to conform to the naming conventions   --[[User:Drendon|Drendon]] 22:00, 27 Jul 2005 (UTC) ==

I'm planning to move all the pages in all the languages during the weekend (July 30-31, 2005). The new pages will receive names such as Online_OsiriX_Documentation/3-D_reconstructions. I will also update all the links.

Wikibooks has documentation regarding [[Wikibooks:Naming_conventions|the naming conventions]] and [[Wikibooks:How_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page|the procedure I'll follow]]. I will be using the [[Wikibooks:Naming_conventions#The_subpage_convention|subpage convention]].

I will use the Spanish version as a test bed, and follow with the English, French, German and finally the Japanese version. At this time, I will not change the content of any of the pages, only the links. While I'm at this, I'll also change the names of the main pages in English and French, to correctly spell OsiriX.

If anyone has objections or suggestions, please attach them to this entry.


:I'm working at the Wiki's Japanese site. In this English site, two renamed pages have lost redirections to their older named pages. That is in OsiriX HOW TOs, 19.Extract a 3D volume from a series and 20.Working with Curved-MPR, these older pages are [[en:Extract_a_3D_volume_are_from_a_series|19.Extract a 3D volume are from a series]] and [[en:Work_with_Curved-MPR|20.Work with Curved-MPR]]. These japanese pages are now linked to older english pages. May I help the change of links in the japanese pages after your renewal?.   --[[User:Hfuji015|hfuji]] 05:20, 28 Jul 2005 (UTC)


Thanks for the tip on the &quot;lost pages&quot;. I will make sure that they are included again (and with correct titles). Regarding the Japanese pages,  I will certainly appreciate your help very much. As my knowledge of Japanese is basically null, I was planning on prepending &quot;OsiriX オンライン解説文書/&quot; to all titles and fixing the links accordingly, without touching any other characters at all. Even then, chances of me screwing up are higher than with the other languages. Also, there is no way for me to identify currently misspelled titles. It's comforting to know that someone will double check my work. :-)  [[User:Drendon|Drendon]] 00:13:41, 2005-07-29 (UTC)


:All right.  The usage and layouts are same between Wiki's English and Japanese site. If some troubles occur after updating, I will correct them. Take it easy.  --[[User:Hfuji015|hfuji]] 13:00, 29 Jul 2005 (UTC)


OK, I completed all the changes. Everything looks fine, but please check. I rescued the two English pages, along with two lost pages from the French version. [[User:Drendon|Drendon]] 00:27:47, 2005-08-01 (UTC)


:I corrected the linked name of OisirX Developer Overview in the page of Online OsiriX Documentation . No other problems exist in the japanese pages. Great job, thanks!  --[[User:Hfuji015|hfuji]] 12:08, 4 Aug 2005 (UTC)

== Generating DSA Images ==

13 Dec 2005:  Added a HOW TO for generating DSA images.

== No DICOM Conformance Statement = Osirix is not DICOM compliant ==

Many Osirix users request support from their modality vendors (GE, Siemens, Agfa, Philips and others) when they run into problems interfacing their modality to Osirix.  However, All major and most minor vendors have policies prohibiting their staff from assisting when the PACS product does not have a published DICOM Conformance Statement (DCS).

The reasons for this are twofold:
1) Part 2 of the DICOM Standard (Conformance) stipulates that one of the requisites for a product to claim DICOM compliance is the existance of a released DICOM Conformance Statement, so by definition any product without a DCS is not DICOMhttp://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Online_OsiriX_Documentation&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=322081 compliant.
2) The lack of complete documentation makes troubleshooting interoperability issues extremely difficult, if not impossible.  The WikiBooks documentation is not an adequate substitute for a DCS.

A plea to the Osirix development community: please help these vendors help your users - publish a DCS for Osirix as soon as possible. ''This is an [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Online_OsiriX_Documentation&amp;curid=16642&amp;diff=322081&amp;oldid=308017 unsigned comment] by [[Special:Contributions/161.88.255.140|161.88.255.140]] at 20:12, 29 December 2005.''

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Solitude. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Solitude~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

__NOTOC__
'''Kapustnik''' is a hearty Central and Eastern European raw [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] [[Cookbook:Soups|soup]]. It must be not confused with Kapusniak which is made of sauerkraut.

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*One litre or more [[Cookbook:Chicken Broth|chicken broth]]
*One head of [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
*One or two [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*Four to six [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*Four or five sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*Two medium size [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*Two to five cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*One large can of diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*Pickling spices plus accessory spices [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], etc.
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]

===Garnish===
*[[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]] or [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|yoghurt]]

==Procedure==
# Prepare the potatoes and carrots by peeling, then slicing into bite-size pieces. Wash and slice the celery into bite-sized pieces. The onions and garlic must be peeled and chopped. The cabbage should be sliced. 
# In a large cooking pot heat enough olive oil to fry the chopped onions and garlic over medium heat. Three or four tablespoons of oil should be enough. If not, add more oil. 
# Let the onions and garlic simmer over medium or low heat for 8 to 10 minutes. 
# Now add one liter of chicken broth and bring to a boil. 
# Now add the sliced potatoes, carrots and celery; bring to a boil and simmer over medium heat until vegetables are almost tender enough to eat. 
# While the vegetables are boiling add any other spices your heart may desire (you may use a spice container to easily remove their remnants afterwards). Put the spice in the boiling soup and leave it there until the soup is finished. 
# While the soup is simmering add salt and pepper to taste, a dash of [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcester]], soya sauce, seasoned salt, garlic salt or celery salt until the soup is really tasty. 
# If the soup becomes too thick, add some more chicken broth but it should be a hearty soup with plenty of vegetables. 
# When the vegetables seem tender, add the can of tomatoes and the shredded cabbage. Again let the soup simmer over medium heat; continue tasting to see whether your imagination has worked magic. 
# Lastly, add the chopped fresh dill. When it’s done, EAT!

Serves about 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Formally, a Deterministc Finite Automaton is a 5-tuple &lt;math&gt;D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)&lt;/math&gt; where:

Q is the set of all states. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the alphabet being considered. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the set of transitions, including exactly one transition per element of the alphabet per state. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the single starting state. &lt;br&gt;
F is the set of all accepting states. &lt;br&gt;

Similarly, the formal definition of a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton is a 5-tuple &lt;math&gt;N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)&lt;/math&gt; where:

Q is the set of all states. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the alphabet being considered. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the set of transitions, with epsilon transitions and any number of transitions for any particular input on every state. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the single starting state. &lt;br&gt;
F is the set of all accepting states. &lt;br&gt;

Note that for both a NFA and a DFA, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is not a set of states. Rather, it is a single state, as neither can begin at more than one state. However, a NFA can achieve similar function by adding a new starting state and epsilon-transitioning to all desired starting states.

The difference between a DFA and an NFA being the delta-transitions are allowed to contain epsilon-jumps(transitions on no input), unions of transitions on the same input, and no transition for any elements in the alphabet.

For any NFA &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a DFA &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L(N) = L(D)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Caviar''' is the processed, salted roe of various species of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], most notably [[Cookbook:Sturgeon|sturgeon]]. It is commercially marketed throughout the world as a delicacy and is eaten principally as a garnish or spread, as with hors d'oeuvres.

The most well known fishery for caviar is the Caspian Sea, with Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, and Kazakh fishermen account for most of the catch.  Overfishing in the Caspian Sea and the long time required for sturgeon to become sexually mature (up to 25 years, depending on species) has led many groups to recomend against using Caspian caviar.  American aquaculture (fish farming) produces caviar from farm raised white sturgeon and Atlantic [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], which is considered to be more environmentally friendly. Commercial caviar production involves killing the fish and extracting the ovaries; caviar is generally not considered to be vegetarian for this reason.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium's ''Seafood Watch Program'' rates Caspian caviar as &quot;avoid&quot;, and farm produced caviar as a &quot;best choice&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=49 mbayaq seafood watch factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grades of Caviar==
It comes in a number of basic grades:
* Beluga - The most expensive of caviars.
* Sevruga
* Osetra

An easy recipe that can be whipped up in about 15 minutes from minimal ingredients for maximum style.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Pasta|Pasta]] (taglietelli, spaghetti or angel hair preferred)
* Mascarpone cheese (or similar bland cheese - e.g. Ricotta)
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|Tomato puree]] (paste)
* [[Cookbook:Vodka|Vodka]]
* [[Cookbook:Caviar|Caviar]] (or lumpfish roe - cheaper alternative)

== Split off from Wikibooks? ==

As a retired teacher, I am interested in creating content for children. If we can split Wikijunior off from Wikibooks, and make it a separate searchable, child-oriented space, I would be willing to make a substantial donation, and I would be very keen on creating content for it. Here is a prototype child-oriented encyclopaedia I have been working on. https://wikids.wikispaces.com/Index+1 [[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] ([[User talk:Barry Desborough|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Barry Desborough|contribs]]) 13:02, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
: {{ping|Barry Desborough}} Allow me to offer some perspective on this, and ask you a question.
:* In a very real sense, Wikijunior is ''already'' separate from the rest of Wikibooks.
::* Wikijunior benefits from the attention of administrators of the larger Wikibooks collection, yes, which is good because finding enough administrators, with enough understanding, for a small project is a serious challenge.  In a sense, Wikibooks as a whole is a collection of thousands of really tiny projects (individual books) that have all banded together to share a common supporting administrative infrastructure.
::* We administer our Wikijunior space differently than the rest of Wikibooks:  When an edit is made here, it isn't visible to ordinary readers until it is approved by an authorized Wikibookian.  We went to a lot of trouble, some years back, to arrange things this way so that Wikijunior would be safer for kids to read; kids reading it have a line of protection between them and some vandal coming along and adding offensive content to Wikijunior pages, because the offensive content wouldn't be instantly visible.
:* Wikijunior was created, years back, as a concept that wasn't specific to any particular sister, because somebody made a massive donation to the Wikimedia Foundation (I ''think'' it was about a million dollars, though that might be my memory playing tricks on me).  And it's not at all clear that the Foundation actually used all that money in a way that was specifically directed toward Wikijunior; but we ''did'' create a subspace on Wikibooks for books directed specifically at children, and it is still here.
: So, with all this in mind, my question is this:  Why do you think Wikijunior would be better off if it were administratively more separate from Wikibooks?  Since, to me, it seems as if Wikijunior right now has the best of both worlds, the benefits of attention from administrators who understand about administering books, together with the benefits of special treatment for the protection of kids reading it.  I'm not sure why you feel it wouldn't be worth contributing unless Wikijunior were further separated, and I'm honestly concerned that it wouldn't work as well as the current arrangement.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:15, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
::{{ping|Pi zero}}Thank you for your response. I would have replied earlier had I had a notification. I must not have set it correctly.
::The concern I have is that Wikijunior, within Wikibooks, is not a self-contained child-oriented &quot;space&quot;. A basic improvement could be made by having the search function, in all Wikijunior pages, search only Wikijunior pages, rather than all of the Wikibooks pages, which include content at an adult level. The other concern I have is that, being under the Wikibooks umbrella, there is an apparent bias towards book-like presentation and organization. To be immediate, and child-oriented, I would like to see short simple one-screen pages with minimal distractions, designed for online access - the sort of pages that independent students can easily gain from, and that can also be used by teachers for their presentations. I have prototyped this sort of content for illustration purposes. Unfortunately, I have had to abandon it's latest, more up-to-date incarnation as a paid-for Wikispaces plan, due to lack of adequate support. Here is the previous version again, @ http://wikids.wikispaces.com/Index+1 
::See also my old proposal @ https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Barry_Desborough/WikijuniorOnline
::Changing the search function would be, to me, the most important change. I thought that the cleanest way to do this would be for Wikijunior to become a separate searchable space. It would not mean that the administration and oversight procedures would need to change. --[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] ([[User talk:Barry Desborough|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Barry Desborough|contribs]]) 14:59, 8 November 2015 (UTC)
::: {{ping|Barry Desborough}} Localizing the search sounds doable, though at this moment I only have guesses at how.  It sounds like a useful thing to do.  In the same spirit we ''may'' wish to make other customizations of the left-hand menu bar; it's possible the two may be technically related, but both are outside what I've tied to do in the past. &lt;p&gt; I have doubts, off hand, about departing from the book concept, but I haven't had a chance to look at that carefully; in any case, my instinct is to deal with the search issue, and perhaps navbar, first before taking on further issues.  I'll start a section at the reading room about search/navbar, and hopefully I'll have a chance in the next few days to make some independent inquiries.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:43, 8 November 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is a &quot;slug&quot; of vodka.  I'm assuming it's not the unit of mass, as that is about 14.6 kg and would be a lot of vodka. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 14:02, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

A [http://www.bartleby.com/62/88/S1398800.html slug] is an imprecise measure of liquid volume (usually alcoholic).  Splash some in the pan and it should make a 'slug/glug' sound as it comes out the bottle.  You don't need much vodka in this recipe - a shot will do fine if you are in need of precision.  That said, this is a recipe you cook by eye and with the aid of a surreptitious testing spoon.  You don't need to worry about quantities.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nunh-huh, [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome]] to Wikibooks!  I see you've created a [[WB:MODULE|module]] entitled [[Tiger]] as a part of the [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] project.  I'd like to let you know of a general practice of preemptive disambuation we have here, as commonly several wikibooks could have modules with the same title. For example, ''Tiger'' might be used in some books in the [[Biology]] bookshelf, or by the [[Field Guide]] or the [[Dichotomous Key]].  We don't have a standard system in use for disambiguators as each wikibook is a semi-independant project, but the most common are the pseudo-namespace system described in [[WB:NS|Help:Namespaces]], the subpage system Danny applied to [[Wikijunior Solar System]], and the really descriptive title system in [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]].

Other than that, have fun!  You might like to look around at our projects and see what might be useful for Wikijunior, or if there is another wikibook you'd like to work on.  If you have any questions, please ask at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], and you might like to read up on our [[Wikibooks:policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]], which don't always match up with what is the standard practice at Wikipedia. (we apply NPOV much looser than the 'pedia does, and have even discussed eliminating it completely). 

[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 14:30, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Good to know. I've changed the links in Wikijunior Big Cats so that future articles get created according to Danny's system, and trust that the other Wikijunior participants will fix it if I've got it wrong&lt;g&gt;  - [[User:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh]] 21:30, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nunh-huh.

I previously changed subheadings into the affirmative.  I did this because faulty punctuation caught my attention then the interrogative form seemed peculiar to me.  I now see that this is a standard form in this project and guess that the issue was previously decided.  I have returned them to the interogatory form.  Sorry if I've caused confusion.

Tigers are also exist(ed) in Sumatra and Jawa (two Indonesian islands), so we might have to change the distribution map.

There are many types of tigers. Wouldn't it be appropriate to at least mention this?[[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 01:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Venus Facts''':
* Venera 7, the first space probe to land on Venus, was destroyed by the hostile conditions on Venus after only 23 minutes.
* Almost all of the surface features on Venus are named after women.
* A day on Venus is equal to 117 days on Earth.
* It has been proposed that some microbes could live in Venus's clouds.
&lt;/div&gt;
Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. It is a ''terrestrial planet''. This means that we think it was created in a similar way to our planet Earth and is made of rock.

{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

== How big is Venus? ==
[[en:Image:Venus_Earth_Comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Earth and Venus Comparison]]
Venus is only slightly smaller than the Earth. This is one reason why Venus is sometimes thought of as Earth's &quot;twin&quot;. Venus has a ''diameter'' of about 12,100 km. It has also been visited by many probes.
&lt;br clear&gt;

== What is the surface like on this planet?  ==
[[en:Image:Maat_Mons_on_Venus.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Maat Mons on the Surface of Venus, by radar imaging]]
The surface of Venus is very different from the surface of the Earth. It is very dry and hot enough to melt lead. The pressure on the surface is very high. It is the same pressure as being 1 km (3,280 feet) below the surface of the sea on Earth.

[[en:Image:Venus Rivers.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|Channels on the surface of Venus, looking like river channels on Earth]]
Channels that look like rivers have formed on Venus. Scientists think these channels are formed from erupting lava. The lava flows along as it cools down, creating the channels.
One feature only Venus seems to have is unusual volcanoes called ''arachnoids''. These are volcanoes that have formed differently from other volcanoes we have found in the Solar System. We don't know exactly how they were formed. Venus also has volcanoes like those on Earth.

Parts of the surface of Venus look something like continents. The largest of these areas is called ''Ishtar Terra'' (land of Ishtar, from the Babylonian goddess who was similar to Venus). Deep basins like those under the Earth's oceans have also been discovered. On Venus, though, they have no water. Features like mountain ranges and meteor craters have also been found on Venus. One of the highest mountains on Venus, ''Maxwell Montes'', is about 11 km taller than Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth.

On the night side of the planet, there is a strange effect called ''Ashen Light''. For some reason, the dark side of Venus has a subtle glow. There are various theories about this. One of the earliest theories &amp;mdash; now disproved, of course &amp;mdash; was that there were aliens on Venus and they were celebrating a new Venusian emperor. Currently, one of the more believed ones is this: There is a high concentration of carbon dioxide. When it is hit by the ultraviolet rays of the sun, they change into carbon monoxide and oxygen, and emit green light. The entire chemical procedure is {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + O}}.

[[en:Image:Venera_13_lander.gif|right|thumb|The Venera 13 Lander, which made scientific measurements and sent back pictures from the surface of Venus]]

== How long is a day on Venus? ==
Venus ''rotates'' (spins around) even more slowly than Mercury. One full rotation of Venus takes about 243 Earth days. Venus also rotates in the opposite direction to most of the other planets in the Solar System. One day on Venus, from noon to noon, depends on the length of the year as well as the rotation time, and is about 117 earth days.

== How long is a year on Venus? ==
One year on Venus is almost 225 Earth days long.  This is less time than it takes Venus to rotate on its axis and less than two Venus days. 

== What is Venus made of? ==
The surface of Venus, its crust, is covered in nothing but rock. But, the core of Venus is made of nickel-iron. The atmosphere around Venus is very thick and is made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and poisonous gasses that create high pressure and trap in heat.

== How much would Venus's gravity pull on me? ==
If you were on Venus, it would pull you down almost as strongly as Earth. The atmosphere exerts a pressure at the surface more than 90 times Earth's normal sea-level pressure.

== Who discovered Venus? ==

Because Venus is closer to the sun than we are on Earth, we always see it close to the sun in the sky.  So it only appears for us just before sunrise in the eastern sky, or just after sunset in the western sky.  Many cultures thought Venus in the morning and Venus in the evening were two separate things.  The ancient Romans called the evening object Venus (after the goddess of love) and the morning object ''Lucifer'' (which means ''light bearer'' &amp;mdash; a servant who walked ahead of the sun's chariot with a torch, to light the way).  Nobody knows who first thought the two were a single object.  The first known ''written'' description of them as one object was the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa, from about three and a half thousand years ago &amp;mdash; 1581 BCE.
[[File:Mapa de sondas sobre Venus.png|thumb|300px|right|A map of where the Veneras 9-14 and Vegas landed.]]

About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.  Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted.  The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.  Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a ''transit of Venus''.  That's what it's called when Venus passes right between the Earth and the Sun, so that Venus is visible from Earth during the day as a tiny dot passing across the Sun.  In 1761 a Russian astronomer, Mikhail Lomonsov, watching another transit of Venus, saw that Venus has an atmosphere.

Not much more was discovered about Venus until the 1920s.  Then, a United States astronomer, Frank Ross, observed Venus using ultraviolet light &amp;mdash; the light that causes sunburn &amp;mdash; and for the first time saw the structure of the clouds on Venus.

However, there is only so much that can be learned about Venus by looking at it from Earth.  The first successful pictures of Venus by a space probe were taken by Mariner 2 in 1962.  Mariner 2 was the first space probe successfully sent to observe another planet.  It showed two important things:  Venus has practically no magnetic field, and Venus has temperatures of 490 to 590 K &amp;mdash; that's as hot as the inside of a working oven on Earth!

[[File:Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The first written record of Venus. It describes Venus' movement over 21 years.]]
&lt;!-- Mariner 5 measured the power of Venus' weak magnetic field, and Mariner 10 took ultraviolet pictures revealing huge wind speeds. Venera 3 was the first probe to land on Venera, but its communications failed before it reached the surface.  However, Venera 4 managed to collect data while floating down to Venus. Venera 4 measured temperature, air pressure, density, and performed eleven chemical experiments analysing the atmosphere, which was found to be 95% carbon dioxide, all before landing on the surface.  Unfortunately, before it did land on the surface, its battery ran out, making it useless.  Venera 5 and 6 also conducted tests in a similar manner as Venera 4 but they were crushed by the air pressure once they reached 6 km above the surface.  The distance from the surface of Earth to the lowest Cirrus clouds is also 6 km.  The first successful landing on Venus was by Venera 7 in 1970. The surface temperature was measured to be 455 °C to 475 °C. However, because of the extremely high temperatures on Venus, Venera 7 malfunctioned within 23 minutes of landing. Venera 8 also landed on Venus, and performed additional tests. Venera 9, in 1975 orbited Venus while dropping a ground vehicle on the surface. These two combined produced an enormous wealth of information, including that the clouds of Venus form in 3 different layers of the atmosphere. Venera 10 was a repeat of Venera 9. NASA then sent two ''Pioneer'' spacecraft to see for itself. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe (PVM) was designed to carry 4 probes to Venus and then release the probes, each going separate directions. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) orbited Venus. Both the PVM and the PVO conducted multiple experiments and gave information. Venera 11 and 12 flew by Venus and dropped ground vehicles on Venus to collect more information, however, that failed as the colour cameras and soil analysers both malfunctioned. In 1981, Venera 13 landed and took the first colour picture of Venus, and successfully analysed the soil. Venera 13 holds the record among space probes of lasting the longest on Venus, which was 127 minutes. Also in 1981, Venera 14 detected seismic activity on Venus. In 1984, Vega 1 and 2 were launched. Their main purposes were to mainly float in the atmosphere. They took pictures of a third of the planet, along with collecting more data about the atmosphere. The last Soviet Veneras, Venera 15 and 16 took very high resolution pictures of Venus in 1983. In 1990, the US launched a probe called Magellan, named after Ferdinand Magellan who explored the Caribbean islands in the 16th century. Magellan floated in Venus' atmosphere for 4 years before crashing partially vaporising and crashing into the atmosphere. During that time, it mapped 98% of Venus' surface. There were no more missions to Venus until the 21st century, when the European space agency (ESA) launched Venus Express. Venus Express orbited Venus from 2006 to the end of 2012. In the distant future, it is proposed that Venus should slowly begin to be inhabited by humans, but only after Mars has a population like the Earth.  --&gt;

== Who is this planet named after? ==
Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love. Sometimes it can be seen shining brightly just before dawn or just after sunset, when it is called the Morning Star or Evening Star. Some people, like the Aztecs and the Greeks, gave Venus two names &amp;ndash; one for the morning and one for the evening.

Because Venus and the Earth are the same size, scientists call Venus &quot;Earth's sister planet&quot;. For a long time most scientists thought that Venus had plants, animals, and possibly even people. However because Venus is so hot we now know that it is impossible for anything to live there.

== How long would it take people to get there? ==

It could take around a year and a half to get there. But it is very unlikely someone would go to Venus.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis.

== Phonology (sounds) ==

== Basic vocabulary and its use==
See also [[/Dictionary/]]

===Verbs===
There are basically two types of verbs in Tok Pisin: transitive and intransitive.  
*In general, transitive verbs end in -im. Example: '''kisim''' (sampela samting), ''take, receive something''
*In general, intransitive verbs do not end in -im. Example: '''slip''' (long nait), ''sleep (at night)''

[[/Verbs|More about verbs]]

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are usually not marked for plural in Tok Pisin.  

[[/Nouns|More about nouns]]

=== Adjectives ===
There are basically four types of adjectives in Tokpisin:
*[[/Class 1 adjectives|Class 1 adjectives]] have the suffix -pela in attributive position, and also when they follow the copula. Example: '''bikpela''', ''big''. '''Bikpela haus''', ''A big building'', '''Haus i bikpela''', ''The building is big''.  
*[[/Class 2 adjectives|Class 2 adjectives]] have the suffix -pela in attributive position, but they usually lose it when they follow the copula. Example: '''kolpela''', ''cold''. '''Kolpela wara''', ''Cold water'' but '''Wara i kol''', ''The water is cold''.  
*[[/Class 3 adjectives|Class 3 adjectives]] do not have the suffix -pela. Example: '''liklik''', ''small''. '''Liklik haus''', ''A small building'', '''Haus i liklik''', ''The building is small''. 
*[[/Class 4 adjectives|Class 4 adjectives]] do not have the suffix -pela either. Unlike other adjectives, they stand after the noun in attributive position. Example: '''nogut''', ''bad''. '''Tok nogut''', ''bad words, insults''. 

Tokpisin adjectives can be either attributive or non-attributive.  The attributive type is marked by the attributive morpheme -pela; the non-attributive is unmarked.   Semantically, the attributive form qualifies the noun; it attributes characteristics about the noun, while the non-attributive form states the being; the status of the noun.  Syntactically, the attributive precedes the noun, while the non-attributive follows the noun. A few adjective forms like &quot;liklik&quot;, and &quot;nogut&quot;, are considered &quot;non-stabilized forms&quot; (Paradigms have been designed to use to explain some of these linguistics phenomena). Tokpisin has some of these variations still exists.  Many of these variations are acceptable and are variously marked by the cognition of the speaker of the time about the noun. When someone says &quot;nogutpela tok&quot;, the person is attributive in his thought.  When he says &quot;nogut tok&quot; the person is non-attributive.  Many non-attributive forms of Tokpisin are compound words now and must not be taken literally.  For example: &quot;tok nogut&quot; 'swear - using bad language'; &quot;tok i nogut&quot; 'unacceptable message'; &quot;tokim nogut&quot; 'improperly said'; &quot;nogut tok&quot; 'bad words'.




[[/Adjectives|More about adjectives]]

=== Prepositions ===
There are two basic prepositions in Tok Pisin: '''bilong''' and '''long'''.  
* '''bilong''' is used for attribution. Examples: '''haus bilong mi''', ''My home''; '''Han bilong diwai''', ''Arm of a tree; branch''.
* '''long''' is used as a universal preposition for other meanings. 
Nevertheless, there is one other self standing preposition: '''wantaim''', ''with''. 
There are also all kinds of compound preposition like '''ananit long''', ''under''; '''insait long''', ''in''; '''antap long''', ''on, above'', etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Technically Soil Science is termed Agronomy or the study of soils...&quot;

I think perhaps this was meant to read Agrology, not Agronomy, since agrology is defined in most (all?) dictionaries as meaning the same as soil science. Except in Canada where 5000 agrologists consider themselves not soil scientists, but agricultural production experts.  see [[Wikipedia:Agrology]].  So rewording Agronomy to Agrology would be wrong for Canada.  Would it be okay with folks here to reword the above as:

&quot;Technically Soil Science is &lt;s&gt;termed Agronomy or&lt;/s&gt; the study of soils...&quot; ?

:We probably already know this, but this should have many, many links to wikipedia, and should be broken out into chapters the way the botany wikibook is. [[User:160.94.27.141|160.94.27.141]] 14:23, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, Larsie, and [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikibooks!  I saw your question about linking to a pic at Wikipedia.  If you want to use an image that is located in Wikipedia here in Wikibooks, you need to download the image and then upload it here.  The two projects do not use the same image database.  You could also upload it to [[Commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]], which would allow it to be used by all Wikimedia Foundation projects.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], or you can ask one of us old timers. Most importantly, have fun. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:32, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:If you can find the images you'd like to use, you could let me know the url and I'll either upload them here or at commons.  Additionally, I think external links to a file with a .jpg or .gif or .png extension automaticly loads that image, but I'm not sure.

:I see you've been working on Venus, you might checkout [[Commons:Venus]], which has one image.  Useing images is the same no matter where the file is uploaded, as the server searches the local database first, if no file with the right name is found, it searches the Commons database.  However, the server only searches these two projects, so no using images that are exclusive to wikipedia. :(  I hope that helps. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:47, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Larsie. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Larsie~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== What is its Surface like? ==
We don't really know for sure what its surface is like. No spacecraft has ever been there (and the first, ''New Horizons'', isn't due there till 2015, although it has already visited - and passed the orbit of - Jupiter,) and even the best telescopes can't see any detail. It is certainly very cold, at about -230 &amp;deg;C.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoTemp&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html; Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 285. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9; http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/pluto_worldbook.html&lt;/ref&gt; The surface is covered with ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoIce&quot;&gt;Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 287. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9; http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/pluto_worldbook.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto also has a very thin '''atmosphere''' which freezes when Pluto moves far away from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoAtmos&quot;&gt;Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 287. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9; http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The image above on the right shows Pluto's color.

== What are Pluto's moons like? ==
Pluto has three known moons.  The largest is called Charon. Charon is about half as wide as Pluto. Because Pluto and Charon are so close in size, they are sometimes called a &quot;double planet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharonDiameter&quot;&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Plu_Charon&lt;/ref&gt; Charon's surface is covered in water ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharonSurface&quot;&gt;http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman mythology, Charon took dead souls across the river Acheron to the land of the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharonName&quot;&gt;http://www.pantheon.org/articles/c/charon.html&lt;/ref&gt; Two other moons were discovered in 2005. They have been named Nix and Hydra.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewMoonNames&quot;&gt;http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060621_nix_hydra.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== How long is a day on Pluto? ==
One day on Pluto is about 6.487 Earth days long. Like Uranus, Pluto also spins on its side.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoDay&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html; http://www.nineplanets.org/pluto.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== How long is a year on Pluto? ==
One year on Pluto would be about 90,613 days or 248 years on Earth!&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoYear&quot;&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Pluto&amp;Display=Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is it made of? ==
Scientists believe Pluto is made mostly of rock and ice,&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoComp&quot;&gt;http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html&lt;/ref&gt; but they will not be sure until more research is done. The discovery of Charon helped scientists estimate the '''density''' of Pluto. The information collected told them what Pluto was and was not made out of.  If Pluto were made out of heavy solids, it would have a very high density.  If it were made of gases, it would have a low density.  Pluto is somewhere in between, so it is probably made of rock and ice.

== How much would Pluto's gravity pull on me? ==

If you were on Pluto, gravity would be only 0.06 times as strong as it is on Earth. &lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoGravity&quot;&gt;Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 285. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9; http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html&lt;/ref&gt; This means you could do really high jumps—even more than people could on the Moon!

== Who is Pluto named after? ==
Pluto was named after the Roman god of the underworld. In Roman mythology, he kidnapped Proserpina (Persephone) so he could marry her. This made her mother, Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, very sad, causing winter. To end winter, Jupiter, the king of the gods and her brother, decreed that Proserpina could return to the surface as long as she hadn't eaten any food of the Underworld. However, she had eaten six pomegranate seeds, so Jupiter decided she had to spend six months in the underworld each year. This is the Roman myth of winter. When she goes to the Underworld, everything stops growing. When she comes back, her mother is happy again, and life returns. &lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoName&quot;&gt;http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/mythology/persephone_seasons.html; http://www.pantheon.org/articles/p/persephone.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is Pluto a planet?==
Pluto has been officially classified as a dwarf planet, which is different from a regular planet.  One of the reasons is that it is a lot smaller than other planets - although it is the tenth largest known object that revolves around the sun, it is smaller than many moons, including Earth's moon.  Scientists used to think that Pluto was a lot larger than it actually is,&lt;ref name=&quot;PlutoNotBig&quot;&gt;Sobel, Dava (2005) &quot;The Planets.&quot; pp. 220. Harper Perennial Publishing Company. ISBN 1-84115-621-3&lt;/ref&gt; and it was thought of as the ninth planet for many years.  

Another key reason is that Pluto is part of a large group of objects called the Kuiper Belt, which all revolve around the Sun in the area beyond Neptune. In January 2005 another object &quot;Eris&quot; was discovered in the Kuiper Belt. Eris is larger than Pluto. Scientists think there are even more Pluto-sized objects in this part of the solar system, as well as millions of smaller objects. Because of this, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the term 'planet' for the first time. Under the definition, both Eris and Pluto (along with Ceres, Haumea and Makemake) are dwarf planets. 

In spite of this, some people continue to hold on to the idea that Pluto is a regular planet because of tradition. Also, some textbooks and references are not up to date, and still list Pluto as the ninth planet.

== Is Pluto a Planet?  NPOV Questions here ==

I'm concerned about the neutral point-of-view aspect here by even having the discussion of wheither Pluto should be considered a major planet (grouped with the other big eight) or considered a minor planet...essentially an asteroid.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has &quot;ruled&quot; on this issue and simply said that Pluto will remain a planet.

I guess that I'm arguing that this whole question is a pandora's box of problems, and it might be better to simply steer clear by removing this discussion altogether.  Remember, this is a kids book, and coverage of the controversy is not necessary.  If we stick to known facts and don't go onto the fringe of leading theories or arguements that cause flame wars in astronomy chat circles, we will be much safer here.

I would suggest that the whole topic of what does it mean to be a planet, a moon, asteroid, etc. could be one of the &quot;other articles&quot; that discuss general issues regarding the solar system, especially if you want to group Pluto with other Kuiper Belt objects.

From my (non-neutral) POV, I think Pluto should remain called a planet for many reasons, including those mentioned in the main Wikipedia article about Pluto.  Also, by even raising this issue it seems as though this Wikibook is making a political statement about the status of Pluto.  If we question its status as a planet, why are we even writing a module about it?  Again, avoid, avoid, avoid.

:I pretty much agree. It's one of those legacy decisions that doesn't always make sense in hindsight. But if you ask the person on the street &quot;what is the furthest planet from the Sun&quot;, they will usually answer Pluto (or else they have no clue.) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 19:37, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

Here's a news story saying that astronomers are going to meet this week to decide whether Pluto is a planet: http://today.reuters.com/news/ArticleNews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-13T165540Z_01_L10356763_RTRUKOC_0_US-SCIENCE-PLUTO.xml --[[User:Gray Porpoise|Gray Porpoise]] 18:22, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
:With a large number of planets being discovered now outside of our Solar System, not to mention some esoteric object that are now being found that are not quite stars but more Jupiter sized objects that are independent of stars (they have recently been observed, so this isn't theoretical anymore), the whole definition of planets is certainly coming to a major front now.  Personally, I prefer the classification schema that relies on physical characteristics such as the presence or absence of an atmosphere, spherical nature of the object due to gravity, and other similar physcial features that can be measured in order to define a planet.  That it might make Titan a planet as well as the Earth's moon, Ceres, and Vesta, but demote Phobos and Deimos from even being called moons to merely captured asteroids is certainly something to consider.  Even with these more scientifically derived definitions of planets, Pluto is right on the edge of consideration.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

They've ruled, and decided that Pluto, Xena/Persephone/2003 UB313, and Ceres are &quot;Dwarf planets&quot;. I noticed that someone has updated Pluto to suit, and I've added a bit to the tenth planet section. Can anyone recall the date of the decision?
[[User:philculmer|Phil Culmer]]

== Charon ==

The statement that ''Some astronomers believe that Pluto and its moon Charon are actually a &quot;double planet&quot;, because Charon does not orbit around Pluto'' is not quite accurate. Perhaps the author meant to indicate that the center of mass of the Pluto-Charon system does not lie within Pluto? I'm not certain. But the current statement is sure to be confusing. &amp;mdash; [[User:130.76.32.145|130.76.32.145]] 19:33, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

== Discovery ==

&quot;was accidentally discovered...&quot; Sources for this? According to Google (http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/pluto_worldbook.html), it was not accidentally discovered, in fact, Clyde Tombaugh was looking for the planet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1929, Clyde W. Tombaugh, an assistant at the Lowell Observatory, used predictions made by Lowell and other astronomers and photographed the sky with a more powerful, wide-angle telescope. In 1930, Tombaugh found Pluto's image on three photographs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Somewhere I read that he used a projector that switched between two photos of the sky rapidly and looked for objects that moved (since a planet would move over time)...I can't find a source for this, so it may be completely bogus...but it's been a long time, I probably don't remember correctly. [[User:208.51.52.23|208.51.52.23]] 22:41, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:I remeber reading / hearing that somewhere too. --[[User:Bjwebb|Bjwebb]] 12:20, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

::The story that I seem to recall about the whole thing is that Perceval Lowell did some calculations on the outer planets that suggested some other planetary bodies might be found further from the Sun than Neptune.  Just as Neptune was discovered using this method (doing some massive 3-body calculations and other heavy math... without computers mind you) Lowell then suggested a region of the sky to being a search for the &quot;ninth planet&quot;.  [[w:Clyde Tombaugh|Clyde Tombaugh]] then started to search that region of the sky and &quot;discovered&quot; Pluto.&lt;p&gt;Years later more modern astronomers using the original base data that Lowell had for doing the original calculations were then fed into a computer for more precise and accurate calculations, and in particular based on the now known mass of Pluto there doesn't seem to be any basis for the prediction of the location of Pluto.  That is why it was called a &quot;chance&quot; discovery, even though it was based originally on a scientific hypothesis.  With the orbit of Pluto being so far out of the plane of the ecliptic, it seems even more remote that Pluto would have ever been discovered except by a chance discovery.&lt;p&gt;One thing though to refute all this speculation is the fact that the apparent magnitude of Pluto was just brighter than the minimum capabilities of the telescopes that Tombaugh was using for the Pluto discovery, and that Tombaugh was a very through researcher who &quot;flipped&quot; through hundreds of sky survey photo plates before he finally found a set that seemed to indicate &quot;movement&quot;, which in fact was Pluto.  While perhaps not specifically looking for a planet, other astronomical objects including comets and asteroids could have been discovered and indeed were discovered using similiar methods.  This gives incredible credit to the capabilities of Tombaugh and his skill in the use of telescopes.  It has been said that many of the Kuiper Belt objects would have likely been discovered by Tombaugh except for the fact that his telescope just didn't distinguish objects that are that dim as seen from the Earth.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
:::Further note:  See http://www.planetary.org/pluto_75/plutodiscovery1_180205.html for more details about the discovery, including pictures of the telescope that Tombaugh used and the actual photographs used for the discovery of Pluto.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:32, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

Can I hack the mythology section down? I think it's too wordy. This is about planets not mythology.--[[User:Gbleem|Gbleem]] 19:04, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

:Strangely, &quot;hacking the sections down&quot; is not on the proofreading plan, simply because I did not know where to put it in the proofreading plan, unless it belonged under &quot;reorganization&quot;, which is not a very well-defined topic.  Perhaps it would be considerate to discuss it with [[User:Shanel|Shanel]], since she has done all the proofreading work so far on this module.  I am sure there is a way to improve the section, which seems to be much heavier on Proserpina than on Pluto.

* The Moon is nearly twice as big as the planet [[../Pluto/]].
* The &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; isn't always seen as a man. People from India see an old woman with a spinning wheel. People from Mexico see a rabbit!
* The Moon isn't that small compared to the Earth - it's actually the largest moon in the solar system, relative to the size of it's planet. Sometimes the Earth and Moon together are called a ''binary'' or ''double planet system''.
* The Moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system.
* In 2002, another object appearing to be an asteroid was observed orbiting around the Earth. Later it was found to be a rocket booster.

== How big is the moon? ==
[[Image:Moon_Earth_Comparison.png|left|px300|thumb|Comparison of the size of the Moon and the Earth]]
Most of the planets in the Solar System are much bigger than their moons, but the Earth and the Moon are much closer in size. The Moon is just under 3,500 kilometers (km) wide. That's over a quarter of the size of the Earth (about 12,600 km wide) as you can see in the picture below. Because of this, the Earth and Moon together are sometimes called a ''binary'' or ''double planet system''.

The Moon has no atmosphere. It also has no liquid water on its surface. During the day it becomes very hot, but at night it is icy cold. A person visiting the Moon needs an air supply and a special suit.

The Moon has many ''craters'' on its surface. The largest one is called the ''South Pole-Aitken Basin'' and is roughly 2500 km across.

We think nearly all the craters on moons or planets were made by huge rocks hitting them a long time ago. These collisions are called ''impacts.''

Some of the craters on the Moon look as if they have rays coming out of them. These rays are rocks thrown across the Moon by the impacts that made the craters. Some of the craters around the poles of the Moon may have ice in them.

There are also darker areas called ''maria'' (said &quot;MARR-ee-ah&quot;). These are large pools of lava that cooled a long time ago. Most maria are on the side of the Moon we see from Earth. The lighter areas on the Moon are highlands.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== How long is the Moon's revolution? ==
The Moon takes just over 27 Earth days to ''rotate'' (rotate means spin around) once.

== How long is a year on the moon? ==
The Moon also takes just over 27 days to ''orbit'' (move around) the Earth. This is why we always see the same side of the Moon when we look from the Earth. We call this side the ''near'' side. The other side we call the ''far'' side. In 1959, a probe sent back pictures of the far side. That was the first time anyone saw what it looked like.

== What is the Moon made of? ==
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the ''crust''. The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side. It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands. There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface.

We think the Moon has a small ''core'' (center) about 300 km across. The core is composed of solid iron. Because the core is solid, the Moon does not have its own magnetic field.

== How much would the Moon's gravity pull on me? ==
If you were on the Moon, it would pull you down about a sixth as much as the Earth does, so you'd weigh a sixth as much. So would anything else. That's why it was much easier for the astronauts visiting the Moon to pick up rocks there.

== Who is the moon named after? ==
[[en:Image:DianaLouvre.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The goddess Diane, the goddess of the Moon in Roman mythology]]
The names ''Moon'' and ''month'' both come from the ancient Greek name for the Moon, ''Mene''. There have been other names for the Moon, like ''Selene'' and ''Luna''. Selene was the Greek goddess of the Moon. Luna was the Roman goddess of the Moon. The Roman people also associated their goddess Diana with the Moon.
==Who discovered the Moon?==
Ancient Greece and Ancient China noted over 2000 years ago that the light from the Moon is reflected from the Sun. Also, Ancient Greece noted that the Moon causes tides on Earth. More recently, Luna 1 was the first spacecraft to perform a flyby of the moon. Luna 2 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon, and Luna 3 was the first to photograph the far side of the Moon which you can not see from Earth. Luna 1 through 3 all were launched in 1959. Surveyor 3, in 1967, was the first to examine the soil of the Moon. It dug to 17.5 cm. In 1969, Apollo 11 was the very first spacecraft to land people on the moon.

&lt;br clear=all&gt;
== How big is the Earth? ==
The Earth is nearly 13,000 km wide. It's the largest ''terrestrial planet'' in the Solar System.

The Earth's mass is about 5,973,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. That's a lot. But it is little compared with Jupiter (319 Earths) and tiny compared with the Sun (335,789 Earths) or other stars!

== What is its surface like? ==
The Earth's surface is made of rock. Most of it is underwater, but not all. Islands of rock rise up out of the water. The biggest islands are called ''continents'', of which there are seven: [[w:North America|North America]], [[w:South America|South America]], [[w:Europe|Europe]], [[w:Asia|Asia]], [[w:Africa|Africa]], [[w:Australia|Australia]], and [[w:Antarctica|Antarctica]]. The largest bodies of water are called ''oceans'', of which there are five: [[w:Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[w:Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[w:Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[w:Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[w:Antarctic Ocean|Antarctic]] or [[w:Southern Ocean|Southern]].

[[en:Image:Anawhata.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Anawhata beach, west of Auckland, New Zealand]]
The Earth's surface is made up of huge ''plates''. They are like huge jigsaw pieces made of rock. These plates move very, very slowly, carrying the continents with them. They can rub beside each other, push against each other, or even move away from each other. If there are gaps between them, hot molten rock can rise up and make ''volcanoes''. Where the plates rub or push against each other, ''earthquakes'' may happen. When two plates push each other's rock upwards, ''mountains'' are formed.

[[en:Image:Zabriskie_point.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Zabriske Point, Death Valley National Park, California]]Earth has many kinds of ''environments''. It is cold and icy in places like Antarctica. It is hot and dry in deserts like the Sahara in Africa and Death Valley in the United States. It is cold and dry in deserts like Siberia in Russia. Where it is warm and wet, rainforests grow.

== Why is there life on Earth? ==
Wherever we have looked on Earth, we have found living things. They may be very small, like ''bacteria'', but they are there. We have found bacteria where it is very cold, very hot, very deep, very high or very dark.

[[en:Image:Galileo probe deployed (large).jpg|thumb|left|Galileo being deployed after being launched by the Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']]
What all living things on Earth seem to need is ''liquid water''. Wherever you can find some water, there are almost always living things there too, even if you can't see them. If we find liquid water somewhere else in the Solar System, scientists think we might find some living things there too. If we don't, there is always the rest of the universe to explore!

There is another possibility. All the living things we know need liquid water. But maybe somewhere else there are living things that don't need water. Perhaps we will need to learn how to recognize them.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

== What about the Earth's moon? ==
Earth has one moon we call... the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Moon|Moon]]! &amp;nbsp;Sometimes it is called by its name in Latin, ''Luna'', so we don't get confused with other planets and their ''moons''.  The Moon has also been called Selene (pronounced &quot;suh-LEE-nee&quot;) which is Greek for moon and was the name of the Greek moon goddess.

Recently we have also found some other objects that are said to go around the Earth.  The largest one, called [[w:3753_Cruithne |Cruithne]] (pronounced &quot;cru-EE-nyuh&quot;), is three miles wide.  In fact, it ''orbits'' (goes around) the Sun in a way that makes it keep coming close to Earth.

There are various ideas about where the Moon came from (no-one was around to see it happen, after all), but the most widely held theory is that when Earth was young, a large body hit Earth and split off a section of the Earth that is now the Moon.

== How long is a day on this planet? ==
A day on Earth is 24 hours long. That's daytime ''and'' night time. A 24 hour day is how long it takes the Earth to spin around once.  On the half of the Earth that is facing the sun it is daytime and on the half of the Earth that is facing away from the sun it is nighttime.  

The spin of the earth is also the reason why the sun appears to rise in the east and to set in the west.  Although it looks like the sun is moving from the surface of the earth, it is really the surface of the earth that is moving.  The reason we do not feel like we are spinning is because the earth is so big compared to the size of people. 

Also, the Earth is tilted at about 23°, so there are times that the North or South pole is always facing or turned away from the sun. If you live at one of the poles of Earth it can be light or dark throughout the whole day!

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

== How long is a year on this planet? ==
A year on Earth is about 365 and 1/4 days long. That's how long it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun once.  Approximately every four years we have a leap year.  A leap year contains an extra day in our calendar on February 29th in order to account for the 1/4 of a day left over each year.

== What is the Earth made of? ==
[[Image:Inside the Earth.PNG]]&lt;br&gt;
When a planet is made of rock, we call its surface the ''crust''. Below the Earth's crust is hot rock, some of which is molten. It is in a layer called the ''mantle''. The hot molten rock is what comes out of volcanoes. It's then called ''lava''.

Under the mantle is the ''core'' of the Earth. We think it is made from solid iron and nickel, surrounded by hot molten iron. The temperature there is very very hot!

The Earth's crust is very thin compared to the mantle and the core. But it is very thick to us. Nobody has drilled all the way through it yet. Even the deepest underground mines are far away from reaching its deepest base.

== How much does the Earth's gravity pull on me? ==

It's easy to find your weight on Earth by using a scale. You have weight because the Earth's '''gravity''' pulls you towards its center. Normally, the ground or the floor get in the way, making you feel 'stuck' to them.

There are several kinds of scales: 

[[Image:Balance.PNG|left|160px|A pan balance]]
1) Comparing of 2 masses (weights). You put the thing(s) you want to weigh on one pan (like some marbles), and then you put several &quot;weights&quot; on the other pan until the pointer shows that both pans have equal weights on them. Then you look at the pan with the known weights on it, and add them all up. The total is the mass of the thing(s) you want to weigh. 
[[Image:Spring balance.PNG|right|60px|A spring balance]]
2) A spring balance usually has a hook on it, with a pan. You put the thing(s) you want to weigh on the pan, the spring is pulled, and the greater the weight, the further the spring is pulled. That distance, calibrated in pounds or kilogram (or whatever), is usually shown either on a dial or on a linear scale.
[[Image:Electronic balance.PNG|100px|left|electronic balance]]
3) There are also electronic scales that give a properly calibrated reading&amp;mdash;grocery stores, for example, use these.

NOTE: '''Gravity''' varies slightly depending on the location where you want to get the weight; spring balances and some electronic scales can, in theory, read slightly different weights at different places because of that, but usually in practice that difference is too small to be noticed. But, because the balance type of scales work differently from the spring or electronic types, they will always read the true, correct mass. They would even give the same mass on the Moon, where gravity is much less than on Earth.

[[File:Isaac Newton cartoon.png|left|]]


'''Did you know?''' that  ''Sir Isaac Newton'' was the first person to realize that the force pulling you down to the ground was the same force that keeps the planets going around the Sun? The story goes that he thought of this when he saw an apple fall from a tree.

Gravity is a very important force. As well as keeping you firmly stuck to the Earth, it keeps the Moon going round the Earth, The Earth going around the Sun and the Sun going around the center of the Milky Way '''galaxy'''. Gravity also makes stars and planets a nice round ball shape. In fact without gravity there wouldn't even ''be'' a Sun, Moon or Earth because the material that they are made of would just float away into space.

== Who is it named after? ==
[[Image:Earth-moon.jpg|thumb|The Earth seen from the Moon]]

The word earth is used for both planet Earth and soil. Other names had been used for Earth such as Gaia, Tellus and Terra. Gaia is the Greek goddess (meaning Mother Earth) and Terra is the Roman name of the same goddess. Tellus is the Latin for &quot;Earth&quot;, many scientific words dealing with Earth will be derived form Latin.

'''Jupiter Facts''':
*Due to its magnetic field trapping particles from the Sun, Jupiter is surrounded by very powerful radiation belts which would kill anyone who entered them.
*Jupiter's moon Europa is thought to have a giant ocean below its surface.
*Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
*Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, second being Venus and first being the Earth's moon.
*Jupiter has more than twice the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined.
*Jupiter is considered an almost-star. The smallest red dwarf star was only 30% bigger than Jupiter.
*Jupiter's red spot and the Earth are close to the same size. That means that there is a storm going on in Jupiter that is as big as the Earth!
*''Jovian'' in English means anything relating to Jupiter &amp;mdash; the god or the planet. Sometimes the four outer planets are called the Jovian planets.
&lt;/div&gt;

'''Jupiter''' is by far the largest planet in our Solar System: two and a half times larger than all of the other planets put together. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and one of the brightest planets as seen from Earth. Jupiter, along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, is sometimes called a &quot;gas giant&quot; because most of these planets are made up of liquid and gas. 

==How big is the planet?==
[[File:SolarSystem OrdersOfMagnitude Sun-Jupiter-Earth-Moon.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Comparing the sizes of the Sun, Jupiter, Earth, and the Moon.&lt;!--  All four are in the top left.  Then:  Ten Jupiters make up the width of the Sun.  Eleven Earths make up the width of Jupiter;--&gt; Notice the red spot is about the size of the Earth!&lt;!--  Three and a half Moons make the width of the Earth.--&gt;]]
Jupiter is 142,984 km or about 11 Earths in diameter at the '''equator'''. That makes it about one tenth as big in diameter as the Sun! You could fit about 1,400 Earths into the volume of Jupiter. It is 133,709 km or 10 Earths in diameter from pole to pole. Jupiter's rapid '''rotation''' (it spins around in under ten hours compared with 24 hours for Earth) makes it bulge out at the equator.

Jupiter's magnetic field is the largest single planetary thing in the Solar System. It is 26 million kilometers across, making it about 20 times bigger than the Sun. It has a tail that extends past Saturn's orbit. If it could be seen from Earth, it would appear to be five times the size of the full moon.

== What is the surface like on  Jupiter ? == 
[[Image:Jupiter from Voyager 1.jpg|160px|left|Jupiter's atmosphere]]
The surface we see is not solid. This enormous planet has a relatively small solid and rocky core. Liquids and gases surround this core and blend with the atmosphere. 

Jupiter is a cloudy, windy and stormy planet. It is always covered by a layer of clouds, and wind speeds of 600 km/h are not uncommon. The storms are visible as swirls, bands and spots. A particularly violent storm, about three times Earth's diameter, is known as the Great Red Spot. This storm has been in existence since at least 1831, and maybe since 1665.  If the storm has existed since 1665, that would make it more than 300 years old!

The layer of clouds is divided into several bands. The lighter colored bands are called '''zones''' and the darker bands are called '''belts'''. The colors are caused by small changes in the temperature and chemistry. Each band rotates in the opposite direction from its neighbors. Along the edges where the bands meet, these winds collide and create swirling patterns.

The stormy atmosphere of Jupiter has flashes of lightning just like on Earth. However, while Earth's lightning strikes may be hotter than 50,000ºC, Jupiter's lightning strikes may go over 5,000,000ºC, which is a hundred times more than Earth lightning, and is more than the temperature of the sun's corona. The lightning is made by water near the tops of the clouds.

== What are its rings like? ==
[[Image:Jupiter Ring.png|right|200px|The rings of Jupiter as seen by the Voyager 2 spacecraft]]
Jupiter's rings are dark and hard to see. They are made of tiny particles that meteors knocked off Jupiter's small inner moons and debris left over from comets and other objects that came close to the surface of Jupiter.  In fact, until the Voyager spacecraft arrived near Jupiter and took closeup pictures of the rings of Jupiter, scientists didn't even know that it even had rings at all.  Two rings are clearly from material that can be associated with two sets of the inner moons of the planet.

These are the names of the rings and their sizes:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;

|}
Gossamer means in English anything that is delicate, light, and flimsy.

== What is the planet's atmosphere made of? ==
[[Image:Portrait of Jupiter from Cassini.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jupiter as seen by the space probe &quot;Cassini&quot;. This is the most detailed color portrait of Jupiter ever assembled.]]
In the outermost layer of Jupiter lies frozen Ammonia crystals.  (Amonia is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen; its scientific designation is NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.) crystals.

Jupiter's atmosphere is mainly made of '''hydrogen'''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Near the surface, there is almost 90% hydrogen. Apart from this, the atmosphere has helium(He). Because of the high pressure, helium becomes a liquid further down in the planet. In addition, Jupiter has methane(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(0.3%), hydrogen deuteride(HD)(0.003%), ethane(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)(0.0006%), and least of all, water(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(0.0004%).

Jupiter's temperature is very high. Because of this, scientists cannot tell all the materials the planet is made of. The outer core of Jupiter has hydrogen. The pressure present can make the gas solid. However, because of the very high temperature, the gas melts, and becomes liquid.

== What are its moons like? ==
[[File:Jupiter moons anim.gif|100x100px|framed|right|A simulation of the orbit paths of the moons of Jupiter.]]
Jupiter has 63 known moons. There are four major moons that were discovered by Galileo in 1610, the first moons ever discovered around another planet. Those moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto; they are named from characters in mythology closely associated with Jupiter. They are called the Galilean moons. There are often '''eclipses''' on Jupiter's cloud tops by the Galilean moons.

=== [[/Amalthea|Amalthea]] Group ===
There are four  small moons '''orbiting''' inside Io's orbit. That group is called the Amalthea group because Amalthea is the largest one. They are all small and potato shaped. Amalthea is very red. The material of Jupiter's rings came from meteors knocking it off of those moons. Amalthea(Greek:Ἀμάλθεια) in Greek mythology is a foster mother of Zeus.

=== [[/Io|Io]] ===
[[File:The Galilean satellites (the four largest moons of Jupiter).tif|300x120px|thumb|left|The four largest moons of Jupiter. From left to right with increasing distance: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.]]
Io (pronounced EYE-oh) is Jupiter's closest major moon. It is 3643.2 km across, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It has the most spectacular '''volcanoes''' in the solar system and molten '''sulfur''' lakes. Any craters formed by asteroids hitting the surface are quickly covered up by the volcanic activity. Io's core is made of molten '''iron''' and is surrounded by a rock shell. Unlike Jupiter's other moons, there is very little water on Io. Scientists think that when Jupiter was forming, it was hot enough to dry out Io, but not the other major moons. In Roman mythology, Io(Ancient Greek:Ἰώ) was a beautiful young nymph(Nymphs are divine spirits that animate nature and generally portrayed as beautiful young women.) that Zeus loved.

Europa(pronounced ''Eurṓpē'') is 3,121.6 km across, about 10% smaller than Earth's Moon. It is made of silicates and has a layer of smooth water ice 10 to 30 km thick.  The ice has long cracks in it and very few craters. It looks like the sea ice on Earth. The ice has slid around at the cracks. We believe there is liquid water under the ice as much as 100 km below the surface. There are also some large spots on the surface. In Roman mythology Europa was courted by Jupiter in the form of a bull. Europa(Greek:Ευρώπη)in Greek mythology was a Phoenician noblewoman who was abducted by Zeus to Crete (An island of Greece).

=== [[/Ganymede|Ganymede]] ===
[[File:Jupiter-moons.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Jupiter and its four largest moons, as seen through a telescope.]]
Ganymede is 5262.4 km across, making it 380 km wider than Mercury. It is Jupiter's largest moon and the largest moon in the Solar System. It has '''plate tectonics''' like Earth. There are older, darker regions and newer areas with grooves where the plates have moved. Newer craters have bright rays around them from material thrown up by impacts. Older craters look flat and faded because the icy surface does not hold the shape of the crater as well as rock does over long periods of time. Ganymede may have an iron and sulfur core with a silicate '''mantle''' and an icy shell. It may be similar to Io except with a layer of ice on it. In Roman mythology Ganymede was a beautiful young man who Jupiter kidnapped and made cupbearer to the gods on Mt. Olympus.

=== [[/Callisto|Callisto]] ===
[[File:Galileans.PNG|100x100px|framed|right|The orbit paths of the 4 largest moons.]]
Callisto is 4820.6 km across, about the same size as Mercury. It has many craters. Like craters on Ganymede, the older craters have faded. The largest crater is ''Valhalla''. It has a bright center 600 km across with rings around it up to 3000 km across. Callisto is made of silicates and ice. There is a 200 km thick icy '''crust''' with a liquid water sea under it. In Roman mythology Callisto was turned into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno. Later Jupiter placed her in the stars as The Great Bear.

=== Other moons ===

The other moons are smaller in several groups outside the orbits of the major moons. There is also a small moon, Themisto and four groups of small moons that orbit very far from Jupiter.

== How long is a day on this planet? ==
One Jupiter day is about 10 Earth hours long. You have to say &quot;about&quot; because different parts of Jupiter rotate about its axis at different speeds.  This is caused by the fact that Jupiter is mostly gases that are in constant motion and sometimes going in different directions.  Some efforts have been made to try and measure the rotation speed of the inner rocky core of Jupiter, but that has proved to be quite difficult to accomplish due to the magnetic fields that surround Jupiter and the very active radio energy that is generated by the atmosphere of Jupiter, which interferes with measuring techniques like radar that has been used to measure the surface of Venus and Mars.

== How long is a year on Jupiter? ==
[[Image:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Great Red Spot]]
[[Image:Hubble Spies Jupiter Eclipses.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jupiter Eclipses]]
One year on Jupiter is 4,335 Earth days or 11.87 Earth years long.

A Jupiter year is about equal to four-tenths (or two-fifths) of a Saturn year. Thus after every two Saturn years, Jupiter has completed five full orbits about the Sun. So after 59 years, Saturn and Jupiter will be back in nearly the same position. When the orbits of two planets are simple ratios of each other like this, it is called a '''resonance'''.&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== How much would Jupiter's gravity pull on me? ==
If someone were floating close to the cloud tops of Jupiter, it would pull them down with a force about two and a half times as strong as the force of Earth's gravity.

Jupiter's rapid rotation causes the equator to bulge out. This would also cancel out about 10 percent of gravity's force on them if they were at the equator. The amount of this counteraction becomes lower the closer they get to the poles.

== Who is it named after? ==
[[Image:Statue_of_Zeus.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Statue of Zeus (Jupiter) in Olympia, Greece]]

Jupiter (Latin ''Iuppiter'') is named after the king of the Roman gods, also called Zeus in ancient Greece.  The god Jupiter was known for causing lightning strikes on Earth. He is associated with the eagle and the oak tree.

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It is a ''terrestrial planet''; that means a planet made from rock like Earth. It does not have a gas atmosphere, so there is no weather. For a long time, only one spacecraft, Mariner 10, had visited Mercury. In January 2008, the MESSENGER spacecraft went by Mercury. It has gone by Mercury two more times,and has started to go around the planet in 2011.

== How big is Mercury? ==
[[en:Image:Mercury Earth Comparison.png|thumb|left|150px|Comparison of the size of Mercury to the Earth]]
Mercury is 4879 km across. Mercury's diameter is just less than half the diameter of the Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System. Only dwarf planets like Pluto are smaller. Because Mercury is much closer to the Sun than the Earth, it can only be seen just after the sun goes down at night or shortly before it rises in the morning.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== What is Mercury's surface like? ==
[[en:Image:M10 aom 3 8.png|thumb|left|400px|View of the surface of Mercury]]
Mercury has craters like those on the Earth's moon. The largest crater on Mercury is the ''Caloris Basin''. It is about 1300 km wide. It was created by a huge asteroid hitting Mercury. The asteroid was probably 100 km wide, but it hit Mercury's surface so hard that it made a much bigger hole.

{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}
The surface also has big cliffs called ''scarps''. They were made long ago when Mercury cooled down. It shrank, causing the surface to get wrinkled in some places. This wrinkling created the scarps.

There may also be ice on the top and bottom of Mercury. Like the Earth, these areas (called ''poles'') don't get much warmth from the Sun. Any ice there won't melt.

It is very hot during the day (over 400°C) because Mercury is so close to the Sun. At night it is very cold because Mercury loses almost all its heat since there is almost no ''atmosphere'' to keep the warmth there. The temperature can fall to almost -175°C.

== How long is a day on this planet? ==
Mercury ''rotates'' (spins around) much more slowly than the Earth. It takes Mercury 58 days to spin once as viewed from a distant star. Because Mercury orbits the sun very quickly, a day on Mercury lasts longer than 58 days. If you were standing on Mercury at the equator and timed how long it took the sun to go from directly overhead to sunset to sunrise and then rise directly overhead again, it would take 176 Earth days. These long days and nights allow for the temperatures to rise as high, and fall as low, as they do.

== How long is a year on Mercury? ==
Mercury has the shortest year in the Solar System. It is about 88 Earth days long. 

It used to be believed that the same side of Mercury always faced the Sun. In order for this to be true, Mercury would have to take the same amount of time to rotate (spin around) as it does to circle the sun. From watching it carefully we now know that Mercury's rotation is somewhat faster than its orbit. Because of the way the orbit and rotation work together, on Mercury, a day (the time from one sunrise to the next) is actually almost twice as long as a year.

== What is Mercury made of? ==
The center of Mercury is made of iron in partly-molten (liquid) form. We know that there is iron at the center because the planet generates a magnetic field.  It contains more iron for its size than any other planet in the Solar System. The rest of Mercury, its thick crust, is made of a special type of rock called ''silicate rocks''. There are craters near the poles that are constantly in shadow. Some of these craters contain ice. There is a huge crater on Mercury called Caloris Basin. It was formed when a comet hit the planet and ''lava'' or molten rock filled the impact crater. The round wall of this crater is over 2km tall.

== How much would Mercury's gravity pull on me? ==
If you were on Mercury, it would pull you down less than half (38%)as much as the Earth. An item that weighs 100 pounds on Earth, would only weigh 38 pounds on Mercury.

== Who discovered Mercury? ==
[[File:MESSENGER.jpg|200x200px|framed|left|A computer-generated simulation of MESSENGER orbiting Mercury.]]
Nobody really knows who first discovered Mercury, but the first known recorded observations of it are from tablets in Assyria about three and a half thousand years ago, in the 14th century BCE. This was probably something like an informational article about Mercury's movements. In these tablets, Mercury is called (in translation) ''The Jumping Planet''. Almost every ancient civilisation had their own written records and names for Mercury.

In 1639, an Italian astronomer named Giovanni Zupi observed that Mercury has phases, like the phases of the Moon, as it orbits around the Sun.  This is evidence that it ''does'' orbit around the Sun, an idea that was fairly new at the time, suggested less than a hundred century earlier by Copernicus.

Before the twentieth century, it was a mystery to all the astronomers how long it took for Mercury to rotate. They solved this mystery in 1962, when some astronomers sent radar signals to Mercury, which then bounced back to Earth: it takes 59 days for Mercury to rotate.

It isn't easy to sent a space probe from Earth to Mercury, because Mercury is much closer to the Sun and therefore orbits the Sun much faster than Earth does.  So a space probe would have to burn a lot of fuel to match its speed with Mercury, in order to orbit &amp;mdash;or land on&amp;mdash; the planet.  In 1973, a space probe Mariner 10 was sent to take measurements of Mercury and map its surface.  Because orbiting Mercury would be so expensive, Mariner 10 orbited the sun instead, and would take pictures each time it got close enough to Mercury.  Unfortunately, when Mariner 10 finally ran out of fuel, it had only mapped about 45% of the surface.  However, it also discovered that Mercury has an iron-rich core and a magnetic field.  29 years later, in 2004, another probe was launched, named MESSENGER.  MESSENGER stands for MErcury Surface, Space ENviorment, GEochemistry, and Ranging.  MESSENGER followed a complicated path that would slowly match speeds with Mercury without using much fuel.  It passed by Mercury three times, and finally settled into orbit around Mercury more than six years after it was launched.  By March 2013, MESSENGER had mapped 100% of the surface of Mercury.

== Who is this planet named after? ==
[[File:Mercurius.jpg|220x200px|framed|left|A statue of Mercury.]]
In Roman mythology, Mercury (Latin ''Mercurius'') was the messenger of the gods.  He wore a hat and sandals with wings on them, allowing him to travel around the world very quickly.  The planet Mercury was named after him because it moves faster than any other planet in the Solar System. It moves nearly 48 km ''every second''!  (Of course, the Romans didn't know that, but they could see how fast it moved across the sky.)The Greeks called this god Hermes.

'''Mars Facts''':
*Mars is red because of rust in the surface rocks
*A volcano on Mars called ''Olympus Mons'' is the highest mountain in our Solar System.
*Mars has polar ice caps that look like the ones on [[../Earth/]].
*Mars has ancient river beds where scientists think liquid water flowed millions or billions of years ago.
*The ''Tooting'' crater on Mars was named after a suburb in London because the discoverer &quot;thought [his] mum and brother would get a kick out of having their home town paired with a land form on Mars&quot;.
&lt;/div&gt;
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is called a ''terrestrial'' planet because its outer layers are made of rocky material like the Earth.

== How big is the planet?==
[[File:Mars_Earth_Comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Comparison of the size of Mars and the Earth]]
Mars is the second smallest of the eight major planets in the Solar System. Only Mercury is smaller. It is nearly 7,000 kilometres (km) wide; just over half the width of the Earth. Its volume is about 15% of the Earth. Since a lot of the Earth is covered by water, the total surface area of the Mars is nearly as large as all of the land on the Earth. It is possible that its size may eventually permit human colonies.
{{clear}}

== What is its surface like? ==
[[File:Spirit_Lookout_L256t-A413R1_br2.jpg|none|thumb|800px|A panorama view from the Mars rover ''Spirit''.]]

The surface of Mars is a lot like a desert on Earth; it is very dry and dusty, but it is also very cold. There are a lot of loose rocks and dunes of fine sand. Crater impacts mark the surface, but these are not as common as on the Moon. One of the craters is the huge ''Hellas Planitia''. It is about half the size of the continental United States. The southern half of the planet has more craters than in the north. The south is also higher in elevation.

[[Image:Olympus Mons.jpg|thumb|300px|An overhead view of ''Olympus Mons'', the highest mountain in the Solar System.]]
There is an area on Mars called the ''Tharsis Bulge'', which has four huge volcanoes. These volcanoes have not erupted for millions of years. The largest volcano is called Olympus Mons. It is 27 km tall, making it the highest mountain in the Solar System; ''more than three times'' higher than Mount Everest on Earth. It is 625 km across and takes up an area as big as the US state of Arizona. Mars also has a huge canyon called the ''Valles Marineris''. It is much bigger than the Grand Canyon on Earth. It is 4000 km long, up to 7 km deep and up to 200 km wide. Scientists think that when the ''Tharsis Bulge'' was created, the surface of Mars cracked to form the ''Valles Marineris''.

Like the Earth, Mars has ice caps at its poles. However, they are made from frozen carbon dioxide as well as ice. During the Martian winter at each pole, the cap grows as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere freezes. The cap shrinks again during the Martian summer.  As on Earth, when it is winter at one pole it is summer at the other.

In some places, there are dry ''channels'' that look like they were made by running water. So, a long time ago Mars may have had lakes and streams made of water. Now all of the water is frozen into ice under the surface.

There is an atmosphere on Mars, but it is very thin. There is also much more carbon dioxide in it than oxygen. (Oxygen is the gas we need when we breathe in; carbon dioxide the gas we get rid of when we breathe out.) So, we would need spacesuits to visit Mars. The atmosphere helps protect the surface from smaller meteorites.

When Mars comes closest to the Sun, the atmosphere can stir up storms of dust. Some of these storms are gigantic; they can cover the entire planet in clouds of dust. Dust storms on Mars can last for hundreds of days, with wind speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour. Huge storms like these have been seen from the Earth through telescopes.

== How long is a day and year on this planet? ==
One day on Mars is only 39 minutes and 35 seconds longer than a day on Earth (1.026 Earth days). A year on Mars is almost two Earth years long (687 Earth days).

Much like the Earth, the axis of rotation of Mars is tilted at an angle. This tilt causes seasons on Mars as it travels around the Sun. Summer occurs on the half of the planet that is tilted toward the Sun, and winter on the other half. After half a Martian year has passed, the seasons are reversed. But these seasons are about twice as long as on Earth.

== What is it made of? ==
[[Image:Mars interior.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]

The outer, rocky surface of Mars is called the crust. Most of the crust is made from basalt, a type of rock made when lava grows cold.

Like the Earth, Mars has a thick layer of rock below the crust called the mantle. The mantle is much hotter than the crust, and the mantle rock is partly molten. But the crust on Mars has grown thick, so the lava from the mantle no longer reaches the surface. There are volcanoes on Mars, but they are no longer active.

At the center of Mars is a core made of the metals iron and nickel. If Mars were the same size as the Earth, the core of Mars would be smaller than the Earth's core. So a larger amount of Mars is made out of rock. Because rock is lighter than the metals in the core, Mars has a lower density than the Earth.
{{clear}}

== How heavy would I be on Mars? ==
[[Image:MarsFromAbzt.jpg|thumb|300px|Detailed picture of Mars]]

If you were on Mars, you would be lighter, as Mars' gravity only has a force about two fifths as strong as the that of Earth's. You could lift objects that weigh almost three times as much compared to similar objects here on the Earth. You could jump up almost three times higher, and it would take much longer to fall to the ground from the same height.

Even though it looks as though you would be like a comic-book hero on Mars, there are some things you couldn't do. Although a big rock would ''weigh'' less and you could pick it up, it would still have the same ''mass''. If you tried to catch it, it would knock you over, and if it landed on you it would crush you. A car on the surface of Mars would need the same amount of power to speed up, although going uphill would be less of a problem. It may, however, need more room to stop. Because of the reduced gravity a vehicle would not &quot;grip&quot; the ground on Mars as strongly, but the constant mass would keep the vehicle moving just as strongly, making it easy to go into a skid.

== Who was it named after?==
In Roman mythology, Mars was the god of war and agriculture. The planet Mars was named this because the planet looks red like blood, from rust in its surface rocks.

== Who discovered Mars? ==

Nobody knows, but the earliest records were by Ancient Egyptians, more than 4000 years ago, noted Mars' movement. On one pharaoh's tomb, named ''Seti I'', Mars is drawn on the ceiling. The Babylonians (in the Middle East), Chinese, and Greek also studied Mars more than 3000 years ago. The Greeks learned about Mars from the Babylonians, and since the Babylonians called it their god of war, named ''Nergal'', the Greeks called it their own god of war, ''Ares''. Exploration of Mars was first attempted in 1960, with Mars 1. It failed, along with several other missions by the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The first successful mission to Mars was in 1964, by Mariner 4, by the U.S. Most of the other Mariner missions to Mars were successful. The last Mariner mission to Mars, Mariner 9, landed in the midst of a dust storm. So far, all these missions were flybys or orbiters. The first spacecraft to land on Mars was Viking 1 in 1976. Viking 2 landed 19 days later. Together, they took many good pictures of Mars' surface.

Saturn is 120,536 km or 9.449 Earths wide at the '''equator'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnDiameter&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html; http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is its surface like? ==
Saturn is mostly gas and liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;NasaSaturnOverview&quot;&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&amp;Display=OverviewLong&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn may have a small core of rock and ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;NasaGasGiantInteriors&quot;&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=166&lt;/ref&gt; The '''atmosphere''' has bands, but they are not as colorful as Jupiter's.

== What are its rings like? ==
[[Image:Saturn-cassini-March-27-2004.jpg|thumb|255px|Saturn casts a shadow on its rings]]
Saturn's rings are composed of rock and ice particles ranging in size from specks of dust to the size of a house. Some particles might even be a few kilometers wide! The particles in the rings are actually spaced far apart. It would be easy to pass through the rings.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnRings&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html; http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturnrings.htm; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&amp;Display=Rings&lt;/ref&gt;

== What are its moons like? ==
[[Image:Saturn-map.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Map of the Saturn system (NASA)]]
&lt;!--[[Image:Saturn (planet) large.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saturn with some of its moons]]--&gt;
Saturn has 56 moons, and many of them have names.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnNamedMoons&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html&lt;/ref&gt;The size of Saturn's moons and the size of the chunks of ice in its rings are similar, which means that we can never know the exact number of moons. &lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnMoonCount&quot;&gt;http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0860937.html&lt;/ref&gt; New moons are still being discovered. Saturn's biggest moon is named Titan, and is large enough to be a planet in its own right!


=== Shepherd moons ===
There are small potato-shaped moons in or near Saturn's rings. They control the ring particles with their gravity. That is why they are called shepherd moons. Six of them are known, and there may be more.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShepherdMoons&quot;&gt;http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/saturn.cfm#q13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Mimas|Mimas]] ===
Mimas is mostly made of water ice with a small amount of rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;MimasComp&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/mimas.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has a large '''crater''' for its size called ''Herschel''. It is 130 km across, making it about a third as big as Mimas.&lt;ref name=&quot;MimasCrater&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/mimas.html&lt;/ref&gt; The crater makes Mimas look like the Death Star from the ''Star Wars'' movies.

=== [[/Enceladus|Enceladus]] ===
Enceladus is made of ice. It is '''denser''' than the other icy moons. That suggests it also has some rock  inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnceladusComp&quot;&gt;http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/products/pdfs/20050830_CHARM_Esposito.pdf; http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb/phoebe.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has smooth areas, cracks and some craters. The smooth areas are younger. Craters there have been erased within the past 100 million years. Water vapor was found over a smooth area around the south pole. The cracks and grooves suggest '''tectonics''' similar to Ganymede's. Some ridges similar to Europa's ridges were also found. Those suggest oceans like Europa's under some areas of Enceladus.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnceladusSurface&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/enceladus.html; http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jul/HQ_05208_cassini_watery_world.html;&lt;/ref&gt;'''Tidal forces''' from Dione could be powering some of this activity. It is because Enceladus orbits Saturn twice for every orbit by Dione. This makes Dione and Saturn tug on Enceladus. This is similar to how Europa and Ganymede's tidal forces on Io power Io's volcanoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TidalForces&quot;&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/saturn/enceladus.shtml; http://www.spacedaily.com/news/cassini-01e3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Tethys|Tethys]] ===
[[Image:Tethys cassini.jpg|right|95px|Tethys imaged by the Cassini spacecraft.]]
Tethys is an icy moon that has many craters, including the huge ''Odysseus''. It is 400 km across, 1/5th as big as Tethys is. The crater had become flattened because the icy material does not hold its shape as well as rock would. There is also a large valley called ''Ithaca Chasma''. It is 3 to 5 km deep, 100 km wide and 2000 km long, three fourths of the way around Tethys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tethys&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/tethys.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two moons, Telesto and Calypso, which share Tethys' orbit. Telesto is ahead of Tethys and Calypso is behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;SharedOrbit&quot;&gt;http://apod.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020519.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Dione|Dione]] ===
Dione is made of lots of ice and there may be some rock in its '''core'''. It has lots of craters. The craters are flattened because the ice does not hold their shape as well as rock. One side has bright white lines that are fractures. Two moons share Dione's orbit. Helene is ahead of Dione and Polydeuces is behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dione&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/dione.html; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Dione; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Polydeuces&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Rhea|Rhea]] ===
Rhea is an icy moon similar to Dione with some rock in the core. It has many craters mostly on one side, and the other side has some bright white icy areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhea&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/rhea.html; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Rhea&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Titan|Titan]] ===   
[[Image:Titan multi spectral overlay.jpg|left|95px|Titan imaged by the Cassini spacecraft.]]   
Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest one in the solar system.&lt;ref name=&quot;TitanSize&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Titan&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only moon in the Solar System that has a thick atmosphere. The atmosphere is made of '''nitrogen''', '''argon''', '''methane''' and various '''organic compounds'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TitanAtmosphere&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html; http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Titan&lt;/ref&gt; Its surface has light and dark areas and few craters. The Cassini probe discovered a huge crater 440 km wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;TitanSurface&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/titan.html; http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-021605.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Hyperion|Hyperion]] ===
Hyperion is made of water ice with a little rock. It is potato shaped. It wobbles instead of rotating in the same way other moons do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyperion&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/hyperion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Iapetus|Iapetus]] ===
[[Image:Iapetus 706 1419 1.jpg|right|95px|Mosaic of Iapetus images taken by the Cassini spacecraft.]]
Iapetus is almost entirely ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;IapetusComp&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has a light area called ''Roncevaux Terra'' that has craters.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoncevauxTerra&quot;&gt;http://www.seasky.org/solarsystem/sky3g8.html&lt;/ref&gt; There is a big dark area called ''Cassini Regio'' that covers half of Iapetus. The dark material may be from Phoebe. Some of it is on the bottom of craters. Some huge craters and a ridge have been discovered in ''Cassini Regio'' by the Cassini probe. The ridge stretches 1300 km along the equator. It is up to 20 km high, which is over 2.26 times higher than Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=&quot;CassiniRegio&quot;&gt;http://www.solarviews.com/cap/pia/PIA06166.htm; http://www.solarviews.com/eng/iapetus.htm; http://www.nineplanets.org/iapetus.html; http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap030831.html&lt;/ref&gt; More huge craters were found in ''Roncevaux Terra'' when Cassini went by Iapetus again.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoncevauxTerra2&quot;&gt;http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=2763&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Phoebe|Phoebe]] ===
Phoebe is made of ice and rock. It looks dark because it has a layer of dark material on the outside. It also looks rough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoebe&quot;&gt;http://www.solarviews.com/eng/phoebe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other moons ===
There are two groups of small outer moons. Phoebe is part of the second outermost group.&lt;ref name=&quot;OtherMoons&quot;&gt;http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0860937.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== How long is a day on this planet? ==
One day on Saturn is about 10 hours and 39 minutes in Earth time.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnDay&quot;&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&amp;Display=Facts&amp;System=Metric&lt;/ref&gt;

== How long is a year on this planet? ==
One year on Saturn is about 29.46 Earth years long. That is 10,760 Earth days!&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnYear&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is it made of? ==
Saturn has a rocky core. Around the core, there is ice. Above the ice is liquid metallic '''hydrogen'''. On top of that is gaseous hydrogen. There is no place where the hydrogen suddenly turns from a gas to a liquid.

The gaseous hydrogen makes up most of Saturn's atmosphere. Other gases there include '''helium''' and some other gases. There may be rain made of helium falling through the hydrogen. There is also ammonia on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnComp&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html; http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturn.htm; http://www.seasky.org/solarsystem/sky3g1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== How much would Saturn's gravity pull on me? ==
If you were floating close to the cloud tops of Saturn, it would pull you down with a force only a little stronger than the force of Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnGravity&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of Saturn's large '''radius''' and its '''mass''' almost cancel each other out, making the force only a little bigger. So, if you weighed 100 lbs. on Earth, you would weigh 106 lbs. on Saturn.

== Who is it named after? ==
Saturn is named after the most important Roman god of agriculture and harvest time. He taught people how to farm.  He was the father of Jupiter. Saturday is named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaturnName&quot;&gt;http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/saturn.html; http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_kids/AskKids/saturn_name.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== How big is Uranus?==
[[Image:Uranus_Earth_Comparison.png|left|px200|thumb|Comparison of the size of Uranus and the Earth]]
Uranus is 51,118 kilometers or about four Earths wide. It is the third widest and fourth heaviest planet in the Solar System.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

== What is the surface of Uranus like? ==
Uranus does not have a surface that you could stand on without going deep into the '''atmosphere'''. Under the atmosphere, there may be an even mixture of rock and ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusUnderAtmos&quot;&gt;[http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm]; [http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What are the rings around Uranus like?==
Uranus has eleven rings. They are dark in colour and very hard to see. They were discovered by accident in 1977. Scientists were studying a bright star near Uranus. However, the star's light was blocked before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. From this, they figured out that Uranus has a ring system.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusRings&quot;&gt;[http://www.solarsystem.org.uk/uranus/ http://www.solarsystem.org.uk/uranus/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== What are its moons like? ==
[[image:uranus rings and moons.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Uranus's rings and moons]]

Uranus has 27 known moons, which places it third in the Solar System for number of moons. The five main ones are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusMoons&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/index.html; http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Miranda|Miranda]] ===
Miranda is the smallest and closest of Uranus's major moons. It is mainly made of ice and rock. Miranda's surface has grooves, cliffs, and valleys. The moon was named after a character in ''The Tempest'', a play by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miranda&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/miranda.html http://www.nineplanets.org/miranda.html]; http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/miranda.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Ariel|Ariel]] ===
Ariel is made of rock and ice. Ariel has many valleys, but not many craters.  Ariel was named after a  character in the poem ''The Rape of the Lock'' by Alexander Pope.  Ariel is also a spirit in ''The Tempest'' by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariel&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/ariel.html http://www.nineplanets.org/ariel.html]; http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/ariel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Umbriel|Umbriel]] ===
Umbriel is made of lots of ices and some rock. It is also the darkest of Uranus's major moons. Umbriel was named after a character in the poem ''The Rape of the Lock'' by Alexander Pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Umbriel&quot;&gt;http://www.nineplanets.org/umbriel.html; http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/umbriel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[/Titania|Titania]] ===
Titania is the largest moon of Uranus. It is mostly ice and rock. The surface is covered with canyons. It was named after the Queen of the Fairies in ''A Midsummer's Night Dream'', a play by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titania&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/titania.html; http://www.nineplanets.org/titania.html]; http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/titania.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

=== [[/Oberon|Oberon]] ===
Oberon is the outermost of the major moons of Uranus. It is made of the same things as Titania. It has many craters. Some of them have white rays around them and dark crater floors. It was named after the King of the Fairies in ''A Midsummer's Night Dream''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oberon&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/oberon.html http://www.nineplanets.org/oberon.html]; http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/oberon.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Moons ===
There are 13 tiny moons known to be '''orbiting''' Uranus inside Miranda's orbit. Nine more tiny moons are known to be in big orbits beyond Oberon's orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;OtherMoons&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/uraniansatfact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== How long is a day on Uranus? ==
One day on Uranus is about 17.24 Earth hours long. Uranus spins on its side, maybe because of a big impact early in the history of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusDay&quot;&gt;Gierasch, Peter J., and Philip D.

== What is Uranus made of? ==
Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is thought to be made mostly of rock and ice. The gases in its atmosphere are 83% '''hydrogen''', 15% '''helium''', and 2% '''methane'''.  Other gases found in smaller amounts are ammonia, water, and '''methane'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusComp&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html]; [http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Uranus' blue color comes from '''methane''' clouds, which absorb red light and reflect blue light.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== How much would Uranus's gravity pull on me? ==
If you were floating close to the cloud tops of Uranus, you would be pulled down with a force about 89% of Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;UranusGravity&quot;&gt;Gierasch, Peter J., and Philip D. Nicholson. &quot;Uranus.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004. World Book, Inc.

{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}
[[Image:Neptune_Earth_Comparison.png|left|200px|thumb|Comparison of the size of Neptune and the Earth]]
Neptune is very similar to Uranus in size. Its diameter is only slightly smaller, at 49,528 km wide. &lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneDiameter&quot;&gt;Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004. World Book, Inc. [http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900 http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900]; [http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost as big as four Earths in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarthDiameter&quot;&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is its surface like? ==
The '''atmosphere''' of Neptune has some dark blue spots. When the Voyager probe went by Neptune in 1989, it saw a large one called the Great Dark Spot. In 1994, it vanished, but later reappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004. World Book, Inc. [http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900 http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900]; [http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large white cloud nicknamed &quot;Scooter.&quot; It goes around Neptune every 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html]; [http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;filename=science_resources_neptune.html http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;filename=science_resources_neptune.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The winds of Neptune are very fast, blowing at up to 2000 km per hour(the fastest in the entire solar system).&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneWind&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html]; [http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level1/neptune.html http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level1/neptune.html]&lt;/ref&gt; That is about four times faster than the fastest recorded tornado on Earth.

== What are its rings like? ==
Neptune has some faint rings that are dark and hard to see. There are clumps in some parts of the rings where the material is '''denser'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneRings&quot;&gt;Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004.

== What are its moons like? ==
Neptune has 13 moons. There could be more.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneMoons&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inner Moons ===
There are five small potato-shaped moons '''orbiting''' close to Neptune.

Proteus is a dark moon about 418 km across. It has an irregular shape. In Roman mythology Proteus was a sea-god who could change into any shape he wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proteus&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/proteus.html http://www.nineplanets.org/proteus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[/Triton|Triton]] ====
Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. Scientists think that it is a lot like Pluto. It is 2700 km across. It is made of rock and ice. It has a surface temperature of &amp;minus;235 &amp;deg;C  Triton has a very thin atmosphere made up of '''nitrogen''' and a little '''methane'''.

There are volcanoes that have eruptions of liquid nitrogen, dust or methane compounds. The eruptions happen because of the seasons. There are few '''craters''' because the eruptions cover them up. There are ice caps that change sizes with the seasons. There are also '''ridges''' and '''valleys'''. They may have formed because of repeated freezing and thawing.

An interesting thing about Triton's orbit is that it goes around Neptune in the opposite direction that Neptune's rotates. Because of this, scientists think that Triton was captured by Neptune long ago. In Roman mythology, Triton was the son of Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Triton&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/triton.html http://www.nineplanets.org/triton.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[/Nereid|Nereid]] ====
Nereid is an irregularly shaped moon about 340 km across. Its orbit is very eccentric or noncircular. It may have been captured by Neptune or moved into the eccentric orbit by Triton's gravity when Triton got captured. In Roman mythology Nereids were sea nymphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nereid&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/nereid.html http://www.nineplanets.org/nereid.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outer Moons ===
There are five other known moons. They are small potato-shaped moons far from Neptune. There might be more we haven't seen yet.

== How long is a day on this planet? ==
A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and 7 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneDay&quot;&gt;Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004. World Book, Inc. [http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900 http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar386900]; [http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/neptune_worldbook.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==How long is a year on this planet?==
One year on Neptune is about 165 Earth years, or 60,265 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneYear&quot;&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html]; Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004.

== What is it made of? ==
Neptune is made of rock and metal in the '''core'''. The core is probably bigger than Uranus's because Neptune weighs more, but is the same size.  Around the core is rock, water, '''ammonia''' and '''methane'''. The atmosphere is made of '''hydrogen''' and '''helium'''. Lower down in the atmosphere, there is methane and ammonia too. The methane makes Neptune look blue-green.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneComp&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html]; Smith, Bradford A. &quot;Neptune.&quot; World Book Online Reference Center. 2004.

== How much would Neptune's gravity pull on me? ==

If you were floating close to the cloud tops of Neptune, it would pull you down with a force only a little stronger than the force of Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneGravity&quot;&gt;Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 281. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of Neptune's larger '''radius''' and its '''mass''' almost cancel out, making the force only a little bigger.

== Who is it named after? ==
Neptune is named after the Roman god of the seas, also known as Poseidon in ancient Greece. &lt;ref name=&quot;NeptuneName&quot;&gt;Snow, Theodore P. (1996) &quot;The Outer Planets.&quot; In ''The Dynamic Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy''. pp. 282. West Publishing Company. ISBN 0-314-64212-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Typing commands on the keyboard can be tiring and error prone. If you are using Celestia to show the universe to others, a script may be an effective way to tour the stars. 

== Types of Scripting ==
Celestia supports two different Scripting languages, CEL and CELX (Lua). These can be used to add new functionality to the program, or to run educational activities. 

=== CEL scripting ===

See the page [[Celestia/Cel_Scripting]]

=== CELX scripting ===

See the page [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting]]

=== Other Languages ===
You can use any other language you want if it can pass commands to the operating system's command interpreter. It can issue the command to run Celestia and can include on that command line the instruction to run a .CEL Celestia script or .CELX Lua script. 

When invoked from a command line, Celestia can be passed the name of a .CEL or .CELX script to run at startup: 

 ./celestia --url name-of-script.cel

When the command line includes the qualifier &quot;--once&quot;, the command line will be passed to the running copy of Celestia instead of starting a new copy of the program. (note: use two hyphens) 

 ./celestia --once --url name-of-script.celx

(Starting with Celestia v1.3.1, scripts may be in any folder. Previously they had to be in Celestia's &quot;root&quot; folder.)

hey check out the image of the sun in the wikipedia aricle [[Wikipedia:sun|sun]] it pulls up a moving image really cool actually --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 23:06, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I don't see it. There are two still images on that page, but I don't see any moving ones :-(  [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:13, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::Oh I see. Yes it is cool. Larsie was that you who tried to add the image to this module direct from the wikipedia page? Because it doesn't work. All I see is a message &quot;Missing Image&quot;. When you put an image link in, the software checks to see if it's here, if not it checks wikicommons -and that's it. It doesn't check wikipedia.

This page is going to need the standard do not directly look at the sun warning[[User:Geni|Geni]]

:Good idea, we should also show how to make a simple pinhole camera for safe viewing of the Sun. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:17, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)


==Distance==

I added the distance to the sun, as that should be in there somewhere, but if it should be moved to another section that's fine. --[[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 23:45, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Sample spread ==

I whipped this up. It's a little sparse, and some of the orange text overlaps the sun picture, and the colors got really intense when I went from CMYK to RGB, but it's a start. Let me know what you guys think. [[User:LockeShocke|LockeShocke]] 00:57, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

That whole thing could be done with no pics (or just one depending on how you do it), just html and css. would take some time and some know-how but its possible. I think as a mock up it looks pretty damn good.

== Solar Wind ==

Is a section needed on the Solar Wind? &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 20:18, 31 May 2005 (UTC)
:Okay I added a short section. Wasn't sure how much detail to add. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 22:44, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::I apologize for editing/deleting the words that you put in for the solar wind.  I tried to incorporate the major ideas that you had, but it has been substantially reworded as part of an overall expanded explaination of the solar atmosphere in general.  I also feel that the discussion of the aurora needs to be put on the Earth page instead, although perhaps we need to add something about auroras in general here, as they also occur on all of the other planets with an atmosphere (Does Mercury have aurora?  Really, I don't know.)[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:43, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Possible Minor Clarification for How Bright a Sunspot is ==

Right now, the brightness of a sunspot is compared to an electric arc.  Would it be possible to compare it with a light bulb of the appropriate wattage instead?  I think that might be clearer to young readers.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:192.160.51.70|192.160.51.70]] ([[User talk:192.160.51.70|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/192.160.51.70|contribs]]) 13:17, 23 June 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Suggestion of possible warning message ==

My concern here is that with the mention of various aspects of the Sun, that children will want to look at it.  While that is not a bad thing, perhaps we should warn children that looking directly at the Sun is dangerous - viewing the Sun should only be done with appropriate protective eyewear or a protective apparatus (I don't think sunglasses count).  I saw that there was a blurb hidden within the text, and there's a previous comment here about it.  Could we put it in a little more visible place?  Maybe the top?
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:13:38, 23 June 2005|13:38, 23 June 2005]] ([[User talk:13:38, 23 June 2005|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/13:38, 23 June 2005|contribs]]) 192.160.51.70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:I added a warning message into the 'fact box' section.  This is a valid point.  BTW, I would personally (Non-NPOV here... so I don't think it is easy to put into the module) recommend using welding goggles or other similar filters.  Solar observatories use somewhat similar filters that are even stronger....they look like black glass or even obsidian until you see the sun through it.  If you ever get a chance to see solar prominences through one of these telescopes, it is an experience that is nothing short of incredible, and photos just don't do it justice. (I had my first experience at Mt. Wilson observatory in Los Angeles.)[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:06, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Better basic facts ==

I really dislike most of the &quot;Sun Facts&quot; on this page.
For example, &quot;The sun is really a star&quot; suggets that it might be something else.  Perhaps just &quot;the sun is the closest star to earth&quot;

The one about the sun blowing up should be replaced with something that explains how light takes 8 mins to travel from the sun the earth.

And also, ALL bodies that rotate around an axis move faster along the equator because the distance of the circumference is greater at the equator than at the poles.  Perhaps this should be changed to &quot;The Sun rotates about an axis, just as Earth does&quot; or something. [[User:Doom Of Doom|Doom of Doom]] 26 Jul 2005

:I completely agree.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 06:04, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

::Actually, the sun &quot;swirls&quot; around on its axis.  The equator completes a rotation sooner than the higher latitudes.  I think it is 25 Earth days for the equator, 35 for the higher latitudes.  When we talk about the surface of the Sun, we are talking about the photosphere, which is a gas.  Presumably, the Earth's atmosphere swirls around the Earth's axis in a similar way. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 04:22, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== Photoshpere ==

On section &quot;What are sunspots?&quot;, &quot;photoshpere&quot; is mentioned without previously defined and without a short explanation: &quot;The Umbra is about 2000 °C (3600 °F) cooler than the photosphere and only looks dark in relation to its surroundings.&quot;

== Move Heliopause and Zodiacal Light to &quot;Solar System&quot;? ==

I don't think either of these things are part of the sun.  What do you all think?--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:22, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

Well, ok, Heliopause *IS* part of the sun.  But maybe Zodiacal light is not so much a part of the sun's atmosphere.  Since Zodiacal Light is the light reflected from interplanetary dust, I think it is only part of the sun in the way that the asteroids are part of the sun.  I am thinking Zodiacal Light should be moved to the &quot;The Solar System&quot; module, perhaps right after &quot;asteroids&quot;.  I might just be bold enough to do it. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 04:18, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== Voyager recorded &quot;'''the bump'''&quot; ??? ==

''In May 2005, the Voyager I spacecraft went through this region recorded the bump.''

: not sure what this means b ut it is unclear and need some sort of fix [[User:Pedant|Pedant]] 19:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

You are correct.  That's bad writing. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 13:05, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

== Proofreading Done ==

I have proofread this entire page following the plan, except for the references section. I am not sure what the current policy is about locking the page to prevent it from becoming &quot;unproofread&quot;. Who is the admin for this area?

== Dubious factoid ==
Copy paste from a post I just made on reddit
:&quot;This seems way off to me. Order of magnitude approximations: volume of a pinhead is about a mm cubed density of sun's core is about 150 g per cm cubed so the piece would way 0.15 g heat capacity of hydrogen gas is about 15 J per g per degree K at ambient pressure and temperature, which probably bears little resemblance to the heat capacity of material in the sun's core. I'll use 150 J/gK as an upper bound. Temperature at the sun's core is about 15000000 K, so with simple arithmetic we get the thermal energy in that piece of sun is about 300000000 J, which is equivalent to about 0.1 tons of TNT exploding. While impressive, this is nowhere near sufficient to kill someone at 100 miles. Atomic weapons equivalent to millions of tons of TNT are survivable at less than that range. Unless my value for heat capacity was off by over a factor of 10000, this post is completely incorrect.
tl,dr, OP lies (or is at least misinformed)&quot;
Unless someone can give a better source for that factoid it should be removed. Bouer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I like the new navigation markers (&lt;^&gt;) that you put in.  They are very simple, elegant and  fairly intuitive.  It also makes it simple to go through sideways through the documentation, page by page.  

However, I have a few minor concerns for which you may already have a solution:

* I wonder how well the &lt;^&gt; alone will work once the documentation pages become nested several layers deep.  In the Menu documentation section, for example, we are starting to  go 3 layers deep in the preference section, i.e.:

'''''Online OsiriX Documentation Table of Contents &gt; OsiriX Menu &gt; OsiriX General Preferences'''''

With the &lt;^&gt; system, it will be clear how to go up the tree from &quot;Here&quot; to &quot;There&quot; or from side to side, but I'm not sure it will be completely clear to the user where &quot;Here&quot; is and how far down the tree or to the side &quot;There&quot; is.

* The &lt;^&gt; alone doesn't seem to provide a quick way to get back to the front page, or any arbitrary distance up the tree.  The original &quot;bread crumb trail&quot; method I started with  allows this, although it takes up a lot more screen space and doesn't allow one to move to either side.

* As long as the documentation is only 2 layers deep, it's not hard to know which page the &lt;^&gt; should point to next.  However, once we get deeper than that, it's less clear.  Should the &gt; lead to the next section of the same level, or should it go to the first page of the next section no matter how far down the tree it is?

* It also seems to me that once the documentation gets only slightly more complex, it could become a real headache to keep all of the &lt;^&gt; updated properly, especially if we decide to add a new page or rearrange the order of the pages.

Can you think of some way we can resolve these issues?  I'd love to find some solution that keeps all the benefits of both systems.  Whatever system we arrive at, I hope that it will be one that will make it easy to keep the different multilingual versions of the documents congruent. 

However, perhaps I am thinking too linearly -- maybe I should be thinking more in a hypertext manner. :-)  Perhaps there is already some cool Wiki solution or convention for handling this of which I am unaware.

Best Regards,

==The Mythical Period==

According to legend, Chinese history began with a succession of three rulers - half-human, half-animal - followed by five emperors. The three rulers - Fuxi, Nüwa, and Shennong - each are credited with contributing to the early people's lifestyles:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Fuxi''' - traditional reign began in 2852 B.C. Introduced domestication of animals and founded the basic social structure of family life.
&lt;li&gt;'''Nüwa''' - wife of Fuxi. She is also credited for his accomplishments.
&lt;li&gt;'''Shennong''' - divine farmer who taught agriculture to the settled peoples.
&lt;/ul&gt;

Following this period, five successors introduced the basic aspects of culture:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Huangdi''', or the '''Yellow Emperor''' - traditional reign lasted from 2698 B.C. - 2599 B.C. As with the aforementioned rulers, his existence may be mythical as well; the period of his reign occurred about one millennium before Chinese history was recorded. Nevertheless, he has been regarded as the ancestor of all Han Chinese - the largest ethnic nationality in all of China. Some of his achievements include the institution of Chinese characters (thus leading to literacy), the development of silk (from silkworms), and the establishment of the principles of Traditional Chinese medicine.
&lt;li&gt;'''Zhuanxu''' - credited with the creation of the Chinese calendar, as well as the introduction of religion and astrology (this may or may not correspond to the Chinese zodiac).
&lt;li&gt;'''Emperor Ku''' - dates suggest he ruled from 2412 B.C. - 2343 B.C.; however, little else is known about his contributions.
&lt;li&gt;'''Emperor Yao''' - reign lasted from 2317(?) B.C. - 2234 B.C. He is believed to have served as a &quot;role model&quot; for future rulers due to his dignity and diligence. Some also credit him for creating the popular board game, &quot;weiqi&quot; (also known as &quot;Go&quot;).
&lt;li&gt;'''Emperor Shun''' - reign lasted from 2233 B.C. - 2205 B.C. Although he did not follow the bloodline of Yao (Shun was a peasant), he was chosen to succeed the former because of his 'devotion to his (own) father'. Shun's devotion also set an example for future rulers.
&lt;/ul&gt;

Like Yao, Shun also chose his successor rather than continue the family line. He appointed Yu, a paragon who helped to drain the floodwaters around much of eastern China. At this point, archaeological evidence suggests that he founded the Xia Dynasty in 2205 B.C.

==The Xia Dynasty (c. 2070 B.C. - 1600 B.C.)==
Because Yu was also a Chinese mythological figure, the existence of the Xia dynasty is somewhat debatable, as most of it is based off of cultural legends. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence (dated from the Shang and later dynasties) shows that an early farming culture was established around 2205 B.C., centralized in the the Huang (Yellow) River Valley and the surrounding region. The early peoples of the Xia were also believed to have created a primitive writing system, though this is also questionable as no written records have yet been found near that region. 

Based on available evidence and findings, the Xia developed sufficient agricultural methods and techniques and generally experienced considerable prosperity. Lack of irrigation and flood protection made the region prone to frequent floods and other natural disasters, however. Eventually, the peoples of the Xia were overthrown by rebels c. 1760 B.C., who in turn established new rule in the Huang River Valley.

==The Shang Dynasty (c. 1760 B.C. - 1120 B.C.)==
Upon establishment c. 1760 B.C., the Shang developed a theocratic government centered around the capital city of Anyang (south of the Huang River, in present-day Henan province). Shang kings were believed to fulfill sacred rather than political purposes; thus, a council of chosen advisers administered various aspects of the government. The dynasty claimed rule over much of northern China, but in reality its control and influence did not spread as far and wide. Farther away from the capital, aristocrats who pledged support to the king governed local areas and managed affairs such as defense, militia, and tax collection. The border territories of Shang rule were led by chieftains who gained the right to govern through connections with and/or acceptance from the royalty.

===Society and Class Divisions===
Citizens during the Shang dynasty can be classified into four social classes: the king &amp; aristocracy, the military, artisans &amp; craftsmen, and peasants.

The aristocracy were centered around Anyang, the Shang capital, and conducted governmental affairs for surrounding areas. Regional territories were also controlled by the wealthy, although their roles were limited to local districts as opposed to the entire state.

Following the aristocracy came the Shang military, who were respected and honored for their skill. There were two sub-divisions: one for infantry (foot soldiers) and one for chariot warriors. The latter were noted for great skill in warfare and hunting, and evidence has shown that horses and other cavalry were utilized by the Chinese during the late Shang period, c. 1250 B.C.

Artisans and craftsmen comprised the 'middle class' of Shang society. Their largest contribution was their work with bronze, which the Chinese developed as early as 1500 B.C. Bronze weapons and pottery were commonly made, but the most prominent creations included ritual vessels and treasures, many of which were discovered via archaeological findings in the 1920s and 1930s. Shang aristocrats and the royalty were believed to have been buried with large supplies of bronze valuables, particularly wine vessels and other ornate structures.

At the bottom of the social ladder were the peasants, the poorest of Chinese citizens. They comprised the majority of the population, and were limited to farming and selling crops for profit. Archaeological findings have shown that masses of peasants were buried with aristocrats, leading some scholars to believe that they were the equivalent of slaves, but other scholars have countered that they were similar to serfs. Peasants were governed directly by local aristocrats.

===Early Chinese Culture===
The Shang dynasty gave birth to much of modern Chinese culture, and thus set the 'template' for further development by future dynasties.

Chinese writing had its origins in Shang culture as a means to unify the various dialects spoken by regional Chinese. The earliest forms of writing were depicted using pictographs, where primitive drawings conveyed symbols, objects, and ideas. Although not as detailed as Egyptian hieroglyphics or other ancient forms of writing, the pictographs served as a basic form of written communication. As years passed and the language grew, ideographs replaced these pictures, and used more simplified symbols to communicate. Combinations of symbols produced characters, which could be used to express more complex ideas. Over time, more and more characters became incorporated into the Chinese language. Scribes learned the writing system to record historical accounts and other royal documentation; they used calligraphy as a 'script' to record such observations.

Shang religion was characterized by a combination of animism (spiritual control of the world) and ancestral respect and worship. Natural and mythological symbols such as the moon, sun, wind, rain, dragon, and phoenix were controlled by respective gods, to whom peasants prayed for bountiful harvests. Festivals became common and celebrated the gods in hopes for a good spring harvest. The great god Shang Di, believed to rule over humanity and nature, was consulted by rulers for advice and wisdom. Thus, Shang kings believed themselves to be divine rulers. Priests frequently consulted both the gods and rulers as well - they inscribed divine questions on oracle bones (dried animal bones, especially turtle shells) and heated them until a series of cracks appeared on the surface. These cracks were interpreted in an attempt to seek answers to such questions.

The Chinese also established a lunar calendar that was used to predict and record events such as harvests, births, and deaths (of rulers and peasants alike). The system assumed a 29-day month that began and ended with each new moon; twelve lunar months comprised one lunar year. Priests and astronomers were trained to recalculate the lunar year and add enough days such that each year lasted 365 days. Because the calendar was used to time both crop planting and harvest, the king had to employ skilled astronomers such that predicted dates (and successes) of annual harvests would help him maintain support from the people.

==The Zhou Dynasty (1122 B.C. - 256 B.C.)==
Toward the end of the Shang dynasty, a new faction of rebels amassed within the empire. Naming themselves the Zhou, they overthrew the last of the Shang kings in 1122 B.C. and instituted the Zhou dynasty, with its capital at present-day Xi'an.

===&quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;===
The Zhou claimed that their rule had been justified by the '''mandate of heaven''', the idea that the king was chosen by the gods (as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;) but could be deposed if he ruled unfairly or tyrannically.  In other words, the Zhou believed that the last Shang king lost his mandate and 'transferred' it to the new ruler, who in turn became 'blessed' by the gods. The mandate of heaven was also used to justify the demise of the Xia dynasty as well, and would be repeated by future dynasties.

It looks like there's a confusion in present continous and present tenses. For an example, &quot;I go&quot; is almost never used in the meaning of &quot;I am going&quot; in Turkish. The first is translated as &quot;giderim&quot; and the latter as &quot;gidiyorum&quot;. This works as it would in English. But, sometimes a literal tranlation would give a wrong meaning; &quot;I understand&quot; should be translated as &quot;Anladım&quot; (I understood).

==Splash Screen==
I read somewhere the splash screen isn't a good idea, or that helpful, should we delete it?

----
minute details of pronounciation are too intricate and unnecessary to introduce this early.&lt;br&gt;(noone really will understand the difference if you pronounce 'deyil' or 'deghil' and noone really woud attempt to pronounce 'limon' with a back-L)&lt;br&gt;

== The big tidy up ==

Hey, I've cleaned up to some extent this Wikibook, splitting it into seperate pages, and added a picture. I hope everyone is happy with this and good luck with continuing the book. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:56, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

== Thank You ==

I'd just like to express my appreciation for those who are working on this book. I am eager for it to be developed further so that I may learn more Turkish. So far, it is well-structured and easy to understand. Keep up the good work! --[[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 05:12, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

== Someone please add next page and previous page texts. ==

== New TOC template ==
Hi everyone... this is my fist time contributing to a wikibook, though I've been a Wikimedia fan for a while now. Since I'm a novice Turkish speaker, I probably won't contribute to the content as much as I will learn from it; OK so I created this template named [[Template:TurkishTOC]] so that links can be easily included on every page to the previous, next, and all other pages. Just add the text
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TurkishTOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
at the top of each page (or wherever) for a full TOC that looks like this:
{{TurkishTOC}}
Or add the text
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TurkishTOC|mini}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
at the bottom for a condensed TOC that looks like this:
{{TurkishTOC|mini}}
I guess the table of contents will need to be updated if changes are made to page titles, or if new pages are added, etc. That can be done by editing the template page directly: [[Template:TurkishTOC]]. Of course there might be a better way to do this sort of thing, so if someone knows a better system please show us. I think this is a good project and am looking forward to learning from it :)

== Picture of Mount Olympos ==
Is the actual Mount Olympos in Turkey? If you look at the corresponding wikipedia article, it says it's in mainland Greece.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympos

:Yes, it is in Greece...
:There is also an Olmypos in Turkey

== Exercises, anyone? ==

Merhaba! I'm beginning to learn Turkish as my 5th language and I think this Wikibook needs some exercises at the end of each lesson. I'll begin by adding a few. [[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 16:58, 2 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sun is the star at the center of the solar system, around which Earth, the seven other planets, and numerous other bodies revolve.  It is sometimes called Sol (hence the term &quot;solar system&quot;).  The Sun has a mean diameter of 1.392 million kilometers, which is 109.1 times the diameter of Earth and 9.7 times the diameter of the largest planet, Jupiter.  The Sun's rotation period relative to the distant stars is 25.05 Earth-days at its equator and 34.3 Earth-days at the poles.

== Solar Structure and Composition ==
[[Image:Sun920607.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Sun]]
'''The sun''' is composed of extremely hot, gaseous material. Because of the high temperatures, this material exists in a state called ''plasma'', in which electrons have been stripped from their parent nuclei.  The Sun's composition is roughly 90% hydrogen and 10% helium, by total numbers of nuclei. Considering mass, about 71 percent of the Sun is hydrogen, and 27 percent helium. The difference is due to the fact that helium nuclei have about 4 times the mass of hydrogen nuclei (protons). There are small percentages of other elements mixed in.

The Sun is made up of a series of layers, which can be thought of as a set of concentric &quot;shells&quot; from the core outward.

At the center of the Sun is its ''core'', a region of some 15  million kelvin (About 27 million degrees F).  The core is where the nuclear fusion reactions that power the Sun take place.  Primarily, this is the fusing of hydrogen into helium. 

Outside the core is a ''radiative zone'', where energy produced in the core travels toward the surface.  However, this energy can only travel outward by radiation for a certain distance, which limits its depth.  Temperatures here run from about 7 to 2 megakelvins. An ''interface region'' above this is thought to be the source of the ''solar dynamo'' which powers the Sun's magnetic field.

Outside the radiation zone and interface region is a ''convection zone''.  This zone sits between the heated radiation zone and the cooler outer layers of the Sun.   The result of this is a series of motions known as ''convection''. Hot material, being less dense, rises upwards toward the surface; material near the surface, once cooled, becomes denser and sinks downwards again.  Through this process, heat is gradually transported upward to the solar surface.  The base of the convection zone is at about 2 megakelvins, while material at the very top is at roughly 6000 kelvins.

Atop the convection zone lies the ''photosphere'', the visual &quot;surface&quot; of the Sun from our point of view.  Material here is at approximately 6000 K.  As a result of the convection going on below, polygonal shapes define the walls of the convection cells, called ''granules'' appear all across the surface. 

Above the photosphere is the ''chromosphere'', a very diffuse, hot layer. Material here rises in temperature from the 6000 K of the photosphere to about 20,000 K.  A ''transition region'' above the coronasphere has an even more dramatic rise in temperature, up to a megakelvin.

Finally, outside the chromosphere and transition region is the ''corona'', an extremely tenuous (very low-density) gas over a megakelvin. It is thought that the corona is primarily heated by the magnetic processes of the solar cycle.

== Solar Cycles ==
[[Image:The alpha effect.gif|thumb|right|360px|Twisting of the magnetic field lines is caused by the effects of the Sun's rotation.]]
The Sun goes through regular cycles related to the formation and destruction of its magnetic field every 11 years.  This process affects features on the surface of the Sun; it is by observing those features that our knowledge of solar cycles has developed over time. 

The Sun's magnetic field is created naturally by the movement of the solar plasma. Because this plasma is made up of charged particles, its movement creates electric fields. Where electric fields are generated, magnetic fields are generated perpendicular to them.

The Sun's rotation, however, is not rigid like the Earth's, because the gaseous material is so much more fluid than the Earth's crust.  Material at the equator moves more quickly than does material at the poles; this is called ''differential rotation''.  Furthermore, the magnetic field lines are embedded within the plasma, and tend to move with its motions. As a result, the magnetic field lines which initially run from pole to pole become more stretched in the middle, with the center of the line outrunning the pole-anchored ends. Eventually, these lines will wrap around the Sun many times.

As magnetic field lines cannot cross one another, they tend to protrude upwards when they come close to one another, forming &quot;loops&quot; that project out of the solar photosphere. It is along these loops that solar prominences are displayed. The more these lines are wrapped around the Sun, the more &quot;tangled&quot; and disrupted the magnetic field becomes. Eventually, the field is so disrupted that it breaks up completely.  After this, of course, a new magnetic field starts to form, and the cycle begins again. The complete process takes about 11 years.

The presence of magnetic fields has an effect on the Sun's photosphere. In discussing solar structure and composition, it was mentioned that the process of convection brings heat from the inner regions of the Sun up to the photosphere.  This convection tends to occur in fairly localized zones of rising hot and falling cool material known as ''convection cells''.  However, if a magnetic loop is present, it will disrupt one of these convection cells, trapping cool material at the Sun's surface.  While these regions (about 4500 K) are only cool compared to the photosphere (at about 6000 K), the overall effect is that they appear dark against the solar &quot;surface&quot;.  As a result, these are known as ''sunspots''.

The presence of sunspots reflects the cycle of the magnetic fields. In fact, it was the progression of sunspot number and position that gave the first evidence of cycle of magnetic field reversals.  At the beginning of the magnetic cycle, when the magnetic field is newly forming, only a few sunspots will appear; this is called a ''solar minimum''. Those sunspots that do appear will tend to be at high solar latitudes - that is, closer to the poles and further from the solar equator. As the cycle continues, sunspots will gradually appear in greater numbers and tend to be closer to the solar equator. The peak of this cycle is known as the ''solar maximum''.  After the sunspot numbers peak, they will continue to appear with less frequency, and be still closer to the solar equator. As this cycle trails off, the first few sunspots for the next cycle will start to appear at high solar latitudes, and so forth.

Because they are formed by magnetic field lines, sunspots occur in pairs; at the base of either end of the magnetic loop that formed them. Likewise, the sunspots will have opposite magnetic polarity from one another.  There are distinct patterns in the polarities of each pair which can be observed during a cycle. For convenience, we will call the spot that appears to be further along in the direction of the Sun's rotation the &quot;leading&quot; spot, and its partner the &quot;trailing&quot; spot.

Sunspot pairs in the northern solar hemisphere will have opposite polarities from those in the southern solar hemisphere. That is, if the leading spot is polarized one way (call it +) and the trailing spot the other (&amp;minus;) in the northern hemisphere, then in the southern hemisphere the leading spot will be (&amp;minus;) and the trailing spot (+).  Sunspot pairs in a given hemisphere will tend to all appear with the same polarities during a solar cycle. However, at the end of the cycle, the polarities will &quot;flip&quot;: new sunspots in that hemisphere will have polarities opposite from the previous cycle.

The table below shows the sunspot pattern over four 11-year cycles, for pairs of (leading and trailing) sunspots.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cycle&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;N. pair polarities&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;S. pair polarities&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+ -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;- +&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;- +&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+ -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+ -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;- +&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;- +&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+ -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

[[Image:Aurora_australis_20050911.jpg‎|center|404px|thumb|Wikimedia commons image Pixel at pl.wikipedia|center|Aurora on Earth.]]

Aurorae are visible effects of the Sun's activity on the Earth's atmosphere. It results from the interaction of the solar wind, a continuous flow of electrically charged particles--a stream of electrons and protons coming from the Sun -- with gases in the upper atmosphere of the earth at altitudes above 50 miles &lt;ref name= “Aurora”&gt; 2009,http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html&lt;/ref&gt;. When these charged particles reach the Earth's magnetic field, they become trapped in it. Bouncing back and forth many of these particles travel toward the Earth's magnetic poles. When the charged particles strike atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, the atmospheric atoms become excited or ionized causing them to emit photons. These photons cause the luminous auroras &lt;ref name=&quot;Ostlie &amp; Carrol&quot;&gt;Ostlie &amp; Carrol,pg. 373, 2007 “An Introduction to Modern Stellar 
Astrophysics
”, Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;. The aurora seen in the Northern Hemisphere is called Aurora Borealis or the northern lights whereas the aurora seen in the Southern Hemisphere is called the Aurora Australis &lt;ref name= “Aurora”&gt; 2009,http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html&lt;/ref&gt;.


The collisions of the solar wind with Earth’s upper atmosphere produce electrical discharges which energize atoms of oxygen and nitrogen which subsequently release various colors of light. Mostly aurorae are seen green and red as it is emitted from atomic oxygen.  Similarly molecular nitrogen and nitrogen ions produce low red and very high blue/violet aurorae. Whereas ionic nitrogen produces blue and green color aurora and neutral nitrogen produces the red and purple color with the rippled edges&lt;ref name=&quot;Bone&quot;&gt;Bone, N.,pg. 53, 2007 “Aurora”&lt;/ref&gt;. Most auroras occur at about 60 to 620 miles above the Earth. Some extend lengthwise across the sky for thousands of miles or kilometers &lt;ref name= “Aurora”&gt; 2009, http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html&lt;/ref&gt;.A diffuse red aurora occurs above 150 miles. An aurora having a pinkish edge will have an altitude of around 50 to 60 miles &lt;ref name= “The Aurora Australis - Southern Lights”&gt; 2009,http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/weather/aurora.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:AuroraAustralisDisplay.jpg‎|right|390px|thumb|Wikimedia commons image Pixel at pl.wikipedia|center|Aurora.]]


Auroral activity occurs mostly in a belt called auroral zones, around the geomagnetic poles, between 65 and 70 degrees of geomagnetic latitude. An auroral zone is a ring-shaped region of approximately radius 2500 km around either magnetic pole of the Earth. It was hardly ever seen near that pole itself. At any time of day, the distribution of aurora is slightly different. It's center is offset from the magnetic pole by 3-5 degree night-ward of the magnetic pole. As a result, the auroral arcs reach furthest equator-ward around midnight during a major geomagnetic storm. Auroral zones migrate as close to the equator as 45 to 50 degrees latitude &lt;ref name= “The Northern Lights and Six Meters”&gt; 2009,http://web.archive.org/20010430135357/www.geocities.com/k2cddx/propaurora.html&lt;/ref&gt;. At higher latitudes in spring and fall, a maximum of aurora activity is noticed as the Earth is at at that time is farthest north or south of the Sun’s equator due to which there is greater chance of Earth intercepting enhancements of the solar wind that emanate from the vicinity of sunspots&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;Davis, N.,pg. 64, 1992 “ the Aurora Watchers Handbook”&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Variation of heights of Aurorae with latitude:-==

h’χ – h’ο = H logn sec χ &lt;ref name= “Harang”&gt; Harang, L.,pg. 133, 1951 &quot; The Aurorae&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

where  χ = earth-magnetic inclination 

h’ο = height of luminosity maximum corresponding to χ = 0

H = (kT)/mg

K= Boltzmann’s constant

T= Absolute temperature

m = mass of gas

g = acceleration of gravity




Aurora occur mostly intensely during the peak phase of the [[w:Solar cycle|11-year Sunspot Cycle]]. Auroral activity also peaks near the maximum of the Sunspot Cycle and for the couple subsequent years. Most violent eruptions on the surface of Sun, called [[w:Solar flare|Solar Flares]], originate in magnetically active regions around visible Sunspot groupings &lt;ref name= “Sunspot”&gt; Wikipedia, 2009,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot&lt;/ref&gt;. Solar Flares release Electrons and Protons which increase the number of Solar particles that interact with the Earth's atmosphere, producing extremely bright Auroras. Sharp variations in the Earth’s magnetic field are called [[w:Geomagnetic storm|Magnetic Storms]] and are also the result of Sunspots. 

[[Image:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Wikimedia commons image Pixel at pl.wikipedia|center|Earth's magnetic field.]]


The Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field, called the [[w:Magnetosphere|Magnetosphere]] that forms a barrier to the [[w:Solar wind|solar wind]]. The solar wind pressure strongly compresses the magnetosphere on the sun-side and draws it out into an extremely long tail on the side opposite. Since the charged particles of the solar wind cannot cross the Earth's magnetic field lines, flow around it . This forms a standing shock wave in space upstream of the Earth, called the [[w:Bow shock|Bow Shock]]. Electrons of the solar wind diffuse into Magnetospheric tail and form a reservoir called the Plasma Sheet. The Magnetosphere and the solar wind form an enormous electrical dynamo where large and complicated electrical currents flow. One component of these currents is carried by the Electrons in the Plasma Sheet, which descends down from 300 km to 100 km following spiral paths along magnetic field lines. These particles then collide with the atmospheric gas causing it to glow, which we call [[w:Aurora_(astronomy)|Aurora]] &lt;ref name= “The ionosphere&quot;&gt; 2009,http://www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk/iono/ionosphere_intro&lt;/ref&gt;.

Based on models of the earth (well supported by the scientific evidence available), the theory of plate tectonics presupposes that the Earth's outermost surface (crust) is made up of two sub-layers, the rigid lithosphere and the semi-molten asthenosphere. Beneath the crust is the mantle, a layer made up of molten rock (magma).

Heat is generated in the Earth's core by uranium, potassium, and thorium.[http://hotrock.anu.edu.au/resource.htm]

== Earth's Surface ==

=== Plate Tectonics ===
[[Image:Tectonic_plates.png|thumb|350px|This map shows all of the Tectonic Plates that make up the Earth's crust]]
This map shows all of the Tectonic Plates that make up the Earth's crust
Plate tectonics is a theory of geology underlying the observed phenomenon of ''continental drift''. 

The rigid stone making up the lithosphere &quot;floats&quot; on the fluid-like asthenosphere, and, in areas where magma wells up from the mantle below the crust, may develop fractures. This results in the lithosphere being separated into contiguous masses of solid earth and rock known as tectonic plates. Due to slow currents in the asthenosphere's material, the plates floating atop this material undergo slow motions in different directions. These floating plates regularly jostle one another, with interactions along these boundaries being responsible for earthquakes and volcanos.

Tectonic plates are roughly divided into two types: continental and oceanic plates. The distinction is based on the thickness of the plates; oceanic plates are thinner than continental plates; as a result, the oceanic plates generally lie below sea level, while the continental plates project above sea level.

The same currents that move tectonic plates with respect to one another also tend to bring molten material closer to the surface at points where a circulation cell is drawing the material upward. In minor cases, this can result in a hot spot, where the material of the plate is eaten away from below, leaving openings for volcanos such as those producing the islands of Hawaii. As plates move over mantle fissures, chains of volcanos can form.
In major cases, the rising magma continuously pushes itself into the midst of the plate, eventually cooling to form new plate material. Thus, some tectonic plates are being widened by the addition of new material, via upwelling of magma from below. Currently the Atlantic oceanic plate is in the process of expanding, fuelled by a continuous input of magma along the North Atlantic Ridge. The region of Iceland, which straddles this ridge, is thus gaining territory at a rate of a few centimeters per century.

The boundaries between plates are known as fault lines. Individual faults are regions where two plate sections are moving with respect to one another. Pressure builds up along these regions as the plates are drawn in different directions by the underlying currents; when the pressure is released by the abrupt motion of the plates, an earthquake results. One of the most famous systems of fault lines is the boundary of the Pacific plate, known as the Ring of Fire due to the amount of seismic activity along this boundary. On the easternmost edge of the ring is the San Andreas Fault, on the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates. This fault line is responsible for the earthquake activity in the western United States, most notably the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.

In some areas one plate will begin to overrun another. The plate being thus overrun will have its edge pressed downward below the leading egdge of the other plate. This process, called subduction, results in the edge of this plate being exposed to the greater pressures and temperatures within the asthenosphere, and the rock making it up may begin to liquify. The resulting build-up of magma under pressure may find explosive release through the lithosphere above it, resulting in a volcanic eruption. In addition, the pressure exerted on both plates during a collision may cause the plates to buckle upward some distance from the plate boundaries. The resulting geographical features are known as upthrust mountain ranges. One example of this is the Himalayas in Asia.

==Earth's Atmosphere==

===The Greenhouse Effect===
CO2 (carbon dioxide) is increasing drastically due to burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This gas, among others, traps heat from the sun, making the Earth hotter. [http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">What qualifies as a ''planet'' has a somewhat variable definition, but in general, it should have the following properties:

#It does not generate energy through fusion
#It orbits around the Sun (or another star)
#It is large enough that its self-gravity makes it spherical

To distinguish planets from the masses known as ''brown dwarfs'', one might add a fourth condition: it formed by accretion rather than direct collapse from a nebula.

Planets have been classified in many ways.  Perhaps the best physical classification actually uses four categories, each named after a 'typical' planet of the type: Terrestrial, Jovian, Neptunian and Plutonian.

''Terrestrial'' planets have solid (rocky) surfaces, atmospheres that are thin in comparison to their diameters, and rocky interiors. They tend to have comparatively small masses. These include Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars; Earth's Moon can be seen as a similar type of body.

''Jovian'' planets have thick atmospheres of gaseous hydrogen, metallic hydrogen mantles, and rocky cores.  They have large masses.  These include Jupiter and Saturn.

''Neptunian'' planets have moderate hydrogen atmospheres, liquid (mostly water) mantles, and rocky cores.  Their masses are intermediate. These include  Uranus and Neptune.  The Neptunian and Jovian planets are sometimes referred to as the &quot;gas giant&quot; planets, but the difference in interiors merits a separate classification.

''Plutonian'' planets have icy surfaces, very thin atmospheres, and rocky interiors. Technically Pluto is the only such planet in our solar system, but similar bodies include most of the moons of the outer planets, notably Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan, and Triton, as well as Pluto's own moon Charon. Another, more recent addition, is Eris (formerly known as 2003 UB313).

==Strings==

Any sequence of characters put together as one unit, is
a string.  So, the word &lt;tt&gt;the&lt;/tt&gt; is a string.  This sentence is a
string.  Even this entire paragraph is a string.  In fact, you could
consider the text of this entire book as one string.

Strings can be of any length and can contain any characters, numbers,
punctuation, special characters (like ''!'' ''#'', and ''%''),
and even characters in natural languages besides English. In addition, a
string can contain special whitespace formatting characters like
newline, tab, and the ''bell'' character. We will discuss special
characters more later on. For now, we will begin our consideration of
strings by considering how to insert literal strings into a Perl
program.

To begin our discussion of strings in Perl, we will consider how to work
with ''string literals'' in Perl.  The word '''literal''' here refers
to the fact that these are used when you want to type a string directly
to Perl.  This can be contrasted with storing a string in a
'''variable'''.

Any string literal can be used as an expression.  We will find this
useful when we want to store string literals in variables.  However, for
now, we will simply consider the different types of string literals that
one can make in Perl.  Later, we will learn how to assign these string
literals to variables in the [[Perl Programming/Scalar Variables|Scalar Variables section]].

==Single Quoted Strings==

String literals can be represented in primarily three ways in Perl.  We have already used one type in the simple programming examples, using double quote marks.  Using double or single quote marks in Perl each has a special meaning.

Single quotes can be thought of as literal strings.  In the previous examples, you may have noticed that variable names were included inside the strings with double quotes.  When the results were printed, the value of the variable was placed in the printed line, not the name of the variable.  If single quote marks were used, the actual variable name would have been printed because nearly all special characters that might be interpreted differently are taken at ''face value'' when using single quotes.  

To see what is meant by this, try this simple program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 my $name = &quot;Fred&quot;;
 print &quot;Hello, $name\n&quot;;
 print 'Hello, $name\n';
&lt;/source&gt;

You should see &quot;Hello Fred&quot; on the first line and &quot;Hello $name\n&quot; on the second (without a newline after it). Putting the ''value'' of &lt;code&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt; into the string in the first print statement is called &quot;interpolation.&quot; If you don't need interpolation, you should use single quotes, because it makes your intent clearer.

===Special Characters in Single-quoted Strings===

There are two characters in single quoted strings that do not always represent themselves. This is due to necessity, since single-quoted strings start and end with the &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; character. We need a way to express inside a single-quoted string that we want the string to contain a &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; character.

The solution to this problem is to preceded any &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; characters we actually want to appear in the string itself with the backslash (&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; character).  Thus we have strings like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  'xxx\'xxx';  # xxx, a single-quote character, and then xxx
&lt;/source&gt;

We have in this example a string with 7 characters exactly. Namely, this is the string: &lt;tt&gt;xxx'xxx&lt;/tt&gt;. It can be difficult at first to become accustomed to the idea that two characters in the input to Perl actually produce only one character in the string itself. (C programmers are already probably used to this idea.) However, just keep in mind the rules and you will probably get used to them quickly.

Since we have used the &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; character to do something special with the &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; character, we must now worry about the special cases for the backslash character itself.  When we see a &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; character in a single-quoted string, we must carefully consider what will happen.

Under most circumstances, when a &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; is in a single-quoted string, it is simply a backslash, representing itself, as most other characters do.  However, the following exceptions apply:

* The sequence &lt;tt&gt;\'&lt;/tt&gt; yields the character &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; in the actual  string. (This is the exception we already discussed above).
* The sequence &lt;tt&gt;\\&lt;/tt&gt; yields the character &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; in the actual string.  In other words, two backslashes right next to each other  actually yield only one backslash.
* A backslash, by itself, cannot be placed at the end of a the single-quoted string. This cannot happen because Perl will think that you are using the &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; to escape the closing &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;.

The following examples exemplify the various exceptions, and use them
properly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  'I don\'t think so.';          # Note the ' inside is escaped with \
  'Need a \\ (backslash) or \?'; # The \\ gives us \, as does \
  'You can do this: \\';         # A single backslash at the end 
  'Three \\\'s: &quot;\\\\\&quot;';        # There are three \ chars between &quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the last example, note that the resulting string is &lt;tt&gt;Three \'s: &quot;\\\&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. If you can follow that example, you have definitely mastered how single-quoted strings work!

Instead of unreadable backslash escapes, Perl offers [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators other ways] of quoting strings. The first example above could be written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  q{I don't think so};            # No \ needed to escape the '
&lt;/source&gt;

===Newlines in Single-quoted Strings===

Note that there is no rule against having a single-quoted string span several lines.  When you do this, the string has ''newline''
characters embedded in it.

A newline character is a special ASCII character that indicates that a new line should be started.  In a text editor, or when printing output to the screen, this usually indicates that the cursor should move from the end of the current line to the first position on the line following it.

Since Perl permits the placement of these newline characters directly into single quoted strings, we are permitted to do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  'Time to
  start anew.';   # Represents the single string composed of:
                  # 'Time to' followed by a newline, followed by
                  # 'start anew.'
&lt;/source&gt;

This string has a total of twenty characters.  The first seven are &lt;tt&gt;Time to&lt;/tt&gt;.  The next character following that is a newline.  Then, the eleven characters, &lt;tt&gt;start anew.&lt;/tt&gt; follow.  Note again that this is '''one string''', with a newline as its eighth character.

Further, note that we are not permitted to put a comment in the middle of the string, even though we are usually allowed to place a &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; anywhere on the line and have the rest of the line be a comment. We cannot do this here, since we have yet to terminate our single-quoted string with a &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;, and thus, any &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; character and comment following it would actually become part of the single-quoted string! Remember that single-quotes strings are delimited by &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning, and &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; at the end, and everything in between is considered part of the string, included newlines, &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; characters and anything else.

===Examples of Invalid Single-quoted Strings===

In finishing our discussion of singled-quoted strings, consider these examples of strings that are '''not''' legal because they violate the exceptions we talked about above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  'You cannot do this: \'; # INVALID: the ending \ cannot be alone
  'It is 5 o'clock!'       # INVALID: the ' in o'clock should be escaped
  'Three \\\'s: \\\\\';      # INVALID: the final \ escapes the ', thus
                           #          the literal is  not terminated
  'This is my string;      # INVALID: missing close quote
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometimes, when you have invalid string literals such as in the example above, the error message that Perl gives is not particularly intuitive. However, when you see error messages such as:

  (Might be a runaway multi-line '' string starting on line X)
  Bareword found where operator expected
  Bareword &quot;foo&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use

It is often an indication that you have runaway or invalid strings. Keep an eye out for these problems.  Chances are, you will forget and violate one of the rules for single-quoted strings eventually, and then need to determine why you are unable to run your Perl program.

==Brief Digression from Strings Alone: The &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; Function==

Before we move on to our consideration of double-quoted strings, it is
necessary to first consider a small digression.  We know how to
represent strings in Perl, but, as you may have noticed, the examples we
have given thus far do not do anything interesting.  If you try placing
the statements that we listed as examples in
[[#Single Quoted Strings|Single Quoted Strings]], into a full Perl program,
like this:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  'Three \\\'s: &quot;\\\\\&quot;'; # There are three \ chars between &quot;&quot;
  'xxx\'xxx';             # xxx, a single-quote character, and then xxx
  'Time to
  start anew.';

you probably noticed that nothing of interest happens. Perl
gladly runs this program, but it produces no output.

Thus, to begin to work with strings in Perl beyond simple hypothetical
considerations, we need a way to have Perl display our strings for us.
The canonical way of accomplishing this in Perl is to use the
&lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; function.

The &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; function in Perl can be used in a variety of ways.
The simplest form is to use the statement &lt;tt&gt;print STRING;&lt;/tt&gt;, where
&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt; is any valid Perl string.

So, to reconsider our examples, instead of simply listing the strings,
we could instead print each one out:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  print 'Three \\\'s: &quot;\\\\\&quot;'; # Print first string
  print 'xxx\'xxx';             # Print the second  
  print 'Time to
  start anew.
  ';    # Print last string, with a newline at the end

This program will produce output.  When run, the output goes to what is
called the ''standard output''.  This is usually the terminal, console
or window in which you run the Perl program.  In the case of the program
above, the output to the standard output is as follows:

  Three \'s: &quot;\\\&quot;xxx'xxxTime to
  start anew.

Note that a newline is required to break up the lines. Thus, you need
to put a newline at the end of every valid string if you want your
string to be the last thing on that line in the output.

Note that it is particularly important to put a newline on the end of
the last string of your output. If you do not, often times, the command
prompt for the command interpreter that you are using may run together
with your last line of output, and this can be very disorienting. So,
'''always''' remember to place a newline at the end of each line,
particularly on your last line of output.

Finally, you may have noticed that formatting your code with newlines in
the middle of single-quoted strings hurts readability. Since you are
inside a single-quoted string, you cannot change the format of the
continued lines within the print statement, nor put comments at the ends
of those lines because that would insert data into your single-quoted
strings. To handle newlines more elegantly, you should use
double-quoted strings, which are the topic of the next section.

==Double Quoted Strings==

Double-quoted strings are another way of representing scalar string
literals in Perl.  Like single-quoted strings, you place a group of
ASCII characters between two delimiters (in this case, our
delimiter is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;).  However, something called ''interpolation''
happens when you use a double-quoted string.

===Interpolation in Double-quoted Strings===

Interpolation is a special process whereby certain special strings
written in ASCII are replaced by something different. In
[[#Single Quoted Strings|Single-quoted strings section]], we noted that certain sequences in
single-quoted strings (namely, &lt;tt&gt;\\&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\'&lt;/tt&gt;) were treated
differently - these are called ''backslash escape sequences''. This is very similar to what happens with interpolation.

For example, in interpolated double-quoted strings, various sequences
preceded by a &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt; character act differently according to the chart below:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; 
|-style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;  align=&quot;center&quot;
| String || Interpolated As
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\\&lt;/tt&gt; || an actual, single backslash character
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\$&lt;/tt&gt; || a single $ character
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\@&lt;/tt&gt; || a single @ character
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; ||  a single double-quote character
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; || tab
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; || newline
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\r&lt;/tt&gt; || hard return
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\f&lt;/tt&gt; || form feed
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\b&lt;/tt&gt; || backspace
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt; || alarm (bell)
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\e&lt;/tt&gt; || escape 
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\056&lt;/tt&gt;  ||  character represented by octal value, 056 (same as&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;)
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\x2E&lt;/tt&gt; || character represented by hexadecimal value, 2E (same as &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;)
|}

As you may have noticed in the previous chapter, you can put the name of a variable within a string with its leading dollar sign.  This form of interpolation replaces the name of the variable in the string with the content of the variable.

===Examples of Interpolation===

Let us consider an example that uses a few of these characters:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  print &quot;A backslash: \\\n&quot;;
  print &quot;Tab follows:\tover here\n&quot;;
  print &quot;Ring! \a\n&quot;;
  print &quot;Please pay someone\@example.org \$20.\n&quot;;

This program, when run, produces the following output on the screen: 

  A backslash: \
  Tab follows:	over here
  Ring!
  Please pay someone@example.org $20.


In addition, when running, you should hear the computer beep.  That is
the output of the &lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt; character, which you cannot see on the
screen.  However, you should be able to hear it.

Notice that the &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; character ends a line.  &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; should
always be used to end a line.  Those students familiar with the C
language will be used to using this sequence to mean ''newline''.
When writing Perl, the word ''newline'' and the &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; character
are roughly synonymous.

===String Operators===

''Operators'' manipulate two or more strings in some way.

====The Concatenation Operator====

Perl uses the &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; operator to concatenate or connect two strings together, like this:

 &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot;World&quot;  # This is the same as &quot;HelloWorld&quot;

If you want to make the string have a space between Hello and World you could write it like this:

 &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot;, &quot; . &quot;World&quot;  # This is the same as &quot;Hello, World&quot;

Or like this:

 &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot;, World&quot; # This is the same as &quot;Hello, World&quot;

====The &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; Operator====

This is called the ''string repetition'' operator and is used to repeat a string.  All you have to do is put a string on the left side of the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and a number on the right side.  Like this:

 &quot;Hello&quot; x 5 # This is the same as &quot;HelloHelloHelloHelloHello&quot;

If you wish to insert a  line break after each output of the string, use:

 &quot;Hello\n&quot; x 5

===Exercises===

*Write a program that uses the &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; operator to print &quot;Hello, Sir!&quot;.

*Write another program which uses the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; operator to print &quot;HelloHelloHelloHello&quot;.  Put comments in this program that explain how it works

*Remember to take some time to play with single and double quoted strings, the more practice you get, the better you will be.

'''Operation: Blank Check''' is the title of the current stage of development for [[World History]].  The scope of this portion is divided into two major categories, as follows:

*Finalization of structure
*Basic articles in place (See: [[World History/The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism|The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism]])

==Finalization of structure==

This goal encompasses the final chapter listing ([[World History]]) and the structure of the articles themselves.  Currently, there are '''32''' chapters.  The scope of World History indicates that there will be more, probably at least 5, especially since one of the goals is to include little-known parts of history, like the Kush Empire (near India, no relation to the one south of Egypt) and the Parthian Empire.  Also, more mainly, there are a few gaps in the history chain; the one between the Industrial Revolution and World War I is the most prominent.  At this time however, we hope to concentrate on the 30 we have down.  On the main page, each will have a brief summary, such as already exists for several.  Eventually the broad date of the topic will be added to the summary.  In naming, chapter titles should have any important words capitalized.  Note the differences to this convention in Internal Article Structure (IAS).

===Internal Article Structure (IAS)===
IAS is in full swing at this point.  It has been applied to several articles and is still evolving, and therefore varies slightly from article to article.  For instance, see the [[World History/Ancient Civilizations|Ancient Civilizations]] structure versus that in [[World History/The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism|The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism]].  There are subtle differences.  Because the latter article is almost complete, dates have been added to the subtitles and structural denotations in this article already.  We hope to have a brief timeline someday to help expedite the dating process.  IAS stipulates the following:

Each article is broken down into broad categories (see [[World History/Precolumbian History of the Americas|Precolumbian History of the Americas]] for an example) which are further divided into individual cultures/civilizations/events.  Structure is to follow this basic method:  1)If the topic is better done by region, such as in the Americas example, then the subcategories must correlate to individual parts of that region, 2) If the topic is better done &quot;by topic&quot;, such as in the Dictatorship example, then is is helpful to break the broad categories into time periods within it, such as the rise of Hitler.  Also, when a single person has an inordinate influence on an event and enough information is available, text should be devoted to the development of this individual's thought, such as early life, political philosophy, etc. (again, see the Dictatorship example), 3) Under no circumstances should there be any divisions smaller than second level (as in &lt;nowiki&gt;===Title===&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  Namewise, make sure that only the first word and the proper words are capitalized if possible.  It's odd, but in main chapter titles, all words other than &quot;the&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and the like being capitalized is pleasing, but not in article categories and subcategories.  Please try to stick to this especially.

So, the guidelines are broad, and much leeway is given.  Please feel free to do a little experimenting, but try not to move things around too much that already have substantial topical information in them.  Follow the [[World History/Golden Rule|Golden Rule]] and '''''&lt;u&gt;Have fun!&lt;/u&gt;'''''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This structure is based entirely on the requirements for the CA book. Lord, if it doesnt look to be a boring book. Somehow I graduated from high school and college without knowing most of this stuff. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]I think that a textbook on world history should actually encompass more than the development of western government. Talk more about India, China and Africa for heaven's sake. I realize this outline is designed to meet California requirements but a comprehensive textbook on World History should be more representative.

Just have come across this. It's as biased as World History could be. IS there a world outside Europe and the USA? Makes me wonder...

I just haven't gotten around to writing about most of the world yet. As you can tell, I've started work on the Ancient World, WWI &amp; WWII, Exploration, Ancient Mesoamerica, and Early China &amp; Japan. That's alot of information already (because of some additional chapters, this may turn out to cover much more than the CA standard, and at least twice as long). Right now, the entire thing is map deficient (most of that stuff is copyrighted and ineligible for inclusion), date deficient (sorry, but right now I'm more concerned about adding info than dates), and grammar deficient (again, info over proofs). It's going to take time, so thanks for patience and help! --[[User:Tai |Tai]]

One most consider the way in which one World History is taught. For example AP World History, to not seem Euro-centric fixates on the concept of interactions between nations after European Ex &amp; Dis. this is in contrast to what World History once was where you would get a fairly indepth look at Mesopotamia then India, China, perhaps Mesoamerica and then to greece and rome and continue on with Europe for the rest of the year. My Pre-AP World History class was done like that but we stopped at the Renaissance in preperation for AP European History, which starts a few hundred years before the Renaissance. When I was offered the chance to take AP World History, I quickly discovered that although the education I received in World History was excellent, I was lacking in anything after the Renaissance for anywhere other then Europe. A good example of this method of history can be found in Spielvogel's World History: A Human Odessey. Speilvogel heavily emphasis Europe and &quot;western&quot; civilizations after a certain point, with one or two chapters here and there covering broad topics in non-western civilizations. Eurocentricism is a large component of history education and one needs to find a way to not babble on incoherently about the &quot;East&quot; in an attempt to make it seem like there is more there then there actually is, while not taking the imperialist concept of &quot;The White Man's Burden&quot; to bring civilization to those eastern savages. The College Boards method is affective, but it does take some of the fun out of history because you center on interactions and trade rather then events and figures. 
--[[User:Alexbl|Alexbl]] 02:37, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Personally, interactions and trade is the way to go for me. Sure, we will need to know about Hannibal, Gengis Khan, Napoleon, or Bismark, but in most cases the impetus for the events they inspired are already there. For example, Germany was well on its way to unification before Bismark, with the Confederation of the Rhine and that economic thing of theirs. Bismark just cleverly got France and Austria out of the way so he could set up the German Empire, but I bet at the rate Prussia was going it could have annexed all the little German states eventually. Of course, studying their lives is far more interesting than looking at the &quot;big picture&quot;, and it's very easy (and correct) to think of one &quot;great leader&quot; altering history. But conditions have to be right, too. I bet there were plenty of people wanting to set up a German Empire long before Bismark came around, and faileed because of the petty infighting between the Germanic royals (before all the fighting got to them). Just my 2 cents. --[[User:Tai |Tai]] (P.S., nice job on the European History book, it looks much more complete than this one).

----
This page is a little odd--it focuses in only on California standards, and the organization is also wierd.  Simple little things like titles and headings are missing and/or not in the most gramatically correct english.  Also, you can't just read from a book and summaraize and/or copy exactly down what you see, that's not only plagiarism, but 10th grade history books are meant to be understood by people with a huge range of IQs, and still developing minds.  This page needs serious restructuring.  Though, I do admire trying to adhere to a written set of standards.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:52, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Flag of Brazil.svg|200px|thumb|right|The flag of Brazil.]]

[[Image:Brazil map 2014.png|200px|left|Map of Brazil.]]
''Bem-vindo ao Brasil''&amp;mdash;Welcome to Brazil! Brazil is by far the largest country in South America, and the fifth largest country in the world. Brazil is located right in the middle of South America, and borders most of the other countries, but it is also very different from them. For instance, while most people in South America speak Spanish, in Brazil people speak Portuguese. Brazil is home to 190 million people, who live in twenty-six states and one Federal District (the capital, Brasília). Because Brazil is so large, it is often broken up into five geographical regions; the North, the Northeast, the Southeast, the South, and the Center-West regions.

==What are Brazil's national symbols?==

Brazil's flag is green with a yellow rhombus and a blue circle set with stars.The stripe across it says ''ordem e progresso'' witch means order and progress. Brazil's national colors, green and yellow, represent the colors of the royal Portuguese family. Brazil once had the largest gold mines in the world. The blue circle shows the sky over Rio de Janeiro.

==What are some famous places in Brazil?==

Brazil is home to the Amazon River and the Amazon Rainforest. It also has two of the 30 largest cities in the world, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

===The steamy rainforest of the Northern Region===
[[Image:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Amazon basin forest north of Manaus, Brazil]]
The northern region of Brazil contains the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest. A rainforest is a place with lots of rain, animals, and trees. The rainforest is so big that it stretches into Brazil's neighbors&amp;mdash;Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. In fact, the Amazon is so big that if you got all the rainforests in the rest of the world and put them all together it would not be as big as the Amazon. The Amazon Rainforest is named after the Amazon river which is the second longest river in the world. 

Because the Amazon is a rainforest, life is very hot and wet. Many thousands of different types of animals and plants are found in the Amazon, as well as 2.5 million different insect species! Because the Amazon is so big, there are still some animals and plants that haven't even been discovered yet.

Unfortunately, the Amazon Rainforest is very quickly shrinking to make way for farmland and cattle. Burning the rainforest is illegal, but difficult for the police to stop because the vastness of the Amazonian region and for the money into the black market that sells wood worldwide... The burning of the forest means that many animals and plants are becoming extinct. Although lots of people are very worried about this it is unlikely that the destruction of the forest will end in the near future.

===The beautiful beaches and festivals of the Northeast===
One beautiful beach in the Northeastern area. This is Boa Viagem Beach. The northeastern region was the first part of Brazil to be inhabited by Europeans, and is sometimes called ''the heart of Brazil''. Some of the oldest cities in the country are there, especially on the coast. The area's beautiful shores attract people from every part of the world. Salvador and Fortaleza are typical cities of the northeastern region. In Salvador the people have invented many dances and musical rhymes for the many festivals which are held year round. 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#ffeedd; width: 350px; font-size:90%; padding:4px; margin: 4px 4px 4px 0;&quot;&gt;
'''Carnival'''
[[Image:CarnavalBrazilRio2005.jpg|152px|right|Celebrations of Carnival ]]
A Carnival is a public parade, combining some elements of a circus and public street party. Carnival is a Catholic tradition, and is celebrated throughout most of South America, but is biggest and most famous in Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro. The celebrations start forty days before Easter, and run for four days. Every region celebrates Carnival in a different way. In Salvador many thousands of people cram the streets to listen to and dance to the ''trios elétricos''. Trios elétricos are giant trucks with a band playing on. In Rio de Janeiro there are ''Escolas de Samba'', which means &quot;Samba schools&quot; &amp;ndash; but in these schools the people don't learn to samba, they work all year preparing a big show like an opera: the Samba Schools Parade. In Recife and Olinda, people go to streets to follow the frevo and maracatu bands like the ''Galo da Madrugada'' (Rooster of the Dawn), the largest Carnival group in the world.&lt;/div&gt;

===The grand cities of the Southeastern Region===
[[Image:P6250057.JPG|thumb|300px|Statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro. In Portuguese it is called Cristo Redentor(Redemption Christ).]]

Southeast Brazil is the part of the country that has the most people and the most business. It contains the two famous Brazilian cities: Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. São Paulo is Brazil's biggest city and has over 20 million people living in it. People living in São Paulo are called ''Paulistanos''. Rio de Janeiro is also a very big city but not as big as São Paulo, with only 10 million inhabitants. The people who live in Rio (called ''Cariocas'') are very proud of their city because it is so beautiful. Rio de Janeiro has some famous beaches, which have been mentioned in many songs and films. The city got its name (which means &quot;January River&quot; in Portuguese) because the city has a great bay; early Portuguese explorers discovered this bay in '''January''' and thought it was the mouth of a '''river''', hence the name &quot;January River.&quot;

===The European-like Southern Region===
[[Image:Gauchos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|People wearing typical gaúcho cowboy clothes.]]
The Southern Region is very different from the rest of Brazil. The temperature is much cooler, and many of the people who live there descended from people who came to Brazil from Italy, Germany, and other countries in Europe. In some cities people still speak the languages of those countries along with Portuguese. The ''gaúcho'' is a kind of cowboy from southern Brazil: he rides his horse through the ''Pampas'', large fields of cattle breeding. Nowadays, however, a gaúcho (or gaúcha, if female) is anyone born in Rio Grande do Sul, regardless of living in the city or in the country.

===The vast fields of the Center-West Region===
The Center-West Region is the least populated region in Brazil. The large fields of ''Cerrado'' are the place for big plantations of soy and cattle breeding. In central-west Brazil we find Brazil's capital, Brasília, a city constructed in the middle of the last century with street patterns shaped like an airplane! Brasília is also located near the exact center of Brazil's territory. In the central-west area there is also the ''Pantanal'', probably the largest wetlands in the world (it is about half the size of France), where a great range of different kinds of birds, fish, mammals, reptiles and others beings live.

==What important events have happened in Brazil?==

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:25%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#ffeedd; font-size:90%; padding:4px&quot;&gt;
'''Where does Brazil's name come from?'''
When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they called this land ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (Island of True Cross), because they thought Brazil was an island. When they discovered that Brazil wasn't an island, the Portuguese called it ''Terra de Santa Cruz'' (Land of Holy Cross). Finally, they found a tree there that could be used to paint clothes with red color. They called this tree ''pau-brasil'', ''pau'' means wooden stick and ''brasil'' comes from ''brasa'' which means ember. So, Brazil received its name from the tree ''pau-brasil''.&lt;/div&gt;
Portuguese explorer ''Pedro Álvares Cabral'' arrived in Brazil in 1500, and called the land for Portugal. Today, the Brazilians are descendants from people of many regions of the world, mainly Portuguese, Africans, and from people the people who lived there when the Portuguese arrived, the Indians (''índios''). There were many Indians in Brazil in ancient times, but diseases and wars against foreigners reduced Indian populations. Millions of Africans came to Brazil as slaves to work mainly in sugar cane farms.

In 1808, King João VI of Portugal, fleeing Napoleon's French army, moved the seat of government to Brazil, and made Rio de Janeiro the temporary capital of Portugal.  Even after the government officially moved back to Portugal, Rio de Janeiro was thought to be a co-capital of the empire for many years, and had a significant influence on the people of Portugal.

In 1822, Brazil declared its independence from Portugal, becoming the Empire of Brazil. And the Portuguese Prince-Regent (next in line to become king of Portugal) ''Pedro I'' became Brazil's Emperor. Later on, his son, ''Pedro II'', was chosen the second Emperor. During these times Brazil had to fight wars against its neighbors, Argentina and Paraguay, to avoid any invasion.

In 1888, ''Princess Isabel'' ended the practice of slavery. Finally, in 1889, Brazil turned into a Republic, which meant Brazil now had a President who is elected by the people, instead of an Emperor.

From a small land bordering the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil grew to be an immense country, especially when some people found gold in Minas Gerais and Goias, far away from the coast, and when Brazil started to take latex from the Amazônia.

The capital of Brazil was earlier Rio de Janeiro, and stayed there for many years.  After many attempts, a new capital was created and built near the center of Brazil called Brasília in 1956.  This was done for many reasons, although a major purpose was to draw the population of Brazil away from the coastal cities and instead toward the interior of the country.

During the twentieth century, Brazil went twice under Dictatorships, which is a type of government that gets a lot of power and turns against the people. When under dictatorships, Brazilians that opposed the government experienced hard times of censorship and cruelty. Today Brazil is a free country, where people are able to vote for President and express themselves with no fear. In late 2010, Brazil elected its first female president, Dilma Rousseff, who took office in January of 2011.
[[Image:Ramphastos_toco.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Toco Tucan lives in the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil.]]
==What is the natural environment like in Brazil?==
Brazil may have more different types of animals than any other country in the world. This is because Brazil is such a large country with many different forests that are dense with living things. All of Brazil is warm and some of Brazil is very rainy. There are two huge forests in Brazil. The Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic forest. Both of these forests are shrinking because people cut the trees down for lumber and also to clear the land for farming and ranching. {{clr}}

==What types of things are made in Brazil?==
Brazil produces many types of things. There are iron mines that produce iron to make into steel. Brazilians also grow coffee, soybeans, and fruit. They manufacture airplanes and cars and electrical equipment. There is also a lot of tourism and eco-tourism in Brazil.
(They are known for one of the countries making the most coffee in the world)
Lately, Petrobras, Brazil's largest oil company is offshore drilling along the continental shelf, it is moving Brazil from being nearly 100 percent dependent on foreign oil imports toward becoming a net oil exporter in the next few years.

==What is School like in Brazil?==

School varies in Brazil, there are many excellent schools however they are private schools and cost a lot of money to go to. The ones that are public can be much worse.  Because many people in Brazil aren't very rich, many children will not get to go to a good school.

==What sports are popular in Brazil?==

[[Image:Lula117951.jpeg|thumb|280|right|Lula was the President of Brazil.]]

Soccer/Football is the most popular sport in Brazil - the country has won the football World Cup more times than any other country. Swimming and Volleyball are some other competitive sports that are played.

==Who are some famous people from Brazil?==
Some people from Brazil have become famous all over the world.

One of the best-known is Pelé, a soccer player that many people believe was the best ever.
Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion. He won in 1988, 1990, 1991.

==Redirects==
Ah, now you understand some of the bad things about interwiki redirects. You need to manually construct a url with ''&amp;redirect=no'' at the end in the browser address bar, in this case http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:The_bellman&amp;redirect=no . You'll also need to do it for your talk page at http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_bellman&amp;redirect=no . Gentgeen 09:37, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==adminship==
I would have promoted you to admin here, except that you withdrew your request (I almost decided to do it anyway, but didn't).  Let me know if you are interested again, as we could use some more admins here.  Even if all you do is some occasional vandal-blocking, it'd be good to have another admin around. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 16:37, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:I don't think there'll be any controversy about it since you had some support, so I went ahead and made you an admin. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 17:23, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== specific companies ==

If you want to eliminate specific companies from the [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine]] page, you have lots more to go. The page is virtually a corporate ad page.

I myself am guilty of adding 1 or 2 links to corporate web sites and/or 1 or 2 product names. I've only done this for those that I thought were particularly deserving. I tend to thing that anon users and non-regular contributers should not be allowed to do this, because they might be getting paid to spam the wiki. If a regular cookbook contributer wants to do this though, I think we should trust that the recommendation is in good faith and is useful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:13, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

-- I added most of those companies (some while not logged in) for the express purpose of people being able to find vegan products. These could perhaps be split off to another page, but I think it's unreasonable to eliminate them. Vegan substitute products are difficult to find and it's even more difficult to find good ones. I am curious about your thoughts on this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]
:: Please respond on the [[Talk:Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine]] page instead of here. Thanks! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:42, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

==Recentchanges==
Sure... It's not protected though, so one need not be an admin to [[MediaWiki:Recentchangestext|edit recent changes]]. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:13, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Celestia]] | Celestia:Add-Ons
== Introduction ==

This article describes the most common procedures for installing add-ons for the 3D astronomical visualization program  &quot;Celestia&quot;.  It can be downloaded for free from [http://celestia.sf.net Celestia].  Most add-ons designed for this program can be downloaded from the [http://celestiamotherlode.net Celestia Motherlode] and [http://celestiaaddons.wix.com/celestiaaddons more].  This document does NOT describe how to create new add-ons.  If you want to make your own add-ons or modify others, you should start by reading Selden Ball's [http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~seb/celestia/addon-intro.html Not-so Brief Introduction to Add-ons] For further information, also see the [http://celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/documentation.html Documentation Page] of the Motherlode.

If you are new to Celestia, please read this document from start to finish, since information that is relevant to later sections is covered in earlier ones. If you try to read just the section that you want help with right now, you might miss important information that would help with future problems.

== How Celestia determines what to display == 
The Celestia application itself is a very small part of the package that you initially download. Most of the size of the package is due to the pictures and catalogs of the celestial objects that Celestia draws. When Celestia launches, it reads the data from a folder on your computer called &quot;Celestia&quot; (Windows systems) or &quot;Celestia Resources&quot; (Macs).  It then uses that data to determine what to display.  By editing a few files in this folder, you can change what Celestia displays on the screen.  

The Celestia Resources folder is in different places depending on your operating system.

In Windows, it is located in C:\Program Files\ and is called &quot;Celestia&quot; (Double-click on My Computer to find it).

In Mac OS X,  the folder is called &quot;CelestiaResources&quot; and it will be where the person who installed the original Celestia program put it.  This is usually in /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Application Support/ or within the Celestia application bundle.  To find it inside the bundle, hold down the {Ctrl} key, click on the Celestia icon and select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; from the menu that appears. 

In Linux KDE, the folder can be installed anywhere, although /opt/kde3/share/apps/celestia is the default and most likely place. In Ubuntu the directory is /usr/share/celestia.

== Types of add-ons ==
Add-ons fall roughly into two broad classes: replacement textures and extras. Since their methods of installation are different, we will deal with them differently.   

=== Replacement Textures === 
If the files you download are nothing more than images, you are dealing with a replacement texture.  Celestia supports the following image formats: JPEG or JPG, PNG,  DDS and BMP. (BMP images should be avoided. Celestia does not implement most of the BMP standard.)

An add-on containing replacement textures is designed to replace a texture that was included with the default distribution of Celestia that you downloaded.   There are two ways to install new textures: by replacing the original image file, or by editing the catalog file that points to the texture, so that it points to your new image file instead. 

==== Replacing the image file ====

Replacing the image file is simple. The tricky part is detailed in the note below about image resolutions.  

Open the textures folder in the Celestia resources folder, find the image file that you want to replace, and remember or write down its exact name. Then rename the original file to something else, like &lt;old-name&gt;-old.jpg. Place the new image file in the same folder as the old one, and re-name it so it matches the original name of the old image (paste the name from the clipboard.) When you relaunch Celestia, you should see the new texture in place of the old one. 

====Resolutions====

Celestia allows you to provide images with the same name but with three different resolutions: low, medium and high. They are kept in the &lt;b&gt;lores&lt;b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;medres&lt;b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;hires&lt;b&gt; folders. You can type the letters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;R&quot; to switch among them. These resolution names are just for your convenience, though. There's otherwise nothing special about the images.

Texture images must be a power-of-two on a side: 512x256, 4096x2048, etc. This restriction is in the design of most 3D graphics cards.

==== Editing the catalog file to refer to your new Texture ====
Instead of renaming files as above, you can change the catalog file that directs Celestia to the image file you want to replace.  For all default textures, these catalog files are in the folder &quot;data&quot; inside the main Celestia resources folder. They are called &quot;ssc&quot; catalog files, and they end in the 3-letter extension (ssc).  

Based on the names of the files, find the one that describes the texture you want to replace. For safekeeping, copy the original catalog file to another name with a different filetype. Then open it with a text editor and scroll down until you see the entry for the object you are trying to improve. The syntax of the catalog file should be understandable.  Replace the name of the old texture with the name of your new texture, but don't modify anything else.  Save and close the catalog file. 

Place your new texture in the medres folder inside the textures folder inside the Celestia Resources folder.  

When you launch Celestia, you should see the new texture on the object whose catalog entry you edited.

=== Extras ===
Extras are add-ons which usually cause Celestia to display an object that is not present at all in the default distribution.  They usually include several files including catalogs, models, textures, and, hopefully, a README that tells you what to do get the object to display properly.  If there is a README included, follow its instructions to install the add-on.  If there is no README, you will need to sort the add-on's files by their filetypes (the part of the name that is after the dot). 

Place the files in the following directories (folders) according their filetypes: 

*.cmod or .3ds or .cms --  Place these models in the &lt;b&gt;models&lt;b&gt; directory.

*.jpg or .png or .dsc or .bmp -- Place these pictures in the &lt;b&gt;textures/medres&lt;b&gt; directory.

*.ssc or .stc or .dsc -- Place these catalogs in the add-on's main directory.

*.xyz -- Place these trajectories in the &lt;b&gt;data&lt;b&gt; directory.

== Testing the Add-on ==
After you have installed the add-on, you'll need to quit and relaunch Celestia. This is because Celestia only reads the data files when it is launched.  Any changes you make will not be apparent until you start Celestia again.  

If you are installing a new object in Celestia, visit the object by pressing the [Return] or [Enter] key to bring up the target entry prompt.  As you begin to type the name of the object you want to visit, Celestia will try to guess what object you want. You can press the TAB key to cycle through Celestia's guesses.  When the window displays the name you want, press [Return] (or [Enter]) again. If the object's name does not appear in the target entry window, you probably have not installed it correctly.

The object has now been selected. Press the 'g' key to go to it. Celestia's viewpoint should move toward the object and it should come into view.  If the viewpoint changes but an object does not become visible, make sure that rendering for that object is enabled in the Rendering menu. If the proper rendering is enabled, but you still see nothing, it is possible that the object is not defined at the time that Celestia is simulating. This could occur with comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, for example, which crashed into Jupiter during July 1994.  Celestia will still take you to a location for objects which no longer exist, but nothing will be displayed.  To view the object, set the time to  something more appropriate. For Shoemaker-Levy, this would be any date before July 18, 1994.

If you are installing a different texture for an object that already exists in Celestia, it might be defined in an SSC catalog as an AltTexture. To view such an alternate texture, right-click on the object and select the alternate texture from the popup menu. If you still have trouble getting your new add-on to work, you may want to read its ssc, stc or dsc catalog file for clues to how and where the object should appear in Celestia.  Even the smallest error can cause Celestia to function incorrectly, so be careful.

Error messages often are shown in Celestia's &quot;console log.&quot; Type a tilde (~) to toggle the log on and off. The up- and down-arrow keys can be used to navigate within it.

Celestia has gone through quite a few versions since it was first made available in the late 1990s. Some of the older versions are still available from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302  SourceForge ].

* The next major release of Celestia, v1.7.0, is currently under development. 
** If the user interface changes to QT, which will be common to all operating systems, it may be called v2.0. 
** See the [[Celestia/Development|Development instructions]] if you'd like to try compiling the &quot;pre-alpha&quot; version yourself. It's very easy to do under Windows, at least.

* Celestia v1.6.1 will be only a bug-fix release. 
** V1.6.1 has been delayed due to an intractable problem in the MacOS version.

* Celestia v1.6.0 was made available on July 10, 2009.
** Please visit the [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13995  Celestia Web forum: Celestia 1.6.0 released ] for details.

* Celestia v1.5.0 was made available on January 26, 2008.
** Please visit the [http://shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11953  Celestia Web forum : Celestia 1.5.0 is ready] for details.

* The previous stable version of Celestia, v1.4.1, was released in February, 2006.

Building More Complicated Formulas


: 'I need a hammer and nails or a screwdriver and screws.'

Though we know what is meant by the above statement, it is technically ambiguous - imagine saying it to a not very bright apprentice.  In this case no harm would be done and the apprentice might fetch an unnecessary tool.  One could think of other situations where such ambiguity could be lethal.

In propositional calculus we use brackets to prevent any ambiguity:

: 'I need (a hammer and nails) or (a screwdriver and screws).'

This is just like the usual mathematical use of brackets: you evaluate the contents first.

We don't use brackets around &amp;not; symbols -- it binds tightly onto whatever is following it.

== General Question ==

It is a great debatable question as to how long the boys spent on this island. If anyone has any thoughts, or general guesses, please leave some here.

&gt;&gt;I don't know about how long. However, I do know that the story did not take place during WWI or II. The author's opinions and ideas may have stemmed from his experiences in WWII, but at the time of his writing LotF it was supposed to be futuristic.

&gt;&gt; I agree with the point made above. I would guess it was written shortly after the stories about WWII were told. Golding probably used these stories to help further his thoughts and ideas.

== Potential Copyright violation ==

[[User:Kernigh]] pointed out that the material on this page fails a google test.  That may be true, but I'm thinking that instead of failing because the content was copyied from elsewhere, this is a failed test because many other sites are mirroring Wikibooks material and doing so illegally, unless they have also been granted copyright permission all of the users, including anonymous users (there are many for this Wikibook) who have contributed.

In short, by going over the history one edit at a time, I fail to see how this can possibly be a copyright violation by Wikibooks.  Instead, it needs to be turned over to the Wikimedia legal team to have some real fun in terms of GFDL violations and other fun stuff that should be happening to people who abuse Wikibooks content.

Perhaps some minor content needs to be culled, but not this whole wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:11, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:On much futher review and really digging deep into the edit history, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_of_the_Flies&amp;oldid=124690 this edit] is likely to be a copyright violation from an external source.  Most of the rest of this Wikibook seems to have been generated a few sentances at a time, and typical of most Wikimedia development.  I'm surprised with how many people have subsequently visted this page havn't caught this earlier.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:08, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1991, Jay Barney developed the Resource Based View of the firm. This view established four criteria that determine a firm's competitive capabilities in the marketplace.

These four criteria for judging a firm's resources are:
#Are they Valuable? (do they enable a firm to devise strategies that improve efficiency or effectiveness?)
#Are they Rare? (if many other firms possess it, then it is not rare)
#Are they Imperfectly Imitable? (because of unique historical conditions, causally ambiguous, and/or are socially complex)
#Are they Non-Substitutable? (if a ready substitute can be found, then this condition is not met)

When all four of these criteria are met, then a firm can be said to have a '''sustainable competitive advantage'''. In other words, the firm will have an advantage in the marketplace which will last until the criteria are no longer met completely. As a result, the firm will be able to earn higher profits than other firms with which it competes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Introduction to High School Geometry====

The word ''geometry'' comes originally from Greek, meaning literally, ''to measure the earth''. It is an ancient branch of mathematics, but its modern meaning depends largely on context.
*To the elementary or middle school student (ages six to thirteen in the U.S. school system), geometry is the study of the names and properties of simple shapes (e.g., the defining properties of triangles, squares, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, prisms, etc., along with formulas for their areas or volumes).
*To the high school student (ages fourteen to seventeen in the U.S. system), geometry has two flavors: synthetic and analytic. Synthetic geometry uses deductive proof to study the properties of points, lines, angles, triangles, circles, and other plane figures, roughly following the plan laid out by the Greek textbook writer Euclid around 300 B.C. Analytic geometry follows the pioneering work of the French mathematicians René Descartes (1596-1650) and Pierre Fermat (1601-1665) to impose a coordinate grid on the plane, making it possible to study geometric objects (e.g., lines, parabolas, and circles) by means of algebra (e.g., linear equations and quadratic equations) and vice versa.
*To the mathematical researcher geometry is a subject that has grown far from its roots, and he may refer to his field  as ''modern geometry'' to distinguish it from the school subject. Modern geometry comes in two main flavours: algebraic geometry (Algebraic curves and surfaces, algebraic varieties), and differential geometry (Riemannian geometry, Spin geometry, Lie groups and algebras). Differential geometry is used in many ways; to describe the universe in the theory of general relativity (Lorentzian 4-manifolds), to describe soap bubble films (minimal surfaces) and as the building blocks of particle physics (Lie groups).

The first part of this wiki textbook aspires to be a high school geometry text adequate to satisfy the  [http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ California curriculum content standards].

====Why invest the energy to learn geometry?====

Basic geometry is a very powerful practical problem solver. It was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks for solving most problems and was the proto-type for rational thinking. Where we use algebra today the Greeks used geometry then.  It is still very current in all the building and fabrication trades. Before building something big and expensive it is better to work out the bugs in a small scale model. Before expending a lot of energy in making a model it is best to do a drawing. With geometry the drawings become very accurate and can be used to predict measurements and costs. Geometry can be easy to master; the proofs are more fun than sudoko; and its applications are as practical as a hammer and saw. It will give you a sophisticated visual intuition and a strong sense of rational proof and a jumping-off place for some of the most abstract areas of pure mathematics. It’s hard to imagine a mathematical education without geometry.

====What should I know before attempting this text?====

*Read [[Geometry for Elementary School]]. It will make you comfortable with the terms and diagrams used here.

*You should be able to do arithmetic up to addition of fractions without a calculator (1/4 + 2/5 = 13/20); and solve simple algebra problems (2x -1= 0 then x= 1/2) and (X^2-16=0). Often algebra and geometry are taught together and the students would know enough algebra by the time they needed it. It wouldn't hurt to read the first few chapters in both arithmetic and beginning algebra while doing geometry. Mathematics builds on itself. This means that only if you work all the examples and learn the definitions will later pages make sense to you. Keep a notebook and make lots of drawings. Talking to others about what you learn is invaluable. You do your part and a good text book will get you there.

====How difficult? Intuition vs. rigor:====

Fifteen little boys sit in front of their first soccer coach, knowing nothing about the game. The coach stands up to teach them soccer. How does he begin?

Perhaps he lectures for several hours, explaining the rules of soccer along with common strategies and tactics. The little boys grow bored. Having no experience of the game, they have trouble understanding the rules and even more trouble remembering them. By the end they have no sense of what a soccer game ''feels'' like.

On the other hand, perhaps the coach divides the boys into two teams, takes them to a soccer field, throws them a ball, tells them, &quot;Try to get the ball into the other team's goal and keep it out of your own,&quot; and then lets them play. Knowing no rules, the boys play a game little like soccer. They pick the ball up and run with it, paying no attention to the boundaries of the field. When they finally get the idea to kick the ball, they have no skill at dribbling, passing, or working together as a team. They have some fun, but again they end up not knowing what a soccer game ''feels'' like.

The first approach (teaching all the rules before playing) is what mathematicians might call a ''rigorous'' approach to soccer while the second (just playing without worrying about rules) is what they might call an ''intuitive'' approach. Rigor emphasizes the rules. Intuition emphasizes the play. Good teaching and good learning need a balance of both. A good soccer coach starts by teaching the boys some of the most important rules, making them practice some  basic drills, and letting them play a little. At first he probably emphasizes the intuitive, letting them play more, so that they get a sense of how the game works and how much fun it can be. Later, as they develop a taste for the game, he focuses more on skills and drills, on rules, strategy, and tactics.

The teacher of beginning geometry students faces the same question as the soccer coach: emphasize rigor or emphasize intuition? Following the example of the good coach, this first chapter emphasizes intuition while introducing a little rigor. Specifically this chapter introduces many of the elementary concepts and much of the terminology of geometry in the context of an intuitive treatment of Euclidean geometry. Later chapters revisit these topics with greater rigor.

So, for instance, this chapter addresses Euclidean geometry without explaining what makes it Euclidean and without mentioning other sorts of geometry. Again, since elementary geometers think of points as dots, this chapter explains that a ''point'' is like an infinitely small dot. It is a helpful mental image that has served geometers well for over 2000 years. Rigorous approaches to geometry leave the term ''point'' undefined, but this text reserves that subtle and confusing convention for a later chapter. Again, this text assumes that its readers already understand something about area and volume and the units for measuring them, so it does not try to define and explain standard units of area and volume.

In both the Mercury and Venus articles, the lack of a moon is explained in the same way. I think it would make sense for Mercury to have the explanation, and Venus to refer to Mercury's explanation. The section about  Venus' moon would still have content, due to the story of its fabled moon.

== &quot;Venus'&quot; or &quot;Venus's&quot; as possessive ==

This goes back to my Senior year of high school (and English 101) where I wouldn't have swore that when you make a possessive out of a word that ends in the letter &quot;s&quot;, you simply put the apostrophe on the end.  Apparently I'm in an edit war over this with [[User:Laurascudder|Laurascudder]], so now I'm appealing to the community in general to decide this issue.  This is like the name of the magazine Boys' Life (note the apostrophe on the end.)  I guess to clarify things we could also simply use the term Venusian (as opposed to Venerial which is the correct term but usually not used in scientific circles to talk about things pertaining to Venus and only used in medical journals instead).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:43, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

:Technically the apostrophe only rule is only applicable when the ''s'' on the end is due to a plural.  An example is that you write Texas's rather than Texas' because Texas is singular but boys' instead of boys's because boys is plural (See for instance [http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/spelling.html#Anchor-POSSESSIVES-6296 University of Minnesota style guide]).  This is however a frequently confused rule.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 18:55, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

I've seen (and myself use) constructions such as Texas' meaning &quot;of Texas&quot; along the lines of &quot;two days' time&quot; meaning &quot;the time of two days&quot;. Would we write (or try to say) &quot;two days's time&quot;..? I'm not convinced the rule given in the University of Minnesota's style guide is generally considered to be a rule &amp;ndash; but then I suppose there's no final arbiter to whom to appeal. So I'll just say that &quot;Texas's&quot; (and &quot;Venus's&quot;, etc) looks odd to me!&lt;br&gt;
Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 15:12, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:K, if that's what you guys want, I'm not going to fight it.  Let me just point out that there's ~400k instances of ''Texas's'' on the internet according to google.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 16:02, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I don't know what the conclusion to this was, but I'm editing it as &quot;Venus's&quot; because this is what it is correct grammatically, rather than taking artistic license to make it anything else. In any case, the possessive form is definitely not &quot;Venuses&quot;, which I had to edit it from. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 19:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Add section: &quot;Fix for Linux if clicking on a Cel: URL does not work&quot;</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{incomplete}}

==Introduction==

A Cel: URL is a bookmark that saves the time, location, rendering options and other settings of a specific Celestia event or place. These URLs can be exported and published as regular HTML, so that any Celestia user can share a Celestia scene with any other.

The Windows version of Celestia includes a Bookmark menu. Those bookmarks are not the same as Cel: URLs.

To record a Cel: URL to your computer's &quot;clipboard&quot;, type a Ctrl-C, or the usual &quot;copy selected region&quot; keyboard shortcut. On a Windows system, you can type a  Ctrl-Insert.

To paste a Cel: URL into a document, type a Ctrl-V, or the usual &quot;paste clipboard&quot;.

==Potential incompatibility warning==
Unfortunately URLs recorded by one version of Celestia often are not compatible with other versions. The origin of Celestia's coordinate system changed in V1.5. As a result, URLs recorded by previous versions of Celestia place the viewpoint hundreds of AU from the intended viewpoint. Similarly, the rotation of the Earth was greatly improved in Celestia v1.6. As a result, URLs recorded by V1.5 for viewpoints on the Earth's surface will place the viewpoint tens of kilometers from the intended viewpoint. Also, although URLs recorded by previous versions of Celestia can be read by V1.6, the URLs generated by V1.6 cannot be used by previous versions of Celestia.

==Fix for Linux if clicking on a Cel: URL does not work==
Depending on the specifics of your installation, Celestia might not have been registered to handle the Cel: URLs. If that is the case, you can remedy as follows (this should work on any system compliant with the XDG specifications).

# Enter &lt;code&gt;xdg-mime default celestia.desktop x-scheme-handler/cel&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal. (This registers Celestia as the program that handles cel: links.)
# Edit &lt;code&gt;celestia.desktop&lt;/code&gt;, replacing the line &lt;code&gt;Exec=celestia-gnome&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Exec=celestia-gnome %u&lt;/code&gt;, so that the system knows that it has to pass the URL argument to Celestia, when launching it. The desktop file is usually found in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications/&lt;/code&gt; and if you don't want to edit files with root, you can instead copy it to &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share/applications/&lt;/code&gt; and edit it there (or more generally copy it from &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/&lt;/code&gt;). Optionally, you can also add &lt;code&gt;MimeType=x-scheme-handler/cel;&lt;/code&gt; to the desktop file. (See [http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html the XDG desktop entry spec].)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Numbers==

Numbers in Perl do not have to be enclosed in any kind of punctuation; they can be written as straight numbers.

===Floating Point Numbers===

Here are some acceptable floating point numbers:

0.1, -3.14, 2.71828...

===Integers===
''Integers'' are all whole numbers and their negatives (and 0): {... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...}.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are a few examples of integers:

 12, -50, 20, 185, -6654, 6654

The following examples are '''not''' integers:

 15.5, -3.458, 3/2, 0.5

===Non-decimal Numbers===

I'll dwell on this topic for a little longer than the other types of numbers.  In Perl you can specify not only decimal numbers, but also numbers in hex, octal, and binary.  If you are not familiar with how these systems work, you can try these Wikipedia articles:

*[[w:Hexadecimal|Hexadecimal]]
*[[w:Octal|Octal]]
*[[w:Binary_numeral_system|Binary]]


In Perl you have to specify when you are going to write a non-decimal number.  Binary numbers start with an 0b, so here are some possible binary numbers:

 0b101011101
 
 0b10

Octal numbers start with 0 (&quot;zero&quot;), so here are some possible octal numbers:

 015462
 
 062657
 
 012

Hexadecimal numbers start with 0x, so here are some possible hexadecimal numbers:

 0xF17A
 
 0xFFFF

===Number Operators===

Just like strings, numbers have operators.  These operators are quite obvious so I'll just give a quick example of each one.

====The +, - , /, and * Operators====

These operators are pretty obvious, but here are some examples:

 100 + 1 # That's 101
 100 - 1 # That's 99
 100 / 2 # That's 50
 100 * 2 # That's 200

Perl also has the familiar increment, decrement, plus-equals, and minus-equals operators from C:
 $a++    # evaluate, then increment
 ++$a    # increment, then evaluate
 $a--    # evaluate, then decrement
 --$a    # decrement, then evaluate
 $a += 5 # plus-equals operator, adds 5 to $a. Equivalent to $a = $a + 5
 $a -= 2 # minus-equals operator, subtracts 2 from $a. Equivalent to $a = $a-2

Now let's look at one more operator that's a little less obvious.

====The &lt;tt&gt;**&lt;/tt&gt; Operator====

The &lt;tt&gt;**&lt;/tt&gt; operator is simply the exponentation operator.  Here's another example:

 2**4  # That's 16, same as 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
 4**3**2 # that's 4**(3**2), or 4&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, or 262144

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|'''Extra!'''&lt;/br&gt; The modulus operator (&lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;) can be used to find the remainder when dividing two numbers.&lt;/br&gt;If that doesn't make sense now, that's fine, it's not that important.
(Note, this returns 0 when used on floating point numbers)
|}

===Exercises===

*Remember the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; operator?  Use a mathematical expression as the number of times to repeat the string, see what happens.
*Write a program like our original hello world program except make it print a mathematical expression.

==Size of Mercury==

I simplified the section on Mercury's size, thinking that our target audience wouldn't need three decimal places when comparing it to the Earth and moon. I changed it to &quot;a little over a third as big as the Earth,&quot; and changed the moon comparison similarly. I also deleted the fifth significant figure for the size in km, figuring such percision unnecessary.

My version is not necessarily the best way to phrase it either, though, so feel free to edit as you will. --[[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 00:06, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Mythology==

Though none of the other planet articles have expanded this section yet, I figured saying why a planet was named after a certain god was important. I've started changing it in this direction, feel free to expand.&lt;br&gt;
On a completely unrelated note, I felt a little like Calvin from ''Calvin and Hobbes'': &quot;Mercury was a Roman God with winged feet... Why they named a planet after this guy, I can't imagine. Um... back to you, Susie...&quot; --[[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 00:45, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've also added a possible &quot;Mythology box.&quot; Do people think such asides are good? -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 20:52, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)


I love the Mythology Box! Such asides usually make it more interesting, especially in children's books. [[User:Lady~Macbeth|Lady~Macbeth]] 02:18, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Orbital precession ==

Is the concept of orbital precession too advanced for a book of this nature? As you probably know, in physics the precession of the orbit of Mercury is considered important as it helped confirm Einstein's theory of relativity. Historically people tried to explain the discrepancies in the rate of precession by predicting the existence of the planet Vulcan. (Which may be an interesting section all by itself.) &amp;mdash; [[User:130.76.32.15|130.76.32.15]] 14:55, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)
: Try to simplify (in this case really simplify) the issues and bring up the larger issues of being very close to a massive object like the Sun.  Another place you could write up this issue in terms of relativistic effects could be in a supplimental article like the existing [[Wikijunior Solar System/How the Solar System was born|How was the Solar System born?]] article.  These are planned to be a part of the appendix when the book is formally put together.  [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 9 July 2005 11:00 (UTC)

== How long is a year on this planet? ==

Wouldn't this sentence:
&quot;This means that an eight-year-old person would be 32 years old on Mercury.&quot;

suggests the reader that they will biologically age faster in Mercury? How about: &quot;... would be 32 Mercury years&quot;?

:Sounds great -- go for it. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 17:37, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== Mercury Facts ==

* Mercury's surface temperature can vary from -300 °F (-180 °C) to 800 °F (430 °C). The hottest shade temperature ever felt on Earth was only 58 °C (136 °F)!


- mixed use in the same line of:  xxx °F (yyy °C) - versus - xxx °C (yyy °F)&lt;br&gt;
- dominand use on other Solar System pages seems(?) to be, xxx °C (yyy °F)&lt;br&gt;
? making the (yyy °X) part slightly differ might make it a little more readeble. (whole book!)

:That isn't &quot;mixed use&quot;.  It is consistent use of the logical and proper convention for expressing converted values:  List the '''original first''', followed by the '''converted value in parentheses'''.  You can see from the roundness of the numbers that the degrees Fahrenheit are the likely originals.  But we know that the 58 °C was originally made on the Celsius scale, in part because those are the only units of temperature for weather used where it was made.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 13:39, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

::It is consistent use if you are aware of the rule that is applied. Not sure how I should have know this. (MvG)

:::I was just trying to point out that there are several different bases from which you can look at consistency, and they aren't always compatible with each other.  You could certainly find publications which do follow an &quot;English units first&quot; or &quot;metric units first&quot; rule and things like that.  I'm just arguing that the better position is &quot;originals first&quot;, because, as pointed out below, that is often the best indicator of the precision of the original measurement, and also because, if an error has been made in conversion--which happens quite often, it is a clue as to which one is more likely correct.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 14:23, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

::Note, however, for the stuff below as well, that the better and easier to read conversion style groups ranges of numbers:

Still, I like this one better, and is clean and to the point.  Parenthesis tend to break up thoughts and reading, so grouping the concept of the range is a good one.  I also agree that as a matter of style italics are inappropriate here.  As a general style guideline as well, don't put in false precision when doing conversions between Imperial (American now?) units and Metric units.  I hate it when you see something like 100 miles (160.94 km) when you were talking about a rough distance to somewhere.  Instead it should be somewhat close in precision like 100 miles (160 km) where you can assume in this case +/- 10 km accuracy.  Things like diameters of asteroids and moons generally only have about 2 digit accuracy anyway, and in some cases even the order of magnitude is a guess.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:27, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

:I repeat, the consistency to strive for is originals first; not some artificial notion that some particular unit of measure should come first.
:The reason for this has a lot to do with your point about precision.  That temperature was originally measured as 58 °C, likely on a thermometer that only had the Celsius scale.  Assuming that this was accurately measured to the nearest degree Celsius, it would be somewhere between 135.5 °F and 137.3 °F; to the nearest degree Fahrenheit, it might have been 136 °F or 137 °F.
:However, if it is instead stated as 136 °F first, this creates the misleading impression that it was measured to the nearest degree Fahrenheit, and would be somewhere in the 57.5 °C to 58.1 °C range if accurately measured to greater precision. 
:Similarly, with the originals first in the other numbers, there are two logical choices for the precision of the conversion:  either &amp;minus;300 °F to 800 °F (&amp;minus;200 °C to 400 °C) or &amp;minus;300 °F to 800 °F (&amp;minus;180 °C to 430 °C) would work, but if we can safely assume that the originals have been kept in the primary position, we have a better idea how precise those numbers actually are, no matter which conversion is used.

Bye bye &amp; GL. (MvG)
(I would clean up, but u 2 are still talking)

::We are not talking about a formal scientific journal, where the original numbers are of huge importance and it is critical that the original data is preserved (like real scientists never fudge the data anyway).  This is a book for kids, for crying out loud.  The consistancy is to deal with the cultural context of what units the kids may be familiar with, although even in the USA it is likly that the kids reading this are familiar with the metric system.  If this were to be published in the EU as a primary target, it would be better if the temperature and distances listed would be in metric measurements first.  The dual listing of imperial and metric units is done in part to help encourage a transition away from the imperial units, but use them when that is all the reader may be familiar with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:39, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

:::In this particular case, the figures currently in the Wikipedia article are expressed in kelvins:  90 K minimum, 400 K mean, 700 K maximum, 103 K average night, 623 K average day (in at least the last two cases, there is a fairly good chance they are from originals in degrees Celsius, to the nearest 10 degrees).
:::Using those values as the originals, it is fine with me if it is expressed as (-180 °C to 430 °C (-300 °F to 800 °F).  It is merely coincidence that rounding the degrees Fahrenheit to the nearest ten degrees gives us numbers divisible by 100.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Needs reorganizing and more ==

Despite the fact that all the tasks seem to have been checked off, this page looks like it needs some help. Can the proofreading page be essentially reset to start the proofreading process over again? I don't want to upset anyone by undoing their hard work, but looking at the dates and arguments, someone needs to ''be bold'' if any of these books are going to reach the finished stage.

== &quot;Fun facts&quot; boxes ==
I quite liked the two boxes that used to be in this article (which can be seen in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior_Solar_System/Mercury&amp;oldid=246259 this version]). They were removed by User:Shanel with no explaination. I'm not sure if the problem was the formatting (they took up a bit of room when there was very little on the page), but I think that these articles ought to include such things, especially as having the exact same structure in every article in the series can be fairly boring. &amp;mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|talk]] (''not signed in''), 21:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Image ==
The classical depiction of Mercury was removed by User:Starchildmom. I think that either it or a similar image should go back. Are we trying to make this article as dry as possible? &amp;mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|talk]] (''not signed in''), 21:08, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:The images have been removed due to some discussion that they detract rather than enhance from the content here.  While classical art is interesting, and the names of many bodies of the Solar System are based on ancient mythology, this is not an art history book.  Notably the images of Europa and Neptune were borderline pornographic, and either we need to get something a tad bit more conservative or simply leave them out.  This isn't fighting NPOV, but rather that we want to allow this content to the widest possible audience.  I agree that a classical depiction of Mercury would be useful, so if you know of some images that we could use to represent these greek gods that are 1) availble under GFDL-compatable licenses, 2) are otherwise culturally neutral in their appearance and 3) fairly consistent within the set between one diety and another.  That is also the importantce of each point, I would add, but it seemed as though point #2 was failing with some of these images, and none of the images seemed to show any consistancy of any sort on point #3.  If you are an artist, would you want to give it a try?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:06, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Cell structure ==
What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word &quot;cella&quot;, meaning &quot;small room&quot;, and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.  The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.  Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as &quot;the building blocks of life&quot;.  Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.  

According to ''Cell Theory,'' first proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists of cells.  The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate themselves. It is the basis of human life.


All cells contain:
* Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane)
* Cytoplasm
* DNA (hereditary information)
* Ribosomes for protein synthesis

Eukaryotic cells also contain:
* At least one nucleus
* Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy

Cells may also contain:
* Lysosomes
* Peroxisomes
* Vacuoles
* Cell walls

===Concepts===
;Plasma Membrane : Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions are the following:
#It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.  
#It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
#Communicates with other cells.  
;Model of the fluid mosaic : Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.  
;Phospholipid bilayer : Is in the plasma membrane and produces the fluid part of membranes.
;Proteins : Long chains of amino acids.  
;Glucose proteins : Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts of the cell. 
;Functions of proteins : Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with its environment. 
;Transport Proteins : Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some transport proteins called &lt;b&gt;channel proteins&lt;/b&gt; form pores or channels in the membrane so that water soluble molecules pass.  
;Carrying proteins : Have union sites that can hold specific molecules.
;Reception proteins : They activate &lt;b&gt; cellular responses &lt;/b&gt; when specific molecules join.
;Proteins of recognition : They work as identifiers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
;Fluid : It is any substance that can move or change of form.
;Concentration : Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.
;Gradient : Physical difference between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to move in response to the gradients.
;Diffusion : Movement of the molecules in a fluid, from the regions of high concentration to those of low concentration.
;Passive transport : Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
;Simple diffusion : Diffusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
;Facilitated diffusion : Diffusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
;Osmosis : Diffusion of the water across a membrane with differential permeability.
;Transport that needs energy : Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of concentration with the requirement of energy.
;Active transport : Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
;Endocytosis : Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose particles or liquids.
;Pinocytosis : (Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
;Phagocytosis : Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
;Pseudopodia : False feet (the amoeba).
;Exocytosis : Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
;Isotonic : The cytoplasm fluid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
;Hypertonic solution : The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
;Hypotonic : The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
;Swelling : Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
;Endoplasmic Reticulum : It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.

===Structure and function of the cell===
;Rudolf Virchow : Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
#Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
#The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of the multicellular organisms.
#All the cells come from preexisting cells.

===Common characteristics of all the cells===
;Molecular components : Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
;Structural components : Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
;Robert Hooke : He postuled for the first time the term ''cell''
;Prokaryotes : Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
;Eukaryotes : Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane

== History of cell knowledge ==

The optical microscope was first invented in 17th century.  Shortly thereafter scientists began to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of life.  Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include: 

* The invention of the microscope, which allowed scientists for the first time to see biological cells
* Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called cork &quot;cells&quot;
* Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the microscope &quot;animalcules&quot;
* Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a botanist, in 1838 determined that all '' plants '' consist of cells
* Theodor Schwann, a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all '' animals '' consist of cells
* Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells


In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations, the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells. In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the first statement of their joint cell theory.

===Cell Theory===

Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination, but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis) was later disproven.  Rudolf Virchow famously stated &quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot;... &quot;All cells only arise from pre-existing cells.&quot;  The parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to scientific scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientific community today.

The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: 
(1) The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in living things.  (2) All organisms are made up of one or more cells.  (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division.  (4) Cells carry genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division.  (5) All cells are essentially the same in chemical composition.  (6) Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.

==Microscopes==
* Allow greater resolution, can see finer detail
* Eye: resolution of ~ 100 μm
* Light microscope: resolution of ~ 200 nm
* Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
* Confocal microscopy: 2 dimension view
* Electron microscope: resolution of ~0.2 nm
* Laser tweezers: move cell contents

==Cell size==
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneficial to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diffuse gases and nutrients in and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.

That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less efficient at exchanging materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture proteins locally within different parts of the cell.

'''Key concepts:'''
Cell size:
* Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
* Diffuse oxygen and other gases
* Transport of [[w:RNA|mRNA]] and [[w:protein|protein]]s
** Surface area to volume ratio limited
* Larger cells typically:
** Have extra copies of genetic information
** Have slower communication between parts of cell

[[w:Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear [[w:chromosome|chromosome]]s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, [[w:RER|RER]], [[w:SER|SER]], lysosomes, [[w:vacuole|vacuole]]s, [[w:chloroplast|chloroplast]]s; ribosomes and a [[w:cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]]. Also, plants, fungi, and some protists have a cell wall.

== Structure of the nucleus ==
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the cell.  It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.

===Nuclear envelope===
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered [[en:Plasma membrane|plasma membrane]] like the cell membrane, although without membrane proteins.  To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear envelope has structures called [[en:Nuclear pore|Nuclear pore]]s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum.

===Nucleolus===
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus.  The nucleolus is the area where there is a high amount of [[en:DNA transcription|DNA transcription]] taking place.

== Chromatin ==
Chromosomes consist of [[w:chromatin|chromatin]]. This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a [[w:histone|histone]] core and organized into [[w:nucleosome|nucleosome]]s.

The [[w:chromatin|chromatin]] must be uncoiled for [[w:gene expression|gene expression]] and [[w:replication|replication]].
Chromosome micrograph

== Endoplasmic reticulum ==
The [[w:endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] is a cellular [[w:organelle|organelle]] made up of a series of extended folded intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane. 

There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
* RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of [[w:protein synthesis|protein synthesis]]) associated with ribosomes
* SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of [[w:lipid synthesis|lipid synthesis]])

===Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum===

Proteins are directed to the RER by a '''signal sequence''' of a growing [[w:polypeptide|polypeptide]]s on the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribosome/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon, the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes can happen.

# If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus for processing of the polypeptide.
# If the protein is destined for storage for later secretion after stimulation or for continuous secretion then a protease -an enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond- can cut the signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then occur.

When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are either modified for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become cytosolic enzymes for example.

===Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum===

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces [[w:enzyme|enzyme]]s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis and detoxification
RER

===Sarcoplasmic Reticulum===
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is different from the other 2 types in that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm. This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

|}

== The Golgi apparatus ==
The [[w:Golgi apparatus|golgi apparatus]] is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
* Proteins made on the RER are modified and then sorted
* Formation of secretory vesicles
* Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)

Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
* [[w:Microbody|Microbodies]] (generic term)
* Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
* [[w:Peroxisome|Peroxisome]] (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by [[w:catalase|catalase]])

==Ribosomes==
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the cell [[w:nucleoli|nucleoli]] and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are composed of RNA and protein.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are different, the eukaryotic ones being larger and more complicated. 

== DNA-containing organelles ==
'''Mitochondria'''
* Double membrane
* Aerobic metabolism, internal membrane
* DNA, ribosomes
* Give rise to new mitochondria
'''[[w:Chloroplast|Chloroplast]]'''
* Double membrane
* Photosynthesis, internal membrane
* DNA, ribosomes
* Give rise to new chloroplasts
'''[[w:Centriole|Centriole]]s'''
* Microtubule organizing centers
** Animal cells and many protists
** Pair constitutes the centrosome
** Give rise to flagellum during spermatogenesis
* Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
* [[w:mitosis|Mitosis]], [[w:meiosis|meiosis]]

== Cytoskeleton==

Cytoskeleton is a collective term for different filaments of proteins that can give physical shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried along.  

* Gives the cell shape
* Anchors other organelles
* Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules

The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of filaments:
* [[w:Actin|Actin]] filaments (7 nm)
* [[w:Microtubule|Microtubule]]s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring. 
* [[w:Intermediate Filament|Intermediate Filament]]s

Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.

===Intermediate Filaments===

These are rope like filaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neurofilaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply makes up hair, nails and horns.

===Actin Filaments===

=====Growth=====
These filaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin filaments is concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

Cilia and flagella are threads of microtubules that extend from the exterior of cells and used to move single celled organisms as well as move substances away from the surface of the cell. motor proteins-move, wave motion</text>

The info about Uranus spinning on its side now appears twice.[[User:Geni|Geni]] 22:16, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Astronomical/Astrological Symbol for Uranus ==

This is something that I've been wanting to work on for some time.  The current symbol that is in use for Uranus (in this Wikibook module) is a variant of a symbol that is more commonly used for astrology rather than astonomical purposes, although the distinction when using these symbols is not as clear as you would think.  That is the three vertical bars above the circle.

The more &quot;traditional&quot; astronomical symbol for Uranus, the ball with the arrow pointing up, is something is more commonly depicted in astronomical books in the late 20th Century.

In reality, there is no accepted &quot;standard&quot; as the IAU does not keep an &quot;official&quot; list of symbols, but it is merely a convention.  Pre-20th Century (and some early 20th Century) astronomical notes very frequently used these symbols when doing studies of these planets, although they were usually hand-drawn as it was the astronomer himself that was using them as a kind of short-hand notation for planetary observations.

I plan to write a major sub-section on the Wikijunior Solar System about this topic, as there is some really cool material about it.  For now, however, having two redundant symbols is not really needed, but if a clean and neat rendering of this symbol can be done it would be appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:32, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not sure how appealing a major subsection on symbology would be to kids, but I'll hold off my judgment until I see it. In any case, it wouldn't hurt to have this symbol around in a clean picture. I've taken the liberty of reproducing the symbol in ant's style. If it's not close enough, feel free to replace it.

== Looks like the Proofing on this is done! ==

I just went to sign up for a task on proofreading this work prior to publication, and it looks like every task to be completed in the proofing section has been crossed off and completed.

: I like it, because Brazil article must have one or two pages and this separation gives a good overview about the whole country. Insert a Brazil´s regions map would be nice. A short text about Brazil´s history would be nice too. By the way, are you brazilian? [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 16:23, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:: Não, infelizmente, sou Australiano. I was in brasil for the first half of this year on intercambio, and i feel in love with it. Agora tengo muito saudade de brasil. Btw, i was just looking at [[:wikipedia:Carnival]] and there is almost nothing about the brazillian carnival, so could you (i presume you are brazillian) add something to it, cause i dont really know that much about it (except for what happens in salvador). thanks. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 00:48, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Spelling== 
Hey Bellman (go back to shakespeare wikireader, I'm starting up again too! :)). I think there needs to be a standard spelling for Brazil- I've always known it as a Z, but someone is using the s, which is probably also correct- is that a regional thing or a language thing? I changed the first paragraph to z's, but figured I'd ask before I go changing anything else. [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 16:41, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Sorry for confusing you. I always spell it with an 's' out of habit, becuase that is how it is spelt in portuguese. In english however the correct spelling is with a 'z'. Sorry i didnt realise i was using an 's'. ill go fix it up. If i accedently do it again, go right ahead and change it to a 'z'. i dont know how much time ill have for the bard, but ill try and devote any spare wikitime to him.
[[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 22:42, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: I had &quot;thought&quot; that was the case- but I couldn't be sure. I'll make changes to, as I find them- I'm hanging around the wikijunior stuff. Yea- I'm gonna be focusing more on WS now, so if you've got any time, stop back- I wanna get that off the ground finally. [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 22:59, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: You know, we can have different spellings for different versions. If we can find a good direct-to-print (or if &quot;print from disk&quot;, if you prefer) printer, and they don't mind, languages aside, we can vary bits and pieces of the magazine from country to country, even different ones for different regions (like particular provinces, say). While we'd have to make sure that one standardised edition was working perfectly before doing anything else, this could help make the content more relevant to everyone.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

; ''Bem-vindo'' versus ''bem vindo'' : I am no Portuguese teacher, but since I noticed there has been a few edits concerning the use of &quot;bem vindo&quot; I thought it would be a good idea to create a discussion here. As far as I know &quot;bem-vindo&quot; is an adjective and needs a verb of some sort. Like in &quot;you are welcome here&quot;. &quot;Bem vindo&quot; is for the use in this article, for &quot;Greetings!&quot; So one would say &quot;Bem vindo ao Brasil&quot; or &quot;Seja bem-vindo ao Brasil&quot;. Yeah... pretty confusing for me too... I tried to find an article explaining this online but Google treats hyphens as spaces on its searches. -- [[user:CrisDias]]

== image suggestions ==

I did some additions to the module, but since my English is very poor, I think the text needs revision. Also, I would suggest some images:
* Brasilia's map - it's shaped like an airplane, the city concept was created by famous architect Oscar Niemayer
* Northeastern &quot;Sertão&quot; is constantly affected by droughts, perhaps an image of that could serve to teach kids that Brazil's is not only a place of parties and beauties.
* A picture of São Paulo central streets would be great; the city is very similiar to metropolis of developed countries.

I live in São Paulo, so if there's any doubt or question, ask me! [[User:Marcelo Reis|Marcelo Reis]] 01:03, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:You say that Paulistano is the word used to mean someone who lives in São Paulo, i always thougth it was Paulista. So what does Paulista mean then? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 01:58, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::* Palista is who was born in São Paulo state
::* Paulistano is who was born in the city of São Paulo
:[[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 02:51, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)
: Who lives in Rio isn't Carioca, to be Carioca, like me, must be born in Rio (the city). The same works to be Palistano and Paulista. [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 03:03, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::: Gbiten, I changed to &quot;paulistano&quot; because the text is refering the city of São Paulo, not the state; so the correct term for Rio is &quot;carioca&quot;, indeed. [[User:Marcelo Reis|Marcelo Reis]] 15:28, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==centralweastern==
I removed this sentece: &quot;The centralweastern region is the least populated region in Brazil.&quot; because the northern region is the least populated region in Brazil. [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 03:23, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: Ops... [http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/tabelagrandes_regioes211.shtm Brazil's region pop comparision] 
:: The centralwestern is the least populated region. Perhaps you was confused by the [[w:pt:Regiões do Brasil|article on pt Wikipedia]]. I fix the information there, too. [[User:Marcelo Reis|Marcelo Reis]] 18:18, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::You are wright, Tocantins is northern region now, when it wasn't separate from Goias the northern region is the least populated. I will correct the article. [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 00:05, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Carnival==
With the carnival infobox i was following the idea set out by [[:meta:Wikijunior_draft_page_layout|this]]. The idea is that the information in the infobox is more indepth on a particular topic, so that those who want to know more can easily read it, and those who dont or cant can easily skip it with out missing any of the greater naritive. What do other people think? should it just be a normal heading? should we have more infoboxes? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 04:21, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Titling, ie the northeast example==
Feel pretty. Oh so pretty. And let that show in titles and subtitles. Otherwise, these are no better than the World Book for Kids. It's okay to be a little POV in this aspect, as long as it doesn't hurt the grand scheme of things. Don't mock anything, but just have fun with it. -- [[user:zanimum]]

== Carnival´s photo ==

This carnival´s photo isn´t from Brazil, I will try to find some photo in public domain. [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 07:44, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Spanish vs. Portuguese ==

Im reasonably sure that there are actually more portuguese speakers in South America than there are Spanish speakers. There are more Spanish speakers in the WHOLE of latin america, but because brasil is so huge i think .pt beats .es in south america. Does anyone have any statistics for how many ppl speak  spanish in south america? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 23:21, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:This wikipedia [[w:South America|article]] says that Brazil has 176,029,560 ppl and South America has 355,070,540 ppl, so 49.5% of South America's ppl are brazilian and speak portuguese. [[User:Gbiten|Gbiten]] 22:18, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::and the pop of French Guiana (french speaking) is 182,333 and Guyana (enlish speaking) is 698,209 and Suriname (dutch speaking) is 436,494, which adds to 1 317 036, which brings non-spanish speakers up to 177 346 596, which means that spanish still has a majority of 188 674 speakers. 

::However, there are between 8 to 13 million people who speak [[w:Quechua|Quechua]] as thier first language, a lot of whom speak little or no spanish, living in spanish speaking countries. But i know of no precise statistics.

::So basicly it looks like both Spanish and Portuguese are minority languages in south america, both with about 49% share. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 22:38, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

let's not forget that brazil has one of the highest population growths in the region, while the most populated spanish speaking countries in south america (colombia, argentina) are dropping their numbers when it comes to population growth, portuguese is indeed the most spoken languagei n south america, however spanish is a far more important and international language, therefore it overshadows the portuguese language.

== My edition to History section ==

Hi, I've just made some editions to History section that some may not agree with because of the focus of the project, but here's my reasons:

* first, I've corrected Portuguese spelling of Álvares Cabral (we always write his name with S instead of Z) and Goiás state (without the acute accent in the version for English-speaking kids to read).
* I've specified that an Emperor is a kind of king, instead of a kind of leader. I think this is a better piece of information and not too precise.
* The biggest change: I've rewritten the last paragraph to make clear there were two dictatorship phases in Brazil. They were different in time (1930s-1945, 1964-1985) and nature, and the democratic phase between them was of great importance to the country - it was when important places such as the nation's first steel mill, and Brasília, were built; when oil was first discovered here; and it's an important time for our culture, with writers like João Guimarães Rosa and the Bossa Nova movement in music.

::I have a little bit of an issue regarding the NPOV of that last paragraph.  I lived in Brazil when it went from a military dictatorship to civilian control (which was an amazing experience), and certainly a simplification of what occured there should be covered.  While I believe as well that there were many murders and assasinations (including the President of the Republic in 1985 by the military that got hushed up real good), I feel that this is more political opinion and not necessarily something that needs to be done as abruptly as stated here.  I guess I'm complaining that there is a period of over 60 years of modern history of Brazil that has been compressed down to 3 sentances, and it certainly could be expanded signifcantly.  Well, at least a couple of paragraphs.  The NPOV issue is still there, however, and I don't know an easy way to deal with it. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

== Maps ==

Hi, you will find maps of Brasil at commons:

== Racism ==

Many people in the Southern region are descended from Europeans. Golly gee, I guess this means the other regions in Brazil are simply uninhabited. And in any case, I '''strongly''' doubt that &quot;many people&quot; means more than a small minority. Most Brazilians are undoubtedly mestizo or mulatto. The only country in the whole of South Americas that's primarily white is Argentina, the rest are primarily Indian or Black. [[User:70.26.56.242|70.26.56.242]] 21:00, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

=== Chit-chat ===

{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| ja=たなか | japanese=すずきさん、こんにちは。
| en=Tanaka | english=Good afternoon Ms Suzuki.}}
{{Japanese conversation

{{Japanese conversation|
| ja=Ｂさん | japanese={{furi|私|わたし}}は〜です。
| en=B | english=It's 〜.}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

The word &quot;私&quot;(わたし) is one of the many ways in which you can express the first person singular (i.e. &quot;I&quot;) in Japanese. It can be used in polite and plain language. The formal version is read わたくし.

=== Inquiring for nationality ===

{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| ja=Ａさん | japanese=お{{furi|国|くに}}はどちらですか？

{{Japanese conversation

In Japanese, nationalities are formed by adding adding the word for person, {{furi|人|じん}}, to the name of a country.

;こちらこそ
: This expression can be used to return a polite expression such as ありがとうございます or よろしくお{{furi|願|ねが|い}}します
;Formality
: Some of the phrases above use polite forms, used when speaking to a superior or an equal with whom one has only loose ties.
;Time of day
: おはようございます is used in the morning (till about 10am) or when waking up.
: こんにちは is used during the day.
: こんばんは is used during the evening and at night.
: These phrases are only used in greeting, never in parting.

;Literal Meaning
: おはようございます It is early.
: こんにちは Today...
: こんばんは This evening...
: はじめまして For the first time...
: よろしくお{{furi|願|ねが|い}}します I humbly ask for your favor.
: こちらこそ This side for sure (It is I who should be the one to say)...
: ありがとうございます I am grateful.

#[[wikt:さん|さん]]: Mr.; Mrs.; Miss; Ms.
#*さん is an appellation added to the end of a name to indicate respect. It is roughly equivalent to Mr., Ms., etc. in English, but can be used on either the family name or the given name. It can also be used on a vocation (e.g. {{rubywikt|理容師|りようし|}}さん &quot;barber&quot;, [[wikt:お巡りさん|お{{furi|巡|まわ|り}}さん]] &quot;police officer&quot;), or even an animal (e.g. {{rubywikt|兎|うさぎ|}}さん &quot;rabbit&quot;). The latter usage is considered childish.
#*さん is never used on oneself or those in one's in-group, only on others toward whom one should show respect.
#*see also {{rubywikt|君|くん|}}, [[wikt:ちゃん|ちゃん]], {{rubywikt|様|さま|}}, {{rubywikt|氏|し|}}

#{{rubywikt|元気|げんき|}} (na-adj): healthy; cheerful; energetic
#*[[wikt:元|元]] means foundation and [[wikt:気|気]] refers to ''[[w:chi|chi]]'', the Chinese metaphysical concept of energy. Thus, saying one's ''chi'' is stable means that the individual is healthy, happy, and energetic.
#[[wikt:はい|はい]] (interj): yes
#[[wikt:ええ|ええ]] (interj): yes
#*polite and somewhat feminine
#[[wikt:うん|うん]] (interj): yeah
#[[wikt:まぁまぁ|まぁまぁ]] (na-adj): okay, fair, not bad, so so

* &amp;sup1; Sounds more masculine.
* &amp;sup2; Relatively gender-neutral.

;お{{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか。
: This is used between people who are acquainted with each other and is roughly equivalent to English &quot;How are you?&quot; or &quot;How have you been?&quot;
: When responding, the お at the beginning and the か at the end are dropped, leaving {{furi|元気|げんき}}です
;{{furi|元気|げんき}}？
: This is the the informal way to ask &quot;How are you?&quot;
: The question is asked with a rising intonation.
: The affirmative response can be {{furi|元気|げんき}}だ, which sounds somewhat masculine, or {{furi|元気|げんき}}, which is more gender-neutral.
;まぁまぁです。, まぁまぁ。
: These are acceptable responses if you are not feeling particularly healthy or cheerful at the moment.
;Grammatical construction
: お元気ですか。 = お (polite prefix) + {{rubywikt|元気|げんき|}} &quot;healthy; happy&quot; + です (noun predicate ending) + か (question marker)
: 元気です。 = {{rubywikt|元気|げんき|}} &quot;healthy; happy&quot; + です (noun predicate ending)
;'''Clarifications'''
: Why is the question お{{furi|元気|げんき}} but the answer just {{furi|元気|げんき}} -- what happened to the お ''o''?
:* The お is an exalted prefix, meaning that the health ({{furi|元気|げんき}} ''genki'') you are referring to is the health of someone you wish to exalt. Japanese honorifics do not allow you to exalt yourself, so you can never use お{{furi|元気|げんき}} ''o-genki'' to talk about your own health.
: Well, can't I just ask {{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか without the exalted お?
:* Yes, you may. The お just makes it more polite.
: Can I ask お{{furi|元気|げんき}} informally?
:* It sounds strange because normally if you are exalting someone, you would also use the polite ですか ending.

NOTE: Most countries are written in katakana as they are foreign words. &quot;Nihon&quot;　日本, for example, is not and neither is &quot;Chuugoku&quot; 中国(China).

=== Culture ===
&quot;How are you?&quot; and &quot;Genki?&quot; may translate the same, but the phrases are culturally incompatible. In general, Japanese do not ask each other how the other is every day. &quot;Genki?&quot; is used only when people meet after a long while. For example, when one calls their mother in Japan, the first thing one might ask is &quot;Genki?&quot;, however, one would not ask friends whom the see every day, &quot;Genki?&quot; 

&quot;Genki&quot; is, culturally,  much closer to &quot;How have you been?&quot;. Although &quot;How are you?&quot; is common greeting in Western countries, it is culturally more accepted to simply say &quot;Kon-nichi-wa.&quot;

Also in English countries, the expected answer to the English &quot;How are you?&quot; is &quot;Fine, thanks.&quot; Japanese, however, tend to respond quite literally to the question お{{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか. It is not considered rude in Japan to go into detail about your medical situation. In fact, when a Japanese has a cold or other disease that can be transmitted aerially, it is considered good manners to wear a mask resembling a surgical mask over the mouth and nose to avoid infecting others with whom you come in contact.

So if you're sick and a Japanese friend asks you, お{{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか, feel free to tell them all about your ailment (within reason). The following words might help:

*{{rubywikt|風邪|かぜ|}}: cold
*[[wikt:咳#Japanese|{{furi|咳|せき}}]]: cough
*[[wikt:インフルエンザ|インフルエンザ]]: flu
*{{rubywikt|病気|びょうき|}}: sickness

== Grammar ==

;こんにちは
: This phrase is equivalent to saying &quot;Good day&quot; in english, and is only said once a day to each person. It is used from 10-11 A.M. to around sunset.
;お元気　ですか
: Translated as &quot;Are you well?&quot;, it is commonly used after a greeting to politely start a conversation.
;はじめまして
: Meaning &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;, it's used mostly as a precursor to an introduction.
;～は　&amp; ～です
: は is a particle; it looks like ''ha'' but is pronounced ''wa''.
: The particle is used to express one thing's relation or status, much like English speakers say &quot;My name is Clem&quot; or &quot;He is burning!&quot;. It states the ''topic'' of the sentence (some more uses and contexts will be studied further on).
: です is used to affirm a statement. 
: For example, わたしのなまえはメアリーです means 'my name is Mary'.
;か
: This is a particle added to the end of the sentence to make it a question. For example:
:*あなたは　山田さんです。(You are Mr. Yamada.)
:*⇒ あなたは　山田さんです'''か'''。(Are you Mr. Yamada?)
;~さん
: This is a honorific. An honorific is a particle added to the end of a name to show respect. Honorifics are never used when talking about yourself or anything related to yourself (like your siblings, for instance), but when you are talking about someone else. So it's wrong to say:
:*私は山田さんです。(I am Mr. Yamada, '''This sounds very strange to japanese ears.''')
:or
:*あなたは山田ですか。(Are you Yamada? '''This is incorrect because you don't know Yamada.''')
:When talking to friends or colleagues you can drop さん or replace it with くん and ちゃん.e.g. Hiroko and Matsumoto, 2 high school friends arrive at school.
:*'''hiroko''': まつもとくん、げんき？
:*'''matsumoto''': ええ、げんき。ひろこちゃんは？

=== Introducing yourself ===
When you meet someone for the first time, you first say,
:はじめまして
:&quot;Nice to meet you&quot; (more literally, &quot;This is the first time...&quot;)

You should not use はじめまして if you have already met the person.

Next, you introduce yourself by saying, 
:私は＿＿です (わたし　は ＿＿です).
:I am ＿＿.
Your family name should be used in place of the blank. If you know how, pronounce your name in Japanese.

* 私 (わたし) means &quot;I, me, myself&quot;.
* は is the topic-marker particle in this sentence, so it is pronounced &quot;wa&quot;.
* です is a polite ending. Here it means &quot;to be&quot; (the [[w:copula|copula]]), but we will see later that it has other uses.

Finally, you say どうぞ　よろしく おねがいします, which means something like &quot;Please favor me with your friendship&quot;.

Let's put it all together. If your name were 田中（たなか), you would say.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot;background: #FFF4F4;&quot;
| '''audio''' はじめまして、私は田中です。どうぞよろしくおねがいします。
|}

'''Note:''' You can omit 私は and just say &quot;〜です&quot; when it is clear that the topic being talked about is yourself.

=== Introducing others ===
When you want to introduce someone to another person, you gesture to the person and say,
:こちら　は　＿＿さん　です.
:This is Mr/Miss/Mrs/Ms ＿＿.

* こちら is a polite way of saying &quot;this (person)&quot;
* 〜さん is an honorific suffix denoting Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. 
:: すずき さん
:: Mr/Ms Suzuki.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot;background: #FFF4F4;&quot;
| '''audio''' こちらは''すずき'''さんです。
|}

'''Note:''' When you are addressing or talking about someone, you should add the honorific suffix 〜さん to their name. Never use 〜さん after your own name, since this is inappropriate.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Scalar Variables==

===Introduction to Scalar Variables===

Now that you understand how to use strings and numbers in Perl, you need to start learning how to use variables.
The best way to learn about scalar variables - Perl talk for a single variable, as against a group or list of values - is to look at an example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 use warnings;
 
 $my_scalar_variable = &quot;Hello, Sir!\n&quot;;
 print $my_scalar_variable;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now let's break this program down:

*The first two lines you already know, &lt;tt&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;use warnings;&lt;/tt&gt;
*The third line is more interesting, it contains a scalar variable.  There are a few important things to point out:
*#In case you haven't figured this out, the scalar variable in this line is &lt;tt&gt;$my_scalar_variable&lt;/tt&gt;
*#Notice the &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; before the name ''my_scalar_variable'', in order to define a scalar variable, this sign must appear before the name.
*Now let's look at the last line.  This is just the familiar print function being told to print the value of &lt;tt&gt;$my_scalar_variable&lt;/tt&gt;.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|'''Try it!'''&lt;/br&gt; Type in the program mentioned above and run it.
|}

===Assigning and Using Scalar Variables===

In the course of writing a program, you will most likely use a variable.  What is a variable?  A variable is something that stores data.  A ''scalar'' variable holds a single value.

====Naming Conventions====

*All scalar variables names must start with a &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; symbol.  You can remember this by thinking &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;calar.
*Variable names can be comprised of alphanumeric characters and underscores.
*Numeric characters are allowed in names of variables, but not as the first character after the &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;.

====Using Scalar Variables====

=====Scalar Variables and Strings=====

You may recall that earlier in the book, I said that whether you use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; in strings makes a big difference in the interaction of strings and variables.  Well now I am going to explain what I meant.

Now that you know what a variable is, what if you wanted to put a variable in a string?  Here's the difference:

*With a double quoted string, this program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #/usr/bin/perl
 
 use warnings;
 
 $variable = 4;
 print &quot;I saw $variable lions!&quot;;

&lt;/source&gt;
Would return &quot;I saw 4 lions!&quot;

*With a single quoted string, this program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #/usr/bin/perl
 
 use warnings;
 
 $variable = 4;
 print 'I saw $variable lions!';

&lt;/source&gt;
Would return &quot;I saw $variable lions!&quot;

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|'''Try it!'''&lt;/br&gt; Type in the programs mentioned above and run them.
|}

This effect is because of what I said before, [[Perl Programming/Strings#Single_Quoted_Strings|single quoted strings]] are interpreted literally.

===Comparison Operators===
:''Main article: [[Perl Programming/Operators]]''

There are operators that are used for comparing numbers and strings.  This can be very useful when you get to more advanced programming.  Both numbers and strings have their own set of operators which test for a condition such as equal or not equal and return either true or false.

====Numeric Comparison Operators====

Here is the list of numeric comparison operators:

*&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; - Equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; - Not equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; - Less than
*&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; - Greater than
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; - Less than or equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; - Greater than or equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; - Numeric Comparison

====String Comparison Operators====

Here is the list of string comparison operators:

*&lt;tt&gt;'''eq'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;'''ne'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Not equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;'''lt'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Less than
*&lt;tt&gt;'''gt'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Greater than
*&lt;tt&gt;'''le'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Less than or equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;'''ge'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Greater than or equal to
*&lt;tt&gt;'''cmp'''&lt;/tt&gt; - String Comparison

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;  ''The two 'Comparison' operators'' &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''and'' &lt;tt&gt;'''cmp'''&lt;/tt&gt; ''are slightly different from the rest.  Rather than returning only true or false, these operators return 1 if the left argument is greater than the right argument, 0 if they are equal, and -1 if the right argument is greater than the left argument.
|}

===Exercises===
*Try writing a program like the Hello World program except elaborate it by storing &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; in a variable and then printing the variable.

*Play around with all the things we have learned so far.  Try to create a program that has an example of everything we have learned so far.

*[[w:Earth]] -- General data
*[[http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html]] -- More general data
The Cambridge Atlas of Astronomy ISBN 0521363608 -- Inspiration for the diagram

== Moon Caption ==
Sorry, don't know how to edit it myself. But the picture of the moon with the caption &quot;The Earth seen from the surface
of the moon&quot; is slighlty in acurate since the picture was taken from the apolo 8 which never touched the surface of the moon.

== How long a day and year is on earth ==

Do we think the kids will know (and care) without definition the difference between solar and sidereal?

And then the precision is lost entirely on how long a year is (saying it is 365 days).  An explanation of leap years might be cool.

:: In conjunction with the article on Venus, where a sidrial day vs. solar day has a significant impact on what can be called a day, this little tidbit of information does indeed have an impact, and the same can be said to a lesser degree about Mercury.  This section could be beefed up a little bit, perhaps, in a follow up article that talks about the relationship between Sidrial time vs. Solar time (Sidrial time is used widely in astronomy to plot positions of objects in the sky, and most good observatories have a sidrial clock next to the telescope for positioning).  Basically, add some content here to explain the significance and value, rather than try to delete it.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:33, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== How old is the Earth? ==

We really want to keep as many controvercial subject out of this Wikibook, especially with intelligent design or talk about the age of the Earth as according to the King James Version of the Bible (or any other religious text for that matter at the moment).  I am a person of faith, and feel that there is a place to discuss and debate these issues, but as an edit war placing a very strong point of view for what should be a children's book is certainly not the place.  If you want to tackle this issue like the mass vs. weight issue has been done, feel free to cover all aspects of this debate, including not only Christian thought, but also Mayan, Egyptian, Vedic, and other ancient or religious ideas on the age of the Universe.  It can be done tactfully and respectfully, but not as a minor section of what is to be a general look of a planet we live on from the viewpoint of merely one of several planets in a vast solar system.  I'm sorry if this may seem harsh or unforgiving to revert text in this nature, but don't place a Christian point of view on this Wikibook, which is against Wikibooks policy as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:21, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

      
:-I must say this view point strikes me as intellectually dishonest. The question: &quot;how old is earth?&quot; is a very common and very valid question. By avoiding it I can't tell if you are trying to protect a particular creationist view point or trying to avoid an arguement with creationists.

:At any rate, the age of the earth should definately be addressed in the book, which according to current scientific understanding is 4.57 billion years. There is no &quot;debate&quot; to be had here, nor is the notion of earth being so old a &quot;very strong point of view&quot;: give or take a few million years, it is a scientific fact. 

:Any attempt to deny or weaken this fact, even by NOT stating it, undermines our understanding of the entire cosmos. I can see no valid reason for not including this section.--[[User:Z00|Z00]] 11:21, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

::Hey, I don't mind answering questions that are many months apart in replies.  I would recommend that you go through this history of this page to see what exactly was posted here, as it was a very POV statement about how scientists were fooling the general public that the earth was billions of years old and citing the Bible as evidence that the earth was much younger, as well as spouting off POV material about creationism science.  That was the debate that I felt was inappropriate to this page, and why I removed it completely.  This page is not to debate creationism but rather to give factual details about the Earth.  Even adding a point about the age of the Earth to the content here is only going to add a single minor detail, for something that perhaps should be expanded into a whole other page entirely.  This page is not appropriate to go into details about why we think the Earth is so ancient, as well as the rest of the Solar System.  Supplimental topics have been added to the [[Wikijunior Solar System]] book going into more controvercial subjects, and perhaps this could be one of them.  Certainly this is not justification to start an edit war.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== The [[Wikijunior Solar System/Earth#How much does the Earth's gravity pull on me?|How much does the Earth's gravity pull on me?]] section ==

As is already present, although perhaps in too sophisticated a style, this section seems to be the place to introduce the notions of gravity and weight ''in lieu of'' [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight|this section]] (or the separate modules [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|here]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|here]]). All pointers in the book to an explanation of gravity or weight could then arrive here. The answers to each planet X's &quot;How much would X pull on me?&quot; section are (understandably) couched in terms of Earth's gravity, i.e. what is said in this section. Comments anyone? &amp;nbsp;[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 07:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

==Cruithne==
Following the link you might learn that it isn't a second moon and it doesn't orbit Earth but the Sun. So it is better to mention it in a different context. [[User:Knightowld|Knightowld]] 21:00, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
:I altered the text to be factually correct, yet still fit with the section. --[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 20:15, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Terrestial Planet ==
Its states that earth is the largest terrestial planet without defining what this is.
[[User:130.95.128.51|130.95.128.51]] 03:37, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:Good point.  Or any object within the orbit of Jupiter, which is often used as a definition of a terrestrial planet.  Mainly a planet that has a comparatively thin atmosphere if you want to give it a non Solar System-centric definition.  i.e. Earth, Venus, and Mars fit this defnition, as perhaps does Titan, but clearly Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune do not.  Mercury and the Earth's Moon are borderline cases under this defintion, and the Asteroids simply don't qualify at all, nor do any of the other moons of the other planets in the Solar System.

:The point I was trying to make is that the Earth is huge, and this is another cool fact:  If you combined all of the mass of all other objects in the inner Solar System, including all of the astroids, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Earth's Moon, and compared it to the Earth after they were all mashed up together, it would still be smaller than the Earth.  How about that?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:13, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

''Sessions'' allow the PHP script to store data on the web server that can be later used, even between requests to different PHP pages. Every session has a different identifier, which is sent to the client's browser as a cookie or as a $_GET variable. Sessions end when the user closes the browser, or when the web server deletes the session information, or when the programmer explicitly destroys the session.
In PHP it's usually called '''PHPSESSID'''. Sessions are very useful to protect the data that the user wouldn't be able to read or write, especially when the PHP developer doesn't want to give out information in the cookies as they are easily readable.
Sessions can be controlled by the $_SESSION superglobal. Data stored in this array is persistent throughout the session. It is a simple array. Sessions are much easier to use than cookies, which helps PHP developers a lot. Mostly, sessions are used for user logins, shopping carts and other additions needed to keep browsing smooth.
PHP script can easily control the session's cookie which is being sent and control the whole session data. Sessions are always stored in a unique filename, either in a temporary folder or in a specific folder, if a script instructs to do so.

==Using Sessions==
At the top of each PHP script that will be part of the current session there must be the function &lt;code&gt;session_start()&lt;/code&gt;. It must be before the first output (echo or others) or it will result in an error &quot;Headers already sent out&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 session_start();
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will do these actions:
#it will check the &lt;code&gt;_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_GET&lt;/code&gt; data, if it is given
#if the session file doesn't exist in the &lt;code&gt;session.save_path&lt;/code&gt; location, it will:
##generate a new Unique Identifier, and
##create a new file based on that Identifier, and
##send a cookie to the client's browser
#if it does exist, the PHP script will attempt to store the file's data into &lt;code&gt;_SESSION&lt;/code&gt; variable for further use

Now, you can simply set variables in 2 different ways, the default method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $_SESSION['example'] = &quot;Test&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
Or the deprecated method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $example=&quot;Test&quot;;
 session_register($example);
&lt;/source&gt;
Both of the above statements will register the session variable &lt;code&gt;$_SESSION['example']&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;Test&quot;. The deprecated method should not be used, it is only listed because you can still see it in scripts written by programmers that don't know the new one. The default method is preferred.

===Session Configuration Options===
PHP sessions are easy to control and can be made even more secure or less secure with small factors. Here are runtime options that can be easily changed using php_ini() function:

{|
| '''Name''' || '''Default''' || '''Changeable'''
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.save_path&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;/tmp&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.name&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;PHPSESSID&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.save_handler&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;files&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.auto_start&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.gc_probability&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.gc_divisor&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;100&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.gc_maxlifetime&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;1440&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.serialize_handler&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;php&quot; &lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.cookie_lifetime&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.cookie_path&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.cookie_domain&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;session.cookie_secure&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;||&lt;code&gt;PHP_INI_ALL&lt;/code&gt;

A simple example of this use would be this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 //Setting The Session Saving path to &quot;sessions&quot;, '''must be protected from reading'''
 session_save_path(&quot;sessions&quot;); // This function is an alternative to ini_set(&quot;session.save_path&quot;,&quot;sessions&quot;);
 //Session Cookie's Lifetime ( not effective, but use! )
 ini_set(&quot;session.cookie_lifetime&quot;,time()+60*60*24*500);
 //Change the Session Name from PHPSESSID to SessionID
 session_name(&quot;SessionID&quot;);
 //Start The session
 session_start();
 //Set a session cookie ( Required for some browsers, as settings that had been done before are not very effective 
 setcookie(session_name(), session_id(), time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
This example simply sets the cookie for the next year.

===Ending a Session===
When user clicks &quot;Logout&quot;, or &quot;Sign Off&quot;, you would usually want to destroy all the login data so nobody could have access to it anymore.
The session file will be simply deleted as well as the cookie to be unset by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 session_destroy();
&lt;/source&gt;

===Using Session Data of Other Types===
Simple data such as integers, strings, and arrays can easily be stored in the $_SESSION superglobal array and be passed from page to page. But problems occur when trying to store the state of an object by assignment. Object state can be stored in a session by using the serialize() function. serialize() will write the objects data into an array which then can be stored in a $_SESSION supergloblal. unserialize() can be used to restore the state of an object before trying to access the object in a page that is part of the current session. If objects are to be used across multiple page accesses during a session, the object definition must be defined before calling unserialize(). Other issues may arise when serializing and unserializing objects.

== Avoiding Session Fixation ==

{{Wikipedia|Session fixation}}Session fixation describes an attack vector in which a malicious third-party sets (i.e. ''fixes'') the session identifier (SID) of a user, and is thus able to access that user's session.  In the base-level implementation of sessions, as described above, this is a very real vulnerability, and every PHP program that uses sessions for anything at all sensitive should take steps to remedy it.  The following, in order of how widely applicable they are, are the measures to take to prevent session fixation:

# Do not use GET or POST variables to store the session ID (under most PHP configurations, a cookie is used to store the SID, and so the programmer doesn't need to do anything to implement this);
# Regenerate the SID on each user request (using &lt;code&gt;[http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php session_regenerate_id()]&lt;/code&gt; at the ''beginning'' of the session);
# Use session time-outs: for each user request, store the current timestamp, and on the next request check that the timeout interval has not passed;
# Provide a logout function;
# Check the 'browser fingerprint' on each request.  This is a hash, stored in a &lt;code&gt;$_SESSION&lt;/code&gt; variable, comprising some combination of the user-agent header, client IP address, a salt value, and/or other information.  See below for more discussion of the details of this; it is thought by some to be nothing more than 'security through obscurity'. &lt;code&gt;[TODO]&lt;/code&gt;
# Check referrer: this does not work for all systems, but if you know that users of your site ''must'' be coming from some known domain you can discard sessions tied to users from elsewhere. It relies on the user agent providing the referrer header, which should not be assumed.

{{Code:Basic
|This example code addresses all of the above points save the referrer check.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$timeout = 3 * 60; // 3 minutes
$fingerprint = md5('SECRET-SALT'.$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
session_start();
if ( (isset($_SESSION['last_active']) &amp;&amp; (time() &gt; ($_SESSION['last_active']+$timeout)))
     || (isset($_SESSION['fingerprint']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['fingerprint']!=$fingerprint)
     || isset($_GET['logout']) ) {
    do_logout();
}
session_regenerate_id(); 
$_SESSION['last_active'] = time();
$_SESSION['fingerprint'] = $fingerprint;
&lt;/source&gt;
|The &lt;code&gt;do_logout()&lt;/code&gt; function destroys the session data and unsets the session cookie.

== Language summary attributes ==

The concept of '''attributes''' is pretty unique to [[Ada Programming|Ada]]. Attributes allow you to get &amp;mdash;and sometimes set&amp;mdash; information about objects or other language entities such as types. A good example is the {{Ada/attribute|Size}} attribute. It describes the size of an object or a type in bits.

 A : Natural := Integer'{{Ada/attribute|Size}}; {{Ada/--|A is now 32 (with the [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] compiler for the x86 architecture)}}

However, unlike the {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} operator from [[C Programming|C]]/[[C++ Programming|C++]] the {{Ada/attribute|Size}} attribute can also be set:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -128 .. 127;  {{Ada/--|The range fits into 8 bits but the}}
                                {{Ada/--|compiler is still free to choose.}}
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Byte'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 8;           {{Ada/--|Now we force the compiler to use 8 bits.}}

Of course not all attributes can be set. An attribute starts with a tick ' and is followed by its name. The compiler determines by context if the tick is the beginning of an attribute, a character literal or a quantified expression.

 A : Character := Character'{{Ada/attribute|Val}} (32) {{Ada/--|A is now a space}}
 B : Character := ' ';               {{Ada/--|B is also a space}}

== List of implementation defined attributes ==

The following attributes are not available in all Ada compilers, only in those that had implemented them. 

Currently, there are only listed the implementation-defined attributes of a few compilers. You can help Wikibooks [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Programming:Ada:Attributes&amp;action=edit adding] specific attributes of other compilers:

== Description ==

[[Ada Programming/Pragmas|Pragmas]] control the compiler, i.e. they are [[w:Compiler directive|compiler directives]]. They have the standard form of

 {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} ''Name'' (''Parameter_List'');

where the parameter list is optional.

== List of language defined pragmas ==

Some pragmas are specially marked:

; Ada&amp;nbsp;2005 : This is a new [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005|Ada&amp;nbsp;2005]] pragma.
; Ada&amp;nbsp;2012 : This is a new [[Ada Programming/Ada 2012|Ada&amp;nbsp;2012]] pragma.
; Obsolescent : This is a deprecated pragma and it should not be used in new code.

== List of implementation defined pragmas ==

The following pragmas are not available in all Ada compilers, only in those that had implemented them.

Currently, there are only listed the implementation-defined pragmas of a few compilers. You can help Wikibooks [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ada_Programming/Pragmas&amp;action=edit adding] specific aspects of other compilers:

; GNAT : [http://www.adacore.com/wp-content/files/auto_update/gnat-unw-docs/html/gnat_rm_2.html Implementation defined pragma] of the [[Ada Programming/GNAT|GNAT]] compiler from AdaCore and FSF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Conworld]] : [[conhistory]]: '''prehistory'''

Contrary to popular belief, the story of humanity does not start at Ancient Egypt.

It seems to be a common pitfall of Conworlders that their first peoples, cultures and nations must start with an ancient, venerable, agricultural empire, and that the rest of their conhistory consists of this empire (and others like it) disseminating their civilization outwards. This is, of course, true to a great extent, but it misses another part of the picture completely.

Perhaps it is best if we put things in perspective. Modern humans have existed for at least 100,000 years, 20 times the length of civilization. For 95,000 years all humans of the world lived as hunter gatherers. And even for the remaining 5,000 years of civilization, vast numbers of human beings continued to live in this way, at least until the dawn of modernity in the last few centuries or so. At the time of the rise of ancient Egypt, the majority of our own ancestors lived outside the influence of civilization.

These people are not simpletons either; remember, they are modern human beings of the ''homo sapiens'' species. Their physical and mental capacities were the same as ours. They led their own complex emotional and social and romantic lives. Millions of human beings just like us lived and died in such societies. Civilization, from Egypt to Hollywood (inclusive), is like a sudden and brilliant blip at the very last part of the human story &amp;mdash; civilization is the great exception of human culture, not the rule.

Of course, the fact that they were, in fact, extremely technologically backwards compared to us or even their contemporaries, gave their lives a very different sort of theme than us. We can see still how their way of life may have been in hunting-gathering peoples like the Khoisan peoples of the Kalahari Desert, in Africa. Of course, keep in mind that we're talking about the ''all human cultures of the entire World for several dozen millennia'', so it's hard to generalize anything.

As a whole, women and children stayed close to home and gathered seeds and fruits; men ventured further away to hunt fast-moving wild animals. (Some people like to connect this to the apparent affinity of men to competitive strategic sports, or women to congregating and gossiping, but we'll leave that for another discussion.) Because people needed to be on the move all the time, they tended not to have so many children (about 4; compare that to 10+ which we commonly see in agricultural societies). People didn't live that long; the average lifespan was about 35 years, though this was probably the result of high infant mortality rates -- if you survive to adulthood, you can live longer than that. Nevertheless they aged very fast, so that a 40-year-old hunter gatherer would look a lot older than a 40-year-old professional urbanite with her face creams and so forth.

The main food source was gathered seeds plus hunted animals. People didn't need to work as long for these (about 30 hours a week), so there was quite some leisure time compared to us. Also, hunting and gathering extracts very little calories per unit area of land, so population density was very low -- less than one person per square kilometer. In general people moved around in small clans across a wide, wild landscape, constantly chasing their prey. There was no overcrowding and they did not come into contact with other clans all that often.   As a result, the exchange of ideas and materials was slow, which goes a great deal to explain why for more than 100,000 years human beings didn't seem to advance all that much in terms of philosophy or technology. (Keep in mind that these human beings are basically genetically identical to us, so &quot;because they were stupid&quot; would not be a good enough explanation.)

All that changed, of course, with the development of agriculture, after the end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve">v 1 The church was characterized by its faith in Jesus as the Messiah, and Jesus promised that through him, as the Son of God, his followers could become sons of God as well. A key element in this is faith in him. The church was filled with the faithful, who were set apart from the faithless in the world. It was a much sharper distinction than today, as the decision to follow Christ was often met with steep opposition and persecution. So those who stayed in the church had to do so through faith, not just a family tradition or feeling of comfort. 

John called the faithful to love one another as brothers in one family, all sons of the same Father. To be a Christian meant to love God, and here John continues insisting that the Christian must also love his brothers in the church.

v 2 Again John insists that to love God is to do what God commands, which includes loving the other Christians. They are not just any person, but sons of God himself, and therefore even more deserving of love. The love of a Christian is tested by how he treats the others. Not even in John’s time was being part of the church any guarantee of how a person lived, he still needed to have his actions tested.

v 3 To love God is to obey his commands. But so this doesn’t seem so much like an unsupportable burden, John reminds us that this is not impossible. It could feel impossible to his audience, having to live a life so different from their surrounding culture in so many details, having higher moral and ethical standards and doing many things the “hard way”. To adults, the idea of “obedience” is usually pretty foreign, and John was aware of this when he asked it of his flock.

v 4 Why was it possible to obey God’s commands? Because his audience was made up of children of God, who used their faith to overcome the world. Being a child of God means getting strength from him to continue growing to be ever more like him. John himself was a victor over the world, and was of the same shared faith as his audience. The battle continued even as he wrote but he said that the victory had already been given, a victory over worldly desires and a worldly lifestyle, a continuing and ongoing victory.

v 5 The key to victory was faith in Jesus as the unique Son of God. If Jesus was the Son of God, then everything that he taught was trustable. That meant that his promise of eternal life for the faithful, and judgement of the disobedient, called everyone’s actions into account on the final day. This would have been a huge motivator for the disciples because it was a double-edged sword – blessing as well as punishment. But on top of that, the deep love shown by Jesus’ willing self-sacrifice as God’s Son gave a deep emotional push to the Christians’ relationship with their maker and their obedience to him. 

v 6 Water and blood: symbols of Jesus’ baptism and death, or death and life through the spirit. Blood and water came out of Jesus’ side when he was pierced on the cross (Jn 19:34). The Spirit is a witness: not the flesh. The Christians lived by a new set of rules that were very different than those of the world around them, and the other people did not understand the symbols of water or blood as did those of the Spirit. But, the Spirit is truth, even though the truth is contrary to much of common wisdom. (Help me on this verse!)

v 7 This verse was apparently added later on and was probably not in the original letter John wrote. “There are three witnesses in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. And three are the witnesses on the earth, (the Spirit, the water and the blood). Only four late Greek manuscripts have the verse, recorded from the fourteenth century to the present. 

v 7-8 John was a witness, and called upon other witnesses to support what he had seen: the Spirit, the water and the blood. The irony of the life in the Spirit and the water is that it came only through the death symbolized by the blood. Just as Christ died, he calls his followers to die to their old life through baptism and to begin a new life through the Spirit in communion with his blood. 

v 9 Testimony about Jesus came from the men and women who were with him, but also through God himself, who asserted that Jesus was his son. That testimony came from God to man through the Spirit and the changed lives of those who followed Jesus. (Jn 1:32-34, 8:47, Lk 3:21-22, 9:35) The testimony was also understood individually by the people who responded to the Christians’ message and converted to faith in Christ. 

v 10 In becoming a Christian, a person came to believe in God and Jesus as his son, and changed his heart dramatically in response to the love shown by God’s willing sacrifice of his son and Jesus’ willingness to submit for the benefit of others. This faith and change of attitude were the testimony of the heart of a Christian. On the other hand, those who did not believe in God, and consequently in Jesus, his Son, were denying what God said about Jesus. This made God out to be a liar, (v 1:10) and was a grave error on the part of the unbeliever. Each believer and every person should mind what God says and not try to oppose him (parable of the warring kings). 

v 11 Explanation of God’s testimony: eternal life through his Son. God gives it to his children, the Christians, (Jn 1:12-13) and does so solely through Jesus (Jn 14:6). 

v 12 To have the son of God is to have an intimate relationship with him, that is, to be one of Christ’s disciples. Life is eternal life forever with God in heaven, as well as meaning, purpose and joy in the Spirit even amidst suffering in life here on the earth. These are privileges of Christians only, not enjoyed by those who do not know God.

[[Image:Bdna.gif|thumb|The DNA helix]]

[[Wikipedia:DNA|DNA]] stands for [[Wikipedia:deoxyribose|deoxyribose]] [[Wikipedia:nucleic acid|nucleic acid]], or deoxyribonucleic acid.

Its structure was discovered by [[Wikipedia:James D. Watson|James D. Watson]] and [[Wikipedia:Francis Crick|Francis H.C. Crick]] in 1953 with the assistance of [[Wikipedia:Rosalind Franklin|Rosalind Franklin]], but the knowledge of DNA was first discovered in 1871.

The DNA [[Wikipedia:molecule|molecule]] has a [[Wikipedia:polymer|polymer]] [[Wikipedia:backbone chain|backbone]] of deoxyribose molecules ([[Wikipedia:ribose|Ribose]] in [[Wikipedia:RNA|RNA]]), a [[Wikipedia:deoxy sugar|five carbon sugar]], connected together by a [[Wikipedia:phosphate group|phosphate group]] (see [[Wikipedia:phosphorylation|phosphorylation]]).

The sugar also connects to a [[Wikipedia:nucelobase|nucleobase]] (or simply called &quot;base&quot;, for short). There are 5 different bases used for [[Wikipedia:coding region|coding]], 4 of which are used in DNA (the other, [[Wikipedia:uracil|uracil]], is exclusive to RNA).

The four bases are [[Wikipedia:adenine|adenine]], [[Wikipedia:guanine|guanine]], [[Wikipedia:cytosine|cytosine]] and [[Wikipedia:thymine|thymine]]. These are represented by the letters A, G, C, &amp; T and carry all information found in the DNA (see [[Wikipedia:nucleic acid nomenclature|nucleic acid nomenclature]]).

The structure of DNA is a [[Wikipedia:double helix|double helix]]. This means that there are two strands coiled around each other. The molecule is bonded together by the bases with [[Wikipedia:hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]]. Guanine pairs with Cytosine by three hydrogen bonds while Adenine bonds with Thymine by two hydrogen bonds (see [[Wikipedia:base pair|base pair]]).

Watson and Crick's insight into the double helical structure of the DNA molecule was based upon [[Wikipedia:Erwin Chargaff|Erwin Chargaff]] noting that these pairs of bases were always in the same concentration.

== wow ==

after my lectures and my textbooks, this has been one of the most useful explanations. [[User:141.213.66.46|141.213.66.46]] 21:59, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Mistake? ==

In the example 

&lt;math&gt;P=\left(\begin{matrix}-1&amp;1\\4&amp;1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;P^{-1}=1/5\left(\begin{matrix}1&amp;-4\\-1&amp;-1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

but I think &lt;math&gt;P^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; should be

&lt;math&gt;P^{-1}=\frac{1}{5}\left(\begin{matrix}-1&amp;1\\4&amp;1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hi Silencer.  You are right, the article is wrong.

== Lambdas replaced in last example ==

The last (vector ODE) example concluded that solutions to the equation would require that lambda be an eigenvalue of the matrix, but the rest of the example continues to use lambda.  I just replaced the lambda with its specific values (4 and 2) in the rest of the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The LSAT is Learnable ==
The first thing to understand about the LSAT is that you ''can'' prepare for it by honing the mental skills required by the exam as well as becoming familiar with the format of the test.  Many people think that since it is an aptitude test, it is largely a matter of innate ability.  Granted, some innate ability is necessary to get a perfect score on the LSAT, but many with sufficient ability will get lower scores because they do not prepare effectively.

This is not to say that learning the LSAT is easy. However, with sufficient time and effort, most students are able to learn the skills necessary to significantly increase their LSAT score.

== Attack the Analytical Section First ==
'''Note: the analytical section has become significantly easier since the writing of the instructions below. It is no longer nearly as highly timed, i.e., there tend to be fewer problems than there were five years ago.'''

Basically, you should understand that if you attack the analytical section in your preparation, then the logical reasoning section should follow easily. The reading comprehension section will come to you easily as well, so long as you are a fast reader.  If you are a slow reader (as I was a few years ago), then you will need to do some deliberate practice in your reading in order to improve.  

In order to beat the analytical section, you need to see the differences between the types of questions that occur repeatedly.  Some of the questions involve ordering, others involve pigeonholing, others both of these at once.  Usually, expressing the rule system in a diagram is essential to solving the problem quickly.  A pigeonholing problem usually implies a grid diagram, with a spot for each possible assignment of variables.  Ordering usually involves a 1 by X grid, with the ordering rules expressed (in shorthand) alongside the grid.  In a hybrid game, you will have the X by Y grid along with ordering rules expressed in shorthand. 

If you immediately see some further implications of a rule set, then you should express them immediately in shorthand along with the given rules.  For instance, if the rules say:
  John always must go before Sarah
  Sarah must go with Martin
  Ralph goes after Martin
then you should write out that John must go before Ralph in some form of shorthand.  This example is very simple, but the LSAT questions will often give you something more complex which results in some implications that are key to solving the problem set quickly. The reason you should take a moment to write out these implications is that you will solve five or six problems, not just one, under these rules.  You want to work out the intricacies just once, write them down, and then refer to your shorthand as you proceed.

Because the analytical section is highly timed, if you see an answer that appears absolutely correct before you've read all alternatives, I recommend you just circle it and move on.  Often, if this is not the last problem in the section, you will recognize any possibility of error later, as you work out the other problems.  It generally seems that the harder questions come toward the end of the section.

== Analytical Section Game Types ==
The game section consists of several different types of games.  The linear, grouping and linear/grouping hybrid games are by far the most common.  By one analysis, they make up 75% of all the released LSAT games.  You must master these two types thoroughly because they are going to appear on your test for certain.

===Linear===
Also, known as ranking, the game asks you to arrange different elements in a certain order.  Here, the order is important.  Let's look at one example.&lt;br&gt;
'''Simple Linear Game'''&lt;br&gt;
During Wikimania 2007 conference, the seven participants, Albert, Bart, Ciara, Don, Ellen, Fred and Greg signed the guestbook consecutively.&lt;br&gt;

Albert signed the guestbook before Greg.&lt;br&gt;
Greg signed neither first nor last.&lt;br&gt;
Ciara signed either before or after Bart.&lt;br&gt;
Fred signed second.&lt;br&gt;

===Grouping===
Unlike the linear (ranking) games, grouping games do not specify the order of the elements.  In these games, how the elements are paired is what matters. 

 
== General Method of Preparation ==
You may or may not wish to buy a &quot;Study Guide&quot; book.  I've recommended Master the LSAT for that purpose.  But what is '''essential''' is that you obtain some of the official PrepTests.  If you have thirty days to prepare, buy at least twenty PrepTests, and start working on them immediately. 

At first, you must work '''untimed'''.  The time factor would otherwise distract you from your ability to understand and solve the problems.  You must also keep records of which problems you missed, and keep them with the idea that you will be reviewing these particular problems very intensely toward the end of your preparation.  You will be looking for patterns in the problems you missed throughout all your tests.  Granted, the questions you miss early on will be less relevant than the ones you still miss toward the end of your preparation. 

You can get one official PrepTest for free from the LSAT website.  You may wish to take this first test under simulated test conditions, just for the sake of gauging how much improvement you make over the study phase.  In any case, you want to answer all the questions and see how many you got right (timed or not).  

At first, instant feedback on a problem is better than feedback on the whole section after you've completed it.  You don't want to go on solving more problems if you're unsure whether you understood, for example, #1.  In this case just make sure you have the solutions to #2 and later covered up (credit card works nicely), then check the solution to #1 and move on (if you got it right).  If you got it wrong, classify your mistake, (don't get too upset about it), and move on to #2.  When you've finished the section in this manner, give an honest assessment of how many you missed, and then give an accurate assessment of why you missed each problem.  You should find a surprising number of '''misread''' mistakes.  Generally, this problem is corrected as you take more PrepTests, and get better at noticing when a problem says, for example, &quot;all of these are true EXCEPT,&quot; versus &quot;all of these are true:&quot;.

Other types of mistakes may reflect genuine misunderstanding, or a rift between your thinking and that of the test-makers.  In the end, in my opinion, what makes LSAT questions answerable is that the test-makers picked an answer.  It has nothing to do with actual '''truth''' (except in AR).  They generally follow rules of logic, but in the end some questions are misphrased.  Fortunately, you can learn enough about the test writers, through taking their official tests, that you can distinguish between their traps and their solutions. 

If your mistakes were due to genuine misunderstanding, then you need to review the basics.  For instance, in Logical Reasoning, you '''must''' understand the rules of logic impeccably. The same is true for Reading Comprehension and Analytical Reasoning, but these two have other issues surrounding just the application of logic, (reading quickly and diagramming, respectively).

At least have your problems classified before you attempt another test.  At best, go and remediate any major problems before attempting another.  But eventually, do move on to another exam.  For the second and third test it is still okay to be taking them untimed.  By the fourth test, you should definitely be able to take the Logical Reasoning section under a timer and complete it.  The Reading Comprehension will either be right with your Logical Reasoning or behind it.  

Every aspect of the test is improvable. And every aspect of the test evaluates your ability to make logical deductions and (in the case of Logical reasoning) figure out logical flaws. Contrary to popular opinion, the Reading Comprehension section is most definitely improvable. It is a question of figuring out the way the different points were explicated and proven to you through the passage. It's like reading one big (and slightly less challenging) Logical Reasoning passage. If you do enough of these, you will eventually max this section out.

Another misconception is the hardness of the Analytical Reasoning. It is by far the section you can improve the fastest on. All it requires is several months of diligent games practice and understanding how certain groups of games are similar to others and how they connect with respect to deductions.

==Understanding the Basics of Logical Reasoning==
If you want to get a score higher than 160, then you have to have a basic understanding of logical reasoning. An argument contains premises and conclusions. Think of premises as the evidence upon which the conclusion is made. The conclusion is the specific point that you are trying to make. For example, take the simple argument: Jenny must not like apples, because I've never seen her eat one. The premise: I've never seen her eat one, and the conclusion: Jenny must not like apples. 

Another part of an argument are assumptions. Assumptions are simply unstated premises. They have to be true in order for the conclusion to be true. Think of an argument as a table. The legs of the table would be the premises and assumptions and the table top would be the conclusion. The conclusion rests upon the premises. This is true of all simple arguments.

Finding the conclusion in each stimulus is important. Most of the questions on the Logical Reasoning will have some effect on the conclusion. On the LSAT, some questions will contain conclusion indicators. Not all questions in the Logical Reasoning section will have conclusion indicators, especially Main Point questions. There are also premise indicators. Make sure to memorize the following lists.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Premise Indicators !! Conclusion Indicators
|-
| because || thus
|-
| since || therefore
|-
| for || hence
|-
| for example || consequently

|-
| owning to || shows that
|-
| this can be seen from || conclude that
|-
| We know this by || follows that
|-
|  || for this reason
|-
|}

==On Test Day==
There is a lot of basic and very true test advice out there.  Don't drink alcohol in the days leading up to the LSAT.  Get a good night's rest.  Eat a healthful breakfast.  Drink a little coffee if you need to. Don't drink too much coffee.  Bring a snack to keep the brain active. Common sense stuff, but it counts. 

Digital devices are not allowed, but analog watches can be used. The best way to use a watch is to adjust the minute hand and point it at the 12. When it reaches the 7, your time should be up.

On the LSAT, you can cancel your score before you hand in the test if something went wrong. They also allow you to cancel your score by mail.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancel&quot;&gt;http://www.lsac.org/jd/lsat/lsat-cancellation.asp&lt;/ref&gt; If you finish taking the exam and do not feel comfortable with your performance, it is recommended that you take a day or two to sleep on your cancellation decision rather than canceling your score before you hand in the exam and regretting the decision later. If you ultimately decide to cancel your score my mail, ensure that you send your cancellation request via overnight mail, and retain documentation of the correspondence and tracking information. 

&quot;''LSAC recommends that you keep proof that your score cancellation request was received by LSAC by the six-calendar-day deadline, as well as a photocopy of your score cancellation request. If you cancel your score, you will not receive a score or copy of your answer sheet. You will receive written notification of a score cancellation and, if you took a disclosed test, you will receive a copy of the test questions and the credited responses for the scored sections as well. Law school reports will reflect that your score was canceled at your request; this advises the law schools that you were exposed to test questions. There are no refunds for canceled scores. Valid score cancellation requests are irreversible and cannot be rescinded.''&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cancel&quot;&gt;http://www.lsac.org/jd/lsat/lsat-cancellation.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, know that you will be taking an extra, experimental section on test day, which is ungraded. However, they will not tell you which section is experimental, so it is imperative that you take each section seriously.  The experimental section is used to try out new questions for use on future exams.  The additional time required to complete the 4 graded sections of the LSAT along with an additional experimental section and writing sample can be exhausting for unprepared test-takers. Consider occasionally adding a 5th section to your LSAT prep tests to simulate the experimental section and build up your stamina for test day.

*Comets are often described as giant &quot;dirty snowballs&quot; because they are mostly made up of ice and some dirt.
*Comets have two &quot;tails&quot;, one made up mostly of rocks and dust, the other mostly made of gas.
*Comet tails always point ''away'' from the [[../The Sun|Sun]].

== What is a Comet? ==
[[File:Comet Hale Bopp NASA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Hale Bopp comet]]
Think of a comet as a big, dirty, gassy snowball. Comets are formed in the ring of rocks, dust, and ice that orbits the [[../The Sun|Sun]] beyond [[../Pluto|Pluto]] called the [[../Kuiper Belt|Kuiper Belt]]. Comets form when rocks, dust, and ice &lt;i&gt;condense&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; that is, join together&lt;!--due to [[../About weight and gravity#Gravity|gravity]]--&gt;. As a comet grows larger,&lt;!--gravity starts to pull it more and more--&gt; it starts to be pulled towards and around the Sun. Comets in our Solar System usually take many years to go around the Sun &amp;ndash; from a few dozen years to many thousands of years. This is because they start to orbit the sun from very far away. They make long, egg-shaped orbits&lt;!--[[../About weight and gravity#Orbits and weightlessness|orbits]]--&gt; around the Sun instead of almost circular ones like the planets. &lt;!--Please review sources!--&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== What does a Comet look like? ==
{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}
The comets that can be seen in the sky without telescopes are unusual because they are the biggest and brightest comets of all. You might have the chance to see one once or twice during your life. Most comets can only be seen with a telescope. The few that can be seen with human eyes are usually just hazy streaks or faint smudges in the night sky.

When comets are very far away from the Sun, they are covered in a coating of icy, black rocks and dust. As a comet approaches the Sun, however, the ice starts to melt. This creates large amounts of water and gas that break through the coating, freeing some of the dust and rocks. Sometimes this water, gas, rocks, and dust can be seen from the Earth as one or two tails streaming away from the comet. Even when only one tail can be seen, there are two, one made from the lighter gas and water, and the other from the rocks, dust, and chunks of ice.

Comets themselves are usually between a few kilometres and several hundred kilometres in size, but their tails can be several million kilometres long.

== Seeing Comets in the Sky ==
The &quot;great comets&quot; that produce particularly spectacular tails are some of the rarest objects in our solar system. Usually they can only be seen about once every hundred years, so it is very rare to see one of these comets. The last great comet appeared in 1910, but it may still be another hundred years before another one comes near the Earth. Astronomers can't predict exactly how or when they will appear as there are still things about our Solar System that they don't understand. If you hear about a comet coming into the sky soon, follow the instructions below to watch it!

# Find out if the comet is going to be in your area of the sky.
# Get a telescope or binoculars and some chairs to view it.  Many of the largest comets have never even needed a telescope to see them.
# Ask your parents to take you to a park, the woods or another dark place away from city lights.
# Look up into the sky and enjoy this amazing sight.

Usually the dust making up the comet's tail is so faint you can't see it. However, when the Earth's orbit takes it through one of these tails, the dust hits the Earth's atmosphere and burns up. 
&lt;!--Copyedited to here, 24 February 2006--&gt;
These are the recurring '''meteor showers''' that happen from time to time, and most major meteor showers have now been identified either with an existing comet or the remains of a comet that was observed earlier, usually in previous centuries.  When the Earth travels through this &quot;swarm&quot; of dust left behind, you can see '''shooting stars''' or '''meteors''' at night.

==How many Comets are there?==
No one really knows.
All comets spend most of their orbit so far away from the sun that they can't be seen -- even with a telescope.
However, every year amateur astronomers[http://home.earthlink.net/~tonyhoffman/cometfornewyork.htm] discover over 100 never-seen-before comets that have come close enough to be discovered[http://comethunter.de/].
As of November 2005, astronomers have discovered 2 857 comets&lt;!--
comets, short period:  372 (orbital periods less than 200 years)
comets, long-period: 2,485 (orbital periods over 200 years)
total:               2,857
--&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/sslist.html].
Most of the comets we see either crash into the Sun, or leave the Solar System entirely.
There might be millions of these comets that sooner or later will come within range of our telescopes.

Of all the comets that have ever been seen,
astronomers only expect 253 comets to ever return&lt;!--
168 &quot;Observed More Than Once&quot;, + 85 &quot;Still Awaiting First Return Since Discovery&quot;
--&gt;[http://cometography.com/periodic_comets.html].

== How is a Comet named? ==
[[Image:Edmond_Halley.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Edmond Halley]]
A comet is usually named after the astronomer who first discovered it.  When several people are involved in its discovery, sometimes you will see multiple names on a comet, like Comet Hale-Bopp, or Comet Shoemaker-Levy.  It is generally considered to be a great honor to have a comet named after you.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

== What are some famous Comets in history? ==
[[Image:Halley's comet orbit.PNG|right|frame|This diagram shows the orbit of Halley's comet around the Sun. There are a few things to note about this orbit.&lt;br&gt;
*It is much more elongated than a planet's orbit.&lt;br&gt;
*It is not in the same plane as the planets.&lt;br&gt;
*It goes round its orbit in the opposite direction. This is called retrograde motion.&lt;br&gt;]]

*Halley's Comet - Perhaps the most famous of all comets, and this was the first comet to be identified as a recurring comet.
*Comet Encke - The second comet to be identified as a recurring comet.
*Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 - This was the first comet to have been observed hitting another body in the Solar System.  In this case, it smashed into the planet Jupiter in what was possibly  the most studied astronomical event in history.

== Do comets bring bad luck? ==
In ancient times people didn't have a very good understanding of what comets really were or where they came from.  They were seen as very unusual objects in the sky, and very temporary in nature as well.  In some societies it was often a sign of bad events in the future when a comet arrived, associated with the death of a king or a significant military defeat.  In other countries comets were considered to bring good luck, bringing increased fertility and more food.  The ancient Chinese astronomers seem to have done the best job of actually recording when comets appeared in the sky, and left detailed descriptions of what they looked like and approximately where in the sky each comet was seen.  

Even as recently as the 1910 appearance of Halley's Comet there was widespread panic when it was discovered that the Earth might pass through the tail of that comet.  The panic was over the possibility of gases from the comet flooding the atmosphere of the Earth with poison.  The reality was that there is so little gas in a comet tail that there is no measurable effect in the content of the Earth's atmosphere when an event like this occurs.

sorry about the cold -- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 04:37, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Haha, dude, *you* said to &quot;edit my pages to make them look more proper&quot;. So I did :). I filled in the kana teaching pages with basic groundwork, image names, sounds, one or two actual mnemonics. For the image names I used a Japanese romanization for easier naming. Henche sa, si, su, se, so and ta, ti, tu, te, to. I may not have access to a computer for the weekend, but I'll see if I can fill in some of the examples next week , and dream up some more mnemonics. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:27, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Ah I see what caused the confusion. [[User:%E9%BC%A0|Nezumi]] wrote that comment about having a bad cold but didn't add signature. GoodStuff, please don't tamper with user comments on discussion tabs (spelling, grammar of user's comment isn't important to edit). This is why I thought it was your post. Now I had to add the signatures for both Nezumi and Antimobius to avoid confusion about who wrote them.

The comment I made on your page before you blanked it, about everyone working towards the same goal. I still believe that. I had planned to name the images SI, TI, TU, HU so we think the same. Thanks for adding the sounds, mnemonics. It's a good idea. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 15:05, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

My most humble apologies. From now on, badly speelled user comments are sacred :) It looks like we are making visible progress at last. I'm grateful for that. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:53, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Main page layout change==

I have to say I dislike this layout.  Yes the old one made the yellow column squashed, so I think maybe the ratio should be adjusted, but the new version is not as aesthetically appealing as the old version.  Also, it hids the important information in the yellow column, which makes the blue column sometimes difficult to understand by new users.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:12, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:You're right. Done. :-) -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]]

== [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] ==

May I know why you hastily moved the page without reading the earlier history of that page &amp; [[Programming:C plus plus]]? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 11:51, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:There are already enough forks of the work. Please don't add more. See [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#My &quot;textbook-l&quot; Post]]. Thanks! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 11:53, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I meant that the history of why that page exists is referred to by [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] which is referred to by [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]]. So unless the disputes are settled it is best not to move the page. Sorry if I sounded rude. Thanks for your cooperation. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 11:58, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:BTW you could add your comments to the lounge on this issue. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 11:58, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
Yeah of course I meant to say &quot;page/group of pages&quot; instead of just &quot;page&quot;. I'm in favour of multiple-pages. But when talking about forks I tend to call the group of pages a page. I hope I haven't made this mistake in many places, or people might think I'm in favour of single page! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:32, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:i.e. I meant merge into a single page/group of pages. Er... wait a minute. I was talking about merging of the talk pages, not the article. And the talk page could even be a single page. It could've remained a single page, but Panic added some redundancy which caused the talk page to bloat. Now it makes sense to have subpages for the talk too. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:36, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've given up. I'm afraid people may take this too personal if I continue the &quot;crusade&quot; against forkers. If the community wants to avoid forks, it better nip it in the bud. Else if the community suffers later with forks, it's its (i.e. the community's) choice. I've given enough opportunities for everyone to respond, but the fork still stays. I also have better things to do than trying to organise things without the support of others. I'll do something now &amp; then, but I've decided to stop all futile efforts in educating forkers.

Actually I know one (albeit unethical) way one can make everyone aware of the issue. Rather than opposing something detrimental to the community, support &amp; expand on it. Fork random versions of random pages, esp. those not in the main namespace. Then it spreads faster than it would've &amp; the community notices &amp; takes action. I've concluded that there's no other way out. Which is why I've quit this activity.

BTW Thanks for your cooperation. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 13:08, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:BTW this also means that the lies in [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]], e.g. that I didn't advance a particular idea any further, would prevail. Similarly any opposition to someone's statement in [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]], which weren't forked into [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]] wouldn't be visible to the readers of [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]] and vice versa. This may lead to some &quot;proposals&quot; being branded as &quot;adopted&quot; and some as &quot;dead&quot; irrespective of whether any proper discussion took place. One side would be giving their views in page A &amp; the other side in page B. So nobody would easily come to know of the entire conversation. Some would think there is consensus on page A, and one would think there is consensus on page B.

:Or whatever, forget that rant. Only one question: do what you feel like about [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Programming:_C_-/-_-/-&amp;diff=69397&amp;oldid=69393]. If I try to do anything about that, it'll only get reverted. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 13:54, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Sigs ==

Hi.  I noticed that your signature is looking a little funny.  1.4 changed the way signatures are rendered, so if you want to fix it, you can go to [[Special:Preferences]], and tick &quot;Raw signatures (without automatic link)&quot; under the first section. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 05:03, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Bookshelf templates ==

Hi Mnk! I like your work on the bookshelf templates (div float on the right). Looks nicer now. If you have some time and you like the idea, join us to review some books and give new [[Help:Development stages|development stages]], including date (see there). This is to increase the overall appearance and standard of Wikibooks. I started a little bit on the [[IT bookshelf]] and [[Science bookshelf]]. No need to hurry, and a few book reviews would be enough to get something started. Thanks, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 11:18, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook:Bacon Cheese Omelet]] ==

Please take a look at [[Cookbook:Bacon Cheese Omelet]]. I'm guessing (well, hoping) that you
know wikitext well enough to fix the image alignment problems properly, hopefully without huge
amounts of obscure code.

Desired result:

*Both the ingredient list and tool list are actual lists. (like this one)
*The images are lined up with the lists, not flowing randomly.
*There is no need to crudely guess at some number of semi-blank lines to do this.

== [[Cookbook:Corn]] header ==

I've been trying to standardize the headers, and you just switched one back.

We have irregular use of |&gt;- and more, with and without lines, occasionally in small print. The | symbol is most common, looks relatively attractive, and matches what the wiki engine uses for categories at the bottom of the page. (a bullet might look better, but that's getting complicated)

== Hiragana on wikicommon ==

hello, 
I'm french (so sorry for the english ;-), We are trying to write the japanese wikibook in french, so we use your drawing of hiragana et probably the katakana.. the problem is : I can't use (or I don't know how) link from wikibook english -&gt; wikibook french so i decide to transfert the picture on wikicommon, But i forgot to ask you..
I feel sorry, next time I will ask you before. I modify a little bit the picture, separate ka and ga. because we dont use the same order in the lesson.

Hello, Mkn. I am not sure if you are still around, but if you read this, you should know that some Wikibooks users want to delete [[Japanese:Videogame]] and subpages. Unfortunately, we forgot to put a notice about the proposed deletion on the [[Japanese:Videogame]] page, but as of 21 October I have added one. I am supporting the deletion because I think that [[Japanese:Videogame]] will grow into a huge collection of videogame transcripts and translations, which are copyrighted without a [[GFDL]] license.

According to my records, you have uploaded atleast 85 images to this project that are not properly licensed. We are going to be mass deleting all unlicensed images from wikibooks in the next month, because they pose a significant legal threat to our project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zen Buddhism states that in order to live a happy life, one needs to be free from unimportant desires, and focus more on 'important' aspects of life, such as nature, children, etc. '''Thich Nhat Hanh''',  a highly respected Zen Buddhist monk, noted that in order to be truly happy, one needs to have the ability to derive pleasure from any experience.  An example he gave involved appreciating a toothache.  He stated that &quot;Suffering from your toothache you get enlightened: you say: &quot;It’s wonderful not to have a toothache.&quot; So, how to enjoy your non-toothache? Just remember the time when you had a toothache. Suffering plays a very important role in helping you to be happy. That is why even what you call suffering, loneliness, meaninglessness, sadness, fear and despair can be wonderful, because it is thanks to them that you have an opportunity to discover what freedom, stability, friendship, interbeing and love are.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;

Thich Nhat Hanh also taught that one should be happy with what they have, and appreciate their well-being in order to ever achieve true happiness.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lyellin. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lyellin~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Complex analysis looks interesting however I would like to know more.  What about complex integration?

== Structure ==

*I've gone ahead and started a restructuring of the book, with the goal of eventually expanding it to the level of coverage common to an introductory level Complex Analysis class (ie, at least through integration). The outline I'm planning on is more or less the following
Ch.1, Complex Numbers
 1.1 Definitions
  1.1.1 Geometric
  1.1.2 Matrix
  1.1.3 Traditional (i=sqrt(-1))
  1.1.4 Relation between them
 1.2 Complex Number Field
 1.3 Polar and Exponential Forms
 1.4 Roots
Ch.2, Complex Functions
 2.1 Polynomials
 2.2 Exponential
 2.3 Logarithm
 2.4 Trig Functions
 2.5 Riemann Surfaces
 2.6 Branches
Ch.3, Topology of the Complex Plane
 3.1 Regions (Open/Closed Sets, Un/Bound, etc)
 3.2 Limits
 3.3 Continuity
 3.4 Sequences
 3.5 Series
Ch.4, Analytic Functions and Power Series
 4.1 Analytic Functions
 4.2 Cauchy-Riemann Equations
 4.3 Harmonic Functions (maybe... nice connect to analytic though)
 4.4 Taylor's Theorem
 4.5 Uniqueness of Power Series and Radius of Convergence
 4.6 Mermomorphic and Entire Functions
 4.7 Analytic Continuation
Ch.5 Integration
 5.1 Contour Integration and Cauchy's Integral Formula
 5.2 Classification of Isolated Singularities
 5.3 Winding Number and Residue
 5.4 Laurent Series
 5.5 Improper Integrals and Cauchy's Residue Theorem
Ch.6 Advanced Topics (maybe)
 6.1 Infinite Products and Functions of Finite Order
 6.2 The Possion Summation
 6.3 Arithematic Functions and Dirichlet Series
 6.5 Conformal Mappings
 6.6 Fixed Points of a Fractional Linear Transformation
 6.7 The Riemann Mapping Theorem
 6.8 Weierstrass's Theorem
 6.9 Mellin Transormation
 6.10 Elliptic Functions and Liouville Theorem
 6.11 The Gamma, Sigma and Zeta Functions
 6.12 The Riemann-von Mangoldt Formula
 6.13 The Lindelof Hypothesis
 6.14 Stirling's Formula
 6.15 The Prime Number Theorem

So, who has any comments, suggestions, or complaints?
--[[User:Notanut|Notanut]] 13:39, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

*Actually, looking that outline over again, it seems to me that there need to be a section 2.0 on Complex Functions in general before going into special functions - it may even be desirable to break the chapter in two, one on general Complex Functions (things like mappings from '''C''' to '''C''', branchs/Riemann Surfaces, and general properties (with a few specific examples)) and a Chapter on Special Functions (basically 2.1 to 2.4 now).
--[[User:Notanut|Notanut]] 02:29, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: ''Do not duplicate content''. We already ''have'' a text on complex numbers! Now content in [[Calculus:Complex_analysis/Complex_Numbers]] not in [[Algebra/Complex Numbers]] will have to be merged. (I've done so. 08:15, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC))
: Now, with your outline, that may be usable, but it's best to add content in a structured manner rather than add the structure and then work around it. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:46, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Sorry about the duplication, I'm used to hardcover Complex Analysis books where an opening chapter on complex numbers is basically manditory. That said, the proofs of Euler's formuala and some of the more abstract ideas like the complex numbers as a field are really too advanced to put in a high school level introduction to complex numbers.
::Ok, never mind the high school comment - I confused the HSE Complex Numbers article with the plain Complex Numbers article.
::I'm sure you're right about the outline, but I just have a much easier time when I'm doing technical writing when I actually have an overall plan. Obviously there a pretty much a null chance the book would actually come out looking like the outline, I just like having one. --[[User:Notanut|Notanut]] 20:32, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)



Perhaps I (I'm a physicist) learned complex analyses in a different way than most mathematicians, but I suggest to move the integration stuff forward. After you derive Cauchy's integral formula for complex differentiable functions you can easily show that if you can differentiate a function once, you can differentiate it twice, so the function is infinitely often differentiable. Also you can show that the Taylor series will converge to the function.

Then you need to introduce the principle of analytical continuation. This can be used to introduce complex analytical functions such as
Exp[z] etc.


Then you can proceed with all the usual stuff such as the Maximum Modulus theorem, Residue theorem for meromorphic functions etc. It would be nice to revisit expansion into partial fraction everyone knows from high school analyses using complex analyses.

Then some examples of calculation of integrals using the residue theorem. Also integration of functions with branch point singularity (e.g. by using analytical continuation of function accross the branch cut).

: I wholeheartedly agree. Holomorphicity and the Cauchy Integral Formula should be introduced as early in the text as possible. Without them, there's not much to say about power series, analytic functions, meromorphic functions, singularities, or analytic continuation beyond the definitions. --[[User:Danvk|Danvk]] 18:58, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

== Added some integration material ==

I've gone ahead and added some material and examples relating to complex integration and Cauchy's theorem/integral formula. No proofs yet, but the examples are fairly complete.

Also, I'm new to wikibooks, and I'm a little turned off by the fact that only about one in five of my edits actually gets saved. The rest of the time it says I've &quot;lost session data&quot; and need to try again later. Any idea what's going on? I'm using Firefox on Windows, so this probably isn't a browser issue... --[[User:Danvk|Danvk]] 23:08, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Hi Danvk, nice edits! About equality of functions (analytic continuation), I think it is enough to demand that f and g are equal on a sequence of points with a limit point in the region. The proof consists of constructing the power series about that limit point, which then turns out to be the same for both functions. Let's see if this comment gets saved :) [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 23:24, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::: After having the same thing happen to me on en.wikipedia.org, I figured out that it was actually a firefox extension issue. I removed the extension, and have had no problems since. You're correct -- there only needs to be a sequence of points that converges, but I've never seen a non-contrived example where the disc condition wasn't sufficient. I think saying that equal on a disc implies equal everywhere in the region of mutual holomorphicity makes it much more intuitive why this is a remarkable fact. --[[User:Danvk|Danvk]] 18:49, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

:::: The sequence of points is useful to show that analytical continuations of real functions are unique. If you have some real function f(x) and if you have two analytical functions g(z) and h(z) that are continuations of f(x) then g and h must be the same function. 

:::: Also, in theoretical physics you sometimes encounter analytical continuations of functions defined on the integers, e.g. d-dimensional integrals being continued to arbitrary d. But this isn't unique unless you make some assumptions about the asymptotic bahavior.[[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 23:00, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gregor Johann Mendel was a monk in the Augustinian Monastery in the Brunn, Czech Republic. In 1854 he began the experiments which started modern genetics.
His work with garden peas, '' Pisum sativum'', was vital to our understanding of inheritance.
He is known as the Father Of Genetics.

===Mendel's Experiment===
Mendel's first step was breeding pure breeding strains of peas. 
The traits he studied included:
* Pea colour
* Height of pea plants
* and whether the Peas were wrinkled or smooth.

Mendel crossed the pure breeding Parental Generation (designated P).
He found that the first generation (F1) was exclusively phenotypically one of the parental types.
Mendel then crossed his F1 generation with itself.
He found that the F2 generation showed a surprising trait, three quarters were like the F1 generation, while the remaining quarter were like the other Parents.

From this Mendel realised that there were two versions of each loci, one of which expressed [[../Dominant and Recessive Genes|dominance]] over the other. He called this Biparticulate Inheritance.
If a gene was following this 3:1 pattern it was said to be segregating Normally.

By looking at multiple genes, Mendel showed that they were not linked to each other and that each loci he studied had no influence over the others.
He called this Independent assortment.

By studying cases where the Mendelian laws we can also learn a lot. For instance, if a gene isn't segregating normally it may be sex linked. If two genes aren't Assorting Independently they're probably on the same [[../Chromosomes|chromosome]]

Mendel's laws are the first step to understanding Genetics, they lay down the basic concept of inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When [[../Mendelian Inheritance|Mendel]] studied peas, one of the phenotypes showed complete dominance over the other one.
If we look at pea height, and denote the gene for short as ''s'' and the gene for tall as ''S'', then as every plant has two sets [[../Chromosomes|chromosomes]] each has two genes at this locus.

So there are three possibilities: ''  SS, Ss, ss   ''(order doesn't matter)

In this case ''S'' was fully dominant over ''s'', so ''Ss'' individuals were phenotypically identical to ''SS'' individuals. Only ''ss'' pea plants were short.
The ''S'' gene would be said to be '''Dominant'''
While the ''s'' gene is said to be '''Recessive'''.

==The Molecular Basis of Dominance==

As has already been mentioned, all diploid organisms have two homologous chromosomes.  At a specific locus on each homologous chromosome, there are homologous alleles for a particular trait.  For example, the gene that codes for a dominant tall pea plant could be labeled A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and for a short recessive pea plant could be labeled A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.


==Alternative Patterns of Inheritance== 

Not all loci show this simple dominance. If we represent phenotype on a plot then Complete Dominance would be like this:

 ''AA/Aa                                          aa''     Complete Dominance

Other types are:

 ''AA                    Aa                       aa''     No Dominance

 ''AA     Aa                                      aa''     Incomplete Dominance

 ''Aa      AA                                     aa''     Over Dominance

==The Arbitrary Nature of Recessiveness and Dominance==

== Flux ==

Flux is effectively the amount of Field passing through a surface. In other words, it is analogous to a stream of water; if you put a screen in a creek, then water will pass through it. The amount of water moving through it is the flux.

Using the water analogy, point charges can be viewed as a source (such as a hose or faucet where water comes from), or a drain. Water comes out of a source, flows around the field, and travels into the drain.

If we draw our electric field lines so that our lines from our sinks connect to the lines from our drains, and if we ensure that no lines cross, the flux is essentially represented by the density of lines in our drawing. If we use the common convention that charge &quot;flows out of&quot; a positive charge, and &quot;flows into&quot; a negative charge, we can have a better understanding of what flux is.

== Surfaces ==

A '''surface''' is an abstract mathematical tool that we can use to explore various phenomena. What a surface is, is a shell around a region of space. Consider a common inflatable ball, such as a soccer ball, or a basketball. The &quot;ball&quot; itself is just a rubberized shell around a pocket of air.

Like a ball, a surface is just a shape in space that encloses a certain volume. Like a ball, the surface cannot have any gaps in it (if a ball has gaps, air will escape, and the ball will deflate).

== Gauss' Law ==

If the surface we have is a closed one, so it has no gaps, then you can imagine that in a river the same amount of water that enters the surface must also exit the surface. The only time that more water can be coming out of a surface is if there is a hose inside the surface. The only time more water can be entering the surface is if there is a drain inside the surface.

Or if we go back to Electric Field, the only time the flux in a surface is not zero, is when there is a charge inside that surface. 

{{eqn|Gauss' Law for Electric Fields (zero charge)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S{\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

If no charge is inside the surface, where d'''a''' is an infinitesimally small area.

Now what happens if we place a charge inside the surface, you can imagine that if we had a water tap inside that we would get a net flux leaving the surface. The same is true for the electric field.

=== Charge Inside the Surface ===

Imagine a sphere with a charge in the center. We will denote the sphere in spherical coordinates, for ease of use:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S{\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}} = \int\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\left ( \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf\hat r\right )\cdot(r^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\rho \mathbf\hat r) = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}q &lt;/math&gt;

Now notice that the radius of the sphere has no influence upon the ''Net Flux'', this means no matter what size the sphere is the answer is the same. This can be extended to mean that there is no dependence upon the shape of ''S'' at all.

So therefore:

{{eqn|Gauss' Law of Electric Fields (non-zero charge)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S{\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}} =\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enclosed} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''Q&lt;sub&gt;enclosed&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total amount of charge located inside the surface. This is '''Gauss's Law for Electric Fields '''.

== Example: Infinite Charged Plate ==

Imagine an infinite uniformly charged metal plate, with charge density &amp;sigma;. What is the electric field around the plate? In this case, because we have a plate with charge density &amp;sigma;, but no object of the opposite charge, we assume that there is an oppositely charged object at infinity, for our electric field lines to be drawn towards.

'''Solution'''
Place a Gaussian Surface through the surface of the metal plate, with sides only perpendicular and parallel to the surface. For ease, we will say that our gaussian surface is a cube or a rectangle. Let ''A'' be the area of the side of the cube that is parallel to the plate. To find the total charge inside the plate we can multiply the charge density &amp;sigma; with the total area. Therefore there is an enclosed charge of &amp;sigma; ''A''.

Because the plate is infinite and symmetrical the only direction the '''E''' Field can go is perpendicular to the plate. If the '''E''' field lines were not perpendicular to the plate, they would eventually cross each other. 

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_S{\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}} = |\mathbf{E}|\int_S{d\mathbf{a}} = 2A|\mathbf{E}| &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_S{\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enclosed} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \mathbf\hat n &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat n &lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector perpendicular to the plate.

== Expressing Gauss's Law in Terms of Divergence ==

Perhaps a more useful way of Expressing Gauss's Law is by using the Divergence of the Electric Field:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf E &lt;/math&gt;

This turns our original integral equation into a differential one by using the '''Divergence Theorem''':

:&lt;math&gt; \oint {\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}}=\int (\nabla \cdot \mathbf E) dV  &lt;/math&gt;

Now if we rewrite Q in terms of charge density &amp;rho;, then we have:

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{Enc} = \int \rho dV&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\int (\nabla \cdot \mathbf E) dV = \int \left( \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\right) dV &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf E =  \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that Gauss's Law is always true, but not always useful. You need a certain amount of symmetry and a good Gaussian Surface in order to use it effectively.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is an Ideal Gas ==
An Ideal Gas is a hypothetical gas in which all the molecules are considered as non-interacting elastic spheres with negligible radius. The molecules do not interact with each other and they move as free bodies except during very short time intervals when they bounce off each other or bounce off the wall that contains them. Obviously, there is no gas in nature that exhibits the characteristics of an Ideal Gas, although some come very close. It is only a crude approximation to the gases, which often gives reasonable results.

== Why Do We Have The Ideal Gas Approximation ==
We use the ideal gas approximation in most thermodynamic examples involving gases. It is a very good approximation of real gases, especially at low pressures when particle interaction is low.

== The Ideal Gas Temperature Scale==
When defining a Temperature Scale, you must find a physical situation in which something measurable changes over time. The equation governing the change must be invertible. One option could be length of a metal rod, this wouldn't be very good though as the rod would soon melt.

What was settled on was the Ideal Gas Scale, Temperature is defined such that the product of Pressure and Volume is directly proportional to temperature. Such that 0 [[/Kelvin/]] is when Pressure times Volume is 0 and 273.15K is the [[/Triple Point/]] of Water. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; PV \propto T &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Equation of State of an Ideal Gas ==
Experimentally, it was realised that there were only a certain minimum number of properties of a substance which could be given any specified values. The others depended on these variables. The way in which they were related was called the ''Equation of State''. The Equation of State of a an Ideal Gas is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {PV = nRT} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

P = Pressure

V = Volume

n = Number of Moles of Gas

R = Universal Gas Constant = 8.314 &lt;math&gt;JK^-1M^-1&lt;/math&gt;

T = Temperature

The variables you set are called the ''independant'' variables, the others are called ''dependant''.

=== Example ===

If you have 1 mole of Gas, and it occupies 1 metre cubed at 273.15K what pressure is it at?

'''Answer'''
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\ PV &amp; = &amp; nRT \\ \\
\ P &amp; = &amp; \frac{nrt}{V} \\ \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \frac{1\cdot 8.314 \cdot 273.15}{1} \\ \\
\ &amp; = &amp; 2271 Pascals
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Pressure Volume Plots ==

A thermodynamic state of a gas (ideal or not) is completely described by four variables &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (see previous topics). In most cases &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (the number of mols) is kept constant or is approximately constant (in other words the number of the gas molecules is practically unchanged) so we are left with three variables. From the equation of state (see previous topics) we can calculate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; from the other two variables. Therefore we are left with only 2 independent variables &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. It is common practice to represent a thermodynamic state on a &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; diagram with a point. The coordinates of the point give us the values of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. A set of such points represent a thermodynamic process, as shown for example in the figure below. 

[[Image:PV.gif]]

The process a) is a constant pressure prosess, known as isobaric (from the Greek word iso:equal and baros:load). For example the steam that leaves our body after a shower. It keeps increasing its volume (it is to be founnd all over the bathroom) but since it is in open air it has a constant atmoshperic pressure. The process b) is a constant volume prosess, known as isochorus (from the Greek word iso:equal and choros:space). For example when we put in the microwave oven a sealed food container. The traped air inside it occupies a costant volume but its pressure keeps rising as it warms up (that's why the lids sometimes pop-up in the microwave oven). The process c) is a constant temperature prosess, known as isothermal (from the Greek word iso:equal and thermal:heat). Why is it that the isothermal curve has such a shape? From the equation of state if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = constant then &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; = constant and so &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;1/V&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adiabatic and Isothermal Expansions ==
What is the difference between a slow and fast expansion or compression? Thermodynamically we say that if an expansion is fast it is Adiabatic, i.e. A process where there is no heat flow into the system. A slow expansion is generally an isothermal expansion, where the temperature of the system remains constant throughout the process.

=== Adiabatic Processes ===
Adiabatic Process are reversible as the entropy stays the same. No heat flows into the system and all work is done at the expense of Internal Energy.

For an Ideal Gas the equation of a PV equation of an Adiabatic Process is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; PV^\gamma \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; where &amp;gamma; is the ratio of the Specific Heat at Constant Pressure to that of Constant Volume.

=== Isothermal Processes ===
Isothermal Processes are a little different, the system must be connected to a heat bath so that heat can flow into or out of the system in order to keep the temperature constant.

For an Ideal Gas the PV plot is hyperbolic, i.e. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; PV \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Expansion needed ==

The class I'm at (in school) is recently teaching about the counting method, and it seems almost everyone(except a few like me) in my class didn't understand it. I think the explanation at this page is not very enough, and more sections can be added:

1)The 'AND' and 'OR' combination(that is things like 2*5*4)

2)Factorial and its application(For example 4!)

Then it's the ordered and then unordered selection
--[[User:Lemontea~enwikibooks|Lemontea]] 11:31, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:{{done}} All covered. I'll be on the 'AND' and 'OR' combinations in the days to come, I think they would serve as a good introduction for the probability chapter. --[[User:VitoFrancisco|''Vito Francisco'']] 01:58, 2 February 2016 (UTC)

== Not Clear ==

They tried to teach this in 7th grade and did a bad job explaining it. the Wikis should do better.  in the unordered selection it jumps to a formula with no explanation. 
--[[User:Phoebus|Phoebus]] 00:33, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I added a bit of explanation of the general formulas, but I'm not sure if it's enough.  I haven't taught classes below college level. --[[User:Jwwalker|Jwwalker]] 04:30, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Permutations and combinations ==

Isn't the things described in this chapter normally called permutations and combinations. [[User:Zginder|Zginder]] 23:16, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

:{{done}} Added clarification. Thanks for your input. --[[User:VitoFrancisco|''Vito Francisco'']] 01:58, 2 February 2016 (UTC)

== Combination with repetition ==
'''To do:''' Needs more tangible examples and teen-friendly (less rigorous and abstract) language. --[[User:VitoFrancisco|''Vito Francisco'']] 02:04, 2 February 2016 (UTC)</text>

{{technique}}



'''Smoking''' is a slow form of cooking that can pack in more flavour than probably any other form. It involves soaking the ingredient, whether it be fish, meat or vegetables, in the smoke of an aromatic wood. 

An optional method of smoking food is through the cooking of the food in a covered grill. In a sense, all [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] or [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbeque]]d food have some aspect of smoking involved, usually through drippings on hot fire causing smoke, or by the fire smoke itself. 

==Ingredients and Materials==
*Smoker or smoker grill
*wood, charcoal or other fuel for fire
*Smoking woods, leaves or herbs. Each has different attributes and favors. Some complement the meats more than others.
**Alder &amp;mdash; light smoke, good with fish
**[[Cookbook:Bay leaf|Bay leaves]] - spicy herbal smoke, good for meats, vegatables, and general purpose
**Apple &amp;mdash; somewhat sweet. Good with ham, beef or poultry
**Cedar Plank &amp;mdash; used with fish.
**Cherry &amp;mdash; sweet smoke, good with poultry or fowl. Do not use the bark from cherry for smoking, as it will impart a bitterness.
**Grape &amp;mdash; unique sweet smoke, good with poultry or fowl
**Hickory &amp;mdash; traditional favorite. Sharper flavor
**Maple &amp;mdash; Mild smoke, good with pork, bacon and ham
**Mesquite &amp;mdash; southwest flavor, somewhat sweet. Burns hot and fast when moisture is depleted so replenish frequently. 
**Oak &amp;mdash; medium smoke, good with meats
**Peach &amp;mdash; somewhat sweet, good with poultry or fowl 
**Pecan &amp;mdash; rich smoke, burns slowly
**[[cookbook:Seaweed|Seaweed]] &amp;mdash; Sharp unique flavor - unique flavor for seafood
**Wine barrel chips &amp;mdash; combination of fruity wine and oak smokes, good with meats and poultry
**[[cookbook:Herb|Herb]]al smoke &amp;mdash; Bay leaves, [[cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|Nutmeg]], [[cookbook:Peppermint|Peppermint]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|Rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Tea|Tea]] 
**Fruit smoke &amp;mdash; [[cookbook:lemon|Lemon]] Peel, [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange]] Peel

==Procedure==
===Building a Smoker===
'''Building a smoker''' is not a complicated process, but may take a bit of time and effort. An old style barbecue (the round ones you put coals in the bottom of) is easily modified into a &quot;grade A&quot; smoker. Just get the barbecue, find a thick piece of metal tubing (about 10-15 cm diameter) and cut a hole to fit it into the bottom of the barbecue. Another smaller metal drum is now needed; similar to an oil drum. Attach the other end of the pipe to the lid.  The pipe needs to be long enough so that the meat doesn't actually cook while being smoked, just picks up flavour. Put a light bulb at the bottom.

A metal mesh goes above the globe and this is where you place your leaves, wood and/or wood chips.

===Smoking Fish===

Fish is one food that is typically preserved by smoking. Salmon, Trout, Whitefish, various types of suckers, eel, Tuna, Marlin, and other fish are commonly used, with fish containing a high oil content producing the best results due to the fat picking up the smokes flavor, and helping to retain a moist texture. Whole fish, sectioned steaks, and skin on filets produce the best results because of the tendency of many fish to fall apart if the skin is removed.

Dress and then wash the fish under cold running water. Prepare a brine solution using a common easy brine. Combine 1 cup of salt, and one cup of sugar per gallon of water. This makes a saturated solution in which the liquid will not accept any more salt. Old timers used to mix in salt until it would float an egg. Many variations exist, and the salt/sugar ratio can be reduced, however it will influence flavor and preservation qualities. Full salt brines are highly recommended for cold process smoking due to the very real threat of botulism toxin forming under low heat, low salt smoking conditions. Botulism is likely to form in ranges of  40°F (4.4°C) to 140°F (60°C) temperature. Monitor your temperatures using a quality thermometer you trust. Soy sauce, can be substituted for part of the salt, or in addition to it, as can honey, brown sugar, molasses, or other sweeteners for the sugar. Be aware that it will affect the final flavor and results. Many other ingredients can be added such as Worcestershire sauce, chilies, garlic, herbs like dill, and spices of various flavors are used in regional variations.

Place the fish in a large enough glass, or stainless steel container, then pour the brine solution over the fish and cover. Do not use steel, cast iron or aluminum. Plastic can be used, but it will tend to pick up the odor of the fish, and some ingredients will stain it, rendering it unusable for other purposes. Place the container in the refrigerator and depending upon size and thickness of the cut of fish brine for 2-3 hours for small fish, such a Smelt, or leave large whole fish like Salmon, or Lake Trout overnight. Be aware that the longer the fish is in the brine the stronger the salt and seasoning flavor will become. Experience will guide you.

Remove fish from the brine and rinse under running water briefly. You can skip the rinse, but the finished product will be affected in appearance and have a stronger flavor. Pat dry the fish with paper towel, or a clean lint free cloth. Place the fish on racks also made of stainless steel, or chrome plated steel. Never use galvanized metal in contact with salt brined fish, fowl, or meats. Allow the fish to dry until the pellicles form. This is a thin, shiny membrane that is dry to the touch. It will take about an hour or so to develop depending upon the humidity in the air. This drying step produces a superior product with steaks and filets. The pellicles formation is less apparent in whole fish, but does enhance the finished product. Place the fish in the smoker, and using the wood of your choice, smoke from 1 to several hours depending again on the thickness of filets or steaks, or size of the fish, and how hot the smoke is. Again experience will guide you. If after sampling the fish the product is not sufficiently smoked return it to the smoker.

90 degrees Fahrenheit/32 degrees Celsius constitutes a cold smoke, and results in a superb final product with a long shelf life. Dry cured hams are cold smoked and require no refrigeration. Cold smoking also takes longer than a hot smoke, and closer monitoring. Higher heat is a combination of grilling and smoking, and the finished product will be cooked as well as smoked. Insure that the fish is far enough away from the heat source to avoid burning. Indirect heat is best, and a water filled pan can be placed between the heat source and food being smoked to add moistness and catch fat that may cause flare ups if allowed to drip directly on the coals. This method works with pork, fowl, and also for making beef jerky. Meats and fowl can be basted with a sauce near the end of the cooking cycle. My preference is to use a hotter smoke for meats and fowl, and a cooler smoke for fish.

===Heat Sources===

Gas, either natural or propane, charcoal, wood burned down to an ember fire, a hot plate with a cast iron pan, or a cast iron smoke box placed on any of these heat sources will generate the required heat and smoke. The advantage of an electric hot plate is the ease of regulating the heat source, and a higher degree of control. Soak the chunks, or chips of wood, in water to prevent them from igniting. This step will cause them to smolder and produce smoke for a longer period of time. Place the wood in either direct contact with the coals, or in a metal pan always when using gas, or electric heat sources. A pan, or smoke box can be used with direct charcoal fires also. If using Cherry wood for smoking remove all the bark. It will adversely affect the flavor of the product.
A remote heat source piped into the smoker itself is necessary for cold smoking. Utilize draft control and convection to funnel the smoke into the smoker by placing the smoke generator in a position below the smoker. Clothes dryer vent pipe and elbows, or furnace duct with dampers, works well for directing and controlling the smoke.

===Cooking by Smoking===

To cook, just pick the leaves and wood chips from an aromatic tree ([[w:Bay Tree|Bay leaves]] are good) and put it on the metal mesh. Put the meat in the smoker like you would if you were barbequing it. Turn on the light and wait 6 hours. After this you can refrigerate it and cook it on a grill later.

Smoking food is time-consuming, and can be expensive and a bit tricky, but the results can be superb.

==Variations==
===Cooking foods by smoking===
In this method, the foods are cooked slowly with a smokey fire. This usually involves an indirect cooking method, where the food is covered with the smoke and heat, but not directly over hot coals. The smoke is provided through water soaked wood chips or aromatic leaves placed on the fire or coals. It is a slower cooking method taking an hour or longer, depending on the food being smoked. 

==Warning==
'''Warning:  If you can't cure it, do not cold smoke it.'''  While cold smoking food is quite a simple process, there are issues of safety.  All smoked products '''''must be''''' [[w:Curing_%28food_preservation%29|cured]].  The reason for this is the threat of botulism. The bacterium responsible, ''Clostridium botulinum'', is ubiquitous in the environment, grows in the anaerobic conditions created in the smoker, and thrives in the 40°F (4.4°C) to 140°F (60°C) temperature range.  For this reason, anything you cold smoke should be cured.

==Procedure==
# In a bowl, mix the lukewarm water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and active dry yeast. Let stand until yeast mixture becomes frothy and increases in volume.
# While the yeast mixture is standing, in a separate large mixing bowl, mix the butter, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, salt, and hot water or buttermilk.
# Once the yeast mixture becomes frothy, add the yeast mixture to the separate large mixing bowl.
# Add 2 cups of white flour to the large mixing bowl. Stir at slow speed with an electric mixer for 1 minute. After that, mix at medium speed for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl frequently.
# With the remaining 2 cups of white flour, add the remaining flour at about 1/4 to 1/2 cups at a time to the large mixing bowl, and continually mix with a spoon until the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl or it becomes difficult to add more flour. 
# Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and a towel. Place in a warm room with no drafts until the batter doubles in volume. About 45 minutes to 1 hour.
# After the batter was allowed to sit, stir it down with a spoon (about 25 strokes).
# Divide the batter into 2 loaf pans. Wet fingers and push into the corners and smooth out.
# Cover both setups with plastic. Place in a warm room and let the batter rise until it just reaches the tops of the pans (about 25 minutes). Watch carefully and don't let the batter rise too high (if it does rise too high, punch it down a little bit and let it rise again.)
# After the batter was allowed to rise in the loaf pans, bake at 375° for 30 to 45 minutes. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom of the pan and is browned to the baker's preference.
# Turn out on a wire rack and let cool.

'''Latkes''' are potato pancakes, commonly associated with the Jewish cultural tradition in the United States and Europe. They can be and are served any time, but traditionally form part of the menu during the celebration of Chanukah. Eating potato pancakes is not one of the mitzvot of Chanukah; that is, it is not a fundamental part of the Chanukah rituals, and has no religious significance. It is seen as appropriate to eat foods cooked in oil during a festival that celebrates the miracle of the Chanukah oil. In Israel, potato pancakes are familiar and well-liked but the [[Cookbook:Sufganiya|sufganiya]] (jelly doughnut) is considered to be more Israeli.

Various recipes for potato pancakes vary in the degree of fineness to which the potatoes are grated. Some are grated to long strips, others to a fine powder. Both latkes and potato pancakes bear a distant resemblance to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] dish [[Cookbook:Hash Browns|hash browns]]; however, hash browns are merely coarsely grated potatoes with no binding ingredients or flour.

==Ingredients==
*4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
*2 tablespoons Matzo meal, [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]], or [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*2 tablespoons vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Applesauce|applesauce]], [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], and/or [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Peel potatoes and onion and [[wikt:grate|grate]].
#Place grated potatoes and onions in cheesecloth or fine sieve. Squeeze mixture to drain excess moisture, ensuring proper frying.
#Mix drained potato and onion mixture with egg, meal, and salt.
#Heat oil in a {{convert|10|in|cm}} pan over medium heat until it is quite hot.  Drop 1-2 tablespoons of the potato mixture onto the pan per pancake.  Turn once to allow both sides to fry.
#Serve with applesauce, sour cream, and/or sugar as a topping.

Serves four.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Variants include cheese latkes, zucchini latkes, and apple latkes.

==Ingredients==
* 1 ounce [[Cookbook:Ham|Ham]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 1/2 stalk [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 sprig [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* 1/3 c [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1/2 glass [[Cookbook:Wine|Chablis white wine]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:Velute sauce|Velute]] or [[Cookbook:Espagnole sauce|Espagnole sauce]]
* 1 t [[Cookbook:Castor sugar|castor sugar]]
* Juice of 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

== Procedure ==
# Cut up the ham, onion, carrot, and celery very finely.
# Fry them in butter together with the bay leaf, thyme, clove and peppercorns.  
# Over this pour the vinegar, and when the liquid is all absorbed, add the Chablis and stock.
# Then the tomatoes, cut up and strained of all their liquid.
# Cook this in a covered stew pan and pass it through a sieve, but see that none of the bay leaf or thyme goes through.
# Mix this sauce with an equal quantity of Velute sauce (No. 2) or Espagnole sauce, (No. 1), let it boil and pass through a sieve again and at the last add the castor sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and an ounce of fresh butter. 

Another tomato sauce may be made like this, but use stock instead of vinegar and leave out the lemon juice and sugar.

Delicious easy fudge that works every time. Never crystallizes.


== Ingredients ==
* 4-1/2 cups sugar
* 1/2 lb. butter
* 12 oz. evaporated milk
* 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
* 2 cups miniature marshmallows
* 12 oz. real chocolate chips
* 2 cups chopped walnuts

== Procedure ==

# Combine sugar, butter, evaporated milk, vanilla in a saucepan and bring to a rolling boil.
# Cook on medium heat for 11 minutes, stirring constantly.
# Add marshmallows, chocolate chips, walnuts to fudge and mix well.
# Pour into a buttered pan and let cool. 
# Cut into squares when it cuts without melting back together but before it becomes crumbly. 

Makes 5 pounds. Store in an air-tight container.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Substituting margarine for butter makes the fudge oily. Imitation vanilla affects the aroma. Other varieties of chips (vanilla, butterscotch, etc.) work as well.

'''Beef Jerky''' is ideal for road trips and camping, as it will not perish as readily as fresh meat. It is suitable not only as a snack but also as a meal. This recipe for jerky is not heavily brined and flavored as commercial jerky is.

Other meats may be substituted instead of beef, but use caution.

==Ingredients==
* ¾ tsp. [[cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ tsp. [[cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 tbl. [[cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* ¼ tsp. [[cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 tbl. [[cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] or [[cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|Teriyaki sauce]]
* ¼ tsp. [[cookbook:Liquid Smoke|Liquid Smoke]]
* 1 Lb. (450 g) [[cookbook:Beef|beef]] ([[cookbook:Steak|flank]] or [[cookbook:Steak|skirt steak]] is ideal)
* Other common seasonings may include (¼ tsp. of) cayenne pepper, cheese powder, and/or white pepper

== Procedure ==
# Mince or press garlic.  
# Mix all ingredients except beef to make brine.
# Slice beef into ¼&quot; thick strips. Small chunks (about ¾&quot;) of stewing beef may also be used. If possible, cut along the grain of the meat rather than across it. It may be easier to freeze the meat before attempting to cut it, as this will stop the meat pulling and deforming so easily.
# Marinate meat in overnight, or at least for an hour or two.
# Place meat on racks and dry in a food dehydrator at 145 °F (63 °C) for 6 - 8 hours.  May be dried in a 150 °F (65 °C) oven with foil-covered racks. In oven, turn meat over 3 - 4 hours into drying time and reduce temperature to 130 °F (55 °C).
# Meat should bend but not break when properly dried.

      <text xml:space="preserve">¡Bienvenido! :-D Veo que has empezado con ganas :) Supongo que el material que subes es de tu propia factura, y no tomado de libros ni apuntes de profesores. ¿Supongo bien? Es que ando algo paranoico porque en la wikipedia siempre andamos con problemas con eso (los potenciales líos de propiedad intelectual, etc).

Ahora que lo miro, veo que has subido imágenes. Te pregunto lo mismo: ¿son tuyas o de una fuente libre? Si son escaneadas de un libro o de un cuadernillo de prácticas, lo mejor es que pidas permiso para su uso de forma oficial, o que solicites su borrado a algún administrador, y las sustituyas por otras usables (quizá ni siquiera necesitemos imágenes nuevas, hay varios wikilibros de química que tendrán un buen surtido...). A las malas, mejor dejar un artículo sin imágenes, a la espera de que algún artista libre nos las dibuje, que exponernos a pleitos y problemas legales :)

Hola! Lo que he escrito son apuntes hechos en ordenador directamente de clase, los apuntes reales son mucho mas elaborados y mas tochos. Respecto a las imágenes, son de unas fotocopias, osea, son de libre distribución y no han sido sacadas de ningún libro. Si ves ke las imágenes no merecen la pena me lo dices y buscamos unas ke sean mejores y que tampoco tengan el copyright ese.

Saludos!

Pochi.

:Si los apuntes han sido escritos por tí, entonces son el tipo de material que nos sirve :) La calidad y oportunidad de las imágenes es indiscutible: son buenas y aportan al curso. 
:Sin embargo, las fotocopias como sinónimo de libre distribución me dan un poco más de miedo... es como las imágenes que coges de páginas web. Por defecto, no se puede. Seguro que a todo el mundo le da lo mismo, pero el caso es que esas imágenes las hizo alguien, y es posible que alguien (que puede ser el mismo u otro) tenga los derechos de autor. Ahora puede dar lo mismo, pero quizá dentro de unos años estos wikilibros se comercialicen (la [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFDL GFDL] lo permite), y si alguien tiene derechos, quizá nos meta en un lío. Podemos dejarlas por ahora, pero en el futuro sería muy bueno coger la costumbre de tomar imágenes de origen libre certificado (como tus textos, con alguien detrás que diga: &quot;es mío y lo libero bajo la GFDL&quot;). Una idea interesante que se me acaba de ocurrir sería irlos sustituyendo por fotografías digitales.
:En cualquier caso, pido perdón por ser tan pesado en este tema (bueno y en casi todos ;). En la Wikipedia hemos tenido y seguimos teniendo muchos problemas y discusiones muy largas y sesudas sobre asuntos de copyright, especialmente en imágenes... -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 06:29, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pochi. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pochi~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Introduction_to_Philosophy|Introduction to Philosophy]] &gt; [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Logic|Logic]] &gt; Paradoxes

:The simplest way to think about the paradox is as something that can not exist without itself. Generally, it is an event perpetrated in such a way as to remove or render impossible the perpetration of said event. There are many forms of paradoxes. Three such are the predestination paradox, the ontological paradox, and the grandfather paradox.

==Several Types of Paradoxes==

===Predestination Paradox (Causal Loops)===
A predestination paradox, or causal loop, is a paradox of time travel. It exists when a time traveller is caught in a loop of events that &quot;predestines&quot; him to travel back in time. This paradox is in some ways the opposite of the grandfather paradox.

The following are two examples of a predestination paradox:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As an example, say there is James, a time travelling android. He was created by Mark, who found the plans to make James on his dresser one day and worked from those. The issue at hand is that the plans were written and placed there by James after he was made. The obvious difficulty is the fact that, at some point, the cycle has to have an outside factor as a beginning. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say that Irwin was born as a result of Nick dying in an assassination. Irwin has always believed that Nick's death was a terrible loss to humanity, and he goes back in time to prevent it. In a universe of diverging realities, this may make sense, as Irwin is actually travelling from reality A to reality B, where he can prevent the assassination and maintain his existence. Likewise, there may be a universal principle that prevents such paradoxes from occurring that holds him back from doing anything, however, in the constraints and for the purposes of this discussion, we will assume there is no such principle. Irwin warns Nick (or pushes him down, or shoots the sniper, or removes Nick from the situation), thereby erasing his birth from existence. The question raised is, how was Irwin born to go back in time in the first place, as he was not born at all supposing that the cause of his birth (Nick's death) has been removed? As such, he couldn't have protected Nick from assassination, else he would not be born. This, in turn, would lead to him being born, which would mean that he went back in time and saved Nick, and the same process would be repeated ad nauseam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ontological Paradox===
An ontological paradox is similar to a predestination paradox in that it is nested in causation, but raises the ontological questions of where, when and by whom the schematics were created. Time loop logic operates on similar principles, sending the solutions to computation problems back in time to be checked for correctness without ever being computed &quot;originally.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One example is seen in ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home''. In ''Star Trek II'', Captain Kirk receives antique eyeglasses from Dr. McCoy. In ''Star Trek IV'', Captain Kirk pawns the glasses (nearly three hundred years in the past, in the late 20th century) given to him by Dr. McCoy, who will, again, buy the glasses for Kirk in the 23rd century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Grandfather Paradox===
The grandfather paradox is a paradox of time travel, supposedly first conceived by the science fiction writer René Barjavel in his book &quot;Future times three&quot; (&quot;Le voyageur imprudent&quot;, 1943). Suppose you travelled back in time and killed your biological grandfather before he met your grandmother. Then you would never have been conceived, so you could not have travelled back in time after all. Now did you travel back or not? The grandfather paradox has been used to argue that backwards time travel must be impossible. However, other resolutions have also been advanced.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">What follows is a personalized account and in no way reflects the views of the sponsor:

v 1 John was a trustworthy witness because he relates what he himself saw, touched and heard. His entire life was changed by his experience with Jesus, and even decades later, in his old age and near death, he is preoccupied with telling people about it. At this point John has seen ten of his fellow apostles killed for their faith but he keeps on professing up to the very end. An entire community was based on what he and others had witnessed, and it is to this community, the church, that John is addressing his letter.
*** For those seeking a historical-critical approach, I offer the following notes:  The text of 1 Jn does not identify its author, nor is there any mention in the text of anyone named John nor of any apostle(s).  Moreover, the author does not use the first person singular &quot;I,&quot; but writes about what &quot;we&quot; (first person &lt;u&gt;plural&lt;/u&gt;) have heard, seen, looked upon, and touched.  No apostles are mentioned in the text nor, consequently, anything about their lives or martyrdoms.

v 2 Before meeting Jesus, John, a faithful Jew, was spiritually dead. It was only through Jesus that he was able to feel set free from his old way of life. Now this was an experience shared by thousands of Christians who received his letter: leaving death for life, leaving an existence marked by shallowness and lack of fulfillment for a new life of constant struggle but of soul-felt happiness. The old life was life only in that his body existed and functioned, but was without hope. His new life begins on the earth and continues into eternity with God. Life came only through Jesus, sent by God from heaven to earth to bring hope to a people who had none. Life was manifested first to John and his companions, then through them to many more people who had come to faith in Christ and who had left behind their old lifestyle and united with the radically different lifestyle of the church.

*** This letter doesn't suggest that its author was a converted Jew.  There is no maligning of Judaism as hopeless, shallow, or anything else, inasmuch as Judaism isn't mentioned in the letter.

v 3 John announced the message to the people to help them be united with him as he was united with God. Without the message or the preaching, the people would not be united with God or with the apostles. John proclaims that no-one would be close to God, since Jesus is the only path to God in a darkened world (Jn 14:6). 

v 4 John enjoyed what he did and it was a pleasure for him to write to his flock. He saw people’s lives change as they drew close to God. Thus writing helped him to complete his happiness, which would be incomplete if he didn’t help those around him draw closer to God or if those who had been close to God drifted away.

v 5 The message: God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. Light is freedom from sin and ingorance; light is understanding, enlightenment, and spiritual maturity. Darkness is a symbol of sin, lies, and death. As God has no darkness, the Christian should not permit sin in his or her life. 

v 6 Saying we are united with him: that is, the Christians. Anyone in the church who lives in lies or unrepentant or unconfessed sin lives in darkness, futily trying to hide his actions from men, but unable to hide them from God. This is to have stepped away from the truth and be once again in opposition to God and his will. This drives a barrier between one Christian and the others, is a break of faith and is not what God or John want.

v 7 No Christian, nor any human, has never sinned (Rom 3:9-20) and no Christian can avoid sin completely even after coming to know God (v 8). However, to be close to God a person needs to be purified, and that happens only through the blood of Jesus. This allows Christians to be united one with the other and live in the light, with God. 

v 8 Some in John’s audience liked to think that they had no sin. They were mistaken and fooling themselves. Not only that, but they had stepped away from God’s truth, because John says that such a person has no truth in him. We must recognize our sins before God to be close to him and for there to be truth in us.

v 9 What should we do about our sins? John’s answer for his flock was clear: confess them. A person is not right before God by behaving well, as no-one is able to live up to God’s perfection. Unfortunately, every living person sins (v 8, Rom 3:9) and needs forgiveness. God, who is just, forgives the sins of the Christian who asks it. Besides this, God cleans the Christian of wrondoing, helping him to leave behind sinful and destructive tendencies. 

v 10 In the case of a Christian who claims he has not sinned, this in itself is a grave sin as it makes God out to be a liar. This reveals that the person has not come to a true relationship with God, as he has not accepted God’s word.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b id=&quot;closed_systems&quot;&gt;Closed systems&lt;/b&gt; are systems which do not interact with their environment. For example, if we are only considering the exchange of heat energy, the inside of an insulated box would be a closed system, since no heat can get in or out. Compare this with [[#open_systems|open systems]].&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b id=&quot;open_systems&quot;&gt;Open systems&lt;/b&gt; are systems which interact with their environment, so that energy or mass can be added or removed from them. For example, a pot of water on

==Introduction==
Celestia provides you with very powerful and flexible ways to control your view into Celestia's simulation of the cosmos. Once you understand how to  manipulate its interactive controls, you can quickly and easily position yourself to view the astronomical phenomena that interest you. If is helpful to think of Celestia as providing a remotely-controlled camera that is at your command. The view that you see on your screen is determined by the location of the camera, the direction the camera is pointing, and the magnification of the camera's zoom lens. Each of these factors can be controlled independently.

One important thing to understand is that both the location and direction of the camera are specified relative to some frame of reference. The frame of reference may be attached to a moving object (such as a planet or moon). If so, then the actual location and direction of the camera (with respect to absolute space) will automatically change as the object moves. This is often very convenient, because it means that you do not have to continuously change the camera location and direction manually in order to keep the object in view.

Commands which change Celestia's view of the universe are described in the file Celestia/controls.txt

==Zoom Control==
The magnification of the camera's zoom lens determines how large or small objects will appear on your screen, and also how much of the environment around you is visible (the field of view). If you increase the magnification then objects will appear larger, but you'll have a smaller area in view. (You can also make objects appear larger by moving the camera closer to them. The difference between zooming and moving the camera is important, as we will explain below.) Celestia displays the current magnification factor and field of view in the lower right hand corner of the window. As you zoom in, the magnification factor will increase, and the field of view will decrease. Zooming out has the opposite effect. If you zoom out to a very large field of view, the view will become distorted, much like what you would see with a fish-eye lens.

Repeatedly typing a comma (,) narrows the field of view, increasing the magnification.
Repeatedly typing a period (.) widens the field of view, decreasing the magnification.

* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]]
* 2 cups white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
* 1/2 cup smooth or chunky peanut butter

==Procedure==
# Combine the sugar and cocoa in a saucepan, stir well.
# Add milk and stir well, add butter and place over medium high heat.
# Bring mixture to a boil -- when it reaches a rolling boil that cannot be stirred-down set timer for 1 minute, boil while stirring exactly 1 minute.
# Remove from heat and add peanut butter and vanilla, stir enough to melt peanut butter.
# Add oatmeal, stir to combine and immediately spoon the mixture onto a cookie sheet, leaving enough space between them for spreading out.
# Let stand on counter for at least 20 minutes to stiffen, or you may refrigerate for quicker stiffening of the cookies.

==Notes, Tips and Variations==
You can also use nutella to give the no-bake cookies something extra.

Rather than forming cookies, pour the hot mixture into a pie pan with a
crust of [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]]. Once cooled, top the mix with whipped cream 
and fruit or any other desired topping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">not sure if anyone is actively maintaining this at present, but i feel that it's important to begin with a less partisan thesis.  in contemporary art pedagody, there is a need (and a considerable demand) for texts which enable students to approach many of the more vital strains of experimental art practice at an undergraduate (or indeed secondary) level.  as such, i'm of the opinion that founding the text on a necessarily expressionist paradigm effectively prevents it from engaging thoroughly with, for example, minimal art, conceptual art, and appropriation-based practices, to name just a few things.

might i suggest that instead of letting this statement remain a central assumption of the text, one could introduce a section on central pilosophical issues in reading/theorizing &quot;art.&quot;  obviously, one of these would be &quot;expression,&quot; discussing among other things the conflation of expression and expressionism, theories of communication and transmission, and the impact of major critical discourses (existentialism, phenomenology, deconstruction...) on the approach to the problem of expression in critical and &quot;studio&quot; art practices.

lastly, if more than one or two others are willing to work on this...i'd like to see the taxonomy of media handled a bit differently.  it needs to be a bit less classical and more of a set of considered heuristics that acknowldge the extremely contingent nature of the project of distinguishing between media.  i'm thinking of things such as the distinction between painting and drawing in much expressionism, the distinction between painting and sculpture in much minimalism, and distinctions between sculpture, installation, assemblage, sound art, conceptual art, software art, etc. that have been nearly impossible to use in any &quot;objective&quot; way for decades now.

at any rate, i'm mostly just wondering who's out there and also interested in working on some outlines for this kind of project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Carnot Cycle ==
The Carnot Cycle is named after its discoveror,[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%E9onard_Sadi_Carnot| Sadi Carnot]]
The Carnot Cycle is the most efficient heat engine that could be built. It converts heat energy from a heat source into work. Or if run in reverse, converts work into the movement of heat, i.e. a refrigerator.
In a Carnot Cycle all Processes are reversible.

=== Steps in a Carnot Cycle ===
# '''[[../Slow and Fast Expansions#Isothermal_Processes|Isothermal]] Expansion at T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''' (The higher temperature). During this step work is done by heat being absorbed from a heat source.
# '''[[../Slow and Fast Expansions#Adiabatic_Processes|Adiabatic]] Expansion from T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''' No heat enters or leaves the system during this step. Work is done on the surroundings in this step.
# '''Isothermal Compression at T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. Heat flows into a heat sink during this step as the surroundings do work on the gas.
# '''Adiabatic Compression from T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.''' Here the surroundings again do work on the system, compressing the gas and raising its temperature.

=== Efficiency of a Carnot Cycle ===
The Efficiency &amp;eta; is defined for heat engines as the amount of work done by the process divided by the Heat Input.

As energy must be conserved, the Work is equal to the heat in minus the heat out.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; W = q_1 - q_2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
So the efficiency is equal to 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \eta = \frac{q_1 - q_2}{q_1} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This means that the efficiency of a Heat Engine Increases with higher heat source and with a cooler Heat Sink.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \eta = 1 - \frac{q_2}{q_1} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{q_2}{q_1}= \frac{T_2}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
so finally
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \eta = 1 - \frac{T_2}{T_1} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And as the heat in and out is proportional to the Temperature of the Source and Sink.

== Refrigeration and Coefficient of Performance ==
When a Carnot Cycle is run in reverse, it becomes a fridge, taking heat from the 'sink', and giving it to the 'source'. The coefficient of Performance is defined as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{q_1}{W} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{q_1}{q_1 - q_2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Reversible Process'==
A reversible process is one where the entropy of the system and surroundings doesn't increase.

'''Anguilla alla Milanese''' (Eels).

==Ingredients==  
*1 large [[Cookbook:Eel|eel]]
*2 ounces [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaf]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
*4 ounces Chablis
*a medley of [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]]

==Procedure==
#Cut up a big eel and [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] it in two ounces of butter. When it is a good colour add a tablespoonful of flour, about half a pint of stock, a glass of Chablis, a bay leaf, pepper, and salt, and boil till it is well cooked.  
#In the meantime boil separately all sorts of vegetables, such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], etc.  
#Take out the pieces of eel, but keep them hot, whilst you pass the liquor which forms the sauce through a sieve and add the vegetables to this.  Let them boil a little longer and arrange them in a dish. Place the pieces of eel on them and cover with the sauce.  It is most important that the eels should be served very hot.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Any sort of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] will do as well for this dish.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Alpharigel. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Alpharigel~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Introduction==

A '''Render path''' is Celestia's way of classifying graphics capabilities. Its different Render paths correspond to different sets of OpenGL functions.

Not all render paths may be available on your computer. A render path will be available only if your computer's graphics software includes the OpenGL functions that it uses. More sophisticated render paths require more recent graphics hardware, but not the most expensive version of a card.

When it is first started, Celestia automatically selects the best render path based on the graphics capabilities advertised by the computer's OpenGL library. However, you can interactively select any available render path. Celestia remembers which path you selected last and will use it when the program is restarted. Choosing another render path may be necessary if there are problems due to bugs in your computer's graphics drivers. 

To select an alternate render path, type a Ctrl-V. That is, press the &quot;V&quot; key while holding down the &quot;control&quot; key. This causes Celestia to switch to the next  available render path. The name of the newly selected render path will be shown briefly in the lower left hand part of Celestia's window.

==Render Paths under Linux ==

{{sectstub}}

==Render Paths under MacOS X ==

{{sectstub}}

==Render Paths under Windows==
Some of the render paths available on computers running Windows are
* Basic
* Multitexture
* OpenGL Vertex Program
* OpenGL Vertex Program/Nvidia combiners (only on Nvidia graphics cards)
* OpenGL 2.0

Celestia can show more and improved &quot;eye candy&quot; when using the later render paths:

* '''Basic''' requires OpenGL v1.1. 
:It shows the fewest effects. It's available even on systems which have only Microsoft's software support for OpenGL and have no 3D hardware acceleration. 
* '''Multitexture''' requires OpenGL v1.2. 
:It adds NightLights and the shadow of a planet on its rings.
* '''OpenGL Vertex Program''' requires OpenGL v1.4. 
:It adds specular highlights on oceans, shaded mountainsides and the shadows of rings on a planet.
* '''Nvidia Combiners''' adds a rudimentary haze effect.
* '''OpenGL 2.0''' requires OpenGL v2.0. 
:It improves the edges of eclipse and ring shadows, draws the shadows cast by as many as four separate light sources, and adds sophisticated atmospheric effects, including cloud shadows on the ground. Haze can be drawn, too, based on Mie and Rayleigh scattering functions. (''These scattering functions are available only with Celestia v1.5.0 or later.'')

==OpenGL Versions==

To find out what version of OpenGL the graphics drivers on your computer claim to support, select Celestia's Help menu. The entry &quot;OpenGL Info...&quot; will list details about your computer's graphics hardware and software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oz''' is a programming language.which supports declarative programming, object-oriented programming, constraint programming, and concurrency as part of a coherent whole. For distribution, a common implementation (Mozart) provides a true network transparent implementation with support for network awareness, openness, and fault tolerance. Oz is ideal for both general-purpose distributed applications as well as for hard problems requiring sophisticated optimization and inferencing abilities. Oz applications include sophisticated collaborative tools, multi-agent systems, and digital assistants, as well as applications in natural language understanding and knowledge representation, in scheduling and time-tabling, and in placement and configuration.

If you have programmed before and would like to see a little bit of how Oz works and is different from other programming languages, you can get an [[/overview|overview]].

== What is Celestia? ==
Celestia is a freely-distributed, multi-platform, open source software package that provides photo-realistic, real-time, three-dimensional viewing of the solar system, the galaxy and the universe. It has proved a valuable tool for astronomy education, and is used in homes, schools, museums and planetariums around the world. Versions are available for Windows, Macintosh (MacOS X) and Linux computers.

== Where can I get more information about Celestia? ==

The   [http://shatters.net/celestia/  ''Celestia Website'']  has some additional information about Celestia.

The  [http://shatters.net/forum/  ''Celestia Forum'']  is a good place to look for or ask for additional information. You'll find lots of friendly people there.

The [http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/  ''Celestia Motherlode'']  has many Celestia resources.

=== Where can I get the most recent version of Celestia? ===

You can download the latest version of Celestia (v1.6.0) from  [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302  SourceForge]. 

Prerelease versions are announced in the Celestia Web Forum in its [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=2 Users Forum].

=== What changes have been made to Celestia since the last version? ===

The developers maintain a list of all new functionality and bug fixes in the Celestia ChangeLog, which is located at [http://celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net/celestia/celestia/ChangeLog?view=markup   SourceForge] (most recent changes listed at bottom).

== Questions about how Celestia works ==

=== Celestia crashes, what it draws is messed up or it's extremely slow. What can I do? ===

Celestia makes use of the most advanced features of [[w:OpenGL|OpenGL]] that your computer's graphics driver claims to support. Many older OpenGL implementations have serious bugs. Here are some options for improving Celestia's display, with the most likely ones first: 
# Make sure full hardware acceleration is enabled in your display properties. 
# Upgrade to the most recent drivers for your graphics card. Download them for free from the Web site of the manufacturer of your card, not from Microsoft. 

Nvidia drivers can be downloaded from http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp

ATI drivers can be downloaded from http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html

Notes: 
# Graphics chipsets integrated into laptop systems usually require drivers provided by the manufacturer of the laptop itself. Too often proprietary &quot;glue chips&quot; prevent the chip vendor's drivers from working properly. 
# Reduce or disable hardware acceleration to verify that the problem is hardware related. 

====Windows XP====

# Whenever you upgrade Microsoft's DirectX software, you must upgrade or reinstall the graphics hardware manufacturer's graphics drivers afterward. Installing DirectX installs Microsoft's copies of the drivers, which usually are several generations old. 
# To disable hardware acceleration under Windows, open the &quot;Display Properties&quot; window. Select the &quot;Settings/Advanced/Troubleshoot&quot; tab. (not the &quot;Troubleshoot...&quot; button). Move the &quot;Hardware acceleration&quot; slider all the way to the left. Click on the &quot;OK&quot; buttons to change the settings in use. This will cause Windows to use Microsoft's Generic OpenGL v1.1 library, which is limited, but seems to have relatively few bugs. It does everything in software, works on 2D displays, and is quite slow.
# Driver Upgrade Procedure
##  download driver installation program
## use the Control Panel / Add or Remove Programs menu to delete the current graphics drivers.
## Reboot
## Cancel out of XP's offer to install new drivers.
## Run the Installation program for the new drivers.
## Reboot
## Configure desktop resolution and other desirable features.

:The two reboots are essential in order to cause the old low-level drivers to be deleted. Without those reboots, the old low-level drivers will not be deleted and the new installation will not work properly, although it may not generate any error messages.

====MacOS X====

For Apple PPC and Intel computers running MacOS X, you must upgrade to the most recent version of the operating system. Updated drivers usually are not available separately.

Apple's OpenGL on MacOS X often has serious bugs which sometimes are not fixed in the most recent release of MacOS. You must report those problems to Apple, otherwise they will not get fixed.

====Linux====

For computers running Linux, you usually can download the drivers for free from the Web site of the manufacturer of your graphics card.

ATI's fglrx drivers for Linux often have serious bugs. Try to use the driver shipped with the most recent version of Xorg's X server software.

=== Celestia draws the Moon in shades of purple, blue and red. Why is it doing that and what can I do? ===

Your graphics chipset and its drivers aren't drawing bumpmaps and normalmaps properly: their OpenGL routine &quot;GL_ARB_vertex_program&quot; is defective. (This is often seen with the newer Intel graphics chips.) Assuming you've already installed the most recent drivers, 
# Download and install a different version of Celestia. The program is frequently revised. 
# Turn off some of Celestia's advanced display features. 
## Type a [Ctrl-V] several times to select &quot;Basic&quot; or &quot;Multitexture&quot; render paths instead of the OpenGL Vertex programs. This disables the use of vertex and shading programs temporarily. If this does improve things after you've followed the previous suggestions, then you need to do the next step: 
## Tell Celestia to ignore specific features that your OpenGL library claims (falsely) to support. To do this, edit celestia.cfg. Remove the # that's in front of the line 
 IgnoreGLExtensions [ &quot;GL_ARB_vertex_program&quot; ]
:Celestia's Help menu lists all of the routines in your system's OpenGL library. Add equivalent Ignore lines for other suspicious routines. 


Addendum provided Tech Sgt. Chen: 

Shut down all background programs on your system before running Celestia (i.e., antivirus software, multimedia software such as REAL Player, Musicmatch, etc.) Graphics programs are notorious for consuming system resources and even the best of graphics cards are better off without competing for those resources.

=== Celestia still crashes, draws funny stuff or is extremely slow. What can I do? ===

Report the exact circumstances and details of your hardware and software in the &quot;Celestia Bugs&quot; forum. Celestia runs on many different hardware and software configurations. It is not appropriate to ask people to guess what you have. For example: 

 Problem: Celestia crashes when I look at Saturn with Ring Shadows enabled 
 System: 256MB 1GHz Pentium 4, Windows 98 2nd ed 
 Graphics: 128MB Radeon 9700, Catalyst 3.2, OpenGL v1.3.9088 
 Program: Celestia v1.3.0 

Hopefully you know the System information. If you're running Windows, System details usually are available in the Control Panel's System Properties menu. 

Some of the Graphics information can be found in Celestia's Help menu. If you're running Windows, more details can be found in the Control Panel's Display Properties menu.

=== Where can I get another version of Celestia that might work better? ===

Older versions of Celestia are available on [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302  SourceForge] v1.2.4 is extremely robust, but does not include many recent features. 

&quot;Prerelease&quot; versions of Celestia for Windows often are available on Shatters.net. Look in http://www.shatters.net/celestia/files/ and http://www.shatters.net/~claurel/celestia/files/ 
The most recent &quot;prerelease&quot; (e.g. V1.5.0pre3 or later) may work for you, but may be even worse.

===  I want to see all possible Celestia eye candy. What kind of graphics card should I get? ===

:Cards based on Nvidia FX 5nnn, GF 6nnn, 7nnn, 8nnn or newer chipsets with 128MB of memory or more will show all of Celestia's eye candy. For example, an inexpensive FX 5200 will show all of the eye candy drawn by Celestia v1.3.2 and v1.4.0, althogh not as quickly as more expensive cards. 

''All other cards'' have limitations or problems when used with the current versions of Celestia. 

# Any graphics card with drivers that support OpenGL v1.4 will show most, but not all, of the eye candy. (e.g. Nvidia GF4 Ti 4nnn series cards cannot show smooth shadow borders although it can show haze; No ATI Radeon cards can show haze or smooth shadow borders. The ATI limitations may be solved in Celestia v1.4.0 when it is finished.) 
# Other cards work, too, but with various additional limitations. (e.g. Nvidia MX cards cannot show ring shadows cast on planets; ATI Rage cards cannot show specular highlights or bumpmap shadows.) 
# Many graphics chipset designs, as well as Microsoft's OpenGL software, are limited to displaying Celestia's Basic and Multitexture &quot;Render Paths&quot;. They can't display bumpmaps or specular reflections, for example. 

Background: 

Starting with Celestia v1.4.0, you will be able to see multiple shadows cast by multiple light sources if your card supports &quot;GL_ARB_shading_language_100&quot; and &quot;GL_ARB_fragment_shader&quot;. These routines are part of the OpenGL V2.0 standard, but are included in the v66.nn and later ForceWare graphics drivers for Nvidia FX 5nnn and later cards. They also are included in the v4.nn and later Catalyst graphics drivers for ATI's Radeon 9500 cards and higher. 

Starting with Celestia v1.3.2, improved eclipse and ring shadows are visible if your card has &quot;GL_ARB_fragment_program&quot; and uses floating point to do the graphics calculations. Unfortunately, Celestia v1.3.2 supports these features only on Nvidia FX 5nnn and GF 6nnn cards and not on any others. 

In order for Celestia to be able to show bumpmap shadows and specular reflections, your card's OpenGL library must support OpenGL v1.4. In particular, it needs to include &quot;GL_ARB_vertex_program&quot;. 

As of February, 2004, only Nvidia and ATI have invested the effort in providing OpenGL v1.4 and later. The other graphics chip vendors have not yet upgraded their OpenGL libraries. However, Matrox Parhelia cards seem to have many of the necessary v1.4 features in their v1.3 libraries. 

Note: The authors of Celestia only have cards with Nvidia graphics chips. Other types of cards sometimes have problems.

=== Sometimes when Celestia captures an image of its window, there's an ugly bright rectangle in the picture. How can I get rid of it? ===
Sometimes a bright area is recorded where the file requestor menu or any other window overlaps Celestia's main window. 

This bug seems to be fixed in Celestia v1.4.0 and later, which is available on [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302  SourceForge].

Here are some suggestions for minimizing this problem: 
# Often the problem will go away if you toggle &quot;Show Galaxies&quot; off and on again before you take your snapshot. Either you can use the Render/View Options menu or you can type the letter &quot;U&quot; twice before you press &quot;F10&quot;. 
# Run Celestia in windowed mode, not full-screen. Drag the file requestor away from in front of the main window before you click on &quot;Save&quot;. 
# If your graphics card supports it, you can connect a secondary display. Some CRTs are very inexpensive. Drag the file requestor to the other screen. 
# Use an external screen-dump command or program. 

Windows includes a &quot;print-screen&quot; command. Under XP, you can use the keyboard combination Ctrl Print-Screen to write the screen image to the clipboard. You can then use any Paint program and Paste the image into it.

=== Sometimes a screenshot captured in Celestia will have multiple boxes around it, as if Multiview was on. How can I get rid of it? ===
To make a good clean screenshot image, press [Ctrl + D] before you capture the image. This cancels Multiview. 

(provided by ElPelado)

=== I can't turn off the Red/Green diamond in the center of the selected planets. ===
You have to press Ctrl+k. Markers can be turned on and off in the &quot;Render/View Options...&quot; menu of Celestia v1.3.1 pre3 and later. 

(provided by ElPelado)

=== Why won't the &quot;Set Simulation Time&quot; menu let me put in a date before 1752? ===

This problem has been fixed in Celestia v1.4.1 and later, available on [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302 SourceForge]: the Windows date/time input routine is no longer used.

September 1752 is when Great Britain and its colonies converted from the [[w:Julian calendar|Julian calendar]] to the [[w:Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar]]. This changed the day on which the new year started and also lost 11 days from that year. 

Earlier versions of the Windows version of Celestia used Microsoft's date/time input routines. Microsoft didn't want to bother with the complexities of converting between Gregorian and Julian dates. This problem does not exist in the Linux version of Celestia.

== I want to write some scripts for Celestia. How can I do it? ==
Briefly: 
:Celestia includes a very simple scripting language of its own which understands commands like &quot;go here, look there, set flag, display text&quot;. These commands should go into a file with the filetype .CEL 

For more information see [[Celestia/Scripting]]

== Questions about objects (not) seen in Celestia ==

=== Why are my favorite stars not in Celestia? ===
Celestia v1.3.2 includes only stars that had their distances measured by the [[w:Hipparcos|Hipparcos]] satellite. Hipparcos was not used to measure the distances to many dim, variable or close double stars. Someone may have created an Add-on that includes your stars, though. Or consider creating the necessary STC file yourself and contributing it. 

More recent versions of Celestia include all of the stars within 20 LY of the Sun, as well as about 200 double stars. (There are actually many more double stars than that, but relatively few have had their orbital parameters accurately measured.)

=== The Sun and the Moon are much too small in Celestia. What's wrong? ===
Their diameters are exactly right. As seen from the earth, they both are about a half-degree across. Celestia's window is about 45 degrees across, so the Sun and Moon are about 1% of that. They are drawn only 10 pixels wide if your screen is 1024x768. 

Remember that your computer screen is only about 10-20 degrees wide in your own [[w:field of view|field of view]]. Celestia's 45 degree field provides a &quot;wide angle&quot; view of the sky. This makes objects look smaller than you might expect. 

The apparent large size of the Sun and Moon as we see them in the sky is a psychological illusion. There are several different explanations for this. If you take a picture of the moon with a camera lens that has the same field of view as Celestia, you may be surprised at the small size of its image. 

At least one book has been written about this effect: 
''The Mystery of the Moon Illusion: Exploring Size Perception'', by Helen Ross and Cornelis Plug. [http://www.astronomyedinburgh.org/publications/journals/46/moonillusion Review of their book] 

A simple experiment was suggested by &quot;HarrieS&quot;, a guest on the Celestia forum: 

:Here is something you might try: a finger at arm's length is about two degrees wide for most  people. That means that you can fit four moons side by side. Go outside and check it. Now have a direct look at your finger indoors. Can you still believe that four moons will fit on it? 

And Dalle of the Forum wrote 

:But if your head is positioned e.g. 70 cm away from your e.g. 17&quot; monitor, which measures 32 cm across (at least mine does), then the effective field of view looking at the Celestia sky &quot;through&quot; your monitor screen is 2*arctan((32/2)/70)) ~ 26 °. Hence, if you decrease the Celestia field-of-view to 26° you may get a more accurate appearence of what you would see looking out the window.

=== Celestia's galaxies are ugly, dim, grey blobs. How can I get colorful galaxies that look like the real things? ===
The real things '''are''' dim, grey blobs. Your eyes are not sensitive to color at the very low light levels emitted by distant galaxies. 

Many of the colorful pictures you're used to seeing are enhanced by long exposures on sensitive color film. Others are imaginative &quot;false color&quot; combinations of narrow-band [[w:CCD |CCD]] images designed to make visible the specific features of interest to the investigators. The colors of those pictures aren't realistic at all. 

You can add a colorful object to Celestia by creating a 3DS model with appropriate images as surface textures. Define it as a [[w:Nebula|Nebula]] in a DSC file. Use the Search command in the Celestia &quot;Development&quot; and &quot;Add-On&quot; forums to find examples.

=== Why are there no stars beyond about 16,000 light years? Why are there no stars in distant galaxies? ===

[[w:Hipparcos|Hipparcos]] could only measure parallax to a value of about 1 milli-arc-second. For details, please read the thread [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=822]
Celestia currently has technical limitations which prevent it from drawing stars beyond a distance of about 16,000 LY from the sun. 

On the second page of the thread mentioned above [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=9424], Chris wrote about some of the tradeoffs in the current version of Celestia.

=== Sometimes the planets and moons are way far away from where their orbits are drawn. Why? ===
To draw the [[w:orbit|orbits]], Celestia only calculates 100 or so precise locations and then draws straight lines between them. If the orbiting body doesn't happen to be close to one of those 100 points, then it won't be very close to the line, either. The position of the orbiting body is calculated very accurately. The lines aren't. 

Celestia only calculates a few points around the orbit in order to minimize the amount of computation needed between frames. The more calculations are required, the slower the frame rate is. 

Starting with Celestia v1.3.2, you can specify the number of segments in an orbit track. Use your favorite text editor to modify the file celestia.cfg. Change the line 

 OrbitPathSamplePoints  100
Increase 100 to 500 or larger.

=== Why does the illumination level in Celestia not fall off the farther from the Sun I go - surely it should be very dark by the time I get to Pluto? ===
The human eye can adapt to a very wide range of illuminations, so it wouldn't be as dark out there as you think - about the level of moderate indoor lighting, in which you can see very well. At the other end of the scale, your computer monitor is physically incapable of generating the brightness of illumination that pertains on the inner planets. Fortunately it doesn't need to, since all that would happen would be that your pupils would constrict to reduce the incoming light to a more comfortable level. 

So in summary - 
# There's no way Celestia can display &quot;realistic&quot; brightnesses on your computer screen; but 
# such &quot;realism&quot; is unnecessary because your eyes merely adapt to compensate. 

(Provided by Grant Hutchison) 

=== When I try to capture a picture or movie, the image is stretched out of proportion. ===
(Thanks to DaveMc for these tips!) Here are three things you can try... 
# Check the OpenGL anti-aliasing setting of your graphics card. If it is on, try turning it off, or setting it to another option. This seems unrelated to the anti-aliasing setting inside of Celestia. 
# Set your graphics card OpenGL options to &quot;default&quot;. 
# Get the most recent drivers for your graphics card. 

(Provided by Don G.) 

=== How can I make Celestia work like a planetarium? I want to see how the sky should look from my backyard. ===
If you're running Celestia v1.3.0 or later 
# Select the body from which to observe; e.g. type '''H''' then '''3''' to select Earth,
# Use the '''GoTo menu''' to specify your [[w:Longitude|Longitude]] and [[w:Latitude|Latitude]] and GoTo there (lat &amp; long are entered in decimal format - there are websites that convert to/from degrees/minute/seconds format, such as [http://www.geology.enr.state.nc.us/gis/latlon.html this one],)
# Type '''y''' = Sync Orbit (this locks you into position above the location you set),
# Type (Windows:'''Ctrl-G''') (Linux:'''Alt-S''') = Goto Surface,
# Type (Windows:'''Ctrl-F''') (Linux:'''Alt-F''') = change Arrow keys to AltAzimuth mode (this keeps the horizon level when panning left &amp; right),
# Use the arrow keys to look toward the sky, you can adjust the field of view (FOV - how much sky you see at once) with the ''',''' &amp; '''.''' keys.

Unfortunately, there is not (yet) an alt-az coordinate system display, but typing a ; will turn on the [[w:equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinate system]] display.  There are some scripts which add alt-az display, such as ''[http://celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/show_addon_details.php?addon_id=900 Planetarium]''.

=== Why can't I see Mir or Galileo? I know they're defined in Celestia. ===
Set Celestia's simulation time to be when the spacecraft was in orbit. Celestia does not display spacecraft if they are not in orbit at the time of the simulation. 

For example, [[w:Mir|Mir]] was launched on February 20, 1986, and reentered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, at 05:55 GMT. Celestia will show Mir only if you set the time to be somewhere between those two dates. 

This is controlled by Beginning and Ending directives in the definition of Mir in solarsys.ssc. If you remove those statements, Celestia will always draw Mir in orbit. 

Addendum provided Tech Sgt. Chen: 

Mir, along with certain other spacecraft models, were modeled within an historical time frame and can only be viewed between the mission start and end dates. You can override ending dates by opening the solarsys.ssc or other specific craft related .SSC files and placing a pound sign (#) in front of the ending date string. Then save the new setting. This way you can always view your installed Space Crafts. Consequently, removing the pound sign will return the craft to its natural time frame.

=== Positions on Mars are on the opposite side of the planet or bumps seem to be half a world away from the mountains or it's dark where it should be daylight. Why???? ===

You have a misaligned map. 

Celestia requires that all maps have 0 degrees of longitude in the center, with 180 degrees of longitude at the edges. All of the surface texture image maps of all of the moons and planets that come with Celestia have this alignment. 

In contrast, many maps of Mars were created with 0 degrees of longitude at the left and right edges, and with 180 degrees of longitude in the center. This includes the maps on www.shatters.net in Fridger's [http://www.shatters.net/ &quot;Texture Foundry&quot;]. 

Using a map with 0 at the edge would cause the symptoms you describe. You need to cut the map in half and exchange the halves or you need to find a map that's properly aligned.

=== My planet's rings are drawn as a featureless oval. It used to work. What's wrong? ===

You need to use a smaller ring image, one that is no wider than your graphic card's OpenGL texture buffer. 

To see how large your OpenGL texture buffer is, use Celestia's menu Help &quot;OpenGL Info&quot;. Near the beginning it has a line that starts with &quot;Max texture size:&quot; 

Older versions of Celestia scaled down large ring texture images so they'd fit into the smaller texture buffer of your OpenGL graphics driver. Celestia v1.3.1 and later no longer do that. 

Some older cards, like 3dfx Voodoos, only have a 256 byte buffer. Modern cards have a 2K or 4K buffer. Microsoft's software version of OpenGL only has a 1K buffer. 

=== Celestia's orbit for the ISS is out of date. How can I get a better one? ===
The orbit of the [[w:International Space Station|International Space Station]] changes continuously in ways that are almost impossible to predict due to things like [[w:atmospheric drag|atmospheric drag]], light pressure, cargo ship docking, etc. If you want an accurate orbit, you'll have to update it on a daily basis. 

ISS TLEs (Two Line Elements) are posted to the [[w:AMSAT|AMSAT]] SAREX mailing list regularly by &quot;Dave Larsen PhD&quot;. [http://www.amsat.org/amsat/archive/sarex/31day/threads.html] 

Here are the ISS TLE orbital parameters for August 16th, 2004: 

    ISS
    1 25544U 98067A   04229.23839543  .00019757  00000-0  15906-3 0  4532
    2 25544  51.6323  19.1941 0005251 117.9988 304.8582 15.70921896327755

Grant Hutchison has provided a spreadsheet to convert TLEs into Celestia SSCs[http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/~seb/celestia/hutchison/spreadsheets.html#2] 

Also, don't forget that Celestia models the shape of the Earth using a [[w:spheroid|spheroid]]. [[w:Spherical Earth|The actual shape of our planet]] is much more complicated. As a result, a view from the Earth's surface in Celestia is not accurate enough to show the correct path across the sky of satellites in low Earth orbit like the ISS. Another issue is that Celestia v1.5.1 and earlier use a fixed rotation speed for the Earth. Since the Earth's rotation is variable, the surface of Celestia's Earth is displaced from where it should be. Celestia v1.6 will use a more accurate variable rotation speed. In other words, you can't use Celestia to find out where to look in the sky to see the ISS.

=== I have a previous version of Celestia with tons of addons, custom textures, etc. How can I update to the latest version without having to reinstall all of those addons, textures, etc? ===

You can have more than one copy of Celestia on your system at the same time. 

Rename the directory (folder) where you have Celestia now, maybe to Celestia131. 

Verify that things still work: Double-click on the icon for Celestia131\Celestia.exe and look around in your universe. 

Install the new copy of Celestia and tell it to use the directory Celestia. It'll create the folder again and install itself there. 

Move your Addons at leisure. 

Cel:// URLs run the copy of Celestia that is in the folder named Celestia. If you want to change back to using your old Celestia that way, just rename the directories again: rename Celestia to be Celestia132 and rename Celestia131 to be Celestia.

=== I've compared the Celestia texture for Venus/Ida/Miranda with one I've found in a book or on the Web, and Celestia's map is upside down. What's going on? ===

Many sources for planetary maps (such as the [[w:USGS|USGS]]) use a mapping convention called &quot;ecliptic north&quot; - the north pole of any planet or [[w:asteroid|asteroid]] is defined as being whichever rotational pole points north of the plane of the [[w:ecliptic|ecliptic]] (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun). Each planet or asteroid can then be classified as a &quot;direct&quot; rotator, if it rotates in the same direction as the Earth when observed from above its north pole (i.e. counterclockwise); or as a &quot;retrograde&quot; rotator, if it rotates in the opposite direction. 

But Celestia uses an equally valid mapping convention called &quot;rotational north&quot; - north is defined as being the pole around which the planet appears to rotate counterclockwise, irrespective of that pole's orientation relative to the ecliptic. 

For direct rotators, this difference is irrelevant - &quot;north&quot; turns out to be the same direction in both mapping conventions. But for retrograde rotators, Celestia's north pole corresponds to ecliptic south - so you will find many maps of retrograde rotators like [[w:Venus (planet)|Venus]], [[w:243 Ida|Ida]] and the moons of [[w:Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] that appear to be upside down relative to those in Celestia. If you want to convert such maps for use in Celestia, you'll have to turn them through 180 degrees.

== What if I have more questions? ==
If you have a question about Celestia that is not answered above or elsewhere in this [[Celestia| WikiBook]], please ask your question in the [http://www.shatters.net/forum/  Celestia Web Forum], '''''not here'''''. There are many experts reading the Forum, but very few knowledgeable people read the WikiBook. If a question is asked more than once or twice in the Forum, it'll be added to this FAQ.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Input/Output or '''IO''', is an all-encompassing term that describes the way your program interacts with the user. IO comes in two forms, or ''stream'' types: the program's stimuli are collectively referred to as ''input,'' while the medium that the program uses to communicate back, write logs, play sounds, etc. is known as ''output.'' Both types of streams can be redirected either at a lower level than Perl, as is the case when done through the operating system by the shell; or, in Perl itself, as is the case when you reopen the file handles associated with the stream.

==Output==

You have already learned how to output with the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement. A simple reference is provided:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Hello World&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

What this &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement is actually doing is printing to ''STDOUT'', which stands for ''standard output''. Standard output is the default destination for all output. If you wish to print anywhere else you must be explicit. We will revisit this later.

==Input==

As you may have imagined, it's very hard to write a good program without any type of input; here is an example program to teach you these concepts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print &quot;What is your name?\n&quot;;

## Get the users $name from Standard In
my $name = &lt;STDIN&gt;;

print &quot;Your name is $name\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Standard input is usually the keyboard though this can be changed at a lower level than your program. For now we will assume it isn't changed. However, this might not be an assumption you wish to make in production code.

=Unit Exercise=
* Write a program which prompts the user for a number and then returns the number multiplied by four (or any other number).

Welcome to South America, the fourth largest continent on Earth. South America has 14 different countries in it and over 355 million people! The South Americans are famous for their parties, their music, their dances, and their food. The two major languages spoken in South America are Portuguese and Spanish, although French, English and Dutch are also spoken, as well as a variety of indigenous languages. If there are any words in this book you don't understand you can look them up in the glossary.

== Where in the world is South America? ==
To the north of South America lies the Caribbean and Central America, to the east lies the Atlantic Ocean, and past that Africa, to the south lies the coldest continent, Antarctica, and to the west lies the Pacific ocean, and past that Australia, Oceania, and Asia.

[[Image:Argentina_-_Pol%C3%ADtico_2.png|thumb|A map of Argentina showing its reclamation [[Wikijunior:South America/Falkland Islands|Falkland Is.]]]]
'''Argentina''' is the second largest country in South America and the eighth largest in the world. It is located between the Andes mountains on one side and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. Argentina and [[Wikijunior:South America/Chile|Chile]] occupy the most southern part of all South America. The country also borders Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Its capital city is Buenos Aires, inside the ''estuary'' of Rio de la Plata (Silver River).

==What are Argentina's national symbols?==
[[Image:Flag of Argentina.svg|thumb|300px|Argentina's flag]]
[[Image:Coat_of_arms_of_Argentina.svg|thumb|Argentina's coat of arms]]

Argentina's Official Language is Spanish, and its national bird is the Hornero. The National Holiday is Revolution Day, which is on May 25th.

==What are some famous places in Argentina?==
[[Image:Rio de la Plata BA 2.JPG|left|thumb|330px|Satellite picture of the River Plate, and on the right the Sanborombon Bay]]
===The Plains of Pampas===

The Pampa (meaning 'plain' in the Native American Quechua language) is a fertile plain around Buenos Aires in Argentina. It is made up of most of Buenos Aires, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces and also has parts of Córdoba province as well. Parts of the plain extend into the countries of Uruguay and Brazil. 

Plants are very simple in this area. They are mostly grasses and low plants, often growing quickly if water is close. Only these small plants grow, as many fires happen on the plain, destroying any other larger plants. Because of these low plants, much of the area is used for feeding cattle or for growing soybeans.

This kind of plain is also called a ''prairie'' in North America, a ''steppe'' in Europe and Asia, and a ''veld'' in South Africa.

===The Plateau of Patagonia===
A marvelous book about Patagonia is titled &quot;IN PATAGONIA&quot; by Bruce Chatwin which tells the story of Chatwin's journey through the entire length of the region during the 1970s.

===The Andes Mountain Range===

==What important events have happened in Argentina?==
The word ''Argentina'' means ''silver'' in Latin. The country was named after silver because, when shipwrecked Spaniards washed up on Argentina's shore, the indigenous Americans brought them gifts made out of silver.

===The rule of Spain===
Before the European invasion of the Americas, Argentina was rather sparsely populated. Different Native American tribes lived in small villages, and Argentina bordered the Inca empire, but large parts of the country had few inhabitants. The Spanish arrived in 1502 on a voyage of Amerigo Vespucci, the mapmaker that ''America'' was named after. Buenos Aires became a Spanish colony in 1580, and was originally a part of greater Peru. It became an important port after 1776 (with the foundation of the &quot;Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata&quot;), exporting leather and other goods. 

Spain lost control of the region when France defeated Spain in the Napoleonic Wars, and the colonists there became somewhat independent. They even prevented several attempted British takeovers in the early 1800s. On July 9, 1816, Argentina officially declared its independence. 

===Independence===
Unfortunately, the new country's first leaders started a civil war that would last several decades. This resulted in a period of anarchy until Juan Manuel de Rosas unified most of the country under the rule of Buenos Aires. He was a tyrant who killed his opponents and anyone who disagreed with him. He attempted to take over Paraguay and Uruguay, and generally developed bad relations with his neighbors. He was overthrown in 1852 with the support of Uruguay and Brazil, and Argentina got its first constitution.

At this time, most people considered &quot;Argentinians&quot; were ethnically Spanish, with Native Americans still thought of as a menace. The country's economy was based on raising animals. Soon Great Britain became more and more involved with Argentina's economy and politics, and Argentina moved towards being a modern country.

===The Modern World===
In the late 1800s, new farming techniques helped improve the lives of Argentinians, and investment by Britain and others helped provide economic wealth. Immigrants came to Argentina from all over Europe, and better roads and railroads were built. The ''War of the Triple Alliance'' against Paraguay was bloody and expensive, but Argentina soon recovered and gained new prosperity, mainly due to trade with Europe. Buenos Aires became known as the ''Paris of the Americas''.

==What are Argentina's people like?==
About 40 million people live in Argentina. They have backgrounds from many other countries and origins. Almost 88 % of the population comes from Italian or Spanish roots, and Argentinians come from many other countries as well. Fifty six percent of the Argentinians have native roots (different kinds of hybridization); only 2 or 3 % of Argentinians are Pure Native American.

In Argentina, you can often find the influences of many different cultures. Pizza and pasta from Italy are very popular here, but so is native maize and pumpkin. Many Jewish sweets and German dishes are also thought of as part of Argentinian food. Tango originated in Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Uruguay), and is very popular throughout Argentina, though many different musical styles are enjoyed. Argentina is more of a melting pot of various cultures than any other South American country.

Despite all this, nearly everyone in Argentina speaks Spanish, the official language, and most Argentinians are Roman Catholic.
About 1 million people a year convert to different religions however.

==What sports are popular in Argentina?==

Although its national sport is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato Pato], Soccer remains the most popular sport in Argentina. The Argentine Soccer team has won two World Cups, and Diego Armando Maradona, one of its players, is famous all over the world.  Other popular sports include Tennis, Rugby, Polo, Basketball and Boxing.

Bolivia is a landlocked country in the center of South America. It is bordered by [[../Brazil/]] to the north and east, [[../Paraguay/]] and [[../Argentina/]] to the south, and [[../Chile/]] and [[../Peru/]] to the west.
Its capital is La Paz. At 11,740 ft (3,580 m) above sea level, it is the highest capital in the world. Bolivia is named after Simon Bolivar, one of the greatest South American generals.

==National Symbols==

==Famous Places==

==Geography of Bolivia==
The west of Bolivia is covered by the [[../The Andes|Andes]] mountain range.  The ''Andes'' is divided in two branches. The ''Altiplano'' is a large plateau which is in the west of the country between the two branches of the ''Altiplano''. The west also contains the largest salt flats on earth, Salar de Uyuni. There is also the largest lake commercially available for transport, Lake Titicaca, which was historically important to the indigenous people and now is an important tourist location. The highest peak in Bolivia is also a volcano, and its name is ''Nevado del Sajama''.

==History of Bolivia==
Divided into three distinct periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, and republican.

There are six places in Bolivia declared World Heritage for their contributions to world history.
Two of them specifically acknowledge indigenous or native cultures: Tiwanaku, which was an archaeological site particularly well known for pre-Columbian pottery and also Chiquitos which the Spanish Conquistadors found after looking at Indian doors and is well known for music.

== History ==
In 1531 Spanish conquistadors under Francisco Pizarro entered Bolivia. Within two years they controlled the territory known as Alto Peru. In 1544 silver was discovered at Potosi. Native and African slaves were forced to work the silver mines and enriched Spain for over the next 200 years. The slaves were encouraged to chew on coca leaves which became a part of the native culture. 

In 1548 La Paz was founded as ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (Our Lady of Peace). It became the capital in 1898.
Bolivia won its independence from Spain in 1825. The first elected president was General Simon Bolivar who had lead the Bolivian forces in defeating the Spanish. The following year Antonio José de Sucre drew up Bolivia's constitution, and the country received its name. In 1828 Sucre was forced to resign, and since then Bolivia has been ruled for the most part by a succession of military dictators.

For over 350 years Bolivia's western boundary extended to the Pacific Ocean. But following a war with Chile in 1883, Bolivia lost its Pacific coastal area thereby becoming landlocked. In subsequent wars with Brazil (1903) and Paraguay (1935), Bolivia lost land in the east including rubber plantations, but came just short of losing important oil and natural gas resources. 

In the 1890s mining corporations interested in Bolivia's tin began to control the country. In 1952 the government was taken over by a revolutionary party, the MNR, which seized the mines, taking them over to be owned by the government. The MNR also divided the estates of the wealthy landowners into smaller farms for their former tenants and peasants, who previously worked the land but didn't own it. 

In 1964 the army took over the government of Bolivia. Since then Bolivia has had a string of generals as presidents, most of them in office for less than a full term.

In 1982 Siles Zuazo became Bolivia's first democratic, civilian president in over 40 years.  Currently the President is Evo Morales, elected 2006.

There are nearly ten million people in Bolivia. Half to nearly two-thirds of people in Bolivia belong to indigenous cultures, which is relatively unusual for a South American country.  Over two hundred different languages are spoken by at least as many native nations.  Many of those are close to becoming extinct. The largest indigenous group is the Quechua with two and a half million people. There are also the Aymara, and two smaller groups known as the Guaraní and the Chiquitano. There are also many Europeans, Asians and people from other ethnic groups.

If you were a Bolivian man, you could expect to live until you were 62 and if you were a Bolivian woman, you could expect to live to be 68. You would also be expected to give birth to three children, but many children attend school for a year or less.

Much of Bolivia is in poverty, and many people work on farms, while cities continue to grow due to former peasant trying to find a livelihood there. Eighty-seven percent of Bolivians can read and write.

The three official languages are Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara.

There are at least four large cities which are growing rapidly : La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.

==What types of things are exported?==
Soy products, zinc, natural gas, and tin.

==What is school like?==

==What is the food like?==
It is the most well known food in all Spanish speaking countries. Delicacies include fruits from the forest with honey.
The food in the north is spicy and full of flavor.  Saltenas, a juicy chicken or beef empanada is one of the most famous worldwide foods.

==What music is popular?==

==What sports are popular?==
Soccer is the most popular sport in the country. Volleyball, Tennis, Horseback riding, Automobile Racing, and Basketball are also popular.

== History of Chile ==

People first came to the area now called Chile around ten thousand years ago. They may have descendants of the first Native Americans who came from Asia during the Ice Age, but some people think that their ancestors &quot;island-hopped&quot; across the Pacific. The area was good for fishing and offered decent opportunities for hunting and agriculture, but it was separated from the rest of South America by the Andes mountains, and so it was not as widely inhabited as other parts of the continent.

No one knows for sure why the place was called &quot;Chile&quot;. Some people think it is a variation on the name of an ancient Indian chief called Tili. Others think it may be a word in an Indian language for &quot;the place where the land ends&quot;, &quot;snow&quot;, or the sound of a bird's call. No matter where the name came from, the Spanish soldiers who invaded the land in the 16th century said that the people there called themselves &quot;men of Chile&quot;.

The Spanish, searching for gold, reported that hundreds of thousands of people lived in the area. Although they never did find any gold or silver in the region, they admired the agricultural possibilities of the area and governed it as a part of the colony they called the Viceroyalty of Peru. The native peoples were not happy about being taken over, and there were frequent uprisings and rebellions. When slavery was outlawed in 1683, the situation improved and revolts became less common.

In 1810, the Chilean people declared they were an independent country, and not under Spanish control. Spain disagreed, and war broke out. But seven years later Chile was recognized as its own country. Still, little changed for the average Chilean. The country was still run by wealthy landowners, and the average citizen had few rights. In the late 19th century, a democracy was set up, but the leaders in parliament were concerned primarily with protecting the land-owners at the expense of the working class. As poor Chileans became more politically powerful and organized, they were able to elect a leftist president in 1920 who tried to change the laws to benefit the working class. Some were promoting communism, and conservatives in the country were alarmed. So in 1924, a general took over the country by force, leading to a violent and unstable period. 

When democracy was finally restored, the people voted in governments which kept the country relatively stable for many decades. Liberal parties appealed to people by promoting programs to feed the poor and provide housing and education. Conservative parties appealed to people by securing better relationships with the United States and loans from American banks. It was a healthy democracy. 

In 1970, a man named Salvador Allende was elected. As a leftist, he was very popular for his programs for the poor and working class. But as part of these programs, he took over foreign mines and banks in the country, which angered foreign investors. Actions that the United States took in retaliation hurt the country economically. In 1973, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) engineered a coup that led to Allende's death and put Augusto Pinochet, a military dictator, in power.

Pinochet greatly improved relations with the United States and the economy, but took away many rights of Chileans. Thousands of people were executed, imprisoned, or tortured for their political views. Many Chileans see this as a dark time in history. When Pinochet stepped down after losing an election, democracy happily returned to the country, and Chile has had an improved human rights situation since that time.

==Chile's Geography==
[[File:Mapa administrativo de Chile.png|Antarctic reclamation|thumb]]
Chile is long and thin, giving it a ribbon-like shape. It is 4,300 kilometers long and its width averages 175 kilometers. Chile is almost double the size of California. 

As a result of Chile's shape, climate varies throughout the country. Chile is dry in the north and cool and damp in the south. Chile's terrain also varies. 

The north is made up of desert. This Northern Desert region extends from the Peruvian border in north to the Aconcagua River north of Valparaiso. There is hardly any rainfall which means that there is almost no plant life. The land is barren and remote which means that it is free from air pollution and bright artificial lights. As a result, it is a great place to study the stars and planets -- in fact Northern Chile is the location for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory where astronomers do just that. In this region you'll find one of the driest spots on Earth, the Atacama desert. The Atacama desert is so dry that a 1971 rainfall was the first precipitation recorded in the desert town of Calama in 400 years. 

Southern Chile is icy and has a windswept coast. In the south, there are snow-capped volcanoes, thick forests, glaciers and lakes. 

Chile has a rugged coastline. 

Chile's eastern border is home to the Andes mountains. The Andes extend along Chile's border with Argentina and Bolivia. 

Between the Andes and the lower mountains of Chile's west coast, you'll find the Central Valley. This is a mild, fertile region. Several rivers run through this region which is considered to be the heartland of Chile and the center of its population. The Central Valley is also where most of the farms and factories are. The Central Valley is made up of orchards, vineyards, pastures and croplands. 

Santiago is the capital of Chile. Other major cities in Chile include: Concepcion-Talcahuano, Vina del Mar-Valparaiso, Antofagasta and Temuco.

==Chile's People==
Chile is home to 16.4 million people. 6 million Chileans live in Santiago. Men are expected to live to age 75 and women to age 81. Most people in Chile speak Spanish. Christianity is the major religion in Chile. 69.9% of Chileans are Roman Catholic and 15% are Protestant. 

About three quarters of Chileans are mestizos, people of mixed Spanish and Indian heritage. About a fifth of Chileans are of European descent, mostly Spanish or British. About three percent come from unmixed Indian ancestry. Just a few thousand people are of African origin, or Zambo&amp;mdash;people of mixed Indian and African heritage.

[[image:co-map.png|frame|right|Colombia is in the northwest of South America. It borders Venezuela to the east, Brazil to the southeast, and Peru and Ecuador to the south. It also has a short border with Panama.]]

'''Colombia''' is a country in the northwest of South America. It is home to forty-eight million people. This includes nine million or more people living in the capital ''Bogota D.C.'' (Bogota Distrito Capital = Capital District of Bogota). Nearly three-quarters of the Colombian people live in cities, as compared to under two-thirds at the year 1955.

Of the people, 1.4% are indigenous Amerindians. They live in the eastern lands and around the country. A third have less than 15 years of age, two-thirds are aged between 15 and 64 years, and five percent have more than 64 years. The average Colombian man today has an expected life 67 years; the average Colombian woman today has an expected life 76 years. For each 1000 Colombians, 22 babies are born each year, and 5 people die each year.

Most Colombians live in western Colombia in the valleys and basins of the Andes Mountains.

== Culture of Colombia ==
Colombians are generally close to their families, especially because of the Catholic faith of most Colombians. Many families are extended as well as nuclear. Godparents (padrinos) are particularly important. They give money and help the family of the child in his or her upbringing.

Many women in Colombia are working outside the home, and are professionals and in high positions in government, education, etc.

==What are Colombia's national symbols?==
The flag of Colombia has yellow, blue and red stripes. The yellow is wider than the other two and represents the native gold, blue indicates two oceans and red represents the blood spent in the struggle for independence from Spain.

The Coat of Arms of Colombia contains a shield with numerous symbols. Perched on top of the shield is a condor holding olives. The national flag is draped on each side of the shield. On the shield itself, there are ships, a Phrygian cap, a pomegranate and two horns of plenty containing fruit and gold and silver coins.
[[Image:North_CB.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The city of Bogotá is high in the Andes mountains.]]

==What are some famous places in Colombia?==
Bogotá is the capital of Colombia, as well as the county's largest city with more than eight million inhabitants. The first European settlement was in 1538, but it was a population center for the native Muiscas long before that. Bogotá is the business hub of the nation and is home to Colombia's stock market. It also has many schools, Universities, and colleges.

==What important events have happened in Colombia?==
There were two main groups living in Colombia before Spanish Colonization. They were the Carib and the Chibcha. A Chibchan tribe called the Muisca lived in the region where Bogota is now. The Muisca traded salt, emeralds, beans, maize and other crops with other tribes. 

The first permanent Spanish settlement, at Santa Marta, was founded in 1525. In 1549, Santa Fe de Bogota became the capital of New Granada. New Grenada was what the Spanish called the area that is now Colombia.

In 1819, forces led by Simon Bolivar won Colombia’s independence. At first, Colombia, Venezeula, Panama and some other nearby areas were all part of a country called Gran Colombia (Greater Colombia). Venezuela and Ecuador split off from Colombia first. Later Panama revolted, and gained its independence.

In the last forty years of the twentieth century, there was civil war in Colombia. This war continues today. The main combatants are the Colombian military, independent private armies (called paramilitaries), and two different rebel groups. The Colombian government is working to disarm the paramilitary and disarm or defeat the rebels.

==What is the natural environment like in Colombia?==
Colombia is very close to the equator and parts of the country are very hot. The country also has many high mountains and the higher the altitude the cooler the climate. Colombia has less than 1% of the world's area, but 10% of the species in the world can be found there. There is a wide variety of birds there too. Almost 15% of the world's species of birds are found in Colombia.

==What types of things are exported from Colombia?==
Colombia exports oil and petroleum products. Colombia is also renowned all over the world for its coffee. The coffee is mainly grown in volcanic soil on plantations in the Andes mountains. Colombia has many delicious native fruits that it sells. Colombia produces tropical fruit juices and concentrates. Cut flowers are another product that Colombia is famous for, they are sold to the rest of the world. Colombia is also famous for their roses. They ship roses all across the world for countries to sell.

==What is school like in Colombia?==
Most Colombian kids go to primary school between the ages of 6 and 11. Primary schooling is paid for by the government and mandatory for all kids. Still, some kids in this age group do not go to school, especially in rural areas. School is conducted in Spanish. There is often Catholic religious instruction as well as instruction in mathematics, science, reading, and writing. 

In rural areas there may be many different ages in the same classroom. Because many of the students in rural areas are poor some must frequently miss school so they can work. Some rural Colombian schools are ''&quot;New Schools&quot;''. They provide guidebooks that allow students to work self-directed at their own pace with assistance from an instructor and other students. Students of all ages will sit at a large table each working on a different course of study from their guidebooks. 

Only half of Colombian kids continue their education into secondary school. Secondary school starts at age 11 and continues for six years. Unlike some other countries, there is no vocational training in secondary school. Colombia has twenty-four public Universities, so there are opportunities for good students to pursue higher education.

==What is the food like in Colombia?==
[[Image:Banpaisa.png|thumb|right|300px|Bandeja paisa is a dish with beans, rice and a fried egg.]]Colombians eat a wide variety of meats, vegetables, and fruits.

Vallenato is a musical genre characterized by instruments like accordion, guacharaca, etc. Big vallenato singers are: Diomedes Diaz, Los Hermanos Zuletas, Los Betos, Ivan Villazon, El Binomio de oro, etc. Today, there are a lot of new and great vallenato singers.

Champeta is another type of music develop in the Atlantic Coast, especially in Cartagena. At the beginning it was rejected because it was considered not appropriate, since the singers came from low-status families, the content in it was not appropriate and its dancing was very sensual. Today is well recognized and played in most of Colombian cities.
==What sports are popular in Colombia?==
Some of the national sports include soccer, tennis, baseball, and bicycle racing, and also competitive skating. The indigenous people contributed the ancient game ''TEJO!'' to Colombia.

'''Ecuador''' is one of the smaller countries in South America.  It is located in the northwest region of South America, south of [[../Colombia/]] and north of [[../Peru/]].  

Ecuador is named because it sits along the equator. Ecuador's western border is the Pacific Ocean.  The two biggest cities in Ecuador are the capital, Quito, and the port of Guayaquil.

==National Symbols==
[[Image:Flag_of_Ecuador.svg‎|thumb|200px|right|The Flag of Ecuador]]

Spanish is the official language of Ecuador. The Coat of arms is a national symbol of Ecuador. You can see it in center of the flag to the right.

==What is the country's history?==
Before the Spanish came to South America, Ecuador was part of the Inca Empire.  The Spanish conquered the area in 1534.  Ecuador became independent from Spain in 1822, but was part of a country called Gran Colombia until 1830. The Gran Colombia was composed of Colombia,  [[../Venezuela/]], Ecuador, and Panama. During that time the province of Panama belonged to Colombia which is why it became part of the Gran Colombia.

[[Image:Ecuador_cajas_national_park.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cajas National Park]]

==What is the country's Geography?==
Ecuador can be divided into 4 main regions: Coast (Costa), Highlands (Sierra), the East (Oriente), and the archipelago (island group) of Galápagos. The population of Ecuador is 11.5 million.

In Ecuador, the roses are extremely beautiful. Thousand of flower farms plant and export various kinds of roses to EU, US, Russia, Hong Kong, Japan.

==What are the people like?==
The main languages in Ecuador are Spanish and Quechua. Spanish is spoken by most people, not only in cities, but also in rural areas. Quechua is a language that was brought to the region by the Incas about half a millennium ago, and it is spoken by their descendants. Most Quechua speakers in Ecuador live in the Sierra or in the Oriente. Though many Quechua speakers are bilingual, there are some Quechua speakers who don't speak Spanish, especially in areas far away from larger cities.

There are also several important ethnic groups, like Zapara, Tsáchila, Chachi, Cofan, Hoao, Cayapa, Awa, Shuar, Achuar, Siona, Secoya, afro-Ecuadorian and Montubio; most of them speak their own language.

[[Image:Blason de la Guyane.svg|thumb|150px|right|French Guiana's logo]]
French Guiana is an overseas department of France, located on the northern coast of South America. Like France, its currency is the euro. 

==History==
French Guiana was originally inhabited by a number of American Peoples. It was settled by the French in the 17th Century. A border dispute with Brazil occurred in the late 19th century over a large area of the jungle. This dispute caused the French Guiana to be an independent state until it could be resolved. In 1946, French Guiana became an overseas department of France. In the 1970s Hmong refugees came from Laos and settled in. In the 1970s and 1980s there became an increase of French people moving to settle in the area.

==Geography==
The French Guiana area is tropical and is usually hot and humid with a total area of 91,000 kilometers squared. There is little seasonal temperature difference with dry summers and rainy winters. French Guiana's population is around 209,000, most of whom live along the coastal region. Much of French Guiana is a national park.

Guyana, officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is the only country of the Commonwealth of Nations on the mainland of South America. It is bordered to the east by Suriname, to the south and southwest by Brazil and to the west by Venezuela. It is the fourth-smallest country on the mainland of South America (after Suriname, French Guiana, and Uruguay).

==Geography==
[[Image:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Parrots can be found in Guyana's Rain forests.]]
Guyana can be divided into four natural regions: a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic (low coastal plain) coast where most of the population lives, then a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits, the dense rainforests (Forested Highland Region) across the middle of the country, the grassy flat savannah in the south and finally the larger interior highlands (interior savannah) made up of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.

There are many rivers in the country, the three main ones being the Essequibo, the Demerara, and the Berbice.The local climate is tropical and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast trade winds along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.

Guyana has one of the largest unspoiled rain forests in South America. It covers much of the land area and is the habitat of many animals.

==The People==
English is the official language of Guyana and used, for example, in its schools. There are other languages spoken as well such as Portuguese and Spanish.

The most popular religions in Guyana include Christian, Hindu, and Muslim faiths.

=== Itaipu: the largest hydro- electric power plant in the world ===
Paraguay shares with Brazil the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, Itaipu. Itaipu is an indigenous name for &quot;the stone that sings&quot;, because of the sound that the water produces when it hits the stones of that region, formed by huge cascades of Paraná river. The hydroelectric plant of Itaipu is so impressive that it was even called one of the '''seven wonders of modern world'''!

Also, one must take into account the huge amount of money that was stolen by Stroessner government (most of the richest families in Paraguay&amp;mdash;partners of Stroessners' business&amp;mdash;owe their richness to the Itaipú Golden Era) and the environmental impact that resulted from such a construction. Many species that existed only in Paraguay cannot longer be taken into account in existing species.

Today, with the biggest hydroelectric power plant in the world, Paraguay still has a steel factory running on wood as fuel, and the electric train in Asuncion (capital city) is only a nostalgic remembrance. Diesel fumes pervade the country and ash and smoke are the constant ingredients of the electric carnival.
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Flag of Paraguay.svg|left|thumb|The flag of Paraguay.]]

Paraguay is one of only two countries in South America that don't have beaches. It's landlocked by other countries. But nature seems to compensate Paraguay for the missing ocean access: there are many rivers. The most important river is the Rio Paraguay, used mainly for transportation. An other river, the Rio Paraná, is used for electric energy production.

== History of Paraguay ==

== The Chaco plains ==
The Chaco--also known as the &quot;Gran Chaco&quot;-- is a vast plain extending from northern Paraguay to areas of Argentina and Bolivia. This area is essentially dry grassland with occasional dense semi-tropical jungles. This is one of the hottest places in South America. What makes this area special is that the animals and plants have been preserved as they were before it became inhabited by humans. It is one of the few places in the Americas where people have not interfered much with the environment.

== Guarani people ==
Paraguay has a population around 6,670,000. Despite of having [[Wikijunior:Languages/Spanish|Spanish]] as its official language, the majority of Paraguayan people speak the Guaraní language. The Guaraní are a native group of South America, like the Incas or the Comanches of North America.

[[Image:Peru-CIA-Worldfactbook.gif|right|200px]]Welcome to Peru! Peru is the third largest country in South America. Peru is located on the western edge of South America, with The Andes mountains running through it. The Andes cause many of the cities of Peru to be located on the Western side, including the capital, Lima.

==Peru's History==
[[Image:Peru_Machu_Picchu_Sunrise_2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Looking down at the ruins of Machu Picchu at sunrise.]]Peru was at one time the center of the Incan Empire. The old capital of the [[Wikijunior:South America/The Incas|Incas]], Cuzco, meaning ''navel of the world'', was located in the Andes mountains in the southeastern part of the country. The Spanish under the conquistador Pizarro conquered the native Andean culture in 1533 and the country became a part of the Spanish Empire in 1542. Peru was liberated from the rule of Spain by the famous South American general José de San Martin in 1821.

==Peru's Geography==
===The Andes and Machu Picchu===
The Andes take up much of Peru, dividing the country into three sections. The Andes are a constantly changing mountain range, so they are prone to earthquakes, landslides, and flash floods. The Andes, though, are also filled with great beauty, such as the great Incan city of the clouds, Machu Picchu, which is a major tourist destination, and the huge Lake Titicaca. Near Huancayo lies Nevado Misti, a 18,500 foot peak, from which emerges a stream that is considered the source of the Amazon, the world's largest river. It flows eastward, joining other rivers, themselves flowing north and east until the Maranon and Ucayali, two great rivers of lowland Amazonia, meet to form the Amazon River itself.

===The Coastline===
[[Image:Peru_Huanchaco_Typical_Fisherman_reed_boats.jpg|right|thumb|205px|Traditional reed fishing boats stand on a Peruvian beach.]] The Pacific Ocean is cold along the coast of Peru and the winds do not pick up much moisture from it, so the land next to coast of Peru is a very dry place. The southern coast region is part of the Atacama desert, which also extends into Chile. The Atacama desert is known as the driest place in the world.

Although little grows naturally in this region of Peru, the people of Peru have long been using irrigation to farm.  As a result, most of Peru's large population centers border this desert.

===The Amazon Jungle===
The eastern part of the country is covered with dense vegetation, and its most important exports are jungle products, consisting of rubber, cinchona, dye stuffs, medicinal drugs and in the cultivated portions, coca, which is raised in large quantities.

===Lima - The Capital City===
[[Image:Lima Cathedral.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Lima Cathedral on the main square in downtown Lima.]]Lima or the ''City of the Kings'' (Cuidad de los Reyes) was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535. The Cathedral of Lima contains the tomb of Pizarro. Callao, located 7 miles west of Lima, is the port of the capital city and contains one of the finest harbors on the Pacific Ocean.

===Arequipa - The White City===
The historic old city is located on the Chili river in the mountains of southern Peru and was founded by Garci de Carbajal under the direction of Pizarro in 1540. An imposing feature of the city is the Cathedral San Francisco de Arequipa. The name ''white city'' comes from the white volcanic rock called ''sillar'', available nearby, which was used as building blocks in the construction of the city.

'''Suriname''', is the smallest and least populated country in South America(French Guinia is smaller but is not a country). 

==What is Suriname's History like?==
Native Americans first moved to Suriname in 3000 BC.  The largest tribes were the Arawaks, a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing, and the Caribs. Other smaller tribes lived further into the country, in the rainforest.

The first Europeans who came to Suriname were Dutch traders who visited the area along with other parts of the South America's coast. In 1630, and again in 1651, the English tried to settle the area. But the two English settlements were conquered by the Dutch in the 1660s. 
==What is Suriname's Geography like?==
Suriname is the smallest country in mainland South America.

[[Image:Mt_Kukenan_in_Venezuela_001.JPG|thumb|right|250px||Mt. Kukenan]]
'''Venezuela''' is the northernmost country of [[../|South America]]. The north of Venezuela is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. The name ''Venezuela'' (&quot;Little Venice&quot;) is from the explorer Amerigo Vespuccio. He saw stilt houses on Lake Maracaibo; those houses reminded him of the city of Venice in Europe.

In relation to other countries in South America, it is bordered by [[../Colombia/]] to the west and [[../Guyana/]] to the east. On the south-east is [[../Brazil/]]. Of the three countries which border Venezuela, the longest border is with Brazil: 2,200 kilometres. The border with Columbia is slightly  smaller: 2,050 km. The border with Guyana is much smaller at: 743 kilometres. In relation to the world, Venezuela is almost twice as large as the American state of California.

==Geography==
Because Venezuela is close (eight degrees north) to the equator, it is mostly tropical, however, Venezuela also has a desert region, open plains and even tall mountains with snow on them. Venezuela has highlands in the middle of the country, and many waterfalls like the Angel Falls.

The weather is as varied as the geography of this land. Venezuela has beautiful hot humid coasts, the Andes mountains begin their journey down South America in Venezuela and are an area of rich agriculture and tourist industry. The mountains are obviously cool compared to the plains (Los Llanos) below where cattle ranches thrive. The highest mountain is Pico Bolivar at 5007 metres. The other mountain range in the south-east is the Guiana Highlands.  Parts of the Amazon jungle are in Venezuelan territory. The beautiful ancient formation of La Gran Sabana of Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World is an amazing territory of table top mountains. The plains where these mountains lie have sheer drops of kilometers into the amazon jungle which are breathtaking.

One of Venezuela's major rivers is the Orinoco River.
Just over a third of Venezuela is forests and woodland, and a fifth is used as farmland. Just under half the land is used for where people live and work.
Venezuela is one of the richest countries in South America for mineral resources, gold and diamonds in particular. Also there are many oil wells, where petroleum and gas come out. Much of Venezuela is irrigated which means water can spread.
Venezuela tends to have floods, rock slides and mudslides, as well as droughts.
In many of Venezuela's cities especially along the heavily polluted Caribbean coast, there is pollution from the sewers, oil and water. In the past Venezuelan forests and soil have been used a great deal, so there is deforestation and soil degradation.

[[Image:Mt Kukenan from Mt Roraima in Guyana HighLand 001.JPG|thumb|left||250px|Mt Kukenan from Top of Roraima]]

==History of Venezuela==
Before the first Spanish settlement in 1522, the indigenous people were living near the Orinoco river and the Andean mountain range. In the middle of the 1500s, gold was discovered, which led to the indigenous people (and Africans who were imported to Venezuela) becoming slaves. The Europeans also raised livestock on the plains. During the 18th century the land was passed under the responsibility of New Granada, after having been owned by two viceroyalties.
Venezuela declared independence from Spain in 1811, but for eight years until 1819 there was a war. Venezuela, with other nations close to it, was part of Gran Colombia until 1830. Oil became an important part of Venezuela's economy in the 20th century, and is still its main source of income. Venezuela in the 20th Century has been largely influenced by oil policy, from the early century dictatorships to the latter half century democracies, to today's government. The current president is Hugo Chávez Frías.

==People of Venezuela==
There are twenty-six million people in Venezuela. Ninety-five percent live north of the Orinoco River. Half of the population is mestizo (of mixed European and Indian ancestry); about 41% - 45% of Venezuelans are of European lineage, and 8% have mainly African ancestry. The native Indian population is statistically small. Historical ethnic backgrounds include indigenous, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arab, German and African.

One third of the Venezuelan people are under 15, two thirds are between 16 and 64 and four percent are over 64. For every 1000 people, every year 21 infants are born and 4 of them die. If you are a Venezuelan man you can expect to live up until you are 70 and if you are a woman you can expect to live up to 76.

[[Image:Mt_Roraima_in_Venezuela_001.JPG|thumb|250px||Mt. Roraima]]

The official language is Spanish. Other languages include the native languages of Venezuelan Indians. Ninety-one percent of people are able to read and write by the time they are 15 years old.

Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy. Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture. An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent work in the oil industry.

Many of the people of Venezuela enjoy baseball, soccer and music. Many Venezuelan players are playing in the Major Baseball League of America and Venezuelan music and dancing is distinctive. Music is varied and reflects the mixed rich cultural heritage of the country, typical music include black drums from the coasts, Gaitas from Zulia, LLanera from the plains, as well as many modern movements of rock, pop, salsa, meringue,etc. The national dance is joropo from the Llanos area. Edgar Ojeda is a particularly famous musician who works with children and has written much about music.

Venezuela is also known for its participation in beauty contests, which are widely shown on television. One Miss Universe, Irene Saez, selected in 1981, become mayor and governor and ran for president in 1998.

==What is the history?==
The Andes were formed through a process called plate tectonics. The formation of the Andes began in the Jurassic Period. It was during the Cretaceous Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks 

==What is the Geography?==
The Andes form the longest mountain range in the world. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia. It is more than 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) long. The Andes go through seven South American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The Andes range has many active volcanoes, including Cotopaxi, one of the highest active volcanoes in the world.

The southern section is rainy and cool, the central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm. The climate is known to change drastically. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak, Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas.

The '''Amazon River''' is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth. It carries more than &lt;u&gt;8 times&lt;/u&gt; as much water as the second biggest river. The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide. A full 20 percent of the water that pours out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon. The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers .

[[Image:Amazonrivermap.svg|thumb|420px|center|Map of the Amazon River and its tributaries.]]

{{NOTE|A river starts at it spring and ends when it meets a larger body of water, from a large lake to an ocean. In case it ends meeting a bigger river the smaller one is called a tributarie.}}  

Thousands of kinds of fish and turtles live in the Amazon River, including Piranha. The Boto, a kind of freshwater dolphin, also lives in the Amazon River. The Anaconda, the world's largest snake, lives there too. 

A Spanish explorer named Francisco de Orellana gave the river its name. He was the first European to travel the length of the river. While exploring the river he encountered a tribe of fierce women. They reminded him of a story from ancient Greece about warrior women named &quot;Amazons&quot;. Because of this, he named the river Amazon.

The '''Amazon Basin''' is the land covered by the '''Amazon River'''. The Amazon Basin is 6,915,000 km² (2,670,000 mi²). It is bigger than many countries. The land it covers includes parts of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. 

In the Amazon Basin there is also the '''Amazon Rain-forest'''. The Amazon Rain-forest is the biggest rain-forest in the world. It covers 5.5 million km², almost half of all rain-forests in the world. Lots of animals and plants can only be found in the Amazon Rain-forest. In some places, the vegetation in the rain-forest is so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground.

The people who live along the Amazon have used the river for agriculture and transportation for thousands of years.

I think the Moon is a special case and you need to mention its effects on the Earth - tides. You also need to explain full moons and half moons etc. because kids will want to understand that phenomena. :[[User:81.155.252.32|81.155.252.32]] 22:39, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::That's a good idea. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 23:44, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

How about a couple questions like: 
Why does the moon change it's appearance?
Why does the sun appear to rise over the eastern horizon and set over the western horizon?

==Another comment==
Just to have it said: Today's version of &quot;how much would I weigh on ...&quot; is total rubbish. Be consisent with the other articles! The way you explain it, there'd only be the need for one general &quot;how much would I weigh on ...&quot; section at the very beginning of the whole topic. That is of course right in every sense, but since the question itself is rather wishy washy I suggest to handle it the way it was done in the other articles and re-revert to my version! Kilogram _is_ an acceptable unit btw.! Or should we rather call Newtons into play?

:Those kilograms are acceptable units of mass, and no longer acceptable units of force.  They do not change depending on your location.  It is improper for you to give the impression that they do.  There are no kilograms force in the modern metric system, the International System of Units (SI).

:Note that kilograms, not [[newton]]s (lowercase), are the proper units SI for your weight in the doctor's office (the terminology used in these articles even before my edits), or any time we weigh ourselves for purposes of fitness and health, in the medical sciences and in sports.

== Lunnik or Lunik or Luna ==

I'm interested in this spelling as everything I have seen spells the Soviet lunar spacecraft as Lunik or more usually Luna. [[User:Evil Monkey|Evil Monkey]] 00:48, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Be bold! Please, look it up, put the correct spelling in, use a citation to back up your fact-checking (see section on fact-checking in [[/Proofreading|proofreading plan]].  Thanks!  -- [[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:19, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== Tides ==

This page does an ok job of explaing tides, but not why there are two high tides/day (instead of one). I'm wondering if a graphic along the lines of [http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/img008.gif this] would be too complicated for this audience? See [http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/tides.html] --[[User:Duk|Duk]] 17:48, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:I think your image would take a lot of words to explain.  And we are already WAY over our word limit for this book.  If we had a book just about the moon, or just about physical oceanography, I think it would fit.  But I don't think we are going to get that specialized in a series of 48-page booklets for 8-11 year olds.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:11, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
::OK, I made some diagrams for [[w:Tide#Tidal physics]] and agree they are probably too much for this audience.--[[User:Duk|Duk]] 05:32, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== to-scale diagram ==

In addition to the
[[Image:Moon_Earth_Comparison.png]]
,
it would be nice to show a picture that not only shows the true relative sizes of Earth and Luna,
but also the distance between them -- something like

I guess you refer for the ''Circus and Brothel'' stuff. I beg excuses. I got a good laugh at the page, which I hope will end up in an equivalent of the BJAODN of the wikipedia, and, as I did look for the reference, and it was indeed real, I couldn't resist linking it. I will go on with my serious work at the Wikiversidad :) By the way, I hope we will go soon to es.wikibooks. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 09:30, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I have just asked for it to the admins in es.wikibooks ([http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikilibros:Caf%C3%A9#Historiales_de_las_p.C3.A1ginas_en_el_dominio_antiguo]). I hope the spanish Wikiversidad will move to es.wikibooks soon enough (in a matter of days-weeks). -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 09:40, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== [[Programming:C plus plus]] ==

Hi Yann, saw that you were an administrator active currently (i.e. with an entry in [[Special:Recent changes]]. I'd like an independent person set right the mess in [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] and their talk pages/give at least guidance.

These pages contain related talk:
*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]]
*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/archive1]]
*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/single page]]
*[[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]]
*[[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/- (Archive)]]

*[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Attracting contributors to a textbook: Differences from the 'pedia]]
*[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Programming:C plus plus and its fork Programming: C -.2F- -.2F-]]

I had earlier asked [[User:Dysprosia]] to help. But I'd like other wikibookians also to help. The traffic to [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] seems too low to be helpful. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 16:09, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Chinese spams ==

Talk moved to [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Chinese_spams]]. Please answer there. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 08:43, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== whoops ==

Hi,

I think it's useless to put comments on anonymous users' pages like [[User:220.58.70.54]]. AT least it should be on the talk page. ;o) [[User:Yann|Yann]] 16:18, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Fixed.  It's useful because when they log in again from the same IP (this happens with maybe half of them) they'll see that they have messages that say &quot;WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE TESTING IN MODULES YOU ARE NOT INVISIBLE&quot; and will not feel like testing in modules anymore :-) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:34, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)


== LPIC ==

Yann, 

I just saw that some 6 months ago you posted on [[User_talk:minderaser]] interest in helping w/ [[LPI Linux Certification]]. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to respond...I've been w/out a 'net connection all this time :-(. The answer, though, is an emphatic YES!!.

Contact me on your talk page here, [[User_talk:minderaser]], or email/AIM (preferred -- info is at [[User:minderaser]])

[[User:Minderaser|minderaser]] 23:27, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Yann,

Whoa! I hadn't realized that you'd upload so much!! When I did my above post I had only looked at the main contents page and saw lots of red (undone) links and assumed nothing (or very little) was added. Only when I looked at [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101|LPIC1_Exam_101]] and tried to discover why none of the items in Topic 101 were linking at all did I discover how much material you had posted. 

Anyway, I still hope to hear from you!

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Identifiers ==
An '''identifier''' is a name used to identify a variable, method, or class. 

As with most languages, valid identifiers consist of alphanumeric characters (&lt;tt&gt;A-Za-z0-9&lt;/tt&gt;) and underscores (&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;), but may not begin with a digit (&lt;tt&gt;0-9&lt;/tt&gt;).  Additionally, identifiers that are ''method'' names may end with a question mark (&lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;), exclamation point (&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;), or equal sign (&lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;).

There are no arbitrary restrictions to the length of an identifier (i.e. it may be as long as you like, limited only by your computer's memory).  Finally, there are [[#Reserved Words|reserved words]] which may not be used as identifiers.

Examples:
 foobar
 ruby_is_simple

== Comments ==
Line comments run from a bare '#' character to the end of the line.
Code commenting and documentation is best implemented with Ruby Embedded Documentation.
http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/rdtool.html

Examples:
 # this line does nothing; 
 print &quot;Hello&quot; # this line prints &quot;Hello&quot;

== Embedded Documentation ==
Example:
 =begin
 Everything between a line beginning with `=begin' down to
 one beginning with `=end' will be skipped by the interpreter.
 These reserved words must begin in column 1.
 =end

== Reserved Words ==
The following words are reserved in Ruby:
 __FILE__  and    def       end     in      or      self   unless
 __LINE__  begin  defined?  ensure  module  redo    super  until
 BEGIN     break  do        false   next    rescue  then   when
 END       case   else      for     nil     retry   true   while
 alias     class  elsif     if      not     return  undef  yield

You can find some examples of using them [http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9 here].

== Expressions ==
Example:
 true
 (1 + 2) * 3
 foo()
 if test then okay else not_good end
All variables, literals, control structures, etcetera are expressions. Using these together is called a program. You can divide expressions with newlines or semicolons (;) &amp;mdash; however, a newline with a preceding backslash (\) is continued to the following line.

Since in Ruby control structures are expressions as well, one can do the following:
  &lt;code&gt;foo = case 1
        when 1
          true
        else
          false
        end&lt;/code&gt;
The above equivalent in a language such as C would generate a syntax error since control structures are not expressions in the C language.

The Second World War (or World War II) was the costliest war in history in terms of lives lost. Over fifty million people died either in direct combat, raids or civilian extermination. The war was fought between the 'Allies' (The British Commonwealth, the United States, China, the Soviet Union (post-1941) and the governments-in-exile of most of the European countries), and the 'Axis' (Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union (pre-1941).

In the beginning, most of the fighting was in Europe, but with the attack on Pearl Harbour, combat moved extensively to the Pacific.

==The German invasion of the Soviet Union==
On June 22, 1941, over 3 million Axis soldiers marched into the Soviet Union. The army was comprised mainly of Germans, but also included smaller numbers of Italians, Romanians, Hungarians, and Bulgarians.

Within weeks, the Red Army was in shambles. Most of the air force was destroyed, and the Wermacht was approaching Moscow with lightning speed.

The Ukrainian and Belorussian people, tired of living under Soviet Russian domination, ran happily towards the approaching army. Of course, these people were killed, as part of Hitler's plan to colonize the Ukraine with families of SS soldiers and their families.

==The Italian invasion of North Africa and The Afrika Korps==
**Rommel and the Afrika Korps here*
After Hitler`s successful blitzkrieg into Poland and France which resulted in the Third Reich becoming dominant in Europe, Mussolini felt unsatisfied because he himself didn`t gain any significant victories or territories. Mussolini planned to occupy Egypt from his colony in Lybia. He hope to get a quick victory that would boost Italian army morale for the Greece campaign.

Before World War II, the main Italian strategies were defensive, because Lybia had a dangerous position with two fronts, The Anglo-Egyptian border in the east and the French colony of Tunisia in the west. But, after France's defeat at the hand of Nazi Germany, Vichy France was no longer a threat to Lybia from the west and so Mussolini asked his Generals to attack the British across the Egyptian border. But Italian troops lacked experience and preparation and the campaign went wrong for Mussolini. After capturing Mensah Matruh, the Italian offensive halted. The British used tactical superiority to launch a counter attack, not only to recapture their lost territory but also to thrust deep into Italian territory. Almost all the Italian attacking force was killed or captured, leading to General Graziani resigning from his position in Africa. Mussolini replaced him with General Gariboldi, who took command of all remaining Italian forces. Hitler, who didn't want Mussolini to lose in Africa, send Erwin Rommel to assist the Italians with only 1 motorised battalion at the beginning. Rommel's army in Africa was known as the Deutsche Afrika Korps (German Africa Corps.)

The British General Wavell preferred not to continue advancing into Italian territory because of 2 factors. The first was the long supply line for the British, making it difficult to organize, and the second was Churchill's decision to transfer some of the British army in Egypt to Greece in order to help Greece to defend itself from the Nazis advancing army. Wavell thought conservatively that both the British and Italian-German didn't have enough forces to launch more offensive campaigns, and so did General Gariboldi and OKW (Ober Komando Wehrmacht). But,Rommel thought progressively, he decided that this was a great chance to attack the unprepared British, although he didn't have enough support because Hitler could only give him one more battalion. Rommel grouped his Italian-German armoured division together so he could used it effectively. On the other side, Wavell`s tanks were scattered amongst the infantry. Although the armies' numbers were equally matched, Rommel's tactics made the Deutsche Afrika Korps win over the British Desert Rats. The British were forced to withdraw and fell back to Egypt, apart from the Tobruk garrison, which was surrounded and placed under siege.

The European war had ended - but the World War had not. The fight in the Pacific proved to be getting as tougher than ever, and so it was decided that the United States would use atomic bombs to end the war. [insert more text]

==The World at the end of the Second World War==
World War 2 led to a fundamental shift in power.  The European powers were devastated and ceased to be major world powers. This left the USA and the greatly expanded Soviet Block as the pre-eminent world powers.

The end of World War 2 saw the recovery of a war-torn Europe under the Marshall Plan which provided financial aid to countries devastated by the war, the expansion of the communist Soviet Block led to the beginning of superpower hostilities between the Soviet Union and NATO in what was to become the Cold War. In America, following the death of President Roosevelt, the newly elected Harry S. Truman sought a much stricter role in the containment of the sudden rapid spread of Communism. In response to the rigged democratic elections in Eastern Europe by the Soviet Red Army and communist officials, and the newly made &quot;sphere of Soviet influence&quot; Truman announced the Truman Doctrine which stated that any country percieved to be under threat from internal or external Communist governments, would be entitled to receive financial and military assistance. 

Notable examples of intervention against communism include the British military and US financial intervention in the Greek Civil War (1946 - 1949) where communists and royalists fought for power, the Korean War in which communist forces battled against a UN force led by the USA and the Vietnam War where communist vietnamese nationalists fought successively against the post war British occupation forces, the French and the USA eventually emerging victorious in the 1970s. 

The Soviet occupation resulted in a divided Europe including a divided Germany where communist states were on the Eastern side, behind guarded borders what were commonly referred to in the West as the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, and democratic states on the Western side. The liberation of Eastern Europe from the Soviet Block was not achieved until the 1990s.

'''Coconut Chutney''' is served as a [[Cookbook:Side dishes|side dish]] for a lot of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] snacks and [[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|breakfast]] items. It can be mild to extra hot depending on the individual preference. This recipe is from South India.

== Ingredients ==
*Fresh [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] - 1 cup finely grated
*Green hot [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] - 6 to 8
*[[Cookbook:Tamarind|Tamarind]] paste -  ½ tsp
*[[Cookbook:Cilantro|Cilantro]] - 1 Tbs, chopped
*[[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]] paste, 1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Channa dhal|Channa dal]] - 1½ Tbs
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] - to taste

Seasoning:
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard seed]] - ½ tsp
*[[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]] - 3-4, chopped
*[[Cookbook:Asafoetida|Asafoetida]] - ¼ tsp
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] - ½ tsp

== Procedure ==
# Dry roast channa dal until browned and allow it to cool.
# Grind all the ingredients in a blender with as little water as possible. For best results the final consistency must be some where between coarse and paste.
# For seasoning heat the oil in a small ladle. Add the mustard seeds to hot oil and allow it to crackle. When the crackling starts subsiding add the asafoetida and the curry leaves and stir for a few seconds. Add to the chutney and mix well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The major problem that I can see in the development of this Wikibook is that, while there are large, ready entries at Wikipedia, we're looking for a textbook-style thing not an encyclopedia entry. While the information will largely be similar in context, we should try not to just direct copy-paste or direct link to Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is our encyclopedia, lets make Wikibooks our textbook. --[[User:DorianGray|DorianGray]] 13:14, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== I have a cunning plan... ==

Okay, bear with me here. I believe this is an ideal topic for the creation of a Wikireader document (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiReader). I may well start one up, and see how it fares. Let's face it, an enormous amount of effort has gone into Wikipedia, and we should use its resources as much as possible. Interested? --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 19:43, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== November 15, 2005 ==

I have been planning to expand [[Modern History]]. Unlike [[World History]], this book would not be constrained by AP requirements; it would be able to go into more detail about the last few centuries. Very recent events (like US in Iraq, 2003) would remain excluded from this book.

I would start by writing stub chapters. Each stub chapter would provide a very short narrative and link to some Wikipedia articles. This would accomplish having a chronological narrative. Then I would continue by adding other features, like listing important persons and providing review questions.

My contributions will be slow. (I am busy with [[Guide to UNIX]].) This is a wiki, though, so other users are welcome to start work now! --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:01, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

If you already have an understanding of 4 conjugations, this page's presentation beyond the 1st and 2nd conjugation imperfects may confuse you. It certainly will not help a Latin student that does not understand advanced grammar. (Our contributor laid out a unique teaching methedology, which I agree with, and will try to see to its completion, but right now it would only confuse and not teach.)

Terms necessary to define (which are not defined) are:
* long I conjugation (ambigious--could refer to either 4th conjugation or prounciation--I really don't know.)
(Could these two be part of the natural variations in the future?)
* short I conjugation-- probably refers to 3rd and 4th -io that does not have a macron over the i, which isn't really a rule that can be derrived or explained easily in this chapter because that is a function of the rhythmical stresses (or accent) of the word. 
* consonatic conjugation (part of the 'i-stem' rule--yet to be defined.)

It's probably much much simpler than this, but without explanation, I'm a little lost.

[[User:Smkatz]] 14:07, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I decided to remove this paragraph, until the page is corrected. Implying that the -e- change happens in the imperfect seems factually incorrect.

&lt;br&gt;However, eventually you'll have to add an '''e''' before the '''ba''' (as in '''capi-''e''bam''' (which means '''I captured''' or '''I caught''')) (Wikipedians are not presently agreed on a common translation.)
&lt;br&gt;But this is only necessary in the long I-conjugation [fourth--as in ven&lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re?], the short I-conjugation and the consonantic conjugation (also called the io rule--a variation that happens in the future with 3rd (and 4th?) conjugation verbs).

Hey, Alex, cool, go ahead and write about modal logic!  
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 07:02, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

----

Hmm.  Progress on the propositional logic is rather slow.  Though in theory I have the time to do this, things don't always work out that way.  When writing the Spanish edition, you can translate my stuff and then fill in the gaps, which are only too obvious.  Then you can fill in the gaps in the English text by translating what you have written in Spanish back to English.  Then perhaps with help I could translate the entire work into French.    
Actually the fact that different language versions are slightly different is an interesting feature of wikipedia and wikibooks.

By the way, someone on #wikipedia asked me to use a 'fictitious name space', so rather than have pages called 'tautology', I have to call them 'Introduction to logic:tautology'.  This is to avoid conflicts with other wikibooks.

Anyway, I'd be pleased to know a little bit about you, e.g. what are your philosophical interests, where did you learn philosophy, do you have a personal website anywhere, etc.

--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 11:47, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Howdy. Tanks for getting in touch, and for your very encouraging comments. You were right to infer that my course would be a little less formal. I hate the stuffiness of philosophy, it's such a turn off. Although technical language, and precise definitions are required at an advanced level, they are hardly required at the beginning.

Thanks again. No doubt, I will be talking to you again!

== Question for Alex Beta ==

Hi.  I'm a high school teacher in Marion, NC.  We have a World Philosophy course at our school, and I thought it might be interesting to have the students participate in one of your modules.  Regardless, I would like to.  Can you give me some direction?  I thank you for your time.
:Hello. As you do not seem to have a wikibooks account open, I suppose I will have to answer here (I hope you check back soon). I am not completely sure about what you mean with &quot;having students participate&quot;. Of course, participation is very welcome here at wikibooks. We are having some admin problems with the wikiversity right now, however, and work here has seemed to slow down very significantly during the last couple of months.

:If you wish to participate writing courses, you only have to open an account (free, no long forms). Just click on &quot;log in&quot; at the top-right of this page. You just need to pick a nickname and type your password in twice.

:If by &quot;participating&quot; you mean participating in one of the courses, then the answer is complicated. As I said before, we are having admin problems here, as some users have suggested that wikiversity should be moved out of wikibooks, perhaps as a consequence of the first on-line wikiversity course being taught (these users consider the scope of Wikiversity beyond the scope of wikibooks).

:In any case, I would be willing to help as much as possible. So, if you have any questions, please ask away. All questions and suggestions welcome. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 15:20, 3 October 2005 (UTC))

My focus in philosophy is epistemology, but I see enormous overlap with lingustics and biology, particularly sensory and brain biology. My sense is that somebody needs to start creating a unified theory, but the task is overwhelming for one person. I'm hoping to find co-equal collaborators, and  think that wiki is the way to go. Interested? Thoughts? Suggestions?

== Are old essays any use to the philosophy wikiversity department? ==

I have many a philosophy essay sitting around on my computer I'm happy to release under the WP license. If you're interested, let me know. If you're not, well, I don't blame you. --[[User:212.84.98.214|212.84.98.214]] 15:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
Sorry I forgot to say, I'm [[wikipedia:en:User:Cfp]]. (I have now created a wikibooks account but I'd rather be contacted on my WP one.)--[[User:Cfp|Cfp]] 22:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

==Soliciting some minor support in new project==

Hello!  I'm contacting you, as you seem to be one of only a couple active people in the Phil Dept. here.

I'm a visiting Asst. professor at Virginia Tech.  I'll be teaching a course in Politial Philosophy (Ancient to Renaissance) this next semester, and plan on putting together an open source alternative textbook.  I'll be a mildly annotated collection of selections from original source material, along with historical/critical introductions to each of the authors.

I'm contacting you because it would be very helpful to me to get someone to help me with formatting, cleaning up entries, and so forth.  I don't have much experience with wikibooks.  Anyhow, if you or someone you know might be interested in casually overseeing my work on this project over the next semester, that'd be great!

Feel free to contact me by email if you have questions, comments, suggestions, etc.

Thanks!

D.E. Wittkower

:Alex beta doesn't seem to have been active since this April. (He might appear and prove me wrong of course.) It does sound a great idea what you are planning, so don't let that put you off. If he doesn't appear in the next few days I will see if I can drum up someone else to help you (or failing that help you myself, though I am liable to be quite busy next term and I haven't done any philosophy in a while). --[[User:Cfp|Cfp]] 00:46, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

:Dear Mr./Mrs. Wittkower, I would like to apologize for not having answered your message earlier. I realise that it is very improbable that you will read this, but I will answer just in case. I have been absent for many months, but I would be delighted to help if you are still interested. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 14:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC))

== Looking for help==

Dear Alex Beta:
My name is Ivan Robaina Bychko and I am a almost 20 years old Cuban wikipedian and universitary student. I am very intersted in Philosophy and logic and I am working to write an article at my university about the history of philosophy, since it seems that no university teacher is willing to help, it seems you are the right guy for it. I do not have internet connectivity (only wikipedia and e-mail), but I think we could contact via e-mail, please, if you are willing to help me, let me know at my e-mail: nayesda.daria@medired.scu.sld.cu
Thanks,
Ivan</text>

There are two similar distributions with the name &quot;Geometric Distribution&quot;. 

* The probability distribution of the number ''X'' of [[Bernoulli trial]]s needed to get one success, supported on the set&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...}

* The probability distribution of the number ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 of failures before the first success, supported on the set&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}

These two different geometric distributions should not be confused with each other. Often, the name ''shifted'' geometric distribution is adopted for the former one. We will use ''X'' and ''Y'' to refer to distinguish the two.  

====Shifted====
The shifted Geometric Distribution refers to the probability of the number of times needed to do something until getting a desired result. For example:

* How many times will I throw a coin until it lands on ''heads''?
* How many children will I have until I get a girl?
* How many cards will I draw from a pack until I get a Joker?

Just like the [[Statistics:Distributions/Bernoulli|Bernoulli Distribution]], the Geometric distribution has one controlling parameter: The probability of success in any independent test.

If a random variable X is distributed with a Geometric Distribution with a parameter p we write its [[Wikipedia:probability mass function|probability mass function]] as:

&lt;math&gt;P\left( X=i \right) =p\left( 1-p\right)^{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;

With a Geometric Distribution it is also pretty easy to calculate the probability of a &quot;more than n times&quot; case. The probability of failing to achieve the wanted result is &lt;math&gt;\left( 1-p\right)^k&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: a student comes home from a party in the forest, in which [[Wikipedia:Cannabis|interesting substances]] were consumed. The student is trying to find the key to his front door, out of a keychain with 10 different keys. What is the probability of the student succeeding in finding the right key in the 4th attempt?

&lt;math&gt;P\left( X=4 \right) =\frac{1}{10}\left( 1-\frac{1}{10}\right)^{4-1}=\frac{1}{10}\left( \frac{9}{10}\right)^{3}=0.0729&lt;/math&gt;

====Unshifted====
The probability mass function is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = p(1-p)^x \,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0, 1, 2, \}&lt;/math&gt;

====Mean====

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_i f(x_i) x_i = \sum_0^{\infin} p (1-p )^x x&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''q=1-p''
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_0^{\infin}(1-q) q^x x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_0^{\infin}(1-q)q q^{x-1} x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = (1-q)q\sum_0^{\infin} q^{x-1} x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = (1-q)q\sum_0^{\infin} \frac{d}{dq}q^x&lt;/math&gt;
We can now interchange the derivative and the sum.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = (1-q)q\frac{d}{dq}\sum_0^{\infin} q^x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = (1-q)q\frac{d}{dq}{1 \over 1-q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = (1-q)q{1 \over (1-q)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = q{1 \over (1-q)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {(1-p ) \over p }&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
We derive the variance using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;

We have already calculated E[''X''] above, so now we will calculate E[''X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''] and then return to this variance formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_0^{\infin} p(1-p)^x x^2&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''q=1-p''
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_0^{\infin} (1-q)q^x x^2&lt;/math&gt;
We now manipulate ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' so that we get forms that are easy to handle by the technique used when deriving the mean.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)\sum_0^{\infin} q^x [(x^2-x)+x]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)\left[\sum_0^{\infin} q^x (x^2-x)+\sum_0^{\infin}q^x x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)\left[q^2\sum_0^{\infin} q^{x-2} x(x-1)+q\sum_0^{\infin}q^{x-1} x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)q\left[q\sum_0^{\infin} \frac{d^2}{(dq)^2}q^x+\sum_0^{\infin}\frac{d}{dq}q^x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)q\left[q\frac{d^2}{(dq)^2}\sum_0^{\infin} q^x+\frac{d}{dq}\sum_0^{\infin}q^x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)q\left[q\frac{d^2}{(dq)^2}{1 \over 1-q}+\frac{d}{dq}{1 \over 1-q}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = (1-q)q\left[q{2 \over (1-q)^3}+{1 \over (1-q)^2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {2q^2 \over (1-q)^2}+{q \over (1-q)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {2q^2 +q(1-q) \over (1-q)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {q(q+1) \over (1-q)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {(1-p)(2-p) \over p^2}&lt;/math&gt;
We then return to the variance formula
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = \left[{(1-p)(2-p) \over p^2}\right] - \left({1-p \over p}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = {(1-p) \over p^2}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The graph of the sine function looks like this:
:[[Image:sin.svg|Graph of the sine function|500px]]

Careful analysis of this graph will show that the graph corresponds to the unit circle. X is essentially the degree measure (in radians), while Y is the value of the sine function.

The graph of the cosine function looks like this:
:[[Image:cos.svg|Graph of the cosine function|500px]]

As with the sine function, analysis of the cosine function will show that the graph corresponds to the unit circle. One of the most important differences between the sine and cosine functions is that sine is an odd function (i.e. sin(-&amp;theta;) = -sin &amp;theta;) while cosine is an even function (i.e. cos(-&amp;theta;) = cos &amp;theta;).

Sine and cosine are periodic functions; that is, the above is repeated for preceding and following intervals with length 2&amp;pi;.

==Exercises==

{{ExerciseRobox|title=When does Sine = Cosine?}}

For what value of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta&lt;/math&gt; does &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin \theta=\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;?  (Choose a value between 0 and 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or equivalently in radians between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).

* Convince yourself you are right by drawing the triangle and using '''SOH-CAH-TOA'''.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A variable in Ruby can be distinguished by the characters at the start of its name. There's no restriction to the length of a variable's name (with the exception of the heap size). 


== Local Variables ==
Example:
 foobar
 _foobar
A variable whose name begins with a lowercase letter (a-z) or underscore (_) is a local variable or method invocation. 

A local variable is only accessible from within the block of its initialization. For example:
 i0 = 1
 loop {
   i1 = 2
   puts defined?(i0)	# true; &quot;i0&quot; was initialized in the ascendant block
   puts defined?(i1)	# true; &quot;i1&quot; was initialized in this block
   break
 }
 puts defined?(i0)	# true; &quot;i0 was initialized in this block
 puts defined?(i1)	# false; &quot;i1&quot; was initialized in the loop

== Instance Variables ==
Example:
 @foobar
A variable whose name begins with '&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:courier new;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/font&gt;' is an instance variable of &lt;font style=&quot;font-family:courier new;&quot;&gt;self&lt;/font&gt;. An instance variable belongs to the [[Ruby Programming/Object|object]] itself. Uninitialized instance variables have a value of &lt;font style=&quot;font-family:courier new;&quot;&gt;[[Ruby Programming/Object/NilClass|nil]]&lt;/font&gt;.

== Class Variables ==
A class variable is shared by all instances of a class and begins with '@@'.
Example:
 @@foobar

An important note is that the class variable is shared by all the descendants of the class.
Example:
&lt;code&gt;
 class Parent
   @@foo = &quot;Parent&quot;
  end
  class Thing1 &lt; Parent
    @@foo = &quot;Thing1&quot;
  end
  class Thing2 &lt; Parent
    @@foo = &quot;Thing2&quot;
  end
  &gt;&gt;Parent.class_eval(&quot;@@foo&quot;)
  =&gt;&quot;Thing2&quot;
  &gt;&gt;Thing1.class_eval(&quot;@@foo&quot;)
  =&gt;&quot;Thing2&quot;
  &gt;&gt;Thing2.class_eval(&quot;@@foo&quot;)
  =&gt;&quot;Thing2&quot;
  &gt;&gt;Thing2.class_variables
  =&gt;[]
  Parent.class_variables
  =&gt;[:@@foo]
&lt;/code&gt;

This shows us that all our classes were changing the same variable. Class variables behave like global variables which are visible only in the inheritance tree. Because Ruby resolves variables by looking up the inheritance tree *first*, this can cause problems if two subclasses both add a class variable with the same name.

== Global Variables ==
Example:
 $foobar
A variable whose name begins with '&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:courier new;&quot;&gt;$&lt;/font&gt;' has a global scope; meaning it can be accessed from anywhere within the program during runtime.

== Constants ==
Usage:
 FOOBAR
A variable whose name begins with an uppercase letter (A-Z) is a constant. A constant can be reassigned a value after its initialization, but doing so will generate a warning. Every [[Programming:Ruby Object Class|class]] is a constant.

Trying to access an uninitialized constant raises the NameError exception.

=== How constants are looked up ===

Constants are looked up based on your scope or via the scope resolution operator (i.e. '::').
For example

  class A
    A2 = 'a2'
    class B
      def go
        A2 
      end
    end
  end
  instance_of_b = A::B.new
  a2 = A::A2

Another example
 
 class Foo
   BAR = 123
 end
 puts Foo::BAR   
 # =&gt; 123

== Pseudo Variables ==
&lt;code&gt;'''self'''&lt;/code&gt;
:Execution context of the current method.
&lt;code&gt;'''nil'''&lt;/code&gt;
:The sole-instance of the &lt;code&gt;[[Ruby Programming/Object/NilClass|NilClass]]&lt;/code&gt; class. Expresses nothing.
&lt;code&gt;'''true'''&lt;/code&gt;
:The sole-instance of the &lt;code&gt;[[Ruby Programming/Object/TrueClass|TrueClass]]&lt;/code&gt; class. Expresses true.
&lt;code&gt;'''false'''&lt;/code&gt;
:The sole-instance of the &lt;code&gt;[[Ruby Programming/Object/FalseClass|FalseClass]]&lt;/code&gt; class. Expresses false. 
&lt;code&gt;'''$1, $2 ... $9'''&lt;/code&gt;
:These are contents of capturing groups for regular expression matches. They are local to the '''current thread and stack frame'''!
('''nil''' also is considered to be '''false''', and every other value is considered to be '''true''' in Ruby.)
The value of a pseudo variable cannot be changed. Substitution to a pseudo variable causes an exception to be raised.

== Pre-defined Variables ==

The use of cryptic two-character $? expressions is a thing that people will frequently complain about, dismissing Ruby as just another perl-ish line-noise language. Keep this chart handy. Note, a lot of these are useful when working with regexp code.  Part of the standard library is &quot;&lt;code&gt;English&lt;/code&gt;&quot; which defines longer names to replace the two-character variable names to make code more readable.  The defined names are also listed in the table.  To include these names, just require the English library as follows.&lt;ref name=&quot;English&quot;/&gt;

Without ‘English’:

    $\ = ' -- '
    &quot;waterbuffalo&quot; =~ /buff/
    print $&quot;, $', $$, &quot;\n&quot;

With English:

    require &quot;English&quot;
    
    $OUTPUT_FIELD_SEPARATOR = ' -- '
    &quot;waterbuffalo&quot; =~ /buff/
    print $LOADED_FEATURES, $POSTMATCH, $PID, &quot;\n&quot;

== Pre-defined Constants ==

Note that there are some pre-defined constants at parse time, as well, namely
  __FILE__ (current file)
  __LINE__ (current line)
and
  __dir__ (current directory)
(new in Ruby 2.0)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Remembering Formulas==

This page is about how to remember trig formulas - so it is more than just a summary of trig formulas.

You will need to have read most of the rest of the book for this page to be useful to you.

==The Blue-Box Formulae==

==Tips on checking and remembering Formulae==


This page contains some trigonometric identities.  It does not contain all trigonometric identities.  It couldn't possibly.  As well as the trigonometric identities for 'double angles' such as:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2t) = \cos^2t - \sin^2t&lt;/math&gt; 

there exist trigonometrical identities for treble angles, quadruple angles and so on.  We could not list them all.  Also the same formula can be presented in different disguises as we'll see below.

It's useful to learn some of the trig identities and to know how to '''''quickly and easily''''' derive one trigonometric identities from another.  

===Checking Formulas===
It is also very important to be able to check that the formulas you come up with make sense.  We know that &lt;math&gt;\cos(0^\circ)=1\,&lt;/math&gt;.  If your formula for &lt;math&gt;\cos(2t)\,&lt;/math&gt; does not give the answer 1 when &lt;math&gt;t=0\,&lt;/math&gt; then it is wrong!  Don't stop there though.  You can work out where you went wrong and save yourself making the same mistake again.  How do you do that?  

If you worked out the formula for &lt;math&gt;\cos(2t)\,&lt;/math&gt;from the formula for &lt;math&gt;\cos(A+B)\,&lt;/math&gt; you need to check through the steps you took.  If the mistake isn't obvious, try putting A=0 and B=0.  It is very very easy to get a sign wrong, a plus for a minus, when working with equations quickly.  It is only through practice that you will become both fast at it and accurate.

==Identities Based on the Pythagorean Theorem==

Some of the most fundamental trigonometric identities are those derived from the [[Trigonometry/Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]]. These are defined using a right triangle:

[[Image:TrigonometryTriangle.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|right|right triangle]]

At this stage in the course the Pythagorean Theorem should be second nature to you.  If you have not yet learned it, learn it now.

:&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\,&lt;/math&gt; of course are the legs or the adjacent and opposite edges, and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the hypotenuse, the longest side, the side that does not include the right angle.  This formula only works for a right angle triangle.  If the angle shown as a right angle in the diagram were obtuse, larger than a right angle, then &lt;math&gt;c^2\,&lt;/math&gt; would be larger than the Pythagorean sum.  If the angle shown as a right angle were smaller than a right angle, then &lt;math&gt;c^2\,&lt;/math&gt; would be smaller than &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2\,&lt;/math&gt;


=== Pythagorean Theorem in Terms of ''sine'' and ''cosine''===

The Pythagorean Theorem is the same thing as 

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A =1\,&lt;/math&gt;

We know this from the earlier in the book where we introduced &lt;math&gt;sine\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;cosine\,&lt;/math&gt;.  
* The &lt;math&gt;cosine\,&lt;/math&gt; is the adjacent side when the hypotenuse is one.  
* The &lt;math&gt;sine\,&lt;/math&gt; is the opposite side when the hypotenuse is one.  
The &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A =1\,&lt;/math&gt; identity should be second nature to you too, but you should also be able to derive it from the Pythagorean relation.  

We can see it's true from a right triangle that has a hypotenuse that is 'c' rather than one.  Dividing the Pythagorean relation through by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg(\frac{a}{c}\bigg)^2+\bigg(\frac{b}{c}\bigg)^2=\bigg(\frac{c}{c}\bigg)^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

And we have [[../Right angle trigonometry|already seen]] from soh-cah-toa that the sine of ''A'' is &lt;math&gt;\bigg(\frac{a}{c}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; and the cosine of ''A'' is &lt;math&gt;\bigg(\frac{b}{c}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.  


==Identities based on Addition Formula==


We saw the addition formula earlier.  

===Letters are Arbitrary===
The letters in these equations &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary.  We could equally use &lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.  We're pointing this out because we happen to have a diagram on this page that has angles &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt; in it, and we want to make it clear that that was for Pythagoras and we're not talking about that diagram any more.  In these equations you can also always substitute actual values, e.g. replace &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi\,&lt;/math&gt; and they'd still be true.  Or you could replace &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;2t\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\pi - t\,&lt;/math&gt;and they'd still be true.

===Addition Formula===
The addition formula for cosine is:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(A + B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B)&lt;/math&gt;

and is worth learning.  But don't learn the next one:

==='Subtraction' Formula===
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(A - B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) + \sin(A)\sin(B)&lt;/math&gt;

Learning the second formula is extra effort that does not really gain you anything.  You can get it instantly by replacing &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;-B\,&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation.  The only things on the right hand side that will change are the terms that had B in them.  The &lt;math&gt;\cos B\,&lt;/math&gt; is unchanged because &lt;math&gt;\cos(-B) = \cos B\,&lt;/math&gt;.  The minus sign before the second term changes because &lt;math&gt;\sin(-B) = -\sin B\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====Checking the 'subtraction' formula====

Now do a quick check.  If &lt;math&gt;A=B\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;cos(A-B)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\cos( 0 )\,&lt;/math&gt; which is one, right?  And on the right hand side we have &lt;math&gt;\cos^2 A + \sin^2 A\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is also one.  Looks good.

It is much better to remember it this way, because you are doing less rote learning and you're also becoming more fluent with the algebra.


===Double Angle Formula===
You can immediately get to the next formula by putting B equal to A in the addition formula.  This is a double angle formula.

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2A) = \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A&lt;/math&gt; 


===Half Angle Formula===
Replace A by A/2 in the previous result and you get the half angle formula.

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(A) = \cos^2A/2 - \sin^2A/2&lt;/math&gt; 


===Sum of two shifted Cosines===

For the next formula, you could just plough through the algebra...

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(x + \theta) + \cos(x - \theta)= ...\,&lt;/math&gt;


====Waves in and out of phase====
Before we do, notice that we are adding two cosine waves, the first shifted left and the second shifted right.  We've seen this before when we looked at waves in and out of phase.  We're going to get another sinusoidal wave.  The expression is fairly symmetric, and actually we can quickly show that the expression gives an even function, that is that the value for -x is the same as for x:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(-x + \theta) + \cos(-x - \theta)= \,&lt;/math&gt;  using cos(x) = cos(-x) we get to:
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(x - \theta) + \cos(x + \theta)= \,&lt;/math&gt; and now swapping the two terms:
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(x + \theta) + \cos(x - \theta) \,&lt;/math&gt; which is the original expression.

with practice you'll be able to see those steps and that the expression is an even function immediately. 

A sinusoidal wave that is an even function - well it is something based on cosine.  We're expecting the formula will simplify to give us something like:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle A\cos(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where A will depend on &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  

====Values to Check With====

When &lt;math&gt;\theta=0^\circ&lt;/math&gt; (try it in the original formula) we expect A to be 2.  When &lt;math&gt;\theta=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; we expect A to be 0, as the two cosine waves are &lt;math&gt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt; out of phase.  So now to plough through the algebra:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(x + \theta) + \cos(x - \theta)= \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \cos x\cos\theta - \sin x\sin\theta + \cos x\cos(-\theta) - \sin x\sin(-\theta)=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \cos x\cos\theta - \sin x\sin\theta + \cos x\cos\theta + \sin x\sin\theta=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \cos x\cos\theta + \cos x\cos\theta =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle 2\cos\theta\cos x&lt;/math&gt;

And to check we try with &lt;math&gt;\theta=0^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle 2\cos x&lt;/math&gt;, and we check with &lt;math&gt;\theta=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle 0 \times \cos x&lt;/math&gt;, as we hoped.

Knowing roughly what we expected made it easier to get the algebraic steps right.  We knew where we were going.  We knew we weren't going to end up with four separate terms, some would have to cancel or combine in some other way.

==Identities based on Sine and Cosine rules ==

:&lt;math&gt;{a \over \sin A} = {b \over \sin B} = {c \over \sin C}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is easy to remember because it is so symmetrical.  You do not even need to remember which way up the ratios are as this is also true:

:&lt;math&gt;{\sin A \over a} = {\sin B \over b} = {\sin C \over c}.&lt;/math&gt;

What you do need to remember is how the triangle is labelled for it to be true.


With the cosine law formula:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2-2ab\cos{\theta}=c^2, \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is best to think of it as a more general version of Pythagoras' theorem.  The a and b have to be on equal footing, so ab as a multiplier is reasonable.  

: If you are familiar with 'units' in physics, then use the fact that units must match up.  The quantities a,b,c are measurements of length.  It is no good adding &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -2(a+b)\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  One might have units Km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the other units of Km.  Adding &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -2ab\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; the units, e.g: Km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, do match.

In some more detail, it has got to be minus for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -2ab\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  That's because for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta&lt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; we need &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c^2&lt;/math&gt; to be less than for Pythagoras' theorem.  

How can you remember and be sure the 2 is right?  Think of an equilateral triangle with each side of length 1.  The angle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta=60^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(60^\circ)=0.5&lt;/math&gt;.  We need the 2 to get the right answer 1 + 1 + 2x1x1x0.5 = 1.


==Ratio identities==

:&lt;math&gt;\tan A =\frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is one definition of tan, and is something you should just learn.

==Identities based on symmetry==

These symmetry identities are best remembered by remembering the graphs for these functions.  Have a look at the graphs again if you don't remember them.

&lt;math&gt;0, \pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2, 2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt; are landmarks on the graphs of sine and cosine, and you should know what happens for both those functions at those landmarks.  When you have that knowledge the following symmetry identities are easy to write down, because you can see them visually.

===Shifting Left===

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi+A)= -\cos A \quad \sin(\pi+A)=-\sin A \quad \tan(\pi+A)=\tan A&lt;/math&gt;

The identities above are visualised as shifting the graph left by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  It's a half cycle, and both cosine and sine change signs - and hence tan does not change sign, because when it is expressed as a ratio of sine over cosine both the top and bottom change signs.


===Reflecting in x=π/2===
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi-A)=-\cos A \quad \sin(\pi-A)=\sin A \quad \tan(\pi-A)=-\tan A&lt;/math&gt;

In the above we are reflecting the graph about the vertical line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.  Spend enough time looking at this on the graph to see that that is true.  It is important to do that to remember this trick for remembering what happens.  

Now sine has a maximum at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; (it has the value one) and it is symmetric about that x value, so &lt;math&gt;\sin(\pi-A)=\sin A\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Cosine is zero at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.  Reflecting cosine in the line &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; reverses the sign. &lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi-A)=-\cos A \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Co-function identities==
:&lt;math&gt;\cos A =\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)\quad \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin A =\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)\quad \,&lt;/math&gt;

The above two formulas are most easily seen from the right-triangle definition of cosine and sine.  The two acute angles in such a triangle add up to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, and we are just giving the ratios of sides lengths in terms of a different angle's trig function.

:&lt;math&gt;\cos A = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+A\right)\quad \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin A = -\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+A\right) \quad \,&lt;/math&gt;

These two formulas are 'the same' as the previous formulas.  We get there in two steps.  First subtracted pi from the angle on the right hand side, which inverts the sign, and inverted the sign to compensate.  Next invert the sign of the angle on the right hand side.  For cosine on the right we are done.  For sine on the right we have to invert its sign since inverting the angle's sign changed the sign of the result.

Yes - keeping track of signs is tricky, and always needs care.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Anthropology is the holistic and scientific study of humanity. '''Cultural Anthropology''' focuses on the study of contemporary human cultures, their beliefs, myths, values, practices, technologies, economies and other domains of social and cognitive organization. The detailed descriptions of culture, or ethnography, are based upon a methodology of primary data collection through participant observation with living human populations.

This textbook aims to provide an introduction to the field of cultural anthropology. The initial chapters introduce the concept of culture and review the historical, theoretical and methodological influences on the field. Chapters four through twelve discuss the major domains of the study of culture; symbolism, communication, ritual, production, healing, rights, reproduction, kinship, conflict and globalization. These chapters provide ethnographic examples (both etic and emic perspectives) and case studies to support the central concepts in each chapter. Additional case studies are available via the Anthrobase website and others can be developed in wikibook format and integrated through links in this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I want to add/correct some things about the metal article. Well, I don't think metal has been &quot;invented&quot; in the US. Well the real creators of metal are the 60's/70's bands Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin among others. In their music are the riffs and patterns that became so typical for Metal Music to be heard first (and especially in Black Sabbath's music).
Well I don't think it is necessary/useful to split up Heavy Music into so many different styles, I'd say the only styles within metal music are:

* Heavy Metal
* Speed Metal
* Hard Rock

There's no need to split them up further, because they all use the same clichees all over again.
Well there's one more thing to say: It's no specific thing for goth bands to use locrian mode, I suppose many of those bands don't know what locrian is. Listen to the most known goth bands, you'll hardly ever find a locrian mode in there. Much more specific for goth is the HM5 (Harmonic-Minor, 5th mode, which is also called phrygian dominant, and which is created by raising the third of the 5th step, so that in A-minor the E-minor on the 5th step becomes a e-major chord).

That's all!

--

No way; there are many differences between the metal genres listed, and I believe they are fine the way they are. The only thing I don't really like about this article is the end where it talks about how seven string guitars tuned to drop a are not uncommon. I don't agree with this and I don't like how it states it. -[[user|MetalGeoff]]

Heavy Metal, Speed Metal and Hard Rock? Where would NWOBHM come in then (unless it's grouped with Progressive or Power Metal)? Or NuMetal? Or even Black Metal. None of those genres even remotly resemble Heavy Metal, Speed Metal or Hard Rock.

Although I agree, Metal has way to many sub genres.


==hold up==

There's no such thing as &quot;blues metal&quot;. Aerosmith and GnR are hard-rock/rock 'n' roll bands.
Where on earth do you come up with this stuff?
==
--actually, no...if you grew up in the 80s you knew that both Aerosmith and GnR were heavy metal, but today calls hard rock.  That is the problem with this whole article;  it skips 2 decades, the 70s and 80s...what I have seen called &quot;mainstream metal&quot;, but really back then was just called &quot;heavy metal&quot;.  The biggest problem with this article is the fact that none of these descriptions fit a band like Iron Maiden;  any true metalhead knows that Iron Maiden was a defining sound of heavy metal.  By not taking them into account, this article is useless, as are most of today's definitions of heavy metal.

== Visual kei ==

Visual is not a music style, nor is it metal. The music style visual belongs to is J-Rock.

^ You are correct to say visual kei is (at this moment) not a music style; however, present-day visual kei artists can encompass any music style, including metal.

==What?==

There ar elements in this that are outright erroneous (swedish death metal wasn't popularised by In Flames etc.) and there is, well, a lack of knowledge present. I mean, for example, there is just no point in the description of progressive metal - Opeth are in a completely different genre to Dream Theatre etc. etc.) The various subgenres are totally valid though, although hair metal is exactly the same thing as glam metal, There are one or two missed out, and they're badly fleshed out. Basically, whoever wrote this dosn't have anywhere near enough knowledge to write this, or perhaps, not the time to do it properly.

==Theory of metal==

are there any books that discuss the actual sounds of metal (specifically the extreme sub-genres)... that's what i want, a music theory book about death metal. [[Special:Contributions/64.230.107.230|64.230.107.230]] ([[User talk:64.230.107.230|talk]]) 19:34, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

==Absolutely baseless==

I am given the impression, reading this, that the writer does not actually listen to or understand Metal in the slightest.  Who wrote this?  The writer seems to be focusing on &quot;core&quot;, rather than Metal.  Metal is incredibly melodic music, and rhythm is only important in &quot;Progressive&quot; and &quot;Technical&quot; Death Metal, and, in those genres, is used primarily to accent the melodies.  I mean, if you look at all of the main/best genres of Metal, chronologically, you will see that they're all primarily focused on melodic progression and song structure - Heavy Metal, NWOBHM, Speed Metal, Death Metal, Black Metal, all of these focus primarily on melody, some even making copious use of harmony (NWOBHM, Speed Metal, and some Black Metal).  Atonality does not mean that melodies are not melodies, just as a piece with multiple concurrent time signatures can be &quot;in time&quot; (this is done in Metal, occasionally - Symphony X's &quot;The Accolade&quot; has a short passage of this).

Speaking of song structure - song structure is incredibly important in Metal.  Why is there no discussion of the riff, riff progression/self-reference, and so on?  There's nothing about the overarching usage of narrative and architected structures in NWOBHM and Extreme Metal.  The overall assumption appears to be that Metal is based on Rock'n'Roll's &quot;verse-chorus&quot; structure, which is so fundamentally incorrect as to be aggravating.

Much of the incorrect information on this page is an absolute disgrace, and should be disregarded by all until it has been rewritten in a satisfactory manner.

==Change the First Paragraph==
Towards the end of the first paragraph, it says that metal contains more musicianship than other rock acts. This is an opinion, and therefore does not belong in here. [[Special:Contributions/209.106.46.161|209.106.46.161]] ([[User talk:209.106.46.161|discuss]]) 17:47, 21 March 2011 (UTC)

== Who wrote this? ==

I personally am disgustesd by how biased this article is, the main writers obviously have no clue what they are talking about.

== Minor quibble ==
Ignoring the big issues for now (they've been brought up be people above), minor quibble: near the end of the section on death metal, it mentions deathcore, and goes on to say that there's dispute as to metalcore's and deathcore's status as real metal. Now, while yes, there are people out there who enjoy yelling &quot;metalcore isn't real metal stfu poser fag&quot;, I have yet to see a recognised critic (or even a literate person) seriously consider the opinion. Yes, metalcore does take a lot from hardcore punk, but ultimately, its most striking elements are death growls, blast beats, and most tellingly, tritones. The reason I bring it up, and honestly, I wouldn't normally bother opening this can of worms, is that I'd rather not see such a popular yet unfounded statement furthered on this page [[Special:Contributions/143.92.1.33|143.92.1.33]] ([[User talk:143.92.1.33|discuss]]) 08:56, 7 November 2012 (UTC)

== Major Quibble ==

I know I said I wouldn't mention these, but I will.

The genres idea is a bad one. Actually, it's a good one, but it's badly executed. As it currently stands, the article talks about subgenres of metal without talking about music theory, then talks about music theory only tangentially relating it to the aforementioned subgenres (and often makes sweeping generalisations only true for a small portion of metal subgenres, such as comments about often only having one or two chords, which is true for metalcore, some trad metal, some industrial metal, and that's about it). A better way of doing this would be to merge the two sections; either talk about each genre and the music theory behind it, or talk about the music theory as it relates to each subgenre.

== NWOBHM Motorcycle gang? ==

I basically stopped reading when I saw this acticle say that NWOBHM mostly sings about motorcycles... this statement is based on what? It's laughable misinformation since that's not even true of the movement's biggest band, Iron Maiden. Where's the motorcycle craze in Angel Witch, Venom, Diamond Head, and Tank? It's more typical of Saxon and sometimes Motörhead, but not of the entire scene.

== Who One earth thought this was a good Idea??? ==

You cant put &quot;core&quot; genres together with metal genres and not expect people to pick a side, and not write horrible inaccurate stuff that they pull out of nowhere, like &quot;melodeath came from metalcore&quot; (which i gladly changed), and many others that i cannot think of right now, this article is mostly written by wanna be musician kids that think where a certain style came from is music theory, and seriously, this would never work because the amount of music theory involved in metal is nothing compared to the aspect of feeling it while you play it/ write it. since more than half of metal cannot be simply created by using scales or chords. I say please just erase this. And well if u actually intended to create a horrible inaccurate source for certain people to be misguided, then as nefarious as that is i guess i can respect what you are doing here, but otherwise is making metal musicians look really, really bad. Better Idea Put a warning that says. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdominoplasty''' or &quot;tummy tuck&quot; is a cosmetic surgery procedure to reshape and firm the abdomen. It involves the removal of excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen in order to tighten the muscles of the abdominal wall. This type of surgery is usually sought by woman (who are not considering having any or more children) and individuals who have abdominal fat deposits which do not respond well to diet and exercise. There are two types of abdominoplasty: Complete. Requires from about two to five hours Partial. Requires from about one to two hours

A complete abdominoplasty involves five steps: An incision is made from hip to hip just above the pubic area Another incision is made to free the navel from the surrounding skin The skin is detached from the abdominal wall to reveal the muscles to be tightened The skin flap is reattached with any extra skin being removed. A new hole for the navel is made and stitched into place All stitches are dressed and any excess fluid from the site is drained

A partial abdominoplasty involves three steps: A smaller incision is made The skin in removed between the incision and the navel. The skin is stretched down and excess skin removed The flap is stitched back into place Recovery from a complete abdominoplasty can take from four to six weeks and patients are advised to take this recovery time off from work. For the first ten days, a patient may experience bruising and discomfort. A supportive abdominal binder is normally worn to ensure proper healing. Patients are advised not to smoke during recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adenoids, or pharyngeal tonsils, are folds of lymphatic tissue covered by ciliated epithelium. They are found in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx at the back of the throat behind the uvula.

Adenoids are part of the immune system as they trap inhaled viruses and produce antibodies, particularly in children. This function decreases with age as the adenoids shrink. Because of this, the problems caused by enlarged adenoids rarely occur in adults.

The condition where hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsils occurs is also referred to as adenoids. Enlarged adenoids can obstruct breathing through the nose, and it is common when this happens for them to be surgically removed in a procedure called adenoidectomy. This procedure is carried out through the mouth under a general anaesthetic and involves the adenoids being curetted or cauterised. Sleep apnoea, recurrent infection of the adenoids or distorted speech are also reasons for adenoidectomy. The procedure is often carried out at the same time as a tonsillectomy. Adenoidectomy is also carried in patients who have chronic ear infections caused by the adenoids blocking the eustachian tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Amputation is the removal of a body extremity by trauma or surgery. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene.
Amputation is a blind and final method in surgery to save the patient's life.

== Types ==

Types of amputation include:
*leg 
*amputation of digits 
*partial foot amputation (transmetatarsal)
*ankle disarticulation (Syme) 
*below-knee amputation (transtibial) 
*knee-bearing amputation 
*above knee amputation (transfemoral) 
*hip disarticulation 
*arm 
*amputation of digits 
*metacarpal amputation 
*wrist disarticulation 
*forearm amputation (transradial) 
*elbow disarticulation 
*above-elbow amputation (transhumeral) 
*shoulder disarticulation and forequarter amputation 

Hemicorporectomy is the most radical amputation. Genital modification and mutilation often involves amputating tissue, although it is usually not a result of injury or disease.

As a rule,  amputations through the bone diaphysis are preferred to preserve joint function, but in oncological surgery, disarticulation is favored.
(Edited by Dr. Avadh Sahi)

==Epidemiology==
110,000 a year in the USA ; of those 100,000 are lower limb amputations for peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

==Method==
A tourniquet is used in orthopedics to limit bleeding but not in vascular surgery (where the limb is already underperfused because of arterial disease).
The muscles are transsected, any bleeding vessel is ligated and finally the bone is sawed through . Skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump,except in amputations for gangrene when the stump is left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention.

==Complications==
Some amputees experience the phenomenon of phantom limbs; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, and feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence.

==Autoamputation==
In some rare cases when a person has become trapped (on account of getting a limb stuck) in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his own limb:
In 2003, 27-year old Aron Ralston amputated his forearm using his pocketknife and breaking and tearing the two bones, after the arm got stuck under a boulder when hiking in Utah. 
A month later, an Australian coal miner amputated his own arm with a Stanley knife after it became trapped when the front-end loader he was driving overturned three kilometers underground.

'''Toasted Ravioli''' is a misnomer as this dish is fried.

==Ingredients==
* 2 tablespoons whole [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 3/4 cup Italian seasoned [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
* 1/2 (25 ounce) package frozen [[Cookbook:Ravioli|ravioli]], thawed
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]
* 1 tablespoon grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce

==Procedure==
# Combine milk and egg in a small bowl. 
# Place breadcrumbs and if desired, salt in a shallow bowl. 
# Dip ravioli in milk mixture, and coat with breadcrumbs.
# In a large saucepan, heat marinara sauce over medium heat until bubbling, about 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to simmer.
# In a large heavy pan, pour oil to depth of 2 inches. 
# Heat oil over medium heat to 375 degrees F. 
# Fry ravioli, a few at a time, 1 minute on each side or until golden. 
# Drain on paper towels. 
# Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately with hot marinara sauce.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* You can use cheese or meat raviolis, however the traditional toasted ravioli is made out of a square meat ravioli.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple harmonic motion==

[[Image:Simple harmonic motion animation.gif|thumb|200px|right|Simple harmonic motion. Notice that the position of the dot matches that of the sine wave.]]

Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the motion of an object which can be modeled by the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;x = A \sin \left(\omega t + \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x = c_{1} \cos\left(\omega t\right) + c_{2} \sin\left(\omega t\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A'' sin &amp;phi; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A'' cos &amp;phi;.

In the above functions, ''A'' is the amplitude of the motion, &amp;omega; is the angular velocity, and &amp;phi; is the phase.

The velocity of an object in SHM is
:&lt;math&gt;v = A \omega \cos \left(\omega t + \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration is
:&lt;math&gt;a = -A \omega^2 \sin \left(\omega t + \phi\right) = -\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition of harmonic motion is motion such that
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a =  -\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

===Springs and Hooke's Law===

An application of this is the motion of a weight hanging on a spring. The motion of a spring can be modeled approximately by [[w:Hooke's law|Hooke's law]]:

:''F'' = -''kx''

where ''F'' is the force the spring exerts, ''x'' is the extension in meters of the spring, and ''k'' is a constant characterizing the spring's 'stiffness' hence the name 'stiffness constant'.

====Calculus-based derivation====

From [[General Mechanics/Fundamental Principles of Dynamics|Newton's laws]] we know that ''F'' = ''ma'' where ''m'' is the mass of the weight, and ''a'' is its acceleration. Substituting this into Hooke's Law, we get

:''ma'' = -''kx''

Dividing through by ''m'':

:&lt;math&gt;a = -\frac{k}{m}x&lt;/math&gt;

The calculus definition of acceleration gives us

:&lt;math&gt;x'' = -\frac{k}{m}x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x'' + \frac{k}{m}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have a second-order differential equation. Solving it gives us

:&lt;math&gt;x = c_{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + c_{2} \sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)&lt;/math&gt;    '''(2)'''
with an independent variable ''t'' for time.


We can change this equation into a simpler form. By lettting ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the legs of a right triangle, with angle &amp;phi; adjacent to ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \phi = \frac{c_{1}}{\sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \phi = \frac{c_{2}}{\sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c_{1} = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{2} = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into (2), we get

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \sin \phi \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \cos \phi \sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using a trigonometric identity, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \left[\sin \left(\phi + \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right) + \sin \left(\phi - \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\right)\right] + \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \left[\sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t + \phi\right) + \sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t - \phi\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}} \sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t + \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;    '''(3)'''

Let &lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{c_{1}^{2} + c_{2}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega^{2} = \frac{k}{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this into (3) gives

:&lt;math&gt;x = A \sin \left(\omega t + \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lions''' are a major symbol of wild Africa.  They have been worshipped by African tribes for their strength and beauty.  Lions are the only big cats that live in large groups.  Also, they have the loudest roar of any cat, which can be heard for up to five miles!

==Where do lions live?==
[[File:Lion_distribution.svg|thumb|right|Places where lions live are colored green.]]

Despite the nickname ''King of the jungle'', lions do not live in the jungle.  They live in a flat grassy plains called savannas; they usually have a certain place in the savannas where they like to stay. In ancient times, lions roamed nearly every continent.  Today, they can commonly be found across central and southern Africa.  There is also a small population in the Gir forest of India on the continent of Asia. Also, most people know lions as &quot;The King of the Beasts&quot; today.

==What do lions look like?==
[[File:Female lion.jpg|thumb|left|A lioness]]

Lions have tawny, or yellowish brown, fur. They grow to a length of about 10 feet (3 m) and stand about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. Male lions are larger than the lionesses (females), weighing as much as five men or about 550 lb (250 kg).  The more slender lioness usually weighs about as much as two and a half men or 400 lb (180 kg).  

Adult males can be recognized by the furry mane that runs around the heads and down the neck.  For some lions the mane even runs along the belly.  There is no other big cat with such a dramatic difference in appearance between males and females.  

Both lions and lionesses have tufts on the end of their tails, something no other cat has.  If you could touch a male lion's tail, you would feel a sharp bone tucked into the tail tuft.  One old legend claims that lions would use the tail spur to whip themselves into a frenzy before fighting.

==What is a pride?==

Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called ''prides''. Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs. The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters. Lion prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.  

The male lion is much stronger than the female.  This makes him an able protector, especially when a group of females are hunting and the cubs are at risk of marauders, such as hyenas. Male lions use their muscles and fighting skills to guard the land and keep enemies away.  Sometimes those enemies are other lions.

In prides, cubs are cared for not just by their mothers but by other adult females, as well.   Often, one or two lionesses (female lions) will stay with the cubs while the other females hunt. If a cub becomes an orphan, it is common for it to be cared for by other females who are related to it, perhaps by a lioness who is an aunt or older sister.

According to a study on sciencedirect.com, &quot;male lions were frequent and successful hunters. The main prey species of all male group types, but particularly nonterritorial males, was buffalo. By contrast, females preyed more frequently on the most abundant medium-sized ungulates, such as wildebeest.&quot; There are photographs of both male and female lions hunting at http://www.laocomics.com/blog/category/animals/.

When young male lions reach the age of one year, they are chased from the prides they are born into by the older male lions. If the lead male is elderly, the young male, either alone or with male siblings, will sometimes fight to take over the leadership of the pride. If the young males leave the pride, they become &quot;rogue&quot; males. They travel alone or may partner with other rogues, perhaps brothers. Having a partner makes it easier for a rogue lion to survive and eventually win a pride of his own.  These rogue lions are often found scavenging food killed by smaller predators, such as hyenas or jackals, which can be chased away. Rogue lions hunt for themselves until they are able to take over a pride of their own!

==What do lions eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[File:Lion with buffalo cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A lioness tries to move a buffalo]]

Lions eat large prey, such as gazelles, antelopes, zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, and buffalo. They have been known to take down even elephants, but then only with all of the adults of the pride participating in the kill.  Even elephants dread lions. When food becomes scarce, lions will hunt smaller prey or sometimes eat the kills of other animals.

Most prey animals can run much faster than the average lion. Therefore, lions hunt in fairly well organized groups and stalk, or sneak up on, their prey.  They may try to surround them first, then make a swift, sudden charge from the tall grass. The grass where lions live is not short and green but grows very tall and is a light brownish color most of the time. The lions' fur is the same color as this grass, making it difficult for other animals to see them.  Coloring that helps to hide an animal or thing is called &quot;camouflage&quot;.   

Females do most of the hunting and work in groups although, if she has to, a single lioness is able to hunt on her own. Male lions are actually more capable hunters than females but they usually focus more on protecting the pride. Lions might spend hours stalking prey but the actual kill is made in just minutes.  After a kill is made, the females let out low roars.  This tells the pride to join them for a meal. Adult males eat first, followed by females, and then cubs. 

To avoid the dangerous heat of the mid-day sun, lions usually hunt at night when the dim light helps to keep them hidden from their prey.  Lions have very good night vision so the darkness does not pose a problem for them. Animals that are active at night like lions are called ''nocturnal'' creatures. Lions can eat 69kg of meat a day!

==Fun facts==

 
* A male lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away.
* The hunting grounds for a pride of lions can range from 8 to 150 square miles.
* The largest lion on record was almost 11.8 feet long and weighed nearly 900 pounds.
* Lions rarely eat an entire kill. Hyenas and vultures finish the rest.
* A lion can run as fast as 50 mph for short distances and can leap a distance of more than 30 feet.
* There are only a quarter the number of lions in Africa as there were just 40 years ago.
* A lion's eyesight is five times better than a human's eyesight, and it can hear prey that is more than a mile away.
* It may take up to 4 hours for a pride of lions to finish eating.
* A male lion eats first, even though the females actually catch the prey.
* After eating, a thirsty lion may drink for as long as 20 minutes.
* Lions were once thought to be magical creatures and were worshiped as gods. Domestic cats replaced lions in that role, especially in Egypt, because they were much safer and easier to care for. 
* There can be up to 40 members in a pride with over half of them being cubs and young adults.
* Females will often stay with the pride their entire life, while young males are driven out.
* A lion eats 36 kg of meat a day.
* When a male lion gets old, its mane may fall off.
* The lion is the only social predator among the Big Cats.
* Lions can't climb as well as leopards.
* Lions can steal food from other predators such as cheetahs.

A class in PHP (as in most modern programming languages) is a way to group related functions (or methods) and variables (or members) together.

== Basics (PHP 5) ==

A class is a structure composed of items, that is, members (also known as properties or variables) and methods (also known as functions), each of which is declared with a visibility that is either explicit (from &quot;private&quot;, &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;public&quot;) or implicit (that is, omission of a declaration, only allowed for methods for which the default value is &quot;public&quot;).

An object is an instance of a class, in which its class's methods (if any) can be called, and its class's members (if any) can be provided with new values overriding the default ones.

== Classes ==

A simple class can be defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?php
  
  /* Start the class */
  class Html {
  
     /*
       Declare a public member named &quot;br&quot; with a default value of &quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot; (the
       XHTML line break)
     */
     public $br = '&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;';
  
  
     /*
       Declare a public (by default) method named &quot;printLn&quot; requiring an argument
       named &quot;message&quot;
     */
     function printLn ($message) {
        
        /*
          Echo the &quot;message&quot; argument followed by the value of the &quot;br&quot; member (accessed
          through the use of the &quot;$this&quot; keyword (that represents the current object),
          the &quot;-&gt;&quot; operator (used to access members) and the member's name ''without''
          the &quot;$&quot; character.
        */
        echo $message . $this-&gt;br;
  
     }
  }
  ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, just because you've created a class doesn't mean you get to use anything in it. A class is an abstract entity. It is a way of saying &quot;here is how to create &lt;tt&gt;Html&lt;/tt&gt;-type objects, and what they do.&quot;  Before you can do anything with the members of a class, you must make an &lt;i&gt;instance&lt;/i&gt; of that class. 

That is, you must actually make an &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Html&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; object and work with that.

== Objects ==

Once you have defined a class, you will want to try it out. Objects are instances of a class. Using objects in PHP is as follows
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$myPage = new Html; // Creates an instance of the Html class
$myPage-&gt;printLn('This is some text'); // Prints &quot;This is some text&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The new concepts in that piece are:

*The &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword &amp;mdash; Used to make a new instance of an object, in this case an object of the class &lt;code&gt;Html&lt;/code&gt;.
*The &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator &amp;mdash; Used to access a member or method of an instantiated object, in this case, the method &lt;code&gt;printLn()&lt;/code&gt;

Now, the fact that the representation of a line break is defined within a member of the class allows you to change it. Note that the changes will only concern an instance, not the whole class. Here is an example (note that &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot; is an HTML line break and &quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot; is an XHTML line break):

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$myPage = new Html; // Creates an instance of the Html class
$myOldHtmlPage = new Html; // Creates another instance of the Html class
$myOldHtmlPage-&gt;br = &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;; // Changes the value of the &quot;br&quot; member of the &quot;$myOldHtmlPage&quot; instance to the old HTML value
$myOldHtmlPage-&gt;printLn('This is some text'); // Prints &quot;This is some text&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;, the new value of the member is used
$myPage-&gt;printLn('This is some text'); // Prints &quot;This is some text&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;, the default value of the member is kept
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, note that it is better to avoid modifying an instance's members: to allow the instance for possible constraint validation, one should instead add to the class (and use while dealing with instances) &quot;get_br&quot; and &quot;set_br&quot; methods to get and set the value of the member while allowing the instance to perform tests and possibly reject the change.

== Scope ==

The scope of an item of a class defines who is allowed either to call it (for methods) or to read / change its value (for properties).

Scope definition is compulsory for properties and facultative for methods where &quot;public&quot; is the default value if nothing is specified.

=== Public ===

Public items can be accessed anywhere.

==== Properties ====

Even though declaring class properties as public makes their use easier, it is generally not recommended. Should you decide in future versions of the class to perform any kind of check on a public property, or store it in another additional property for caching purposes, you couldn't, since the rest of the code would still use the public property without any check.

Therefore, one should prefer (except in special cases) not allowing public access to properties, and provide simple &quot;get_foo&quot; and &quot;set_foo&quot; methods to return or overwrite them, leaving open the possibility of adding complexity if required.

==== Methods ====

Since the methods provide the actual interface between an object and the rest of the world, it makes sense for almost all of your methods to be in public access.

More precisely, any method intended to be called from the outside should be public. However, methods only meant for internal use and that aren't part of the interface should not be public. A typical example being an object abstracting a connection with a database while providing a cache system. Different public methods should exist to allow interaction with the outside world, but, for example, a method sending a raw SQL request to the database should not be public, as any foreign code calling it would bypass the cache and potentially cause useless load or (worse) loss of data as the database's data may be outdated (if the latent changes have taken place in the cache).

=== Protected ===

Protected items defined in a class are accessible to the object that instantiates this class or a subclass of this class.

=== Private ===

Private items defined in a class are accessible to the object that instantiates the class.

== Practical use ==
The above example doesn't make the case for classes and objects. Why go to the bother of creating all that extra structure just to access functions?

Let's give an example that can show how this sort of thing would be useful:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
class Html {
   private $source = &quot;&quot;;
   public function printLn ($message) {
      echo $this-&gt;source .= $message . &quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;;
   }
   public function show () {
      echo $this-&gt;source;
   }
}

$elvis = new Html();
$goth = new Html();

$elvis-&gt;printLn(&quot;Welcome to my Elvis Fan Page! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.&quot;);
$goth-&gt;printLn(&quot;Entree the Goth Poetry Labyrinth of Spoooky Doooommmm...&quot;);
$elvis-&gt;show(); 
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

''Some things to note:''

* The statement &lt;tt&gt;echo $this-&gt;source .= $message .&quot;&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;&quot;;&lt;/tt&gt; first changes the value of the private property &lt;tt&gt;$source&lt;/tt&gt; and then prints the changed value. The changed value is saved.
* A different copy of the &lt;tt&gt;$source&lt;/tt&gt; property exists within each instance of the &lt;tt&gt;Html&lt;/tt&gt; class.
* The &lt;tt&gt;printLn&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;show&lt;/tt&gt; functions refer to the same copy of &lt;tt&gt;$source&lt;/tt&gt; that was called for their object. (When I call &lt;tt&gt;$elvis&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;printLn&lt;/tt&gt; function, it changes &lt;tt&gt;$elvis&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;$source&lt;/tt&gt; variable and the statement &lt;tt&gt;$elvis-&gt;show();&lt;/tt&gt;  prints the changed value of &lt;tt&gt;$source&lt;/tt&gt;).
* Using standard variables and methods, there would be a greater risk of sending the wrong content to the wrong page. Which could be horribly confusing for my website visitors.

Now we can start to see how we could save some time and trouble using classes and objects. We can now easily manage two potential web pages at once, printing the correct content to each. When done, we can merely call a page's &lt;tt&gt;show&lt;/tt&gt; function to send that page's html source to the output stream.

I could add more features to all of the objects just by adding variables and functions to the governing class, and I could add more objects at will just by declaring them. In fact, the more complicated my program gets, the easier everything is to manage using object-oriented programming.

== Wrong Equation ==

Seems to me the equations 
Ip/Is= Np/Ns 
or, rearranging: 
Is= Ip * Ns/Np 
are wrong.

Actually, Vp/Vs=Np/Ns
and since Vp*Ip=Vs*Is &lt;==&gt; Vp/Vs=Is/Ip,
Is/Ip=Np/Ns.

:You are absolutely correct.  I mistakenly was thinking of the equation for voltage instead of current.  Sorry for the mess up. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 14:40, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

Examples:
 &quot;this is a string&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;this is a string&quot;
 
 &quot;three plus three is #{3+3}&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;three plus three is 6&quot; 
 
 foobar = &quot;blah&quot;
 &quot;the value of foobar is #{foobar}&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;the value of foobar is blah&quot; 
 
 'the value of foobar is #{foobar}'
 =&gt; &quot;the value of foobar is \#{foobar}&quot;

A string expression begins and ends with a double or single-quote mark. Double-quoted string expressions are subject to backslash notation and interpolation. A single-quoted string expression isn't; except for \' and \\.

=== Backslash Notation ===
Also called ''escape characters'' or ''escape sequences'', they are used to insert special characters in a string.

Example:
 &quot;this is a\ntwo line string&quot;
 &quot;this string has \&quot;quotes\&quot; in it&quot;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

For characters with decimal values, you can do this:

&lt;code&gt;
&quot;&quot; &lt;&lt; 197 # add decimal value 304 to a string
&lt;/code&gt;

or embed them thus:

&lt;code&gt;
&quot;#{197.chr}&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Interpolation ===
Interpolation allows Ruby code to appear within a string. The result of evaluating that code is inserted into the string:
  &quot;1 + 2 = #{1 + 2}&quot;    &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; &quot;1 + 2 = 3&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

  #{''&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/font&gt;''}

The expression can be just about any Ruby code.
Ruby is pretty smart about handling string delimiters that appear in the code and it generally does what you want it to do.
The code will have the same side effects as it would outside the string, including any errors:

 &quot;the meaning of life is #{1/0}&quot;
 =&gt; divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)

=== The % Notation ===

There is also a Perl-inspired way to quote strings: by using % (percent character) and specifying a delimiting character,
for example:

 %{78% of statistics are &quot;made up&quot; on the spot}
 =&gt; &quot;78% of statistics are \&quot;made up\&quot; on the spot&quot;

Any single non-alpha-numeric character can be used as the delimiter, &lt;tt&gt;%[including these], %?or these?, %~or even these things~&lt;/tt&gt;. By using this notation, the usual string delimiters &quot; and ' can appear in the string unescaped, but of course the new delimiter you've chosen does need to be escaped. However, if you use &lt;tt&gt;%(parentheses), %[square brackets], %{curly brackets}&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;pointy brackets&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; as delimiters then those same delimiters can appear ''unescaped'' in the string as long as they are in ''balanced'' pairs:

 %(string (syntax) is pretty flexible)
 =&gt; &quot;string (syntax) is pretty flexible&quot;

A modifier character can appear after the %, as in %q[], %Q[], %x[] - these determine how the string is interpolated and what type of object is produced:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|'''Modifier'''||'''Meaning'''
|-
|%q[ ]||Non-interpolated String (except for \\ \[ and \])
|-
|%Q[ ]||Interpolated String (default)
|-
|%r[ ]||Interpolated Regexp (flags can appear after the closing delimiter)
|-
|%i[ ]||Non-interpolated Array of symbols, separated by whitespace (after Ruby 2.0)
|-
|%I[ ]||Interpolated Array of symbols, separated by whitespace (after Ruby 2.0)
|-
|%w[ ]||Non-interpolated Array of words, separated by whitespace
|-
|%W[ ]||Interpolated Array of words, separated by whitespace
|-
|%x[ ]||Interpolated shell command
|-
|%s[ ]||Non-interpolated symbol
|}

Here are some more examples:

 %Q{one\ntwo\n#{ 1 + 2 }}
 =&gt; &quot;one\ntwo\n3&quot;
 
 %q{one\ntwo\n#{ 1 + 2 }}
 =&gt; &quot;one\\ntwo\\n#{ 1 + 2 }&quot;
 
 %r/#{name}/i
 =&gt; /nemo/i
 
 %w{one two three}
 =&gt; [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]
 
 %i{one two three} # after Ruby 2.0
 =&gt; [:one, :two, :three]
 
 %x{ruby --copyright}

=== &quot;Here document&quot; notation ===

There is yet another way to make a string, known as a 'here document', where the delimiter itself can be any string:

 string = &lt;&lt;END
 on the one ton temple bell
 a moon-moth, folded into sleep,
 sits still.
 END

The syntax begins with &lt;&lt; and is followed immediately by the delimiter. To end the string, the delimiter appears alone on a line.

There is a slightly nicer way to write a here document which allows the ending delimiter to be indented by whitespace:

 string = &lt;&lt;-FIN
            on the one-ton temple bell
            a moon-moth, folded into sleep
            sits still.
 
            --Taniguchi Buson, 18th century; translated by X. J. Kennedy
          FIN

To use non-alpha-numeric characters in the delimiter, it can be quoted:

 string = &lt;&lt;-&quot;.&quot;
            Orchid - breathing
            incense into
            butterfly's wings.
 
            --Matsuo Basho; translated by Lucien Stryk
          .

Here documents are interpolated, ''unless you use single quotes around the delimiter''.

The rest of the line after the opening delimiter is not interpreted as part of the string, which means you can do this:

 strings = [&lt;&lt;END, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;strings&quot;]
 a long string
 END
 
 =&gt; [&quot;a long string\n&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;strings&quot;]

You can even &quot;stack&quot; multiple here documents:

 string = [&lt;&lt;ONE, &lt;&lt;TWO, &lt;&lt;THREE]
   the first thing
 ONE
   the second thing
 TWO
   and the third thing
 THREE
 
 =&gt; [&quot;the first thing\n&quot;, &quot;the second thing\n&quot;, &quot;and the third thing\n&quot;]

== Arrays ==
An array is a collection of objects indexed by a non-negative integer.
You can create an array object by writing &lt;code&gt;Array.new&lt;/code&gt;, by writing an optional 
comma-separated list of values inside square brackets, or if the array will only contain string objects, a space-delimited string preceded by &lt;code&gt;%w&lt;/code&gt;.

 array_one   = Array.new
 array_two   = []              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# shorthand for Array.new&lt;/font&gt;
 array_three = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# array_three contains &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four  = %w[a b c]       &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# array_four also contains &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

 array_three[0]                &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; &quot;a&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 array_three[2]                &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; &quot;c&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four[0]                 &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; &quot;a&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#negative indices are counted back from the end&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four[-2]                &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; &quot;b&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#[start, count] indexing returns an array of count objects beginning at index start&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four[1,2]               &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#using ranges. The end position is included with two periods but not with three&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four[0..1]              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
 array_four[0...1]             &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;a&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;

The last method, using &lt;code&gt;%w&lt;/code&gt;, is in essence shorthand for the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; when the substrings are separated by whitespace only. In the following example, the first two ways of creating an array of strings are functionally identical while the last two create very different (though both valid) arrays.

  array_one   = %w'apple orange pear'            &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
  array_two   = 'apple orange pear'.split        &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
  array_one   == array_two                       &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; true&lt;/font&gt;
  
  array_three = %w'dog:cat:bird'                 &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;dog:cat:bird&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
  array_four  = 'dog:cat:bird'.split(':')        &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; [&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;]&lt;/font&gt;
  array_three == array_four                      &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# =&gt; false&lt;/font&gt;

== Hashes ==
Hashes are basically the same as arrays, except that a hash not only contains values, 
but also keys pointing to those values. Each key can occur only once in a hash. A hash object 
is created by writing &lt;code&gt;Hash.new&lt;/code&gt; or by writing an optional list of comma-separated 
&lt;code&gt;key =&gt; value&lt;/code&gt; pairs inside curly braces.

 hash_one   = Hash.new
 hash_two   = {}                             &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;# shorthand for Hash.new&lt;/font&gt;
 hash_three = {&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3} &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; {&quot;a&quot;=&gt;1, &quot;b&quot;=&gt;2, &quot;c&quot;=&gt;3}&lt;/font&gt;

Usually [[Ruby_Programming/Reference/Objects/Symbol|Symbols]] are used for Hash keys (allows for quicker access), so you will see hashes declared like this:

 hash_sym   = { :a =&gt; 1, :b =&gt; 2, :c =&gt; 3}   &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; {:b=&gt;2, :c=&gt;3, :a=&gt;1}&lt;/font&gt;
 hash_sym   = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}            &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; {:b=&gt;2, :c=&gt;3, :a=&gt;1}&lt;/font&gt;

The latter form was introduced in Ruby 1.9.

=== Hash ordering ===

Note that with 1.8, iterating over hashes will iterate over the key value pairs in a &quot;random&quot; order.  Beginning with 1.9, it will iterate over them in the order they were inserted.  Note however, that if you reinsert a key without first deleting it, or change an existing key's value, the key's order in iteration does not change.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; a = {:a =&gt; 1, :b =&gt; 2, :c =&gt; 3}
=&gt; {:a=&gt;1, :b=&gt;2, :c=&gt;3}
&gt;&gt; a.keys # iterate over, show me the keys
=&gt; [:a, :b, :c]
&gt;&gt; a[:b] = 2
&gt; a.keys
=&gt; [:a, :b, :c] # same order
&gt;&gt; a.delete(:b)
&gt;&gt; a[:b] = 4 # re insert now
=&gt; 4
&gt;&gt; a.keys
=&gt; [:a, :c, :b] # different order
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Ranges ==
A '''range''' represents a subset of all possible values of a type, to be more precise, all possible values between a start value and an end value.

This may be:
*All integers between 0 and 5.
*All numbers (including non-integers) between 0 and 1, excluding 1.
*All characters between 't' and 'y'.

In Ruby, these ranges are expressed by:
 0..5
 0.0...1.0
 't'..'y'

Therefore, ranges consist of a start value, an end value, and whether the end value is included or not (in this short syntax, using two . for including and three . for excluding).

A range represents a set of values, not a sequence.  Therefore,
 5..0

though syntactically correct, produces a range of length zero.

Ranges can only be formed from instances of the same class or subclasses of a common parent, which must be Comparable (implementing &lt;=&gt;).

Ranges are instances of the Range class, and have certain methods, for example, to determine whether a value is inside a range:
 r = 0..5
 puts r === 4  # =&gt; true
 puts r === 7  # =&gt; false

For detailed information of all Range methods, consult the [[Ruby Programming/Reference/Objects/Range|Range class reference]].

==Constructors==
A constructor is a special method inside a class that is called when the object is initiated. A constructor could be used as follows:


'''This is the PHP5 Version:'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?php
  class test {
    public $name;   
    public function __construct ($name) {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
     }
  }
  $testing = new test('Hello');
  echo $testing-&gt;name;  // Prints 'Hello'
  ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''This is the equivalent PHP4.x Version:''' 
(Note that there are no public/private keywords, and the name of the class is the constructor)
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?php
  class test {
    var $name;   
    function test ($name) {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
     }
  }
  $testing = new test('Hello');
  echo $testing-&gt;name;  // Prints 'Hello'
  ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In PHP5 a constructor must be declared as public or it will not work. The name of a constructor must always be __construct in PHP5.The name of the class must be used as a constructor in PHP5.

==Destructors==
Destructors delete an instance of an object. The destructor is declared within the object's class, and contains other code to be executed at the time of destruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
   &lt;?php
   class myClass {
     function __construct() {
         print &quot;Constructing new myClass...\n&quot;;
         $this-&gt;name = &quot;My class&quot;;
     }
     function __destruct() {
         print &quot;Destroying &quot; . $this-&gt;name . &quot;\n&quot;;
     }
   }
   $obj = new myClass();
   ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that destructors only exist in PHP5.

==Why Constructors and Destructors Are Great==
Why are constructors and destructors useful? Sometimes objects represent complex entities that use other resources or have other side effects, even though they appear as simple variables in your program. In these cases, special setup may be required when you create the object; you can use the constructor to do that automatically for you. Also, it can be very important to free those resources at the end of your program so that they don't get tied up from multiple runs or pageviews; the destructor can automatically handle that so you don't forget.

Here's an example that makes handling MySQL databases slightly simpler:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 class db_link {
  private $link;
  public function __construct ($database_name) {
   $link = mysql_connect (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;);
   mysql_select_db ($database_name, $link);
   $this -&gt; link = $link;
   }
  function query ($sql_query) {
   $result = mysql_query ($sql_query, $this -&gt; link);
   return $result;
   }
  function __destruct() {
   mysql_close ($this -&gt; link);
   }
  }
 $db = new db_link (&quot;MyDB&quot;);
 $result = $db-&gt;query (&quot;Select * from MyTable&quot;);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The class &quot;db_link&quot; uses 3 functions: the constructor, which automatically logs into the database for me whenever I create a new &quot;db_link&quot; object, a &quot;query&quot; function, which I can use to get records from the database, and the destructor, which automatically closes the database whenever PhP is finished with my object instance. I could do the same things as the constructor and destructor by writing special &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; functions for the database, but then I would have to call those functions every time. This way, all I have to do is make objects and use them; they can open and close themselves automatically.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

==Serialization and Unserialization==

In certain cases, it is necessary to store an instantiated(created) object as static text for storage between program runs, usually in a file or database field. This can be stored using serialization, which creates a string from an object that can then be unserialized into a working object, including working methods and properties.

An object can be serialized with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 class test {
  private $test1;
  public function __construct ($testval) {
   $this-&gt;test1=$testval;
   }
  public function get_testval() {
   return $testval;
   }
  }
 $testobject = new test (&quot;Testing serialization...&quot;)
 $serialized_testobject = serialize($testobject);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
$serialized_testobject is a string that can then be stored as text in a file or database column, assuming it does not exceed the size limit for the column. It can be unserialized with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 class test {
  private $test1;
  public function __construct ($testval) {
   $this-&gt;test1=$testval;
   }
  public function get_testval() {
   return $testval;
   }
  }
 $testobject = unserialize($serialized_testobject);
 echo $testobject-&gt;get_testval();
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the test class needs to be defined as it is not defined in the serialized string. Defining the class in a different way may cause problems when unserializing. The class must have the same name.

Certain objects, however, will need to perform tasks before and after serializing to ensure consistency between runs. For example, database links will need to be destroyed when serializing and recreated when unserializing, or they will be invalidated later. The object is prepared for serialization during the user-defined __sleep() method, and is prepared for work after unserializing with __wakeup(), as shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 class db_link {
  private $link;
  public function __construct ($database_name) {
   $link = mysql_connect (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;);
   mysql_select_db ($database_name, $link);
   }
  function query ($sql_query) {
   $result = mysql_query ($sql_query, $link);
   return $result;
   }
  function __destruct() {
   mysql_close ($link);
   }
  function __sleep() {
   mysql_close ($link);
  }
  function __wakeup() {
   $link = mysql_connect (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;);
   mysql_select_db ($database_name, $link);
  }
 $db = new db_link (&quot;MyDB&quot;)
 $result = $db-&gt;query (&quot;Select * from MyTable&quot;)
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the link is closed when serializing, and reopened when unserializing as the link would probably not have the same network state if stored in a text file for a few hours. In complex classes, many properties and other data not highly dependent on time would be stored in the serialized string, while more volatile things like file handles and database links would be closed and reopened later. An exception does exist: Large amounts of data that can be quickly generated should be destroyed or at least compacted in __sleep() so they do not take up space in the serialized file. For example, an array containing algorithmically-generated entries that is 2000 entries long should be regenerated.

*[http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/spreadsheets/examples/marsSolution.html] -- Weight data
Atlas of the universe ISBN 0 540 06087 9 -first two jubiter facts

Walabio, thanks for fixing the mistake about how many Earths could fit in the volume of Jupiter. I forget to divide the diameter of Jupiter by two to get the radius. But don't call honest mistakes vandalism like you did on the history page. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 02:51, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

The discussion about weight being the same on Earth as it is on Jupiter is flawed.  Weight and mass have clear and distinct definitions, Mass is the same on Earth and Jupiter, but weight is not.  I haven't corrected this because the discussion was quiet deep and I think it is worth giving it the attention it deserves

:I changed that section because a lot of the material got moved to its own article. Now the question asks how much force there would be due to gravity rather than using the word weight. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 21:07, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Jupiter facts ===
I removed the following:
*Jupiter's magnetic field is the largest single thing in the solar system. It is 26 million kilometers across, making it about 20 times bigger than the Sun. It has a tail that extends past Saturn's orbit. If it could be seen from Earth, it would appear to be five times the size of the full moon.
*Because it is so much larger than the other planets, it had been said that the solar system consists of the sun, Jupiter, and other assorted debris.
The first is better suited for the article itself. The size of the magnetic field is notable - and indeed a fact - but: How big is the sun? How far away is saturn? What ''is'' a magnetic field? A box such of this should have &quot;faster&quot; facts. 
The second isn't a fact. - [[User:69.22.96.91|69.22.96.91]] 11:01, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
*helium turns into liquid because the planet is very hot ?

==Images not ligning up==

I just added an image to &quot;what is it made of&quot; and it's appearing in a different section. I know there is an  tag  that clears the section if there is not enough text to fully wrap the image - something like &lt;clear=all&gt; but I can't remember it. Can anyone else clean up the bottom of this page? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:28, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

:Not to worry. I've sorted it. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:32, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

==Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto==
They were loved by Zeus and not by Jupiter. Only for Callisto I've found Jupiter mentioned as well. Anyway, not only because this book is for kids there should be mentioned the same mythologic story that is mentioned in the articles of the moons themselves. [[User:Knightowld|Knightowld]] 20:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

:I would agree that there is a huge confusion in terms of terminology, and the fact that the names for celestial objects were chosen by people much later than the people who made up these ledgends.  If you think Jupiter vs. Zeus and these planets are confusing, try Uranus, where all of the moons are named after characters in Shakespearian plays.  Or even getting more whimsical with the names of asteroids like [[w:2309 Mr. Spock|2309 Mr. Spock]] or [[w:9007 James Bond|9007 James Bond]] (I'm not making either of these names up, I promise!)  Mythology can only go so far for a kids book, but it does add some extra flavor.  It certainly shouldn't be taken too literally, nor with any sort of religious fervor, even if you accept the Greek gods as your source of devine inspiration.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:29, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

== Moons ==

Clearly, the caspian stars are important enough to merit their own subpages, but which of the other moons are?

== Discovery/Exploration of Jupiter? ==

I believe that this article should include the discovery and maybe the exploration of Jupiter, as these are included in almost every other article on this Wikibook. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

: It looks to me as if there's no discovery section for objects that were known to the ancients.

: I'm not finding exploration sections, off hand.  Is this covered under discovery, for those pages that have that?  It seems this would be a significant change, which doesn't make it bad but does mean it would be good to plan it out carefully.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:25, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:: Lack of research on my part on ancient discoveries. However, exploration then should maybe be a replacement for the ancient discoveries. The page dedicated for exploration talks more about the space shuttles and the people/dogs rather than the actual observation of the celestial objects. I do not see much need for planning; just put it right between ''How much Jupiter's gravity would pull on me?'' and ''Who was it named after?''. If you agree, I will do this after I see your approval. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Malignant melanoma is a neoplasm arising from the melanocytes in the epidermis. It is strongly associated with fair-skinned people with excessive sunlight exposure, particularly episodes of sunburn during childhood. It is commonest in areas with high sun exposure and a predominantly Caucasian population - eg. Australia, South Africa, the &quot;Sunbelt&quot; region of the United States.

== Epidemiology ==
== Pathology ==
=== Macroscopic appearance ===
# Superficial spreading melanoma
# Nodular melanoma
# Lentigo maligna melanoma
# Acral lentiginous melanoma
# Amelanotic melanoma

== Staging == 
The AJCC / UICC TNM system is the current staging system. T stage is assessed on total thickness of the melanoma, and further categorised by the presence or absence of ulceration.

For full current details, the cancer.gov Physician's Data Query is recommended:

== Treatment ==
A general strategy can be summarised as:
# Confirming the diagnosis
# Staging the disease
# Deciding on best stage-appropriate treatment according to current evidence, local resources and patient physiology

This is achieved by:

# Excisional biopsy with a close border
# Further staging, if justified by clinical findings or by thickness &gt;= 1 mm
# Definitive excision and closure
# Consideration of (staging) sentinel lymph node biopsy or (therapeutic) lymphadenectomy
# Consideration of adjuvant therapies (interferon) or clinical trials
# Consideration of treatment of any metastatic disease.

This field of surgery is developing rapidly, with major trials recently published or in progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your best starting point is to have either a pressing '''need''', or a powerful '''desire''' to master the [[w:language|language]]. This may seem obvious, but interest combined with passion brings the best results. If you're not really enthusiastic about learning the language, then you will end up stalling or quitting. Your sustained interest is decisive - which is why courses with a teacher often work better than teaching yourself, as the structured setting and company can carry you over the ''inevitable'' slumps. If the choice of language isn't made for you, pick a language that you can use or practice often in your daily routine, or create such opportunities for yourself. Join a speaking club where the enthusiasm is infectious, or spend some time with cultural things that [[w:motivation|motivate]] you. [[w:Rod Ellis|Rod Ellis]] in &quot;The Study of Second Language Acquisition&quot; (1994) states &quot;''SLA research ...views motivation as a key factor in L2 learning.''&quot; &lt;!--(page 508) --&gt; If possible, find materials like books, magazines, websites, radio, TV or movies in the target language as a supplement to other education. Like-minded buddies (in real life or on chat-sites, for instance) are even better. The more exposure you have to the language in actual use - whether passive (listening/viewing) or active (conversation, reading) - the better.

17 Nov 2004 Jondel reloaded the whole most recent article from wikipedia.--[[User:Jondel|Jondel]] 07:31, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==  Passive Learning  ==

There are several points in the article that suggest passive or subconscious learning.  I'm not familiar with any studies supporting this theory.  I'd suggest either referencing something on the subject or removing them.  My field is technology and language pedagogy, so I could just be unfamiliar with the research, but I'm skeptical.   It seems as though people have been adding tips onto a list for sometime.  A bit of cleaning my be due.  I would suggest an introduction to foreign language pedagogy based on resources from scholar.google.com, with the rest of the article, or separate articles, based on the four basic skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

(bryantt)

: I'm not familiar with much about language learning, but you can add {{tl|citation needed}} as a compromise for now.
: There don't seem to be many active editors here so if you figure you can improve the book without upsetting anyone, just [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and fix it up. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:59, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

== Audiobook (Pimsleur?) ==

This wikibook is a great effort to provide instructional tools in learning foreign language. It would be great if there is an accompanying audio instruction.

Recently I've been using Pimsleur methods to learn spanish, and I find it very good. If anyone is an expert in liguistic and language instructional methods, and is interested in doing Pimsleur audio on Indonesian language, I'd be delighted to help to read out the phrases, since I'm an indonesian native speaker. However, I can't be the one who organize and edit the audio because I don't have experience in language teaching methods. Besides, I think &quot;pimsleur method&quot; itself is not copyrighted (am I correct) although there are pimsleur branded instructional recordings released by Simon and Schuster. Hence I'd think it's possible to replicate the method and record our own instructional recordings in order to make language instruction more accessible (currently the Simon and Schuster Pimsleur is really expensive!).

I have started [[Wikibooks:Wikiproject languages‎]]. Feel free to edit that page, add comment, critics and being bold.--[[User:Youssefsan|Oualmakran Youssef]] 12:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

==Mnemosyne software==
I suggest that you add information about spaced-repetition software such as  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_(software) Mnemosyne software] to the memorization section. I personally found it extremely helpful for memorization. I also suggest that you discuss IPA a bit in the section on pronunciation.

== Learning languages fast ! Encourage contributing to a list of words that both languages have in common or are very similar or easy to remember - that's a real giveaway - and little useful easy phrases and [[mnemotechnic]] means on how to remember them ==
It's alway very encouraging when you get to know some words in a foreign language fast.  And why not start with an easy to remember list of words that are similar or very similar or for some reason easy to remember using a mnemotechnic means.
Then why not start with some easy and very useful phrases and then spin out and learning how to conjugate verbs used in these very useful phrases?

===How to survive thick sand===

Riding a motorbike is often an exercise in defeating ones own instincts. Riding a bike in thick sand is a good example of this. Instinct says go slowly when approaching anything threatening; however, going slowly on a bike is a sure way of having an accident, more so when riding in a threatening situation.

When approaching an area of thick sand it is best to slow down while approaching, then ''gently'' accelerate upon reaching the sandy patch. Motion is what gives stability to any bike, be it a bicycle or a motorbike.

With a motorbike, this stability is especially linked to the back tire's grip on the ground.  Applying too much power will cause the back wheel to spin, thus losing grip, causing the bike to either fall over or dig its back wheel into the sand.

If the sand is particularly thick, fine, or both, and the back wheel has dug itself in, the best thing to do in this situation is to get off, use the &quot;clutch and accelerator&quot; combined to gently apply forward motion; then run with the bike past the worst bit, and finally leap back on.

Instinct causes panic when it feels as if things are out of your control. Often, when in a situation like thick sand, the bike will throw itself about a bit; this is normal, and often a hint that one is going too slowly. The worst thing you can do on a bike is to stiffen up.  Rather, sit upright, lean slightly forward, and relax your arms. If the going is really bad, stand up on the pegs, and lean forward. The main thing is relax and give the bike the power it needs to get out.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Francs2000. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Francs2000~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I have difficulty recommending any books on logic.  Perhaps that indicates the need for the present work.  Perhaps you can recommend one to me.  You might want to look at:

Wilfred Hodges,  ''Logic''  Penguin Books, 1977  ISBN 0140219854


The next two books on the list are definitely rather mathematical:

*Elliott Mendelson, ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''  Wadsworth &amp; Brooks/Cole, 1987  ISBN 0534066240

:: The word 'introduction' in the title needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.

*Boolos &amp; Jeffrey, ''Computability and Logic''

Fault Diagnosis


Our propositional calculus can be quite useful for descriptions of systems and fault diagnoses.  Here are some propositions regarding part of a fairly simple plumbing system:

* If there is an overflow in the upper tank, then the buzzer is sounding or there is an electrical problem.
* If there is water dripping from the ceiling, then there is an overflow in the upper tank.
* The buzzer is not sounding.
* There is water dripping from the ceiling.
____________________________________________

* There is an electrical problem.


As with many things the propositions could be divided into:

* observations, e.g. 'the buzzer is sounding';
* hypothetical if-then statements;
* diagnoses. 


Anyway, to show that the argument above is valid, we first assign letters to all the elementary propositions:

* p - there is an overflow in the upper tank;
* q - the buzzer is sounding;
* r - there is an electrical problem;
* s - water is dripping from the ceiling.

Then we can write our propositions out using symbols:

* P &amp;rarr; (q &amp;or; r)
* s &amp;rarr; p
* &amp;not; q
* s



With fairly simple systems, one's intuition usually provides the correct answer fairly quickly.  If you think of a chemical plant or a power station, the chains of inference can get quite complicated, yet swift action may be required in the case of a fault.  In this case automated reasoning in the form of 'expert systems' can be quite useful.  (Of course then there is the problem that the expert system could be faulty.  Here we encounter the problem of infinite regress.)  When the reasoning gets complicated, the kind of analysis we have done here becomes useful.  


If this kind of thing interests you, then perhaps you should study artificial intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax==

As you've seen in the earlier chapter, Pascal programs have a standard structure which looks like the following:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
Program program_name;

{ Global variables }
Var
 A_Variable: Variable_Type;

{ Other functions/procedures }

Procedure SayHello;

 { Local variables }
 Var
  T : String;

 Begin
  { Redundant code to illustrate the use of local variables in a procedure }
  T := 'Hello'; 
  Writeln(T);
 End;

{ Main function }

Begin
 { Do something }
 SayHello;
End.
&lt;/source&gt;

A program has a ''program header'', followed by ''global variable definitions'', ''procedure or function definitions'' and finally the ''main function''. 

===Variables===

As you may already figure, variable definitions are put in a block beginning with a &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; keyword, followed by definitions of the variables you wish to define. This block has no explicit end marker. 

As you can see from the example, unlike C/C++, Pascal variables are declared outside the code-body of the function (i.e. they are not declared within the &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; pairs), but are instead declared after the definition of the procedure/function and before the &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; keyword. For global variables, they are defined after the &lt;code&gt;program&lt;/code&gt; header.

A declaration in the &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; block יas the following syntax:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
A_Variable,Another_Variable ... : Variable_Type;
&lt;/source&gt;

Declarations may occur on multiple lines, as in the following:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
a,b : integer;
c : integer;
d,e : string;
f : real;
g : extended;
h,i,j,k : byte;
l,m,n,o : byte;
&lt;/source&gt;

Basic numeric types include: &lt;code&gt;longint&lt;/code&gt; (32-bit, hardware dependent), &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt; (16-bit, hardware dependent), &lt;code&gt;shortint&lt;/code&gt; (8-bit). Their unsigned counterparts are cardinal (available only in some versions of Pascal), &lt;code&gt;word&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;. Decimal numbers are supported using the &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; type, and the &lt;code&gt;extended&lt;/code&gt; type (available only in some versions of Pascal)

Other types include the char (for holding characters), the string (as its name suggests).

(For now, arrays, pointers, types and records will be covered in a later chapter)

==Functions/Procedures==

Before we begin, let us first clarify the key difference between functions and procedures. A procedure is set of instructions to be executed, with no return value. A function is a procedure '''with a return value'''. For readers familiar with C/C++, a procedure is simply a function with a void return value, as in void proc_sayhello(). 

The definition of function/procedures is thus as such:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
Function Func_Name(params...) : Return_Value;
Procedure Proc_Name(params...);
&lt;/source&gt;

The function/procedure definition is usually followed by the local variables and the body. However, to provide prototypes, simply add a '''forward''' keyword behind the definition instead of the local variables and the body. Of course, the whole function must be defined somewhere else in the program. The following example illustrates the use of this:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
Function Add(A, B : Integer): Integer; Forward;

Function Bad(A, B, C : Integer) : Integer;

Begin
 Bad := Add(Add(A,B),C);
End;

Function Add(A, B : Integer) : Integer; 
Begin
 Add := A + B;
End;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, Add is first defined as a function taking two integer variables and returning an integer, but it is defined as a forward definition (prototype), and thus no body is written. Later, we see that Add is defined with a body. Note that the two definitions of Add must be congruent with each other, or the compiler will complain.

From the above example, we can also gather that in Pascal, a function's return value is given by the value of the variable with the function's name (or by the variable named &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;), when the function returns. As you can see in the Bad function, an undefined variable named &quot;Bad&quot; has been assigned a value. That is the return value for the Bad function. Similarly, in Add, the variable named &quot;Add&quot; has been assigned a value, which is its return value.

Note that unlike C or other languages, assigning a return value to a function '''does not''' return from the function. Thus, the function will continue executing, as in the following example:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
Function Weird(A : Integer) : Integer;

Var
 S : Integer;

Begin
 S := A/2;

 If S &lt; 10 Then
  Weird := 1;

 S := S + 9;

 If S &gt;= 10 Then
  Weird := 0;

 Weird := 2;
End;
&lt;/source&gt;

If A happens to be 6, the function will not return the expected result of 1 or even 0. Instead, it would return a result of 2, because the function to execute continues even after the return value is set. In fact, as you would notice, the function would return 2 all the time because it runs all the way to the end, at which the return value is set to 2. 

To mimic C style function returns, the exit statement must be used. The exit statement in Pascal, unlike C, exits from the current block of code (in this case, the function), and NOT from the program. The code would then look like this:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
Function Weird(A : Integer) : Integer;

Var
 S : Integer;

Begin
 S := A/2;

 If S &lt; 10 Then
 Begin
  Weird := 1;
  Exit;
 End;

 S := S + 9;
 
 If S &gt;= 10 Then
 Begin
  Weird := 0;
  Exit;
 End;

 Weird := 2;
End;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that a third exit is not necessary at the end of the function since nothing else would be executed that could overwrite the function return.

Los Angeles - 256&lt;br&gt;
New York - 192&lt;br&gt;
San Francisco - 144&lt;br&gt;
Boston - 108&lt;br&gt;
Miami - 320

== Reasoning ==

Let L, N, S, B, M be the numbers of cars sold at Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Boston and Miami respectively.

The statement of the puzzle gives these equations:

 L = (L + N + S + B + M)/4 + 1
 N = (N + S + B + M)/4 + 1
 S = (S + B + M)/4 + 1
 B = (B + M)/4 + 1
 L + S = B + N + 100 (a)

The first four equations can be simplified:

 4L = L + N + S + B + M + 4
 4N = N + S + B + M + 4
 4S = S + B + M + 4
 4B = B + M + 4

 3L = N + S + B + M + 4
 3N = S + B + M + 4
 3S = B + M + 4
 3B = M + 4

 3L = N + 3N = 4N (b)
 3N = S + 3S = 4S (c)
 3S = B + 3B = 4B (d)
 3B = M + 4       (e)

From equation (a) we have

    4L + 4S = 4B + 4N + 400
 =&gt; 4L + 4S = 3S + 3L + 400
 =&gt;  L + S = 400
 =&gt;  L = 400 - S

Combining this equation with equations (b) and (c) gives

    3(400 - S) = 4N
 =&gt; 9(400 - S) = 12N = 16S
 =&gt;  3600 - 9S = 16S
 =&gt;        25S = 3600
 =&gt;          S = 144

From this result and equations (b) to (e), the remaining values easily fall into place:

 L = 256

The asteroid belt lies between the planets Mars and Jupiter. It contains lumps of rock and metal much smaller than planets. These lumps are called asteroids or minor planets. They are not visible from Earth with the naked eye, but many may be seen through binoculars or small telescopes.{{clear}}

The largest asteroid in the solar system is called &quot;2001 KX76.&quot; In the asteroid belt, the four largest bodies are Ceres (a dwarf planet named after the Roman goddess of agriculture), Vesta (the Roman goddess of the home), Pallas (the granddaughter of Poseidon), and Hygiea (the Greek goddess of health). These four bodies make up about half of the asteroid belt. 

Some asteroids are less than a kilometer across. Unofficially the limit has been set at 50 meters, and anything smaller than that is going to be simply called a meteoroid. With advances in telescopes and particularly for objects that travel close to the Earth, some objects smaller than 50 metres have indeed been seen passing nearby the Earth.

There are probably several million asteroids in the solar system.  Over 96,000 asteroids have been given numbers. Almost 12,000 of them have names. But even though there are a lot of asteroids, the asteroid belt is mostly empty space. Traveling through the asteroid belt in a space ship would not be very much like what you see in a science fiction film. This would not be the same in the first 100 million years of the solar system's history (had humans evolved and discovered film). The asteroid belt lost 99.99% of its mass in the first 100 million years of the solar system.

==What are they named after?==
The first asteroids were named after mythical heroes and gods much like the major planets. The first to be discovered was named Ceres after the Roman goddess of growing plants (particularly grain) and of motherly love. The second asteroid discovered was called Pallas and was named after one of the Greek gods of wisdom. Asteroids are also given a number in the order of their discovery, so Ceres is 1, Pallas is 2, and so forth.

As the number of known asteroids increased, they ran out of mythical names so other names were used instead. Some asteroids were named after countries. For example asteroid number 136 is named Austria. Others were named after plants, for example 978 Petunia. 1620 Geographos was named after the National Geographic Society, in recognition to their efforts at sharing knowledge about the Solar System. Many are named after people, both alive and dead. In a couple of cases, like 2309 Mr. Spock, asteroids were named after the discoverer's pet cat. This last type of naming is discouraged, but it still happens from time to time. Even fictional characters have been used.

Today, names for asteroids can be suggested by the people who discover them. The names become official after a group of people reviews them to make sure they are not offensive or too much like another name. Because so many asteroids are now being found, most new asteroid discoveries are not even getting a name at all, but rather a numbered code. It is not likely that they will ever be given a formal name, at least in this century.

The actual word ''Asteroid'' can refer to any member of the family of Asteroidea; in other words, a starfish. The etymology of the word comes from Ancient Greek ''ἀστεροειδής'', literally meaning star form. The Ancient Greeks probably must have mistook the asteroids for stars.

Most of the asteroids have symbols representing them; for example, Ceres has ⚳, representing Ceres's scythe, and Pallas has ⚴, reperesenting Athena's spear.

==Who discovered them?==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Asteroid Belt Facts''':

* The total mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt is about 1/35th of that of our moon.
* The largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, makes about 1/3 of the total weight of all the asteroids.
* Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt.
* Vesta is the only asteroid that can ever be seen with the naked eye. It's magnitude can reach +5.1, about the same as Uranus.
** Although people probably saw Vesta and Uranus thousands of years ago, they were not recognised to orbit the Sun until 200 years ago.
&lt;/div&gt;

The first asteroid to be discovered was Ceres, on 1 January 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi accidentally. At first he thought this was a comet, then later a planet! When it was realised it was too small Sir William Herschel (the astronomer who discovered Uranus) made up the word &quot;asteroid&quot; to describe it, using the Ancient Greek word ''aster'', meaning star, and the ''-oid'', meaning form or shape. In other words a star-like planet, because he couldn't see any details due to the small size of the object.

By 1807 another 3 asteroids were discovered, but no more were found until 1845 when a persistent asteroid hunter named Karl Ludwig Hencke found a fifth, and sixth asteroid in 1847. Ever since then at least one new asteroid has been found each year.

In 1891, the first pictures of the night sky were taken to find more asteroids. This led to the discovery of many more asteroids. A picture of the same part of the sky is taken on two different nights. When the two pictures are lined up, the stars will be in the same places but an asteroid will have moved.

In our modern times, over 280,000 asteroids have been discovered. Many more are being found all the time. Some of these asteroids pass near the earth and astronomers want to find any that come close to our planet. Large numbers of asteroids are now being discovered by machines.

==What are they made of?==
Three out of four asteroids are made of rock that is rich in carbon. The rest are made of the metals iron and nickel. About half of these are pure iron and nickel; the rest are mixed with compounds of silica, the element that makes up rocks. Each of the larger metal asteroids contains huge amounts of iron: much more than is mined every year on Earth. Vesta, the brightest asteroid, has a very unusual composition - being made of high-density volcanic rocks.

Scientists are very interested in what asteroids are made of because it can help them learn how the solar system was formed. Several spacecraft have visited asteroids to learn more about them.

==Are there asteroids outside of the asteroid belt?==
[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|framed|right|All the major asteroid clusters in the solar system. It does look like the asteroid belt is clustered in the picture, but one milimetre of emptiness in the picture means millions of kilometres emptiness.]]Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt, but not all. Some asteroids orbit closer to the Sun, and many asteroids orbit beyond Neptune. Asteroids that closely approach Earth are called Near-Earth Asteroids. Sometimes pieces of asteroids strike the Earth, burning in the atmosphere as a meteor. If they are large enough, they might actually hit the surface and become meteorites.

[[Image:idamoon.jpg|left|thumb|Asteroid Ida and its moon]]

A centaur is a mythical beast having a horse's body with a man's head and torso in place of the head and neck of the horse. There are some asteroids in the outer solar system that are called Centaurs. It is hard to tell whether any one Centaur is an asteroid, comet, or Kuiper Belt object. For example, the first Centaur to be discovered was Chiron(In Greek Mythology, an important centaur). But some scientists think it is a comet, not an asteroid. Officially it is called both the asteroid 2060 Chiron and the comet 95P/Chiron!

In most cases when an asteroid's orbit crosses the path of a planet such as Jupiter, at some point the asteroid will either hit the planet or else be hurled into another orbit. Many of the small moons of some planets may have once been asteroids that were captured by the planet's gravity when they came too close. However there are two points along the orbit of a planet were an asteroid can safely linger. These are found at a point one-sixth (or 60°) of an orbit ahead of the planet, and
the same distance behind the planet. These sites are called Lagrange points, and they are found where the force of gravity from the Sun and the planet balance out with the motion of the asteroid's orbit. The asteroids found in these spots are called Trojans, and they move around the Sun at the same velocity as the planet.

==Ceres==
[[Image:Ceres optimized.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The dwarf planet Ceres.]]

Ceres is a large Dwarf Planet like Pluto located in the asteroid field. The difference between Ceres and most other dwarf planets is that it is also an asteroid. Ceres is one of the few asteroids that are shaped like       a sphere, and it may have some ice just underneath its dusty surface.

==Some famous asteroids==
Ceres the first discovered and biggest asteroid in the solar system. 

The asteroid Ida has its own moon named Dactyl. A number of asteroid moons have now been found.

==Name==
As a chapter, this should be called &quot;Asteroid Belt&quot; with a capital &quot;B&quot;.  I'd move it, but I'm worried it might mess up the templates.  [[User:Rachel|Rachel]] 16:45, 19 October 2005 (UTC)


Should it be just called asteriods? Most of the info is just on asteroids - generally. There isn't even a section on how the belt came to be, or why it stays there ( all ordered) but yet there are other asteroids randomly in the solar system etc. [[User:cilstr 11:45, 16 August 2006

== Writing this module as an introduction to other modules ==

When doing the &quot;cleanup&quot; of this module, it might be nice to make this more into an introduction of the asteroids as a general topic, with this being a launching point to other sections on specific Asteroids.  There is indeed a rich history for Ceres and Vesta, and some detailed information together with pictures (important for kids!) of several other asteroids.  Ceres in particular is going to be an interesting topic not only because it is the largest of all asteroids, but because there is a robotic mission that is going to do specific exploration of that asteroid that has already been designed and is scheduled to launch some time next year.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)


==Response==
I dont really understand your point, but I agree that this module needs an overhaul (if your not working on this anymore, then disregard), but as I edit I will focus on reorganization and rewriting [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 01:00, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

==Reorganize==
I removed these pictures from the top of the page in order to reorganize it, Im no good at coding, so would someone turn this into legitamate code that will fit on the page?

&lt;b&gt;
&quot;[Image:Asteroid belt between Mars &amp; Jupiter.PNG|none]]
[Image:idamoon.jpg|thumb|Asteroid Ida and its moon]]&quot;
&lt;/b&gt;

:Sorry but I reverted you. Whilst reorganising you removed the section on what asteroids were made of and you removed they key facts box on asteroids. I realise that the top of the page is a bit ugly at the moment but some of that is caused by the cleanupboxes. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:58, 12 May 2006 (UTC)                                                 





April 26, 2007- I know that the asteroid belt is awesome and I also know that the gravitational pull of the planets occasionally take an asteroid or two out of the belt. Jupiter is the planet that keeps the asteroid belt in place as it revolves around the sun. P.S.- There are around 40,000 asteroids in the asteroid belt.

== Proofing ==

I did a quick proofing check of this page and have a few suggestions:
# ''It contains lumps of rock much smaller than planets.'' There are asteroids that are made primarily of metal. (See &quot;M-type asteroid&quot; on wikipedia). It would be more correct to say &quot;rock or metal&quot;, or even &quot;rock and metal&quot;.
# ''The largest asteroid is 2001 KX76.'' While this is true (depending on whether the plutino definition is accepted by the IAU) '2001 KX76' is in the Kuiper belt, rather than the asteroid belt. I would suggest changing the text to read: &quot;The largest asteroid in the solar system is 2001 KX76. The largest asteroid in the asteroid belt is Ceres, which is 1,032 kilometers across.&quot;
# ''Some asteroids are less than a kilometer.'' It should say &quot;across&quot;.
# ''some objects have been seen that are indeed smaller than 50 meters that merely pass nearby the Earth.'' Awkwardly worded. How about: &quot;some objects smaller than 50 metres have indeed been seen passing nearby the Earth.&quot;
# ''Due to some automated asteroid scanning observatories and a systematic exploration of the Solar System for near-Earth asteroids'' seems too technical. &quot;Because so many near Earth asteroids are now being found&quot; cuts to the chase. Perhaps the &quot;Who discovered them?&quot; section could mention the automated observatories?
# ''Ida is the only asteroid with a moon, named Dactyl.'' Not even remotely true. At least 37 have been discovered so far. There may be many, many more. C.f. the wikipedia article on &quot;Asteroid moon&quot;.
Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 21:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
: These are changes that should be made. If you don't get around to it, I'll do it in the next week or so. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 05:09, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

Would it make sense to include a table of the five largest asteroids (by maximum dimension) in the belt? &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 18:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

: That seems like a good idea. I have a question though. Is Ceres still an asteriod? I thought it was now a dwarf planet and not an asteroid. Is it both? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 21:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

::Out of curiosity, how many asteroids fit the current IAU definition of a &quot;minor planet&quot;?  (aka with Pluto, Quorar, etc.) That might be a good limit on what to include in this table, as I think Ceres and Vesta both fit the description and definition.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:::According to Wikipedia Ceres is considered a dwarf planet and Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea may be if it is determined that their shapes are formed by hydrostatic equilibrium. [[w:Dwarf_planet#List_of_dwarf_planets|Wikipedia Dwarf Planet]]. According to NASA &quot;According to the IAU, more dwarf planets are expected to be announced in the coming months and years. Currently, a dozen candidate dwarf planets are listed on IAU's dwarf planet watchlist, which keeps changing as new objects are found and the physics of the existing candidates becomes better-known.&quot; and &quot;Instead, on August 24, 2006, an alternate proposal came into effect labeling Ceres a 'dwarf planet'. It is not yet clear whether dwarf planet status is, like planet status, a sole defining category, or whether dwarf planets also retain their previous minor body classifications such as 'asteroid.'&quot; --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:37, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
::::Well, since this is about the asteroid belt, we could just say &quot;Largest bodies in the asteroid belt&quot;. That would get around whether they are asteroids or not. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 22:48, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

== Trojan asteroids ==

The one portion of the text that I think may be problematic for wikijunior is the final paragraph of &quot;Are there asteroids outside of the asteroid belt?&quot; I.e. the whole concept of Trojans, Lagrange points, and 60&amp;deg; stable orbit locations. Is this going to work for a very young reader? Perhaps that paragraph needs to be simplified or explained a little more? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 18:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
:The paragraphs contain some interesting information. I think they add value to the article, but may be a little overly technical for the audience. So I'm not sure. I would lean toward trying to simplify the language rather than removing them completely. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 21:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Project Management is an organized approach to guiding a project from its inception to closure. Managing projects is becoming more and more important as we enter the digital era. To cope with the pace that this transition demands, a method is required to manage projects so they can yield quality work, while incorporating efficient use of time and resources. In this Wikibook, several project management methods/processes are outlined: the '''''Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)''''' and '''''Projects in Controlled Environments (PRINCE2)''''' approaches can be applied to managing any type of project; whereas methods such as SDM, DSDM, RAD, ISAC, SA/SD, IEM and OO are specific to managing Information Technology (IT) projects. Before some of these project management methods/processes are explored in this Wikibook, we will review some project essentials, such as the definition of a project and the project lifecycle.

This needs to be cleaned up.  It seems that all of the functions in this section (save 'caller') are listed elsewhere in the page.

At the bottom, it states that uc and lc reverse each other. This sets off alarm bells- is lc(uc(&quot;QWERTY&quot;)) actually &quot;qwerty&quot;?

'''Kuiper Belt Facts''':
*The Kuiper belt is the most recently discovered section of the Solar System.
&lt;/div&gt;

Beyond the '''orbit''' of Neptune lies the Kuiper belt. It extends outward an additional three billion kilometers away from the Sun. The belt contains different-sized lumps of icy mixtures. These lumps are called Kuiper belt objects. The biggest are called minor planets or dwarf planets. The Kuiper belt may have formed when the gravity of the young planet Jupiter hurled the objects out to where they are now. The Kuiper belt is named after Gerard Kuiper (rhymes with &quot;viper&quot;), one of several astronomers who hypothesized about a field of small objects beyond Neptune.

===What are Kuiper belt objects?===
The objects in the Kuiper belt are frozen mixtures of dirt, ice and '''organic compounds'''. They are a lot like '''comets'''. Some of the objects have a reddish color and others are gray.
{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

===How big are the Kuiper belt objects?===
Scientists consider Pluto to be one of the largest Kuiper belt objects. It is 2390 km across and is a dwarf planet. The next largest known Kuiper belt objects are Orcus, 2003 EL61 and 2005 FY9. Orcus is about 1600 km (1,000 miles) across; 2003 EL61 is 70% the size of Pluto and 2005 FY9 is about 50% to 70% of Pluto's size.

Recently, scientists found another dwarf planet named Eris that is even bigger than Pluto. The scientists don't know its exact size, but they think it is about 20% larger than Pluto. At the time it was found, it was almost 100 times further away from the Sun than the Earth. It can come about as close to the Sun as Pluto. Eris has a moon named Dysnomia. The orbit of Eris is tilted almost 45 degrees compared to Earth's orbit. Pluto's orbit is only tilted by 17 degrees.

Other large Kuiper belt objects about or over 1000 km across are Pluto's moon Charon, Quaoar, Varuna, Ixion, 1996 TL66, 2002 TX300, 2002 TC302, 2002 UX25 and 2002 AW197. Ceres, the largest '''asteroid''' in the asteroid belt, is about 950 km across.

There are many other Kuiper belt objects that are only a few kilometers or tens of kilometers across.

===How many Kuiper belt objects are there?===
Over a thousand Kuiper belt objects had been found by astronomers. Scientists think that there might be more than seventy thousand large objects in the Kuiper belt. Even though there are so many objects in the Kuiper belt, it is very light, weighing between &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; of Earth's mass.

===What is it named after?===
After the first object in the belt other than Pluto and its moon Charon was spotted from the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii in 1992, the belt was named after the astronomer Gerard Kuiper. Back in 1951 this scientist wrote that he thought this belt might exist, but there was no proof at that time. Other astronomers, including Frederick Leonard, Kenneth Edgeworth, and Julio Fernandez, also thought that the belt existed. For this reason some astronomers call it the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt.

===What are the Kuiper belt objects named after?===
When an object is discovered in space, it is given a temporary name called a &quot;provisional designation&quot;.  This temporary name begins with the year the object was discovered, followed by some letters and numbers that tell in what month and in what order it was discovered. Later on, important objects are given formal names, often taken from mythology.

The Kuiper belt objects Orcus, Charon, and Varuna were all named after mythological gods of the underworld. Ixion was named after a mythological person in the underworld. Quaoar was named after a creation god of the Native American Tongva people.

== Configuring mailing lists ==

Majordomo is a mailing list management program. Its goal is to handle all incoming mails to a particular email address, and re-distribute them to a list of email addresses. Majordomo also handles adding and deleting an email address from its lists.

Since Majordomo is responsible for managing E-mail lists, Majordomo relies heavily on a MTA such as Sendmail, Smail, Qmail or Postfix.

aliases file (usually /etc/aliases) is used for making aliases for E-mail addresses. For example, once Majordomo is installed, usually an entry in the aliases file reads:

 majordomo-owner: jarchie

This entry means that all mail addressed to majordomo-owner@host.com will actually be sent to jarchie@host.com. Notice it is unnecessary to append the @host.com to jarchie because both users are on the same host. If it were desired to redirect the message to a different user on a different host, one would have to add the @host.com portion. 

Another type of entry in the aliases file allows E-mail to be redirected to multiple addresses listed in a file:

testlist:  :include:/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/testlist

This entry states that any message sent to testlist@host.com will be redirected to all the addresses listed in the file /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/testlist. The testlist file might look something like this:

 johnarchie@emeraldis.com
 srobirds@yahoo.com
 acreswell@geocities.com

Majordomo is able to add or remove addresses from a list by taking advantage of this feature. When a subscribe request is processed, the user's E-mail address is appended to the testlist file; when an unsubscribe request is processed, the user's E-mail address is removed from the testlist file. One can also add or remove addresses manually simply by editing the file with a text editor such as vi.

Since Majordomo needs to be able to process commands sent to it via E-mail, Sendmail must be able to execute the Majordomo program and pass the message to it. This is done by adding another type of entry to the aliases file:

 majordomo:  &quot;|/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo&quot;

The program /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper is a wrapper (SUID and SGID majordomo or daemon depending on the configuration) that runs the Majordomo program. The quotation marks around the second part of the alias entry are used to tell Sendmail that this part of the entry is all one statement; the quotation marks would be unnecessary if there were not a space between wrapper and majordomo. The | is known as a &quot;pipe&quot;; it is used to tell Sendmail to send the E-mail to the wrapper via the standard input. (Since all the wrapper does here is to call majordomo, the E-mail is actually being sent to Majordomo.) The wrapper accepts one parameter--the parameter of the program it is supposed to execute. (Any parameters after the first will be passed to the program the wrapper is executing.) For security reasons, the wrapper only executes programs located in the Majordomo directory, /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/. This restriction prevents a programmer from using the wrapper to run programs that should not have Majordomo privileges. (i.e, wrapper /bin/vi would allow any user to edit any Majordomo configuration file.) When a message is sent to majordomo@host.com, Sendmail starts up the wrapper which, in turn, starts up majordomo, and Sendmail sends the message to the majordomo script via the standard input. Majordomo then extracts the commands out of the message and responds appropriately.

Majordomo is, of course, the piece of code that this document revolves around; it consists of a collection of Perl scripts with the sole purpose of managing mailing lists.

Majordomo must run under a specific UID and GID so when any of the scripts are run, they will run under Majordomo's UID. Thus, it is necessary to decide what UID and GID Majordomo should run under. Also, Majordomo must be a Sendmail trusted user

Check the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files to find a UID and GID that are not taken. For this example, a UID of 16 and a GID of 16 was chosen. You have to decide on the location where the Majordomo scripts will reside. If you are using a shadowed password file, add entries similar to

 majordomo:x:16:16:Majordomo List Manager:/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5:

to your /etc/passwd and add an appropriate entry to /etc/shadow.

 majordomo:*:10883:0:88888:7:::

Use the other entries in these files as a guide for exactly what should be added. These are only the values for my system. If you are not using shadowed passwords, only an entry in the /etc/passwd file is necessary.

To create a Majordomo group, add a line similar to

 majordomo:x:16:jarchie

to your /etc/group file. Appending your username to the end of the line will give you access to the Majordomo files that are group writeable.

The Makefile contains all the information needed to install Majordomo; it is usually necessary to edit lines in the Makefile that refer to system specific settings so Majordomo will be able to install cleanly on your system. Most of the default settings are correct; however, the following settings, almost invariably, need to be changed on a per system basis.

 PERL = /bin/perl
 CC = cc
 W_HOME = /usr/test/majordomo-$(VERSION)
 MAN = $(W_HOME)/man
 W_USER = 123
 W_GROUP = 45

should be changed to something more appropriate for your system. For example, in my setup, the values were changed to

 PERL = /usr/bin/perl
 CC = gcc
 W_HOME = /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5
 MAN = /usr/man
 W_USER = 16
 W_GROUP = 16

Also the majordomo.cf file must be created. An easy way to create this file is to copy the provided sample.cf file to majordomo.cf and edit it.

Again, most of the settings are correct by default, but the following lines might need to be changed for your system from :

 $whereami = &quot;example.com&quot;;
 $whoami = &quot;Majordomo\@$whereami&quot;;
 $whoami_owner = &quot;Majordomo-Owner\@$whereami&quot;;
 $homedir = &quot;/usr/test/majordomo&quot;;
 $digest_work_dir = &quot;/usr/local/mail/digest&quot;;
 $sendmail_command = &quot;/usr/lib/sendmail&quot;;

to something more appropriate such as

 $whereami = &quot;kes.emeraldis.com&quot;;
 $whoami = &quot;majordomo\@$whereami&quot;;
 $whoami_owner = &quot;majordomo-owner\@$whereami&quot;;
 $homedir = &quot;/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5&quot;;
 $digest_work_dir = &quot;/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/digest&quot;;
 $sendmail_command = &quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;;

$whoami and $whoami_owner do not need to be changed for Majordomo to work; however, I changed them because I like to avoid typing capital letters. $digest_work_dir is a temporary directory where digest files should be placed; this directory should be assigned to wherever you want digests to be stored. If you do not plan to use digested lists, do not worry about this option. $whereami, $homedir, and $sendmail_command should be changed to appropriate values for your system. Unlike the Makefile, these options can always be changed after Majordomo is installed by editing majordomo.cf in the directory where Majordomo was installed. (The configuration file is simply copied during setup.)

The next step is to compile the Majordomo wrapper. The wrapper is the only Majordomo component that needs to be compiled because everything else is a collection of perl scripts and, therefore, is not compiled.

 $ make wrapper

To install the Majordomo files, execute the commands

 # make install
 # make install-wrapper

The first command can be done as the Majordomo user (assuming majordomo can create or has access to $home_dir), but the second command needs to be done as root so the installation script can SUID root the Majordomo wrapper. (Since, majordomo was created without a login shell or password, if you want to execute the first command as majordomo, you will need to su majordomo as root in order to become majordomo.)

Sendmail aliases must be created for Majordomo so commands sent to Majordomo can be processed by majordomo, and an alias for the Majordomo owner must be created so people can E-mail you through the standard owner-majordomo address. Add the following entries to your aliases file :

 majordomo:       &quot;|/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo&quot;
 owner-majordomo: jarchie
 majordomo-owner: jarchie

Then test your configuration, as a regular user (not as majordomo or as root), run :

 $ /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper config-test

This program can detect most problems in the Majordomo installation.

To create a list, create a file with the name of the list in the Majordomo lists directory. For example, to create a list called test, create a test file as Majordomo :

 [root@kes /]# su majordomo
 [majordomo@kes /]$ touch /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/test

and add the related aliases :

 test:        :include:/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/test
 owner-test:    jarchie
 test-request:  &quot;|/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper request-answer test&quot;
 test-approval: jarchie

Now test the operation of the list by issuing a lists command to Majordomo :

 [jarchie@kes jarchie]$ echo lists | mail majordomo

It should only take a second for majordomo to reply with a message containing all the lists which are currently set up. Next, try issuing a help command.

 [jarchie@kes jarchie]$ echo help | mail majordomo

Majordomo should reply with a list of all commands that Majordomo accepts. It might be a good idea to save the message for future reference.

To see if the aliases are working properly, try subscribing and unsubscribing yourself to the list :

 [jarchie@kes jarchie]$ echo subscribe test | mail majordomo

You will receive an E-mail message containing instructions on how to confirm your subscription as well as a letter confirming that your command was successful. After sending back your confirmation, Majordomo should send back two letters--one letter stating that your subscribe request was successful and another letter welcoming you to the test list. The owner of the list will also be sent a message stating that you have subscribed to the list.

To unsubscribe from a list, send a unsubscribe command

 [jarchie@kes jarchie]$ echo unsubscribe test | mail majordomo

You should be sent back a letter stating that your command was successful.

For some lists, it may be desirable to have Majordomo process messages before they reach the list. For example, Majordomo has the resend script to automatically filter messages based on content (such as taboo words), to prevent people from sending Majordomo commands to the list, and other features. To use these options, it is necessary to use a better set of aliases such as :

 test:        &quot;|/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper resend -l test test-list&quot;
 test-list:   :include:/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists/test
 owner-test:  jarchie
 test-owner:  jarchie
 test-request:  &quot;|/usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper majordomo -l test&quot;

The last entry allows someone simply to send a message to test-request@kes.emeraldis.com with the text subscribe rather than sending a letter to majordomo@kes.emeraldis.com with the text subscribe test. Also, note that if sendmail is using smrsh, the above aliases should reference the copy of the wrapper in the safe path--usually /etc/smrsh/wrapper.

It is common for Majordomo's permissions to be set incorrectly causing Majordomo to work improperly. Fortunately, Sendmail and Majordomo typically, give decent error messages indicating a problem. For example, the lists directory must be executable by the user sendmail setuids to, typically mail or daemon. If sendmail cannot execute lists, the permissions must be loosened.

 [root@kes root]# chmod +x /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/lists

Another common problem  is caused by the lists directory being group writeable. To solve this problem, one can ether clear the group writeable bit, or use the sendmail option IncludeFileInGroupWritableDirPath 

Majordomo is intended to run on a isolated system; there are a couple of well-known security holes in the scripts that allow any local user capable of executing wrapper to execute code as the majordomo user. If Majordomo must be run on a system providing users with shell access, then it is advisable to tighten up permissions on the wrapper. This can be done by clearing the world executable bit and chgrping the wrapper to the user that needs to run the Majordomo scripts. For example, if Sendmail and MajorCool are both being used to execute the wrapper use the commands

 [root@kes root]# cp /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper /etc/smrsh/wrapper
 [root@kes root]# chmod 4750 /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper
 [root@kes root]# chown root:nobody /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper
 [root@kes root]# chmod 4750 /etc/smrsh/wrapper
 [root@kes root]# chown root:mail /etc/smrsh/wrapper

to secure the system. This will allow sendmail (while running under mail) to execute /etc/smrsh/wrapper while allowing the webserver's MajorCool (running under nobody) to execute /usr/local/majordomo-1.94.5/wrapper. This solution, however, will allow anyone with the UID or GID of mail or nobody to also obtain access to the majordomo account. To protect the nobody account, it is important not to allow normal users to make use of server side includes or cgi scripts unless those services do not run under nobody.

=== Exercises ===.

== Using Sendmail ==

=== Exercises ===

== Using Postfix ==

Postfix is written and maintained by Wietse Venema who has also written tcp_wrappers, and Satan. Postfix began its life as VMailer but Wietse has released the software under the IBM GPL and IBM's lawyers discovered that VMailer was too similar to an existing trade mark so the name had to be changed. Postfix is written as a drop in replacement for sendmail and it comes very close to hitting the mark on this. There are a few ?gotchas? which can bite you but they are not serious. Wietse actively supports Postfix through the postfix-users mailing list and there is also a developers mailing list. You can subscribe to the postfix-users mailing list this way: 

 echo subscribe postfix-users | mail majordomo@postfix.org.

You can subscribe to the developers list in this way:

 echo subscribe postfix-testers | mail majordomo@postfix.org.

One last list we should mention is the announce list. You can join the announce list in this way: echo subscribe postfix-announce | mail majordomo@postfix.org. Postfix development is on-going and these mailing lists are quite active as of this writing. Archives for the mailing lists may be found at: http://www.egroups.com/group/postfix-users/ and at: http://msgs.SecurePoint.com/postfix/. 

When a message enters the Postfix mail system, the first stop on the inside is the incoming queue. The figure below shows the main components that are involved with new mail.

The figure shows the main Postfix system components, and the main information flows between them.
Yellow ellipsoids are mail programs, Yellow boxes are mail queues or files.
Blue boxes are lookup tables.

Programs in the large box run under control by the Postfix resident master daemon.
Data in the large box is property of the Postfix mail system. 

Mail is posted locally. The Postfix sendmail program invokes the privileged postdrop program which deposits the message into the maildrop directory, where the message is picked up by the pickup daemon. This daemon does some sanity checks, in order to protect the rest of the Postfix system.

Mail comes in via the network. The Postfix SMTP server receives the message and does some sanity checks, in order to protect the rest of the Postfix system. The SMTP server can be configured to implement UCE controls on the basis of local or network-based black lists, DNS lookups, and other client request information.
Mail is generated internally by the Postfix system itself, in order to return undeliverable mail to the sender. The bounce or defer daemon brings the bad news.

Mail is forwarded by the local delivery agent, either via an entry in the system-wide alias database, or via an entry in a per-user .forward file. This is indicated with the unlabeled arrow.

Mail is generated internally by the Postfix system itself, in order to notify the postmaster of a problem (this path is also indicated with the unlabeled arrow). The Postfix system can be configured to notify the postmaster of SMTP protocol problems, UCE policy violations, and so on.

The cleanup daemon implements the final processing stage for new mail. It adds missing From: and other message headers, arranges for address rewriting to the standard user@fully.qualified.domain form, and optionally extracts recipient addresses from message headers. The cleanup daemon inserts the result as a single queue file into the incoming queue, and notifies the queue manager of the arrival of new mail. The cleanup daemon can be configured to transform addresses on the basis of canonical and virtual table lookups.

On request by the cleanup daemon, the trivial-rewrite daemon rewrites addresses to the standard user@fully.qualified.domain form. The initial Postfix version does not implement a rewriting language. Implementing one would take a lot of effort, and most sites do not need it. Instead, Postfix makes extensive use of table lookup.

The primary configuration file for Postfix (the working equivalent to /etc/sendmail.cf) is main.cf. The install.cf file contains the initial settings for Postfix which were set up during the RPM installation. The file master.cf is Postfix' master process configuration file. Each line in the master file describes how a mailer component program should be run. In the debugging section we will talk some more about this file. The postfix-script is a wrapper used by Postfix to execute Postfix commands safely for the Linux environment. Let's take a closer look at the install.cf file as this file contains some data which we will need when we start to configure Postfix with main.cf. 

The install.cf file is really just a list of the default settings used by the installation program built into the RPM.

Here is the main.cf file with comments by Wietse Venema and our suggested changes interspersed throughout :

   # Global Postfix configuration file. This file lists only a subset
   # of all 100+ parameters. See the sample-xxx.cf files for a full list.
   # 
   # The sample files mentioned above are located in /usr/doc/postfix-19990906_pl06/
   # The general format is lines with parameter = value pairs. Lines
   # that begin with whitespace continue the previous line. A value can
   # contain references to other $names or ${name}s.
   # LOCAL PATHNAME INFORMATION
   #
   # The queue_directory specifies the location of the Postfix queue.
   # This is also the root directory of Postfix daemons that run chrooted.
   # See the files in examples/chroot-setup for setting up Postfix chroot
   # environments on different UNIX systems.
   #
   queue_directory = /var/spool/postfix

This is the same directory that sendmail uses for the incoming mail queue.   

   # The program_directory parameter specifies the default location of
   # Postfix support programs and daemons. This setting can be overruled
   # with the command_directory and daemon_directory parameters.
   #
   program_directory = /some/where/postfix/bin

The line above must be corrected. The RPM installs the Postfix binaries into /usr/libexec/postfix by default.

   # The command_directory parameter specifies the location of all
   # postXXX commands.  The default value is $program_directory.
   #
   command_directory = /usr/sbin

The line above is correct and may be left as is.

   # The daemon_directory parameter specifies the location of all Postfix
   # daemon programs (i.e. programs listed in the master.cf file). The
   # default value is $program_directory. This directory must be owned
   # by root.
   #
   daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix

The line above is correct and may be left as is.

   # QUEUE AND PROCESS OWNERSHIP
   #
   # The mail_owner parameter specifies the owner of the Postfix queue
   # and of most Postfix daemon processes.  Specify the name of a user
   # account THAT DOES NOT SHARE A GROUP WITH OTHER ACCOUNTS AND THAT
   # OWNS NO OTHER FILES OR PROCESSES ON THE SYSTEM.  In particular,
   # don't specify nobody or daemon. PLEASE USE A DEDICATED USER.
   #
   mail_owner = postfix

The line above is correct and may be left as is.

   # The default_privs parameter specifies the default rights used by
   # the local delivery agent for delivery to external file or command.
   # These rights are used in the absence of a recipient user context.
   # DO NOT SPECIFY A PRIVILEGED USER OR THE POSTFIX OWNER.
   #
   #default_privs = nobody

The line above is correct and may be left as is but it should be uncommented (e.g. Remove the leading pound sign).

   # INTERNET HOST AND DOMAIN NAMES
   # 
   # The myhostname parameter specifies the Internet hostname of this
   # mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain name
   # from gethostname(). $myhostname is used as a default value for many
   # other configuration parameters.
   #
   #myhostname = host.domain.name

Set the value in the line above to the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for you machine. E.g. if your hostname is turkey and your domain is trot.com then your FQDN would be ?turkey.trot.com?. You will also need to uncomment this line.

   #myhostname = virtual.domain.name

The line above is redundant for most configurations and can usually be left commented.

   # The mydomain parameter specifies the local Internet domain name.
   # The default is to use $myhostname minus the first component.
   # $mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration
   # parameters.
   #
   #mydomain = domain.name

The line above should be your domain name only without the hostname prepended to the front of it. As in the example we gave above the correct value here would be trot.com. Don't forget to uncomment the line as well.

   # SENDING MAIL
   # 
   # The myorigin parameter specifies the domain that locally-posted
   # mail appears to come from. The default is to append $myhostname,
   # which is fine for small sites.  If you run a domain with multiple
   # machines, you should (1) change this to $mydomain and (2) set up
   # a domain-wide alias database that aliases each user to
   # user@that.users.mailhost.
   #
   #myorigin = $myhostname
   #myorigin = $mydomain

The instructions here are pretty good. Typically what's done here is to let this default to $mydomain. Be sure to uncomment your choice.

   # RECEIVING MAIL
   # The inet_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface
   # addresses that this mail system receives mail on.  By default,
   # the software claims all active interfaces on the machine. The
   # parameter also controls delivery of mail to user@[ip.address].
   #
   #inet_interfaces = all

Once again the instructions here are good. Just uncomment the above listed line and you should be fine. Unless you have some odd requirement the next two entries can be left commented. You shouldn't need them.

   #inet_interfaces = $myhostname
   #inet_interfaces = $myhostname, localhost
   # The mydestination parameter specifies the list of domains that this
   # machine considers itself the final destination for.
   # The default is $myhostname + localhost.$mydomain.  On a mail domain
   # gateway, you should also include $mydomain. Do not specify the
   # names of domains that this machine is backup MX host for. Specify
   # those names via the relay_domains or permit_mx_backup settings for
   # the SMTP server (see sample-smtpd.cf.
   # The local machine is always the final destination for mail addressed
   # to user@[the.net.work.address] of an interface that the mail system
   # receives mail on (see the inet_interfaces parameter).
   # Specify a list of host or domain names, /file/name or type:table
   # patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A /file/name
   # pattern is replaced by its contents; a type:table is matched when
   # a name matches a lookup key.  Continue long lines by starting the
   # next line with whitespace.
   #
   #mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain
   #mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain $mydomain

The most common practice is to select the line immediately above as your choice here. Be sure to uncomment it and put a comma between the last two entries as it appears to have been omitted.

   #mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain,
   #       mail.$mydomain, www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain
   # INTERNET VERSUS INTRANET
   # The relayhost parameter specifies the default host to send mail to
   # when no entry is matched in the optional transport(5) table. When
   # no relayhost is given, mail is routed directly to the destination.
   # 
   # On an intranet, specify the organizational domain name. If your
   # internal DNS uses no MX records, specify the name of the intranet
   # gateway host instead.
   #
   # Specify a domain, host, host:port, [address] or [address:port].
   # Use the form [destination] to turn off MX lookups. See also the
   # default_transport parameter if you're connected via UUCP.
   #
   #relayhost = $mydomain
   #relayhost = gateway.my.domain
   #relayhost = uucphost
   #relayhost = [mail.$mydomain:9999]

If you are behind some sort of a firewall or you need to masquerade the envelope (which will be covered later in this document) you would set the ?relayhost? value to the MTA for your domain. If this host is to be *the* MTA for the domain then leave all of these commented out.

   # DEFAULT TRANSPORT
   #
   # The default_transport parameter specifies the default message
   # delivery transport to use when no transport is explicitly given in
   # the optional transport(5) table.
   #
   #default_transport = smtp

In most cases the above line would be uncommented and left as is.

   #default_transport = uucp
   # ADDRESS REWRITING
   #
   # Insert text from sample-rewrite.cf if you need to do address
   # masquerading.
   #
   # Insert text from sample-canonical.cf if you need to do address
   # rewriting, or if you need username-&gt;Firstname.Lastname mapping.
   # ADDRESS REDIRECTION (VIRTUAL DOMAIN)
   #
   # Insert text from sample-virtual.cf if you need virtual domain support.
   # &quot;USER HAS MOVED&quot; BOUNCE MESSAGES
   #
   # Insert text from sample-relocated.cf if you need &quot;user has moved&quot;
   # style bounce messages. Alternatively, you can bounce recipients
   # with an SMTP server access table. See sample-smtpd.cf.
   # TRANSPORT MAP
   #
   # Insert text from sample-transport.cf if you need explicit routing.

   # ALIAS DATABASE
   #
   # The alias_maps parameter specifies the list of alias databases used
   # by the local delivery agent. The default list is system dependent.
   # On systems with NIS, the default is to search the local alias
   # database, then the NIS alias database. See aliases(5) for syntax
   # details.
   # 
   # If you change the alias database, run &quot;postalias /etc/aliases&quot; (or
   # wherever your system stores the mail alias file), or simply run
   # &quot;newaliases&quot; to build the necessary DBM or DB file.
   #
   # It will take a minute or so before changes become visible.  Use
   # &quot;postfix reload&quot; to eliminate the delay.
   #
   #alias_maps = dbm:/etc/aliases
   alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases

The alias_maps line is pointing at the /etc/aliases file which we preserved prior to removing sendmail. Best practice (recommended) usually prefers that all the Postfix config files be kept together so it might be a good idea to change this line to read:

   alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases

and also make sure that you put the aliases file in /etc/postfix. Otherwise Postfix will complain on startup and fail to run. The default db type on Red Hat Linux is hash so be sure and use it as we have here. One common error which people have is when they use dbm instead of hash. Don't fall into that trap.

   #alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, nis:mail.aliases
   #alias_maps = netinfo:/aliases
   # The alias_database parameter specifies the alias database(s) that
   # are built with &quot;newaliases&quot; or &quot;sendmail -bi&quot;.  This is a separate
   # configuration parameter, because alias_maps (see above) may specify
   # tables that are not necessarily all under control by Postfix.
   #
   #alias_database = dbm:/etc/aliases
   #alias_database = dbm:/etc/mail/aliases
   #alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases

As the instructions say if you want to use the newaliases command to handle the aliases file (recommended) you should uncomment the above line but be sure (if you made the path change we recommended in the alias_maps section) and change it to read:

   alias_database = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases

Then be sure to uncomment the line and run the newaliases command before starting Postfix.  

    #alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/opt/majordomo/aliases

If you happen to run majordomo then you should use the line above instead of just the aliases line. Be sure the path to the file majordomo is correct. The best practice convention is to put it into /etc/postfix. Most Red Hat Linux sendmail installations would have had it in /etc/mail/. We will dicuss this a bit more when we get to the listserv section of this document.

   # DELIVERED-TO
   #
   # The prepend_delivered_header controls when Postfix should prepend
   # a Delivered-To: message header.
   #
   # By default, Postfix prepends a Delivered-To: header when forwarding
   # mail and when delivering to file (mailbox) or command.  Turning off
   # the Delivered-To: header when forwarding mail is not recommended.
   #
   # prepend_delivered_header = command, file, forward
   # prepend_delivered_header = forward

The defaults will work fine so you can leave this section commented out unless you have some special need or preference.

   # ADDRESS EXTENSIONS (e.g., user+foo)
   #
   # The recipient_delimiter parameter specifies the separator between
   # user names and address extensions (user+foo). See canonical(5),
   # local(8), relocated(5) and virtual(5) for the effects this has on
   # aliases, canonical, virtual, relocated and .forward file lookups.
   # Basically, the software tries user+foo and .forward+foo before
   # trying user and .forward.
   #
   # recipient_delimiter = +

This one can be left commented out also, unless you have some special need or preference.

   # DELIVERY TO MAILBOX
   #
   # The home_mailbox parameter specifies the optional pathname of a
   # mailbox relative to a user's home directory. The default is to
   # deliver to the UNIX-style /var/spool/mail/user or /var/mail/user.
   # Specify &quot;Maildir/&quot; for qmail-style delivery (the / is required).
   #
   #home_mailbox = Mailbox
   #home_mailbox = Maildir/

On Red Hat Linux systems you should leave this alone unless you know what you're doing. If you're converting from qmail to Postfix (doubtful) then it would probably be useful.

   # The mail_spool_directory parameter specifies the directory where
   # UNIX-style mailboxes are kept. The default setting depends on the
   # system type.
   #
   # mail_spool_directory = /var/mail
   # mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail

The previous line is correct for Red Hat Linux defaults so it should be uncommented and left as is.
 
   # The mailbox_command parameter specifies the optional external
   # command to use instead of mailbox delivery. The command is run as
   # the recipient with proper HOME, SHELL and LOGNAME environment settings.
   # Exception:  delivery for root is done as $default_user.
   #
   # Other environment variables of interest: USER (recipient username),
   # EXTENSION (address extension), DOMAIN (domain part of address),
   # and LOCAL (the address localpart).
   #
   # Unlike other Postfix configuration parameters, the mailbox_command
   # parameter is not subjected to $parameter substitutions. This is to
   # make it easier to specify shell syntax (see example below).
   #
   # Avoid shell meta characters because they will force Postfix to run
   # an expensive shell process. Procmail alone is expensive enough.
   #
   #mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail

The default MDA on Red Hat Linux systems is procmail. You can use the command ?which procmail? to verify the path but unless you've changed procmail's location it is located in ?/usr/bin/procmail?. Don't forget to uncomment the line.

   #mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail -a &quot;$EXTENSION&quot;
   # The mailbox_transport specifies the optional transport in master.cf
   # to use after processing aliases and .forward files. This parameter
   # has precedence over the mailbox_command, fallback_transport and
   # luser_relay parameters.
   #
   #mailbox_transport = cyrus

On a default Red Hat Linux system you should leave the above line alone.
 
   # The fallback_transport specifies the optional transport in master.cf
   # to use for recipients that are not found in the UNIX passwd database.
   # This parameter has precedence over the luser_relay parameter.
   #
   #fallback_transport =

On a default Red Hat Linux system you should leave the above line alone.

   # The luser_relay parameter specifies an optional destination address
   # for unknown recipients.  By default, mail for unknown local recipients
   # is bounced.
   #
   # The following expansions are done on luser_relay: $user (recipient
   # username), $shell (recipient shell), $home (recipient home directory),
   # $recipient (full recipient address), $extension (recipient address
   # extension), $domain (recipient domain), $local (entire recipient
   # localpart), $recipient_delimiter. Specify ${name?value} or
   # ${name:value} to expand value only when $name does (does not) exist.
   #
   # luser_relay = $user@other.host
   # luser_relay = $local@other.host
   # luser_relay = admin+$local

It's your choice what you do here but it can be quite annoying to receive a bazillion bounces a day. Leave this alone (recommended).
 
   # JUNK MAIL CONTROLS
   # 
   # The controls listed here are only a very small subset. See the file
   # sample-smtpd.cf for an elaborate list of anti-UCE controls.
   # The header_checks parameter restricts what may appear in message
   # headers. This requires that POSIX or PCRE regular expression support
   # is built-in. Specify &quot;/^header-name: stuff you do not want/ REJECT&quot;
   # in the pattern file. Patterns are case-insensitive by default. Note:
   # specify only patterns ending in REJECT. Patterns ending in OK are
   # mostly a waste of cycles.
   #
   #header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/filename
   #header_checks = pcre:/etc/postfix/filename

The above section enables a filter which you can use to detect and ?bounce? mail which matches a certain regular expression (REGEXP). The difference between using procmail and regexp or PCRE is that these two catch the mail prior to delivery and can effectively block unwanted mail at the SMTP port. 

   # The relay_domains parameter restricts what domains (and subdomains
   # thereof) this mail system will relay mail from or to.  See the
   # smtpd_recipient_restrictions restriction in the file sample-smtpd.cf.
   #
   # By default, Postfix relays mail only from or to sites in or below
   # $mydestination, or in the optional virtual domain list.
   # 
   # Specify a list of hosts or domains, /file/name patterns or type:name
   # lookup tables, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue
   # long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A file name
   # is replaced by its contents; a type:name table is matched when a
   # (parent) domain appears as lookup key.
   #
   # NOTE: Postfix will not automatically forward mail for domains that
   # list this system as their primary or backup MX host. See the
   # permit_mx_backup restriction in the file sample-smtpd.cf.
   #
   #relay_domains = $mydestination, $virtual_maps

For anyone who knows already how MX records work this is a critical component in the Postfix configuration. Home users probably won't need this line but anyone who handles mail for mutiple domains will. 

Here's a sample of how it can be used:

    relay_domains = $mydestination, /etc/postfix/relay-domains

In this example the domains you want to relay for would be placed in the file /etc/postfix/relay-domains. One to a line like so:

   here.com 
   mail.here.com 
   there.org 
   mail.there.org 

Note: this file is *not* hashed or mapped. It is a simple text file. You can also use IP addresses instead of names.
 
   # The mynetworks parameter specifies the list of networks that are
   # local to this machine.  The list is used by the anti-UCE software
   # to distinguish local clients from strangers. See permit_mynetworks
   # and smtpd_recipient_restrictions in the file sample-smtpd.cf file.
   #
   # The default is a list of all networks attached to the machine:  a
   # complete class A network (X.0.0.0/8), a complete class B network
   # (X.X.0.0/16), and so on. If you want stricter control, specify a
   # list of network/mask patterns, where the mask specifies the number
   # of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify
   # the absolute pathname of a pattern file instead of listing the
   # patterns here.
   #
   #mynetworks = 168.100.189.0/28, 127.0.0.0/8

The line above is another critical component in the configuration of Postfix. As the instructions say it specifies the list of networks that are local to this host. For those unfamiliar with the syntax used, it's called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) or supernetting. For those familiar with the network classes (A, B, C etc.) it is a way of dividing IP addresses up without reference to class.

   #mynetworks = $config_directory/mynetworks
   # SHOW SOFTWARE VERSION OR NOT
   #
   # The smtpd_banner parameter specifies the text that follows the 220
   # status code in the SMTP greeting banner. Some people like to see
   # the mail version advertised. By default, Postfix shows no version.
   #
   # You MUST specify the $myhostname at the start of the text. When
   # the SMTP client sees its own hostname at the start of an SMTP
   # greeting banner it will report a mailer loop. That's better than
   # having a machine meltdown.
   #
   #smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name
   #smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name ($mail_version)

The above config entry is a matter of personal preference. It is not required and is up to the administrator to choose.

   # PARALLEL DELIVERY TO THE SAME DESTINATION
   #
   # How many parallel deliveries to the same user or domain? With local
   # delivery, it does not make sense to do massively parallel delivery
   # to the same user, because mailbox updates must happen sequentially,
   # and expensive pipelines in .forward files can cause disasters when
   # too many are run at the same time. With SMTP deliveries, 10
   # simultaneous connections to the same domain could be sufficient to
   # raise eyebrows.
   # 
   # Each message delivery transport has its XXX_destination_concurrency_limit
   # parameter.  The default is $default_destination_concurrency_limit.
   local_destination_concurrency_limit = 2
   default_destination_concurrency_limit = 10

As the text above says this section is really about rate limiting. It is, essentially, the gas pedal for Postfix. Unless you have some really good reason to change these the defaults should be fine. Once you've run Postfix for a while (particularly those who use it in a professional setting) you may have a better idea of how this should be set for your environment.

   # DEBUGGING CONTROL
   #
   # The debug_peer_level parameter specifies the increment in verbose
   # logging level when an SMTP client or server host name or address
   # matches a pattern in the debug_peer_list parameter.
   #
   debug_peer_level = 2

We recommend the default here unless there is some overriding reason to change this. Debugging will be covered in a later chapter of this document. For what it's worth this section has no real relevance unless the next is enabled.

   # The debug_peer_list parameter specifies an optional list of domain
   # or network patterns, /file/name patterns or type:name tables. When
   # an SMTP client or server host name or address matches a pattern,
   # increase the verbose logging level by the amount specified in the
   # debug_peer_level parameter.
   #
   # debug_peer_list = 127.0.0.1
   # debug_peer_list = some.domain

This section is used in combination with debug_peer_level so if that's not enabled then this one is moot. This is actually a very neat feature of Postfix. Think about it for a minut. If everything works fine but there is this one host which seems to have problem receiving or sending mail to or from your host then you could use this feature to increase the logging level for just that host.

   # The debugger_command specifies the external command that is executed
   # when a Postfix daemon program is run with the -D option.
   #
   # Use &quot;command .. &amp; sleep 5&quot; so that the debugger can attach before
   # the process marches on. If you use an X-based debugger, be sure to
   # set up your XAUTHORITY environment variable before starting Postfix.
   #
   debugger_command =
            PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
            xxgdb $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id &amp; sleep 5

Leave this section alone for now. We will cover debugging in some detail in a later section of this document.
That's it. We've made it through the main.cf file and we're almost ready to start it up. 

=== master.cf ===

The master daemon is a supervisory application which controls and monitors all of the other Postfix processes. The master.cf file is the master daemon's configuration file. The master.cf file is the throttle for Postfix. Here you set all of the daemon process count limits. A good example of a useful limit would be to set a limit on the number of SMTP processes which can be executed simultaneously, after all, you might not want to receive 50 messages inbound all at the same time. The key thing to understand here is that any process without an express limit defaults to a 50 process limit.

In general terms the master.cf file is fine with the defaults as they are so you can leave it alone. 

=== aliases ===

This is simply the default aliases file and it could be exactly the same one you used with sendmail (recommended) and it works the same way it always has with the newaliases command. If you use majordomo your majordomo aliases will work the same way they always have and they will work with the newaliases command as well.

Control of the postfix server is done through the init.d scripts
Don't forget to issue a postfix reload command after changing the configuration !
If you modify the aliases database (/etc/aliases), don't forget to activate the changes by issueing a newaliases command (as with sendmail)

== Managing mail trafic ==

procmail is the mail processing utility language written by Stephen van den Berg of Germany. This article provides a bit of background for the intermediate Unix user on how to use procmail.
As a &quot;little&quot; language (to use the academic term) procmail lacks many of the features and constructs of traditional, general-purpose languages. It has no &quot;while&quot; or &quot;for&quot; loops. However it &quot;knows&quot; a lot about Unix mail delivery conventions and file/directory permissions -- and in particular about file locking.
Although it is possible to write a custom mail filtering script in any programming language using the facilities installed on most Unix systems -- we'll show that procmail is the tool of choice among sysadmins and advanced Unix users.

Unix mail systems consist of MTA's (mail transport agents like sendmail, smail, qmail mmdf etc), MDA's (delivery agents like sendmail, deliver, and procmail), and MUA's (user agents like elm, pine, /bin/mail, mh, Eudora, and Pegasus).

On most Unix systems on the Internet sendmail is used as an integrated transport and delivery agent. sendmail and compatible MTA's have the ability to dispatch mail *through* a custom filter or program through either of two mechanisms: aliases and .forwards.

The aliases mechanism uses a single file (usually /etc/aliases or /usr/lib/aliases) to redirect mail. This file is owned and maintained by the system administrator. Therefore you (as a user) can't modify it.
The &quot;.forward&quot; mechanism is decentralized. Each user on a system can create a file in their home directory named .forward and consisting of an address, a filename, or a program (filter). Usually the file *must* be owned by the user or root and *must not* be &quot;writeable&quot; by other users (good versions of sendmail check these factors for security reasons).

It's also possible, with some versions of sendmail, for you to specify multiple addresses, programs, or files, separated with commas. However we'll skip the details of that.
Managing mail trafic

You could forward your mail through any arbitrary program with a .forward that consisted of a line like:

 &quot;|$HOME/bin/your.program -and some arguments&quot;

Note the quotes and the &quot;pipe&quot; character. They are required.
&quot;Your.program&quot; could be a Bourne shell script, an awk or perl script, a compiled C program or any other sort of filter you wanted to write.

However &quot;your.program&quot; would have to be written to handle a plethora of details about how sendmail would pass the messages (headers and body) to it, how you would return values to sendmail, how you'd handle file locking (in case mail came in while &quot;your.program&quot; was still processing one, etc). That's what procmail gives us.

What we have seen so far is general information that applies to all sendmail compatible MTA/MDA's.
Managing mail trafic

So, to ensure that mail is passed to procmail for processing the first step is to create the .forward file. (This is safe to do before you do any configuration of procmail itself -- assuming that the package's binaries are installed). Here's the canonical example, pasted from the procmail man pages:

 &quot;|IFS=' '&amp;&amp;exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 #YOUR_USERNAME&quot;

If you did this and nothing else your mail would basically be unaffected. procmail would just look for its default recipe file (.procmailrc) and finding none -- it would perform its default action on each messages. In other words it would append new messages into your normal spool file.

You can setup procmail system-wide as local delivery agent in sendmail/postfix. When this is done, you can skip the whole part of about using the .forward file -- or you can use it anyway. For instance in sendmail this can be done by changing sendmail.mc with the following:

 MAILER_DEFINITIONS
 dnl # MAILER(`local')dnl &lt;- comment this one out with dnl
 MAILER(`procmail')dnl
 MAILER(`smtp')dnl

In postfix this can be done according to the [http://www.postfix.org/faq.html#procmail postfix FAQ].
Basically it is just editing /etc/postfix/main.cf with the following and reloading postfix.

 /etc/postfix/mail.cf:
 mailbox_command = /path/to/procmail
 
In either event the next step to automating your mail handling is to create a .procmailrc file in your home directory. You could actually call this file anything you wanted -- but then you'd have to slip the name explicitly into the .forward file (right before the &quot;||&quot; operator). Almost everyone just uses the default.

So far all we've talked about it how everything gets routed to procmail -- which mostly involves sendmail and the Bourne shell's syntax. Almost all sendmail's are configured to use /bin/sh (the Bourne shell) to interpret alias and .forward &quot;pipes.&quot;

So, here's a very simple .procmailrc file:

 :0c:
 $HOME/mail.backup

This just appends an extra copy of all incoming mail to a file named &quot;mail.backup&quot; in your home directory.
Note that a bunch of environment variables are preset for you. It's been suggested that you should explicitly set SHELL=/bin/sh (or the closest derivative to Bourne Shell available on your system). I've never had to worry about that since the shells I use on most systems are already Bourne compatible.

However, csh and other shell users should take note that all of the procmail recipe examples that I've ever seen use Bourne syntax. 

The :0 line marks the beginning of a &quot;recipe&quot; (procedure, clause, whatever. :0 can be followed be any of a number of &quot;flags.&quot; There is a literally dizzying number of ways to combine these flags. The one flag we're using in this example is 'c' for &quot;copy.&quot;

The second colon on this line marks the end of the flags and the beginning of the name for a lockfile. Since no name is given procmail will pick one automatically.

This bit is a little complicated. Mail might arrive in bursts. If a new message arrives while your script is still busy processing the last message -- you'll have multiple sendmail processes. Each will be dealing with one message. This isn't a problem by itself. However -- if the two processes might try to write into one file at the same time they are likely to get jumbled in unpredictable ways (the result will not be a properly formatted mail folder). 

So we hint to procmail that it will need the check for and create a lockfile. In this particular case we don't care what the name of the lock file would be (since we're not going to have *other* programs writing into the backup file). So we leave the last field (after the colon) blank. procmail will then select its own lockfile name.

If we leave the : off of the recipe header line (ommitting the last field entirely) then no lockfile is used.
This is appropriate whenever we intend to only read from the files in the recipe -- or in cases where we intend to only write short, single line entries to a file in no particular order (like log file entries).
The way procmail works is:

It receives a single message from sendmail (or some sendmail compatible MTA/MDA). There may be several procmail processing running currently since new messages may be coming in faster than they are being processed.
It opens its recipe file (.procmailrc by default or specified on its command line) and parses each recipe from the first to the last until a message has been &quot;delivered&quot; (or &quot;disposed of&quot; as the case may be). 

Any recipe can be a &quot;disposition&quot; or &quot;delivery&quot; of the message. As soon as a message is &quot;delivered&quot; then procmail closes its files, removes its locks and exits.

If procmail reaches the end of it's rc file (and thus all of the INCLUDE'd files) without &quot;disposing&quot; of the message -- than the message is appended to your spool file (which looks like a normal delivery to you and all of your &quot;mail user agents&quot; like Eudora, elm, etc).

This explains why procmail is so forgiving if you have *no* .procmailrc. It simply delivers your message to the spool because it has reached the end of all its recipes (there were none).
The 'c' flag causes a recipe to work on a &quot;copy&quot; of the message -- meaning that any actions taken by that recipe are not considered to be &quot;dispositions&quot; of the message.

Without the 'c' flag this recipe would catch all incoming messages, and all your mail would end up in mail.backup. None of it would get into your spool file and none of the other recipes would be parsed.

The next line in this sample recipe is simply a filename. Like sendmail's aliases and .forward  files -- procmail recognizes three sorts of disposition to any message. You can append it to a file, forward it to some other mail address, or filter it through a program.

Actually there is one special form of &quot;delivery&quot; or &quot;disposition&quot; that procmail handles. If you provide it with a directory name (rather than a filename) it will add the message to that directory as a separate file. The name of that file will be based on several rather complicated factors that you don't have to worry about unless you use the Rand MH system, or some other relatively obscure and &quot;exotic&quot; mail agent.

A procmail recipe generally consists of three parts -- a start line (:0 with some flags) some conditions (lines starting with a '*' -- asterisk -- character) and one &quot;delivery&quot; line which can be file/directory name or a line starting with a '!' -- bang -- character or a '|' -- pipe character.

Here's another example:

 :0
 * ^From.*someone.i.dont.like@somewhere.org
 /dev/null

This is a simple one consisting of no flags, one condition and a simple file delivery. It simply throws away any mail from &quot;someone I don't like.&quot; (/dev/null under Unix is a &quot;bit bucket&quot; -- a bottomless well for tossing unwanted output DOS has a similar concept but it's not nearly as handy).

Here's a more complex one:

 :0
 * !^FROM_DAEMON
 * !^FROM_MAILER
 * !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org
 | $HOME/bin/my.script

This consists of a set of negative conditions (notice that the conditions all start with the '!' character). This means: for any mail that didn't come from a &quot;daemon&quot; (some automated process) and didn't come a &quot;mailer&quot; (some other automated process) and which doesn't contain any header line of the form: &quot;X-Loop: myadd...&quot; send it through the script in my bin directory.

I can put the script directly in the rc file (which is what most procmail users do most of the time). This script might do anything to the mail. In this case -- whatever it does had better be good because procmail way will consider any such mail to be delivered and any recipes after this will only be reached by mail from DAEMONs, MAILERs and any mail with that particular X-Loop: line in the header.

These two particular FROM_ conditions are actually &quot;special.&quot; They are preset by procmail and actually refer to a couple of rather complicated regular expressions that are tailored to match the sorts of things that are found in the headers of most mail from daemons and mailers.

The X-Loop: line is a normal procmail condition. In the RFC822 document (which defines what e-mail headers should look like on the Internet) any line started with X- is a &quot;custom&quot; header. This means that any mail program that wants to can add pretty much any X- line it wants.

A common procmail idiom is to add an X-Loop: line to the header of any message that we send out -- and to check for our own X-Loop: line before sending out anything. This is to protect against &quot;mail loops&quot; -- situations where our mail gets forwarded or &quot;bounced&quot; back to us and we endlessly respond to it.

So, here's a detailed example of how to use procmail to automatically respond to mail from a particular person. We start with the recipe header.

 :0

... then we add our one condition (that the mail appears to be from the person in question):

 * ^FROMharasser@spamhome.com

FROM is a &quot;magic&quot; value for procmail -- it checks from, resent-by, and similar header lines. You could also use ^From: -- which would only match the header line(s) that start with the string &quot;From:&quot;

The ^ (hiccup or, more technically &quot;caret&quot;)  is a &quot;regular expression anchor&quot; (a techie phrase that means &quot;it specifies *where* the pattern must be found in order to match.&quot; There is a whole book on regular expression (O'Reilly &amp; Associates). &quot;regexes&quot; permeate many Unix utilities, scripting languages, and other programs. There are slight differences in &quot;regex&quot; syntax for each application. However the man page for 'grep' or 'egrep' is an excellent place to learn more.

In this case the hiccup means that the pattern must occur at the beginning of a line (which is its usual meaning in grep, ed/sed, awk, and other contexts).

... and we add a couple of conditions to avoid looping and to avoid responding to automated systems

 * !^FROM_DAEMON
 * !^FROM_MAILER

(These are a couple more &quot;magic&quot; values. The man pages show the exact regexes that are assigned to these keywords -- if you're curious or need to tweak a special condition that is similar to one or the other of these).

... and one more to prevent some tricky loop:

 * !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org

(All of these patterns start with &quot;bangs&quot; (exclammation points) because the condition is that *no* line of the header start with any of these patterns. The 'bang' in this case (and most other regex contexts) &quot;negates&quot; or &quot;reverses&quot; the meaning of the pattern).

... now we add a &quot;disposition&quot; -- the autoresponse.

 | (formail -rk \
 -A &quot;X-Loop: yourname@youraddress.com&quot; \
 -A &quot;Precendence: junk&quot;; \
 echo &quot;Please don't send me any more mail&quot;;\
 echo &quot;This is an automated response&quot;;\
 echo &quot;I'll never see your message&quot;;\
 echo &quot;So, GO AWAY&quot; ) | $SENDMAIL -t -oi 

This is pretty complicated -- but here's how it works:
The | character tells procmail that it should launch a program and feed the message to it.
The open parenthesis is a Bourne shell construct that groups a set of commands in such a way as to combine the output from all of them into one &quot;stream.&quot;

The 'formail' command is a handy program that is included with the procmail package. It &quot;formats&quot; mail headers according to its command line switches and its input.
-rk tells 'formail' to format a &quot;reply&quot; and to &quot;keep&quot; the message body. With these switches formail expects a header and body as input.

The -A parameters tells formail to &quot;add&quot; the next parameter as a header line. The parameters provided to the -A switch must be enclosed in quotes so the shell treats the whole string (spaces and all) as single parameters.
The backslashes at the end of each line tell procmail mail to treat the next line as part of this one. So, all of the lines ending in backslashes are passed to the shell as one long line.

This &quot;trailing backslash&quot; or &quot;line continuation&quot; character is a common Unix idiom found in a number of programming languages and configuration file formats.
The semicolons tell the shell to execute another command -- they allow several commands to be issued on the same command line.

Each of the echo commands should be reasonably self-explanatory. We could have used a 'cat' command and put our text into a file if we wanted. We can also call other programs here -- like 'fortune' or 'date' and their output would be combined with the rest of this).

Now we get to the closing parenthesis. This marks the end of the block of commands that we combined. The output from all of those is fed into the next pipe -- which starts the local copy of sendmail (note that this is another variable that procmail toughtfully presets for us).

The -t switch on sendmail tell it to take the &quot;To:&quot; address from the header of it's input (where 'formail -r' put it) and the -oi switch enables the sendmail &quot;option&quot; to &quot;ignore&quot; lines that consist only of a 'dot' (don't worry about the details on that).

Most of the difficulty in understanding procmail as nothing to do with procmail itself. The intricacies of regular expressions (those wierd things on the '*' -- conditional lines) and shell quoting and command syntax, and how to format a reply header that will be acceptable to sendmail (the 'formail' and 'sendmail' stuff) are the parts that require so much explanation.

== Serving news ==

The INND daemon is one of the most used news server program
It provides Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) service.
Major newsgroups include: alt,comp,gnu,misc,news,rec,sci,soc, and talk.
Newsgroups are configured in a hierarchical fashion.
INND by default uses the NNTP port TCP 119

Configuration :

Location of configuration files is /etc/news/. A minimal leafnode setup requires that you modify the following files: 

inn.conf :

Set the following options. The defaults for the remaining options should be fine. 

 organization:   MyOrganization
 domain:         mydomain.com
 server:         news.mydomain.com
 incoming.conf :

Place your ISP's news server information in here. 

 # Peer definition
 # MyISP.com  (800) 555-1212 news@MyISP.com
 peer myisp.com {
    hostname:  news.myisp.com
 }

=== Newsfeeds ===

If you want to post articles, you need to modify newsfeeds. 
news.myisp.com:comp.*,!comp.sources.*,comp.sources.unix/!foo:Tf,Wnm:news.myisp.com
The colon is the field delimiter used above. The format of that above line is:
sitename[/exclude,exclude,...]:pattern,pattern,...[/distrib,distrib,..]:flag,flag,...:param

Options: 

;sitename : Names the site to which this feed relates. It can be called anything you want and does not have to be the domain name of the site.

;pattern : Indicates which news groups are to be sent to this site. The default is to send all groups (leave it blank if that's what you want). The above example will cause all &quot;comp&quot; groups to be received, but not any group under &quot;comp.sources&quot; except for &quot;comp.sources.unix&quot;.

;distribution : If specified, and an article has a &quot;Distribution&quot; header, it is check against this value. If the distribution specified matches the distribution header in the article, it is sent. However, if the distribution specified starts with an exclamation point, and the distribution header in the article matches, it is not sent. In the above example, any article with a distribution header containing &quot;foo&quot; will not be sent.

;flag : Specify various options about the newsfeed. The above options specify that this is a file feed type (Tf), and that only articles &quot;message-id&quot; and &quot;token&quot; (Wmn) should be written.
param - Meaning varies depending on the feed type. When the feed type is &quot;file&quot; as in the example above, it specifies the file to write an entry to when an article is received. If not an absolute path, it is relative to the &quot;pathoutgoing&quot; option in inn.conf.

readers.conf : Edit this file if you want to allow readers on other computers.
motd.news : if you allow readers, it is a good idea to put a banner in this file that relays your usage policies to your readers.

Run inncheck to correct any permissions problems and catch any configuration file errors.
Run makehistory to initialize the INN history database.
Run makedbz to rebuild the dbz database files.
Run innd and test with a news client

=== Troubleshooting ===

innd won't start
Use inncheck.
Check logs under /var/log/news.
Readers can't read :
Verify that the reader is allowed access by checking nnrp.access.
Make sure innd is running.
Check logs under /var/log/news.
telnet to port 119 and see if a banner comes up.
Posters can't post :
Confirm poster is allowed to post by checking nnrp.access.
Check logs under /var/log/news.
telnet to port 119 and see if a banner comes up with (posting allowed).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book describes the Microsoft-supplied command interpreter on Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later, which is cmd.exe.

==Introduction==
This book addresses 32-bit Windows commands applicable to modern versions of Windows based on the Windows NT environment. It does not address commands that are specific to DOS environments and to DOS-based operating systems, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me, whose Microsoft-supplied command interpreters are in fact DOS programs, not Win32 programs.

You can find out which version of cmd.exe you are running using the [[#VER|VER]] command.

This book first describes using the Windows NT command interpreter, how it receives, parses, and processes commands from users. Then it describes various commands available.

To obtain an extensive list of Windows commands and their short summaries, open the command prompt on any Windows computer, and type &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt;. To find out about a particular command, type the name of the command followed by &quot;/?&quot;.

The subject of this book is also known as &quot;batch programming&quot;, even though &quot;batch&quot; refers not only to batch files for MS DOS and Windows command interpreter. Other subject terms include &quot;batch file programming&quot;, &quot;batch file scripting&quot;, &quot;Windows batch command&quot;, &quot;Windows batch file&quot;, &quot;Windows command line&quot;, &quot;Windows command prompt&quot;, and &quot;Windows shell scripting&quot;.

==Using the Windows command interpreter==

===How a command line is interpreted===
The parsing of a command line into a sequence of commands is complex, and varies subtly from command interpreter to command interpreter. There are, however, four main components:
;Variable substitution: A command line is scanned for variable specifications, and any found are replaced with the contents of those variables.
;Quoting:Special characters can be quoted, to remove their special meanings.
;Syntax:Command lines are developed into a sequence of commands according to a syntax.
;Redirection:Redirection specifications are applied, and removed from the command line, before an individual command in a sequence is executed.
====Variable substitution====
Command lines can contain variable specifications. These comprise a &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; character followed by a name. The name is ended by a second &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; character, except in special cases such as the batch file parameters &lt;tt&gt;%1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;%2&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth.

Variable specifications are replaced with values. The value used to replace a variable specification is as follows:
* For variable specification names that match the names of environment variables, the replacement is the value of the named environment variable. For example: &lt;tt&gt;%PATH%&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced by the value of the PATH environment variable.
* For variable specifications that name batch file parameters (i.e. that are non-negative decimal numbers), the replacement is the value of the parameter taken from the arguments with which the batch file was invoked (subject to any subsequent modifications by the '''SHIFT''' command). For example: &lt;tt&gt;%2&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced by the value of the second batch file parameter.

=====Special names=====

Some variable names are not visible using [[#SET|SET]] command. Rather, they are made available for reading using the % notation. To find out about them, type &quot;help set&quot;.

Special variable names and what they expand to:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
! Name
! Replacement Value Used
|-
| %CD%
| The current directory, not ending in a slash character if it is not in the root directory of the current drive
|-
| %TIME%
| The system time in HH:MM:SS.mm format.
|-
| %DATE%
| The system date in a format specific to localization.
|-
| %RANDOM%
| A generated pseudo-random number between 0 and 32767.
|-
| %ERRORLEVEL%
| The error level returned by the last executed command, or by the last called batch script.
|-
| %CMDEXTVERSION%
| The version number of the Command Processor Extensions currently used by cmd.exe.
|-
| %CMDCMDLINE%
| The content of the command line used when the current cmd.exe was started.
|}

====Quoting and escaping====
You can prevent the special characters that control command syntax from having their special meanings as follows, except for the percent sign (%):
* You can surround a string containing a special character by quotation marks.
* You can place caret (^), an escape character, immediately before the special characters. In a command located after a pipe (|), you need to use three carets (^^^) for this to work.

The special characters that need quoting or escaping are usually &lt;, &gt;, |, &amp;, and ^. In some circumstances, ! and \ may need to be escaped. A newline can be escaped using caret as well.

When you surround the string using quotation marks, they become part of the argument passed to the command invoked. By contrast, when you use caret as an escape character, the caret does not become part of the argument passed.

The percent sign (%) is a special case. On the command line, it does not need quoting or escaping unless two of them are used to indicate a variable, such as %OS%. But in a batch file, you have to use a double percent sign (%%) to yield a single percent sign (%). Enclosing the percent sign in quotation marks or preceding it with caret does not work.

Examples
*  echo &quot;Johnson &amp; son&quot;
**  Echoes the complete string rather than splitting the command line at the &amp;amp; character. Quotes are echoed as well
* echo Johnson ^&amp; son
** As above, but using caret before the special character ampersand. No quotes are echoed.
* echo Johnson &amp; son
** Does not use an escape character and therefore, &quot;son&quot; is interpreted as a separate command, usually leading to an error message that command son is not found.
* echo A ^^ B
** Echoes A ^ B. Caret needs escaping as well or else it is interpreted as escaping a space.
* if 1 equ 1 ^&lt;br&gt;echo Equal &amp;^&lt;br&gt;echo Indeed, equal
** Echoes the two strings. The caret at the end of the line escapes the newlines, leading to the three lines being treated as if they were a single line. The space before the first caret is necessary or else 1 gets joined with the following echo to yield 1echo.
* attrib File^ 1.txt
** Does not shows attributes of file named &quot;File 1.txt&quot; since escaping of space does not work. Using quotes, as in attrib &quot;File 1.txt&quot;, works.
* echo The ratio was 47%.
** If run from a batch, the percent sign is ignored.
* echo The ratio was 47%%.
** If run from a batch, the percent sign is output once.
* set /a modulo=14%%3
** If run from a batch, sets modulo variable to 2, the remainder of dividing 14 by 3. Does not work with single %.
* for %%i in (1,2,3) do echo %%i 
** If run from a batch, outputs 1, 2 and 3.
* echo %temp%
** Outputs the content of temp variable even if run from a batch file. Use of the percent sign in a batch to access environment variables and passed arguments needs no escaping.
* echo //comment line | findstr \//
** Command [[#FINDSTR|FINDSTR]] uses backslash (\) for espacing. Unlike caret, this is internal to the command and unknown to the command shell.

====Syntax====
Command lines are developed into a sequence of commands according to a syntax. In that syntax, ''simple commands'' may be combined to form ''pipelines'', which may in turn be combined to form ''compound commands'', which finally may be turned into ''parenthesized commands''.

A simple command is just a command name, a command tail, and some redirection specifications. An example of a simple command is &lt;tt&gt;dir *.txt &amp;gt; somefile&lt;/tt&gt;.

A pipeline is several simple commands joined together with the &quot;pipe&quot; metacharacter—&quot;|&quot;, also known as the &quot;vertical bar&quot;. The standard output of the simple command preceding each vertical bar is connected to the standard input of the simple command following it, via a pipe. The command interpreter runs all of the simple commands in the pipeline in parallel. An example of a pipeline (comprising two simple commands) is &lt;tt&gt;dir *.txt | more&lt;/tt&gt;.

A compound command is a set of pipelines separated by conjunctions. The pipelines are executed sequentially, one after the other, and the conjunction controls whether the command interpreter executes the next pipeline or not. An example of a compound command (comprising two pipelines, which themselves are just simple commands) is &lt;tt&gt;move file.txt file.bak &amp;amp;&amp;amp; dir &amp;gt; file.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

The conjunctions:
* '''&amp;amp;''' - An unconditional conjunction. The next pipeline is always executed after the current one has completed executing.
* '''&amp;amp;&amp;amp;''' - A positive conditional conjunction. The next pipeline is executed if the current one completes executing with a zero exit status.
* '''||''' - A negative conditional conjunction. The next pipeline is executed if the current one completes executing with a non-zero exit status.

A parenthesized command is a compound command enclosed in parentheses (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;). From the point of view of syntax, this turns a compound command into a simple command, whose overall output can be redirected.

For example: The command line &lt;tt&gt;( pushd temp &amp; dir &amp; popd ) &amp;gt; somefile&lt;/tt&gt; causes the standard output of the entire compound command &lt;tt&gt;( pushd temp &amp; dir &amp; popd )&lt;/tt&gt; to be redirected to ''somefile''.

====Redirection====
Redirection specifications are applied, and removed from the command line, before an individual command in a sequence is executed. Redirection specifications control where the standard input, standard output, and standard error file handles for a simple command point. They override any effects to those file handles that may have resulted from pipelining. (See the preceding section on command syntax.) Redirection signs &amp;gt; and &amp;gt;&amp;gt; can be prefixed with 1 for the standard output (same as no prefix) or 2 for the standard  error.

The redirection specifications are:
;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt; filename&lt;/tt&gt;: Redirect standard input to read from the named file.
;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt; filename&lt;/tt&gt;: Redirect standard output to write to the named file, overwriting its previous contents.
;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; filename&lt;/tt&gt;: Redirect standard output to write to the named file, appending to the end of its previous contents.
;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;''h''&lt;/tt&gt;: Redirect to handle ''h'', where handle is any of 0—standard input, 1—standard output, 2—standard error, and more.
;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;amp;''h''&lt;/tt&gt;: Redirect from handle ''h''.

Examples:
* dir *.txt &gt;listing.log
** Redirects the output of the dir command to listing.log file.
* dir *.txt &gt; listing.log
** As above; the space before the file name makes no difference. However, if you type this into the command window, auto-completion with tab after typing &quot;&gt; l&quot; actually works, while it does not work with &quot;&gt;listing.log&quot;.
* dir *.txt 2&gt;NUL
** Redirects errors of the dir command to nowhere.
* dir *.txt &gt;&gt;listing.log
** Redirects the output of the dir command to listing.log file, appending to the file. Thereby, the content of the file before the redirected command was executed does not get lost.
* dir *.txt &gt;listing.log 2&gt;&amp;1
** Redirects the output of the dir command to listing.log file, along with the error messages.
* dir *.txt &gt;listing.log 2&gt;listing-errors.log
** Redirects the output of the dir command to listing.log file, and the error messages to listing-errors.log file.
* &gt;myfile.txt echo Hello
** The redirection can precede the command.
* echo Hello &amp; echo World &gt;myfile.txt
** Only the 2nd echo gets redirected.
* (echo Hello &amp; echo World) &gt;myfile.txt
** Output of both echos gets redirected.
* type con &gt;myfile.txt
** Redirects console input (con) to the file. Thus, allows multi-line user input terminated by user pressing Control + Z. See also [[#User input]].
* (for %i in (1,2,3) do @echo %i) &gt; myfile.txt
** Redirects the entire output of the loop to the file.
* for %i in (1,2,3) do @echo %i &gt; myfile.txt
** Starts redirection anew each time the body of the loop is entered, losing the output of all but the latest loop iteration.

===How a command is executed===
(...)

===Batch reloading===

The command interpreter reloads the content of a batch after each execution of a line or a bracketed group.

If you start the following batch and change &quot;echo A&quot; to &quot;echo B&quot; in the batch shortly after starting it, the output will be B.

&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
ping -n 6 127.0.0.1 &gt;nul &amp; REM wait
echo A
&lt;/pre&gt;

What is on a single line does matter; changing &quot;echo A&quot; in the following batch after running it has no impact:

&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
ping -n 6 127.0.0.1 &gt;nul &amp; echo A
&lt;/pre&gt;

Nor have after-start changes have any impact on commands bracketed with ( and ). Thus, changing &quot;echo A&quot; after starting the following batch has no impact:

&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
for /L %%i in (1,1,10) do (
  echo A
  ping -n 2 127.0.0.1 &gt;nul &amp; REM wait
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ditto for any other enclosing, including this one:
&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
(
ping -n 6 127.0.0.1 &gt;nul &amp; REM wait
echo A
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Environment variables===
The environment variables of the command interpreter process are inherited by the processes of any (external) commands that it executes. A few environment variables are used by the command interpreter itself. Changing them changes its operation.

Environment variables are affected by the [[#SET|SET]], [[#PATH|PATH]], and [[#PROMPT|PROMPT]] commands.

To unset a variable, set it to empty string, such as &quot;set myvar=&quot;.

The command interpreter inherits its initial set of environment variables from the process that created it. In the case of command interpreters invoked from desktop shortcuts this will be Windows Explorer, for example.

Command interpreters generally have textual user interfaces, not graphical ones, and so do not recognize the Windows message that informs applications that the environment variable template in the Registry has been changed. Changing the environment variables in Control Panel will cause Windows Explorer to update its own environment variables from the template in the Registry, and thus change the environment variables that any ''subsequently invoked'' command interpreters will inherit. However, it will not cause command interpreters that ''are already running'' to update their environment variables from the template in the Registry.

====COMSPEC====

The COMSPEC environment variable contains the full pathname of the command interpreter program file. This is just inherited from the parent process, and is thus indirectly derived from the setting of COMSPEC in the environment variable template in the Registry.

====PATH====

The value of the PATH environment variable comprises a list of directory names, separated by semi-colon characters. This is the list of directories that are searched, in order, when locating the program file of an external command to execute.

====PATHEXT====
The value of the PATHEXT environment variable comprises a list of filename extensions, separated by semi-colon characters. This is the list of filename extensions that are applied, in order, when locating the program file of an external command to execute.

An example content of PATHEXT printed by &quot;echo %PATHEXT%&quot;:
* .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC

By adding &quot;.PL&quot; to the variable, you can ensure Perl programs get run from the command line even when typed without the &quot;.pl&quot; extension. Thus, instead of typing &quot;mydiff.pl a.txt b.txt&quot;, you can type &quot;mydiff a.txt b.txt&quot;.

Adding &quot;.PL&quot; to the variable in Windows Vista and later:
* setx PATHEXT %PATHEXT%;.PL
** If you use &quot;set&quot; available in Windows XP, the effect will be temporary and impacting only the current console or process.

====PROMPT====
The PROMPT environment variable controls the text emitted when the command interpreter displays the prompt. The command interpreter displays the prompt when prompting for a new command line in interactive mode, or when echoing a batch file line in batch file mode.

Various special character sequences in the value of the PROMPT environment variable cause various special effects when the prompt is displayed, as in the following table:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
! Characters
! Expansion Result
|-
| $$
| $ character itself
|-
| $A
| &amp;amp; symbol AKA ampersand. A convenience, since it is difficult to place a literal &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the value of the PROMPT environment variable using the SET command.
|-
| $B
| Vertical bar &lt;nowiki&gt;'|'&lt;/nowiki&gt; (pipe symbol)
|-
| $C
| Left parenthesis '('
|-
| $D
| Current date
|-
| $E
| ESC (ASCII code 27)
|-
| $F
| Right parenthesis ')'
|-
| $G
| Greater-than symbol '&gt;'
|-
| $H
| Backspace (deletes previous character)
|-
| $L
| Less-than symbol '&lt;'
|-
| $M
| Remote name linked to the current drive if it is a network drive; empty string otherwise.
|-
| $N
| Current drive letter
|-
| $P
| Current drive letter and full path
|-
| $Q
| '=' (equals sign)
|-
| $S
| ' ' (space character)
|-
| $T
| Current system time
|-
| $V
| Windows version number
|-
| $_
| &lt;CR&gt; (carriage return character, aka &quot;enter&quot;)
|-
| $+ 
| As many plus signs (+) as there are items on the [[#PUSHD|pushd]] directory stack
|}

===Switches===
Most Windows commands provide switches AKA options to direct their behavior.

Observations:
* Switches most often consist of a single-letter; some switches consist of a sequence of multiple letters.
* Switches are preceded with a slash (/) rather than, as in some other operating systems, with a minus sign (-).
* Switches are case-insensitive rather than, as in some other operating systems, case-sensitive.
* If a command from another operating system is ported to Windows (such as grep), it usually retains the option conventions from the original operating system, including the use of minus sign and case-sensitivity.

Examples:
* dir /?
** Displays the help. This option is provided by many commands.
* dir /b /s
** Lists all files and folders in the current folder recursively. Two switches are used: b and s.
* dir /bs
** Does not work; switches cannot be accumulated behind a single slash.
* findstr /ric:&quot;id: *[0-9]*&quot; File.txt 
** Unlike many other commands, findstr allows the accumulation of switches behind a single slash. Indeed, r, i and c are single-letter switches.
* dir/b/s
** Works. In dir, removing whitespace between the command and the first switch or between the switches does not make a difference; thus, does the same as dir /b /s.
* tree/f/a
** Does not work, unlike tree /f /a. In tree, separation by whitespace is mandatory. Nor does find/i/v work.
* dir /od
** The switch letter o is further modified by a single letter specifying that ordering should be by date. The letter d is not a switch by itself. Similar cases include dir /ad and more /t4.
* dir /B /S
** The switches are case-insensitive, unlike in some other operating systems.
* sort /r file.txt
** Sorts the file in a reverse order.
* sort /reverse file.txt
** Sort allows the switch string to be longer than a single-letter.
* sort /reve file.txt
** Sort allows the specified switch string to be a substring of the complete long name of the switch. Thus, does the same as the above.
* sort /reva file.txt
** Does not work, since &quot;reva&quot; is not a substring of &quot;reverse&quot;.
* taskkill /im AcroRd32.exe
** Taskkill requires a multiletter switch name for /im; shortening to /i does not work.
* java -version
** Java, which originated in the environment of another operating system family, uses the minus convention for its switches AKA options.
* grep --help
** If GNU grep is installed, it requires multi-letter switches to be preceded by two dashes.

===Error level===
Commands usually set error level at the end of their execution. In Windows NT and later, it is a 32-bit signed integer; in MS DOS, it used to be an integer from 0 to 255. Keywords: return code, exit code, exit status.

The conventional meaning of the error level:
* 0 - success
* not 0 - failure
* The error levels being set are usually positive.
* If the command does not distinguish various kinds of failure, the error level on failure is usually 1.

Uses of the error level:
* It can be tested using &amp;&amp; and ||; see also [[#Syntax]].
* It can be tested using [[#IF|IF]].
* The value can be accessed from ERRORLEVEL variable.

Examples:
* dir &gt;NUL &amp;&amp; echo Success
** The part after &amp;&amp; is executed only if the error level is zero.
* color 00 || echo Failure
** The part after || is executed only if the error level is non-zero, whether positive or negative.
* color 00 || (&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;echo Failure&lt;br&gt;)
** Multiline bracketing works as well.
* echo %ERRORLEVEL%
** Displays the error level without changing it.
* if %errorlevel% equ 0 echo The error level is zero, meaning success.
* if %errorlevel% neq 0 echo The error level is non-zero, meaning failure.
* if errorlevel 1 echo The error level is &gt;= 1, meaning failure via positive error level.
** Does not cover failure via negative error level. Note the &quot;&gt;=&quot; part: this is not the same as if %errorlevel% equ 1.
* exit /b 1
** Returns a batch file, setting the error level to 1.
* cmd /c &quot;exit /b 10&quot;
** In the middle of a batch file or on the command line, sets the error level to 10.
* (cmd /c &quot;exit /b 0&quot; &amp;&amp; Echo Success) &amp; (cmd /c &quot;exit /b -1&quot; || Echo Failure)
** As above, showing the error level is indeed affected.
* (cmd /c &quot;exit /b 0&quot; &amp; cmd /c &quot;exit /b 1&quot;) || Echo Failure
** The error level of a chain created by &amp; is the error level of the last command of the chain.
* cmd /c &quot;exit /b -1&quot; &amp; if not errorlevel 1 echo Would-be success
** The &quot;if not errorlevel 1&quot; test, which might appear to test for success, passes on negative numbers: it tests on &quot;not error level &gt;= 1&quot;, which is &quot;error level &lt;= 0&quot;.
* set myerrorlevel=%errorlevel%
** Remembers the error level for later.
* set errorlevel=0
** To be avoided: overshadows the built-in errorlevel variable. Ensures that subsequent accesses via %ERRORLEVEL% return 0 rather than the actual error level.
* cmd /c &quot;exit /b 0&quot;&lt;br&gt;if 1 equ 1 ( cmd /c &quot;exit /b 1&quot; &amp; echo %errorlevel% )
** Displays 0, since %errorlevel% gets expanded before cmd /c &quot;exit /b 1&quot; gets executed.

===String processing===

Getting a substring of a variable by position and length:

Before running the following examples, ensure that %a% equals &quot;abcd&quot; by running this:
* set a=abcd

The examples:
* echo %a:~0,1%
** Result: a
* echo %a:~1,1%
** Result: b
* echo %a:~0,2%
** Result: ab
* echo %a:~1,2%
** Result: bc
* echo %a:~1%
** Result: bcd
* echo %a:~-1%
** Result: d
* echo %a:~-2%
** Result: cd
* echo %a:~0,-2%
** Result: ab
* echo %a:~0,-1%
** Result: abc
* echo %a:~1,-1%
** Result: bc

Testing substring containment:
* if not &quot;%a:bc=%&quot;==&quot;%a%&quot; echo yes
** If variable a contains &quot;bc&quot; as a substring, echo &quot;yes&quot;.
** This test is a trick that uses string replacement, discussed below.
** This test does not work if the variable contains a quotation mark.

Testing for &quot;starts with&quot;:
* if %a:~0,1%==a echo yes
** If variable a starts with &quot;a&quot;, echo &quot;yes&quot;.
* if %a:~0,2%==ab echo yes
** If variable a starts with &quot;ab&quot;, echo &quot;yes&quot;.

String replacement:
* set a=abcd &amp; echo %a:c=%
** Result: abd
* set a=abcd &amp; echo %a:c=e%
** Result: abed
* set a=abcd &amp; echo %a:*c=%
** Result: d
** The asterisk only works at the beginning of the sought pattern; it does not work at the end or in the middle.

See also the help for [[#SET|SET]] command: set /?.

Splitting a string by any of &quot; &quot;, &quot;,&quot;, and &quot;;&quot;:   [&quot;space&quot;, &quot;comma&quot; and &quot;semicolon&quot;:]
: set myvar=a b,c;d
: for %%a in (%myvar%) do echo %%a

Splitting a string by semicolon, assuming the string contains no quotation marks:
&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
set myvar=a b;c;d
set strippedvar=%myvar%
:repeat
for /f &quot;delims=;&quot; %%a in (&quot;%strippedvar%&quot;) do echo %%a
set prestrippedvar=%strippedvar%
set strippedvar=%strippedvar:*;=%
if not &quot;%prestrippedvar:;=%&quot;==&quot;%prestrippedvar%&quot; goto :repeat
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Command-line arguments===

The command-line arguments AKA command-line parameters passed to a batch script are accessible as %1, %2, ..., %9. There can be more than nine arguments; to access them, see how to loop over all of them below.

The syntax %0 does not refer to a command-line argument but rather to the name of the batch file.

Testing for whether the first command-line argument has been provided:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
if not -%1-==-- echo Argument one provided
if -%1-==-- echo Argument one not provided &amp; exit /b
&lt;/source&gt;

A robust looping over all command-line arguments using [[#SHIFT|SHIFT]] (for each command-line argument, ...):

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
:argactionstart
if -%1-==-- goto argactionend
echo %1 &amp; REM Or do any other thing with the argument
shift
goto argactionstart
:argactionend
&lt;/source&gt;

A robust looping over all command-line arguments using [[#SHIFT|SHIFT]] without modifying %1, %2, etc.:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
call :argactionstart %*
echo Arg one: %1 &amp; REM %1, %2, etc. are unmodified in this location
exit /b

:argactionstart
if -%1-==-- goto argactionend
echo %1 &amp; REM Or do any other thing with the argument
shift
goto argactionstart
:argactionend
exit /b
&lt;/source&gt;

Transferring command-line arguments to environment variables:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
REM Prevent affecting possible callers of the batch
REM Without delayed expansion, !arg%argno%! used below won't work.
set argcount=0
:argactionstart
if -%1-==-- goto argactionend
set /a argcount+=1
set arg%argcount%=%1
shift
goto argactionstart
:argactionend

set argno=0
:loopstart
set /a argno+=1
if %argno% gtr %argcount% goto loopend
echo !arg%argno%! &amp; REM Or do any other thing with the argument
goto loopstart
:loopend
&lt;/source&gt;

Looping over all command-line arguments, albeit not a robust one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
for %%i in (%*) do (
  echo %%i
)
&lt;/source&gt;
This looks elegant but is non-robust, maltreating arguments containing wildcards (*, ?). In particular, the above for command replaces arguments that contain wildcards (*, ?) with file names that match them, or drops them if no files match. Nonetheless, the above loop works as expected as long as the passed arguments do not contain wildcards.

Finding the number of command-line arguments, in a non-robust way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
set argcount=0
for %%i in (%*) do set /a argcount+=1
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, this does not work with arguments containing wildcards.

The maximum possible number of arguments is greater than 4000, as empirically determined on a Windows Vista machine. The number can differ on Windows XP and Windows 7.

In passing arguments to a batch script, characters used for argument separation are the following ones:
* space
* comma
* semicolon
* equal sign
* tab character
Thus, the following lines pass the same four arguments:
* test.bat a b c d
* test.bat a,b,c,d
* test.bat a, b, c, d
* test.bat a;b;c;d
* test.bat a=b=c=d
* test.bat a b,c;,;=d
Yes, even the line with &quot;a b,c;,;=d&quot; passes four arguments, since a sequence of separating characters is considered a single separator.

To have a space, comma or semicolon in the argument value, you can pass the value enclosed in quotation marks. However, the quotation marks become part of the argument value. To get rid of the enclosing quotation marks when referring to the argument in the script, you can use %~&lt;number&gt; described in [[#Percent tilde]].

===Wildcards===
Many commands accept file name wildcards--characters that do not stand for themselves and enable matching of a group of filenames.

Wildcards:
* * (asterisk): any sequence of characters
* ? (question mark): a single character other than a period (&quot;.&quot;) or, if part of a sequence of question marks at the end of a maximum period-free part of a file name, possibly zero number of characters; see examples for clarification

Examples:
* dir *.txt
** Matches Myfile.txt, Plan.txt and any other file with the .txt extension.
* dir *txt
** The period does not need to be included. However, this will also match files named without the period convention, such as myfiletxt.
* ren *.cxx *.cpp
** Renames all files with .cxx extension to have .cpp extension.
* dir a?b.txt
** Matches files aab.txt, abb.txt, a0b.txt, etc.
** Does not match ab.txt, since a question mark followed by a character other than a question mark or period cannot match zero characters.
** Does not match a.b.txt, since a question mark cannot match a period.
* dir ???.txt
** Matches .txt, a.txt, aa.txt, and aaa.txt, among others, since each question mark in the sequence followed by a period can match zero number of characters.
* dir a???.b???.txt???
** Matches a.b.txt, among others. While the last question mark sequence is not followed by a period, it is still a sequence at the end of a maximum period-free part of a file name.
* dir ????????.txt &amp; @REM eight question marks
** Matches the same files as *.txt, since each file also has a short file name that has no more than 8 characters before .txt.

Quirk with short file names: the wildcard matching is performed both on long file names and the usually hidden short 8 chars + period + 3 chars file names. This can lead to bad surprises.

Unlike shells of some other operating systems, the cmd.exe shell does not perform wildcard expansion (replacement of the pattern containing wildcards with the list of file names matching the pattern) on its own. It is the responsibility of each program to treat wildcards as such. This enables such things as &quot;ren *.txt *.bat&quot;, since the ren command actually sees the * wildcard rather than a list of files matching the wildcard. Thus, &quot;echo *.txt&quot; does not display files in the current folder matching the pattern but rather literally displays &quot;*.txt&quot;. Another consequence is that you can write &quot;findstr a.*txt&quot; without fearing that the &quot;a.*txt&quot; part gets replaced with the names of some files in the current folder. Furthermore, recursive &quot;findstr /s pattern *.txt&quot; is possible, while in some other operating systems, the &quot;*.txt&quot; part would get replaced with the file names found in the current folder, disregarding nested folders.

Commands accepting wildcards include [[#ATTRIB|ATTRIB]], [[#COPY|COPY]], [[#DIR|DIR]], [[#FINDSTR|FINDSTR]], [[#FOR|FOR]], [[#REN|REN]], etc.

===User input===
You can get input from the user using the following methods:
* [[#SET|SET]] /P command
* [[#CHOICE|CHOICE]] command
* Using &quot;type con &gt;myfile.txt&quot;, for which the multi-line user input is terminated by user pressing Control + Z.

===Percent tilde===
When a [[#Command-line arguments|command-line argument]] contains a file name, special syntax can be used to get various information about the file.

The following syntaxes expand to various information about the file passed as %1:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
! Syntax || Expansion Result || Example
|-
| %~1 ||%1 with no enclosing quotation marks || Not provided
|-
| %~f1 || Full path with a drive letter || C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
|-
| %~d1 || Drive letter || C:
|-
| %~p1 || Drive-less path with the trailing backslash || \Windows\System32\
|-
| %~n1 || For a file, the file name without path and extension&lt;p&gt;For a folder, the folder name || notepad
|-
| %~x1 || File name extension including the period || .exe
|-
| %~s1 || Modify of f, n and x to use short name || Not provided
|-
| %~a1 || File attributes || --a------
|-
| %~t1 || Date and time of last modification of the file || 02.11.2006 11:45
|-
| %~z1 || File size || 151040
|-
| %~pn1 || A combination of p and n || \Windows\System32\notepad
|-
| %~dpnx1 || A combination of several letters || C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
|-
| %~$PATH:1 || The full path of the first match found in the folders present in the PATH variable, or an empty string in no match.
|-
| %~n0 || %~n applied to %0:&lt;p&gt;The extensionless name of the batch || tildetest
|-
| %~nx0 || %~nx applied to %0:&lt;p&gt;The name of the batch || tildetest.bat
|-
| %~d0 || %~f applied to %0:&lt;p&gt;The drive letter of the batch || C:
|-
| %~dp0 || %~dp applied to %0:&lt;p&gt; The folder of the batch with trailing backslash || C:\Users\Joe Hoe\
|}

The same syntax applies to single-letter variables created by [[#FOR|FOR]] command, such as &quot;%%i&quot;.

To learn about this subject from the command line, type &quot;call /?&quot; or &quot;for /?&quot;.

===Functions===
Functions AKA subprograms can be emulated using [[#CALL|CALL]], labels, [[#SETLOCAL|SETLOCAL]] and [[#ENDLOCAL|ENDLOCAL]].

An example of a function that determines arithmetic power:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
@echo off
call :power 2 4
echo %result%
rem Prints 16, determined as 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
goto :eof

rem __Function power______________________
rem Arguments: %1 and %2
:power
setlocal
set counter=%2
set interim_product=%1
:power_loop
if %counter% gtr 1 (
  set /a interim_product=interim_product * %1
  set /a counter=counter - 1
  goto :power_loop
)
endlocal &amp; set result=%interim_product%
goto :eof
&lt;/source&gt;

While the goto :eof at the end of the function is not really needed, it has to be there in the general case in which there is more than one function.

The variable into which the result should be stored can be specified on the calling line as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
@echo off
call :sayhello result=world
echo %result%
exit /b

:sayhello
set %1=Hello %2
REM Set %1 to set the returning value
exit /b
&lt;/source&gt;
In the example above, exit /b is used instead of goto :eof to the same effect.

Also, remember that the equal sign is a way to separate parameters. Thus, the following items achieve the same:
* call :sayhello result=world
* call :sayhello result world
* call :sayhello result,world
* call :sayhello result;world

(See [[#Command-line_arguments|Command-line arguments]] as a reminder)

===Calculation===
Batch scripts can do simple 32-bit integer arithmetic and bitwise manipulation using [[#SET|SET]] /a command. The largest supported integer is 2147483647 = 2 ^ 31 - 1. The smallest supported integer is -2147483648 = - (2 ^ 31), assignable with the trick of set /a num=-2147483647-1. The syntax is reminiscent of the C language.

Arithmetic operators include *, /, % (modulo), +, -. In a batch, modulo has to be entered as &quot;%%&quot;.

Bitwise operators interpret the number as a sequence of 32 binary digits. These are ~ (complement), &amp; (and), | (or), ^ (xor), &lt;&lt; (left shift), &gt;&gt; (right shift).

A logical operator of negation is !: it turns zero into one and non-zero into zero.

A combination operator is ,: it allows more calculations in one set command.

Combined assignment operators are modeled on &quot;+=&quot;, which, in &quot;a+=b&quot;, means &quot;a=a+b&quot;. Thus, &quot;a-=b&quot; means &quot;a=a-b&quot;. Similarly for *=, /=, %=, &amp;=, ^=, |=, &lt;&lt;=, and &gt;&gt;=.

The precedence order of supported operators, is as follows:
# ( )
# * / % + - 
# &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
# &amp;
# ^
# |
# = *= /= %= += -= &amp;= ^= |= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;=
# ,

Literals can be entered as decimal (1234), hexadecimal (0xffff, leading 0x), and octal (0777, leading 0).

The internal bit representation of negative numbers is two's complement. This provides a connection between arithmetic operations and bit operations. For instance, -2147483648 is represented as 0x80000000, and therefore set /a num=~(-2147483647-1) yields 2147483647, which equals 0x7FFFFFFF (type set /a num=0x7FFFFFFF to check).

As some of the operators have special meaning for the command interpreter, an expression using them needs to be enclosed in quotation marks, such as this:
* set /a num=&quot;255^127&quot;
* set /a &quot;num=255^127&quot;
** Alternative placement of quotation marks.
* set /a num=255^^127
** Escape ^ using ^ instead of quotation marks.

Examples:
* set n1=40 &amp; set n2=25&lt;p&gt;set /a n3=%n1%+%n2%
** Uses the standard percent notation for variable expansion.
* set n1=40 &amp; set n2=25&lt;p&gt;set /a n3=n1+n2
** Avoids the percent notation around variable names as unneeded for /a.
* set /a num=&quot;255^127&quot;
** Encloses &quot;^&quot; in quotation marks to prevent its special meaning for the command interpreter.
* set /a n1 = (10 + 5)/5
** The spaces around = do not matter with /a. However, getting used to it lends itself to writing &quot;set var = value&quot; without /a, which sets the value of &quot;var &quot; rather than &quot;var&quot;.
* set /a n1=2+3,n2=4*7
** Performs two calculations.
* set /a n1=n2=2
** Has the same effect as n1=2,n2=2.
* set n1=40 &amp; set n2=25 &amp; set /a n3=n1+n2
** Works as expected.
* set /a n1=2,n2=3,n3=n1+n2
** Works as expected.
* set n1=40 &amp; set n2=25 &amp; set /a n3=%n1%+%n2%
** Does not work unless n1 and n2 were set previously. The variable specifications &quot;%n1%&quot; and &quot;%n2&quot;% get expanded ''before'' the first set command is executed. Dropping percent notation makes it work.
* set /a n1=2,n2=3,n3=%n1%+%n2%
** Does not work unless n1 and n2 were set previously, for the reason stated in the previous example.
* set /a n1=0xffff
** Sets n1 using hexadecimal notation.
* set /a n1=0777
** Sets n1 using octal notation.

An example calculation that prints prime numbers:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
@echo off
setlocal
set n=1
:print_primes_loop
set /a n=n+1
set cand_divisor=1
:print_primes_loop2
set /a cand_divisor=cand_divisor+1
set /a cand_divisor_squared=cand_divisor*cand_divisor
if %cand_divisor_squared% gtr %n% echo Prime %n% &amp; goto :print_primes_loop
set /a modulo=n%%cand_divisor
if %modulo% equ 0 goto :print_primes_loop &amp; REM Not a prime
goto :print_primes_loop2
&lt;/source&gt;

===Finding files===
Files can be found using [[#DIR]], [[#FOR]], [[#FINDSTR]], [[#FORFILES]], and [[#WHERE]].

Examples:
* dir /b /s *base*.doc*
** Outputs all files in the current folder and its subfolders such that the file name before the extension contains the word &quot;base&quot; and whose extension starts with &quot;doc&quot;, which includes &quot;doc&quot; and &quot;docx&quot;. The files are output with full paths, one file per line.
* dir /b /s *.txt | findstr /i pers.*doc
** Combines the result of outputting files including their complete paths with the findstr filtering command supporting limited regular expressions, yielding a versatile and powerful combination for finding files by names and the names of their directories.
* for /r %i in (*) do @if %~zi geq 1000000 echo %~zi %i
** For each file in the current folder and its subfolders that has the size greater than or equal to 1,000,000 bytes, outputs the file size in bytes and the full path of the file. For the syntax in %~zi, see [[#Percent tilde]].
* forfiles /s /d 06/10/2015 /c &quot;cmd /c echo @fdate @path&quot;
** For each file in the current folder and its subfolders modified on 10 June 2015 or later, outputs the file modification date and full file path. The date format after /d is locale specific. Thus, allows to find most recently modified files.
* (for /r %i in (*) do @echo %~ti :: %i) | findstr 2015.*::
** Searching the current folder recursively, outputs files whose last modification date is in year 2015. Places the modification date and time, followed by a double colon, before the file name. Works as long as the used version of Windows and locale displays dates in a format that contains four-digit years. The double colon is used to make sure the findstr command is matching the date and not the file name.
* for /r %i in (*) do @echo %~ti | findstr 2015 &gt;NUL &amp;&amp; echo %i
** As above, outputs files changed in 2015. Unlike the above, only outputs the files, not the modification dates.
* findstr /i /s /m cat.*mat *.txt
** Finds files by their content. Performs a full text search for regular expression cat.*mat in files with names ending in .txt, and outputs the files names. The /m switch ensures only the file names are output.
* where *.bat
** Outputs all .bat files in the current directory and in the directories that are in PATH.

===Keyboard shortcuts===
When using Windows command line from the standard console that appears after typing cmd.exe after pressing Windows + R, you can use multiple keyboard shortcuts, including function keys:
* Tab: Completes the relevant part of the typed string from file names or folder names in the current folder. The relevant part is usually the last space-free part, but use of quotation marks changes that. Generally considers both files and folders for completion, but cd command only considers folders.
* Up and down arrow keys: Enters commands from the command history, one at a time.
* Escape: Erases the current command line being typed.
* F1: Types the characters from the single previously entered command from the command history, one character at a time. Each subsequent press of F1 enters one more character.
* F2: Asks you to type a character, and enters the shortest prefix of the previous command from the command history that does not include the typed character. Thus, if the previous command was echo Hello world and you typed o, enters ech.
* F3: Enters the single previous command from the command history. Repeated pressing has no further effect.
* F4: Asks you to type a character, and erases the part of the currently typed string that starts at the current cursor location, continues to the right, and ends with the character you entered excluding that character. Thus, if you type echo Hello world, place the cursor at H using left arrow key, press F4 and then w, you get echo world.
* F5: Enters previous commands from the command history, one at a time.
* F6: Enters Control+Z character.
* F7: Opens a character-based popup window with the command history, and lets you use arrow key and enter to select a command. After you press enter in the popup, the command is immediately executed.
* F8: Given an already typed string, shows items from the command history that have that string as a prefix, one at a time.
* F9: Lets you enter the number of the command from the command history, and then executes the command.
* Alt + F7: Erases the command history.

The above are also known as command prompt keyboard shortcuts.

The availability of the above shortcuts does not seem to depend on running [[#DOSKEY|DOSKEY]].

===Perl one-liners===
Some tasks can be conveniently achieved with Perl one-liners. Perl is a scripting language originating in the environment of another operating system. Since many Windows computing environments have Perl installed, Perl one-liners are a natural and compact extension of Windows batch scripting.

Examples:
* echo &quot;abcbbc&quot;| perl -pe &quot;s/a.*?c/ac/&quot;
** Lets Perl act as sed, the utility that supports textual replacements specified using regular expressions.
* echo a b| perl -lane &quot;print $F[1]&quot;
** Lets Perl act as cut command, displaying the 2nd field or column of the line, in this case b. Use $F[2] to display 3rd field; indexing starts at zero. Native solution: [[#FOR|FOR]] /f.
* perl -ne &quot;print if /\x22hello\x22/&quot; file.txt
** Acts as grep or [[#FINDSTR|FINDSTR]], outputting the lines in file.txt that match the regular expression after if. Uses the powerful Perl regular expressions, more powerful than those of [[#FINDSTR|FINDSTR]].
* perl -ne &quot;$. &lt;= 10 and print&quot; MyFile.txt
** Lets Perl act as head -10 command, outputting the first 10 lines of the file.
* perl -e &quot;sleep 5&quot;
** Waits for 5 seconds.
* for /f %i in ('perl -MPOSIX -le &quot;print strftime '%Y-%m-%d', localtime&quot;') do @set isodate=%i
** Gets current date in the ISO format into isodate variable.
* perl -MWin32::Clipboard -e &quot;print Win32::Clipboard-&gt;Get()&quot;
** Outputs the text content of the clipboard. When stored to getclip.bat, yields a handy getclip command to complement [[#CLIP|CLIP]] command.

On the web, Perl one-liners are often posted in the command-line conventions of another operating system, including the use of apostrophe (') to surround the arguments instead of Windows quotation marks. These need to be tweaked for Windows.

===Limitations===
There is no touch command familiar from other operating systems. The touch command would modify the last-modification timestamp of a file without changing its content.

One workaround, with unclear reliability and applicability across various Windows versions, is this:
* copy /b file.txt+,,

==Built-in commands==
These commands are all built in to the command interpreter itself, and cannot be changed. Sometimes this is because they require access to internal command interpreter data structures, or modify properties of the command interpreter process itself.

Examples:
* cd
* cd C:\Program Files
* cd \Program Files
* cd Documents
* cd %USERPROFILE%
* cd /d C:\Program Files
** Changes to the directory of the C: drive even if C: is not the current drive.
* C: &amp; cd C:\Program Files.
** Changes to the directory of the C: drive even if C: is not the current drive.
* cd ..
** Changes to the parent directory. Does nothing if already in the root directory.
* cd ..\..
** Changes to the parent directory two levels up.
* C: &amp; cd C:\Windows\System32 &amp; cd ..\..\Program Files
** Uses &quot;..&quot; to navigate through the directory three up and down

No surrounding quotes are needed around paths with spaces.

===CHDIR===

A synonym of [[#CD|CD]].

===CLS===

Clears the screen.

===COLOR===
Sets the console foreground and background colors.

Examples:
* color f9
** Use white background and blue foreground.
* color
** Restore the original color setting.

Copies files. See also [[#MOVE|MOVE]].

Examples:
* copy F:\File.txt
** Copies the file into the current directory, assuming the current directory is not F:\.
* copy &quot;F:\My File.txt&quot;
** As above; quotation marks are needed to surround a file with spaces.
* copy F:\*.txt
** Copies the files located at F:\ and ending in dot txt into the current directory, assuming the current directory is not F:\.
* copy F:\*.txt .
** Does the same as the above command.
* copy File.txt
** Issues an error message, as File.txt cannot be copied over itself.
* copy File1.txt File2.txt
** Copies File1.txt to File2.txt, overwriting File2.txt if confirmed by the user or if run from a batch script.
* copy File.txt &quot;My Directory&quot;
** Copies File.txt into &quot;My Directory&quot; directory, assuming &quot;My Directory&quot; exists.
* copy Dir1 Dir2
** Copies all files directly located in directory Dir1 into Dir2, assuming Dir1 and Dir2 are directories. Does not copy files located in nested directories of Dir1.
* copy *.txt *.bak
** For each *.txt file in the current folder, makes a copy ending with &quot;bak&quot; rather than &quot;txt&quot;.

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/copy.html copy at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/copy.mspx copy at Microsoft]

===DEL===

Deletes files. ''Use with caution, especially in combination with wildcards.'' Only deletes files, not directories, for which see [[#RD|RD]]. For more, type &quot;del /?&quot;.

Examples:
* del File.txt
* del /s *.txt
** Deletes the files recursively including nested directories, but keeps the directories; mercilessly deletes all matching files without asking for confirmation.
* del /p /s *.txt
** As above, but asks for confirmation before every single file.

Links:

* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/del.mspx?mfr=true del at Microsoft]

===DIR===

Lists the contents of a directory. Offers a range of options. Type &quot;dir /?&quot; for more help.

Examples:
* dir
** Lists the files and folders in the current folder, excluding hidden files and system files; uses a different manner of listing if DIRCMD variable is non-empty and contains switches for dir.
* dir D:
* dir /b C:\Users
* dir /s
** Lists the contents of the directory and all subdirectories recursively.
* dir /s /b
** Lists the contents of the directory and all subdirectories recursively, one file per line, displaying complete path for each listed file or directory.
* dir *.txt
** Lists all files with .txt extension.
* dir /a
** Includes hidden files and system files in the listing.
* dir /ah
** Lists hidden files only.
* dir /ad
** Lists directories only. Other letters after /A include S, I, R, A and L.
* dir /ahd
** Lists hidden directories only.
* dir /a-d
** Lists files only, omitting directories.
* dir /a-d-h
** Lists non-hidden files only, omitting directories.
* dir /od
** Orders the files and folders by the date of last modification. Other letters after /O include N (by name), E (by extension), S (by size), and G (folders first)
* dir /o-s
** Orders the files by the size descending; the impact on folder order is unclear.
* dir /-c /o-s /a-d
** Lists files ordered by size descending, omitting the thousands separator via /-C, excluding folders.
* dir /s /b /od
** Lists the contents of the directory and all subdirectories recursively, ordering the files in each directory by the date of last modification. The ordering only happens per directory; the complete set of files so found is not ordered as a whole.

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/dir.html dir at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/dir.mspx dir at Microsoft]

===DATE===
Displays or sets the date. The way the date is displayed depends on country settings. Date can also be displayed using &quot;echo %DATE%&quot;.

Getting date in the iso format, like &quot;2000-01-28&quot;: That is nowhere easy, as the date format depends on country settings.
* If you can assume the format of &quot;Mon 01/28/2000&quot;, the following will do:
** set isodate=%date:~10,4%-%date:~4,2%-%date:~7,2%
* If you have [[#WMIC|WMIC]], the following is locale independent:
** for /f %i in ('wmic os get LocalDateTime') do @if %i lss a if %i gtr 0 set localdt=%i&lt;br&gt;set isodate=%localdt:~0,4%-%localdt:~4,2%-%localdt:~6,2%
** To use the above in a batch, turn %i into %%i and remove @ from before if.
* If you have Perl installed:
** for /f %i in ('perl -MPOSIX -le &quot;print strftime '%Y-%m-%d', localtime&quot;') do @set isodate=%i

===ECHO===

Displays messages, or turns command echoing on or off.

Examples:
* echo on
* @echo off
* echo Hello
* echo &quot;hello&quot;
** Displays the quotes too.
* echo %PATH%
** Displays the contents of PATH variable.
* echo Owner ^&amp; son
** Uses caret (^) to escape ampersand (&amp;), thereby enabling echoing ampersands.
* echo 1&amp;echo 2&amp;echo 3
** Displays three strings, each followed by a newline.
* echo %random%&gt;&gt;MyRandomNumbers.txt
** While it seems to output random numbers to MyRandomNumbers.txt, it actually does not do so for numbers 0-9, since these, when placed before &gt;&gt;, indicate which channel is to be redirected. See also [[#Redirection]].
* echo 2&gt;&gt;MyRandomNumbers.txt
** Instead of echoing 2, redirects standard error to the file.
* (echo 2)&gt;&gt;MyRandomNumbers.txt
** Echoes even a small number (in this case 2) and redirects the result.
* &gt;&gt;MyRandomNumbers.txt echo 2
** Another way to echo even a small number and redirect the result.

Displaying a string without a newline requires a trick:
* set &lt;NUL /p=Output of a command:
** Displays &quot;Output of a command:&quot;. The output of the next command will be displayed immediately after &quot;:&quot;.
* set &lt;NUL /p=Current time: &amp; time /t
** Displays &quot;Current time: &quot; followed by the output of &quot;time /t&quot;.
* (set &lt;NUL /p=Current time: &amp; time /t) &gt;tmp.txt
** Like before, with redirecting the output of both commands to a file.

===ELSE===
An example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
if exist file.txt (
  echo The file exists.
) else (
  echo The file does not exist.
)
&lt;/source&gt;

See also [[#IF|IF]].

===ENDLOCAL===
Ends local set of environment variables started using [[#SETLOCAL|SETLOCAL]]. Can be used to create subprograms: see [[#Functions|Functions]].

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/endlocal.html endlocal at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/endlocal.mspx endlocal at Microsoft]

===ERASE===

A synonym of [[#DEL|DEL]].

===EXIT===

Exits the DOS console or, with /b, only the currently running batch or the currently executed subroutine. If used without /b in a batch file, causes the DOS console calling the batch to close.

Examples:
* exit
* exit /b

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/exit.html exit at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/exit.mspx exit at Microsoft]

===FOR===

Iterates over a series of values, executing a command.

In the following examples, %i is to be used from the command line while %%i is to be used from a batch.

Examples:
* for %%i in (1,2,3) do echo %%i
** In a batch, echoes 1, 2, and 3. In a batch, the command must use a double percent sign.
** The remaining examples are intended to be directly pasted into a command line, so they use a single percent sign and include &quot;@&quot; to prevent repetitive display.
* for %i in (1,2,3) do @echo %i
** From a command line, echoes 1, 2, and 3.
** The for command tries to interpret the items as file names and as patterns of file names containing wildcards.
** It does not complain if the items do not match existing file names, though.
* for %i in (1,2,a*d*c*e*t) do @echo %i
** Unless you happen to have a file matching the third pattern, echoes 1 and 2, discarding the third item.
* for %i in (1 2,3;4) do @echo %i
** Echoes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Yes, a mixture of item separators is used.
* for %i in (*.txt) do @echo %i
** Echoes file names of files located in the current folder and having the .txt extension.
* for %i in (&quot;C:\Windows\system32\*.exe&quot;) do @echo %i
** Echoes file names matching the pattern.
* for /r %i in (*.txt) do @echo %i
** Echoes file names with full paths, of files having the extension .txt located anywhere in the current folder including nested folders.
* for /d %i in (*) do @echo %i
** Echoes the names of all folders in the current folder.
* for /r /d %i in (*) do @echo %i
** Echoes the names including full paths of all folders in the current folder, including nested folders.
* for /r %i in (*) do @if %~zi geq 1000000 echo %~zi %i
** For each file in the current folder and its subfolders that has the size greater than or equal to 1,000,000 bytes, outputs the file size in bytes and the full path of the file. For the syntax in %~zi, see [[#Percent tilde]].
* for /l %i in (1,1,10) do @echo %i
** Echoes the numbers from 1 to 10.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in (list.txt) do @echo %i
** For each line in a file, echoes the line.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in (list1.txt list2.txt) do @echo %i
** For each line in the files, echoes the line.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in (*.txt) do @echo %i
** Does nothing. Does not accept wildcards to match file names.
* for /f &quot;tokens=1-3 delims=:&quot; %a in (&quot;First:Second::Third&quot;) do @echo %c-%b-%a
** Parses a string into tokens delimited by &quot;:&quot;.
** The quotation marks indicate the string is not a file name.
** The second and third tokens are stored in %b and %c even though %b and %c are not expressly mentioned in the part of the command before &quot;do&quot;.
** The two consecutive colons are treated as one separator; %c is not &quot;&quot; but rather &quot;Third&quot;.
** Does some of the job of the cut command from other operating systems.
* for /f &quot;tokens=1-3* delims=:&quot; %a in (&quot;First:Second::Third:Fourth:Fifth&quot;) do @echo %c-%b-%a: %d
** As above, just that the 4th and 5th items get captured in %d as &quot;Fourth:Fifth&quot;, including the separator.
* for /f &quot;tokens=1-3* delims=:,&quot; %a in (&quot;First,Second,:Third:Fourth:Fifth&quot;) do @echo %c-%b-%a: %d
** Multiple delimiters are possible.
* for /f &quot;tokens=1-3&quot; %a in (&quot;First Second Third,item&quot;) do @echo %c-%b-%a
** The default delimiters are space and tab. Thus, they differ from the separators used to separate arguments passed to a batch.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in ('cd') do @echo %i
** For each line of the result of a command, echoes the line.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in ('dir /b /a-d-h') do @echo %~nxai
** For each non-hidden file in the current folder, displays the file attributes followed by the file name. In the string &quot;%~nxai&quot;, uses the syntax described at [[#Percent tilde]].
* for /f &quot;usebackq tokens=*&quot; %i in (`dir /b /a-d-h`) do @echo %~nxai
** As above, but using the backquote character (`) around the command to be executed.
* for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %i in ('tasklist ^| sort ^&amp; echo End') do @echo %i
** Pipes and ampersands in the command to be executed must be escaped using caret (^).
* (for %i in (1,2,3) do @echo %i) &gt; anyoldtemp.txt
** To redirect the entire result of a for loop, place the entire loop inside brackets before redirecting. Otherwise, the redirection will tie to the body of the loop, so each new iteration of the body of the loop will override the results of the previous iterations.
* for %i in (1,2,3) do @echo %i &gt; anyoldtemp.txt
** An example related to the one above. It shows the consequence of failing to put the loop inside brackets.

''Continue:'' To jump to the next iteration of the loop and thus emulate the continue statement known from many languages, you can use goto provided you put the loop body in a subroutine, as shown in the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
for %%i in (a b c) do call :for_body %%i
exit /b

:for_body
    echo 1 %1
    goto :cont
    echo 2 %1
  :cont
exit /b
&lt;/source&gt;

If you use goto directly inside the for loop, the use of goto breaks the loop bookkeeping. The following fails:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
for %%i in (a b c) do (
    echo 1 %%i
    goto :cont
    echo 2 %%i
  :cont
    echo 3 %%i
)
&lt;/source&gt;

===FTYPE===

Displays or sets the command to be executed for a file type. See also [[#ASSOC|ASSOC]].

Examples:
* ftype
** Lists all associations of commands to be executed with file types, as, for example, 'Perl=&quot;C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*'
* ftype | find &quot;Excel.Sheet&quot;
** Lists only associations whose display line contains &quot;Excel.Sheet&quot;

* [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9037346/making-python-scripts-run-on-windows-without-specifying-py-extension Making Python scripts run on Windows without specifying “.py” extension at stackoverflow]

===GOTO===

Goes to a label.

An example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
goto :mylabel
echo Hello 1
REM Hello 1 never gets printed.

:mylabel
echo Hello 2
goto :eof

echo Hello 3
REM Hello 3 never gets printed. Eof is a virtual label standing for the end of file.
&lt;/source&gt;

Goto within the body of a for loop makes cmd forget about the loop, even if the label is within the same loop body.

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/goto.html goto at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/goto.mspx goto at Microsoft]

===IF===

Conditionally executes a command. Documentation is available by entering IF /? to CMD prompt.

Available elementary tests:
* exist &lt;filename&gt;
* &lt;string&gt;==&lt;string&gt;
* &lt;expression1&gt; equ &lt;expression2&gt; -- equals
* &lt;expression1&gt; neq &lt;expression2&gt; -- not equal
* &lt;expression1&gt; lss &lt;expression2&gt; -- less than
* &lt;expression1&gt; leq &lt;expression2&gt; -- less than or equal
* &lt;expression1&gt; gtr &lt;expression2&gt; -- greater then
* &lt;expression1&gt; geq &lt;expression2&gt; -- greater than or equal
* defined &lt;variable&gt;
* errorlevel &lt;number&gt;
* cmdextversion &lt;number&gt;

To each elementary test, &quot;not&quot; can be applied.  Apparently there are no operators like AND, OR, etc. to combine elementary tests.

The /I switch makes the == and equ comparisons ignore case.

An example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
if not exist %targetpath% (
  echo Target path not found.
  exit /b
)
&lt;/source&gt;

Examples:
* if not 1 equ 0 echo Not equal
* if 1 equ 0 echo A &amp; echo B
** Does nothing; both echo commands are subject to the condition.
* if not 1 equ 0 goto :mylabel
* if not a geq b echo Not greater
* if b geq a echo Greater
* if b geq A echo Greater in a case-insensitive comparison
* if B geq a echo Greater in a case-insensitive comparison
* if 0 equ 00 echo Numerical equality
* if not 0==00 echo String inequality
* if 01 geq 1 echo Numerical comparison
* if not &quot;01&quot; geq &quot;1&quot; echo String comparison
* if 1 equ 0 (echo Equal) else echo Unequal
** Notice the brackets around the positive then-part to make it work.
* if not a==A echo Case-sensitive inequality
* if /i a==A echo Case-insensitive equality
* if /i==/i echo This does not work
* if &quot;/i&quot;==&quot;/i&quot; echo Equal, using quotation marks to prevent the literal meaning of /i

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;PROMPT MyPrompt$G

MyPrompt&gt;CD
C:\

MyPrompt&gt;PROMPT

C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The PROMPT command is used to set the prompt to &quot;MyPrompt&gt;&quot;. The CD shows that the current directory path is &quot;C:\&quot;. Using PROMPT without any parameters sets the prompt back to the directory path.

===RD===

Removes directories. See also its synonym [[#RMDIR|RMDIR]] and antonym [[#MD|MD]]. Per default, only empty directories can be removed. Also type &quot;rd /?&quot;.

Examples:
* rd Dir1
* rd Dir1 Dir2
* rd &quot;My Dir With Spaces&quot;
* rd /s Dir1
** Removes the directory Dir1 including all the files and subdirectories in it, asking for confirmation once before proceeding with the removal. To delete files recursively in nested directories with a confirmation per file, use [[#DEL|DEL]] with /s switch.
* rd /q /s Dir1
** Like above, but without asking for confirmation.

===REN===

Renames files and directories.

Examples:
* ren filewithtpyo.txt filewithtypo.txt
* ren *.cxx *.cpp

* [http://superuser.com/questions/475874/how-does-the-windows-rename-command-interpret-wildcards How does the Windows RENAME command interpret wildcards?], superuser.com

===RENAME===

This is a synonym of [[#REN|REN]] command.

===REM===

Used for remarks in batch files, preventing the content of the remark from being executed.

An example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
REM A remark that does not get executed
echo Hello REM This remark gets displayed by echo
echo Hello &amp; REM This remark gets ignored as wished
:: This sentence has been marked as a remark using double colon.
&lt;/source&gt;

REM is typically placed at the beginning of a line. If placed behind a command, it does not work, unless preceded by an ampersand, as shown in the example above.

An alternative to REM is double colon.

* [http://ss64.com/nt/rem.html rem at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/rem.mspx rem at Microsoft]

===RMDIR===

This is a synonym of [[#RD|RD]].

===SET===

Displays or sets environment variables. With /P switch, it asks the user for input, storing the result in the variable. With /A switch, it performs simple arithmetic calculations, storing the result in the variable. With string assignments, there must be no spaces before and after the equality sign; thus, &quot;set name = Peter&quot; does not work, while &quot;set name=Peter&quot; does.

Examples:
* set
** Displays a list of environment variables
* set HOME
** Displays the values of the environment variables whose names start with &quot;HOME&quot;
* set MYNUMBER=56
* set HOME=%HOME%;C:\Program Files\My Bin Folder
* set /P user_input=Enter an integer:
* set /A result = 4 * ( 6 / 3 )
** Sets the result variable with the result of a calculation. See also [[#Calculation]].

* [http://ss64.com/nt/set.html set at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/set.mspx set at Microsoft]

===SETLOCAL===
When used in a batch file, makes all further changes to environment variables local to the current batch file. When used outside of a batch file, does nothing. Can be ended using [[#ENDLOCAL|ENDLOCAL]]. Exiting a batch file automatically calls &quot;end local&quot;. Can be used to create subprograms: see [[#Functions|Functions]].

Furthermore, can be used to ''enable delayed expansion'' like this: &quot;setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion&quot;. Delayed expansion consists in the names of variables enclosed in exclamation marks being replaced with their values only after the execution reaches the location of their use rather than at an earlier point.

The following is an example of using delayed expansion in a script that prints the specified number of first lines of a file, providing some of the function of the command &quot;head&quot; known from other operating systems:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
@echo off

call :myhead 2 File.txt
exit /b

:: Function myhead
:: ===============
:: %1 - lines count, %2 - file name
:myhead
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
set counter=1
for /f &quot;tokens=*&quot; %%i in (%2) do ( 
  echo %%i
  set /a counter=!counter!+1
  if !counter! gtr %1 exit /b
)
exit /b
&lt;/source&gt;

===SHIFT===

Shifts the batch file arguments along, but does not affect %*. Thus, if %1=Hello 1, %2=Hello 2, and %3=Hello 3, then, after SHIFT, %1=Hello 2, and %2=Hello 3, but %* is &quot;Hello 1&quot; &quot;Hello 2&quot; &quot;Hello 3&quot;.

===START===

Starts a program in new window, or opens a document. Uses an unclear algorithm to determine whether the first passed argument is a window title or a program to be executed; hypothesis: it uses the presence of quotes around the first argument as a hint that it is a window title.

Examples:
* start notepad.exe &amp; echo &quot;Done.&quot;
** Starts notepad.exe, proceeding to the next command without waiting for finishing the started one. Keywords: asynchronous.
* start &quot;notepad.exe&quot;
** Launches a new console window with notepad.exe being its title, apparently an undesired outcome.
* start &quot;&quot; &quot;C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot;
** Starts Internet Explorer. The empty &quot;&quot; passed as the first argument is the window title of a console that actually does not get opened, or at least not visibly so.
* start &quot;C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot;
** Launches a new console window with &quot;C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; being its title, apparently an undesired outcome.
* start /wait notepad.exe &amp; echo &quot;Done.&quot;
** Starts notepad.exe, waiting for it to end before proceeding.
* start /low notepad.exe &amp; echo &quot;Done.&quot;
** As above, but starting the program with a low priority.
* start &quot;&quot; MyFile.xls
** Opens the document in the program assigned to open it.
* start
** Starts a new console (command-line window) in the same current folder.
* start .
** Opens the current folder in Windows Explorer.
* start ..
** Opens the parent folder in Windows Explorer.
* start &quot;&quot; &quot;mailto:&quot;
** Starts the application for writing a new email.
* start /b TODO:example-application-where-this-is-useful
** Starts the application without opening a new console window, redirecting the output to the console from which the start command was called.

==External commands==
External commands available to Windows command interpreter are separate executable program files, supplied with the operating system by Microsoft, or bundled as standard with the third-party command interpreters. By replacing the program files, the meanings and functions of these commands can be changed.

Many, but not all, external commands support the &quot;/?&quot; convention, causing them to write on-line usage information to their standard output and then to exit with a status code of 0.

===ARP===
Displays or changes items in the address resolution protocol cache, which maps IP addresses to physical addresses.

===ATTRIB===

Displays or sets file attributes. With no arguments, it displays the attributes of all files in the current directory. With no attribute modification instructions, it displays the attributes of the files and directories that match the given search wildcard specifications. Similar to [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#chmod|chmod]] of other operating systems.

Modification instructions:
* To add an attribute, attach a '+' in front of its letter.
* To remove an attribute, attach a '-' in front of its letter
* Attributes:
** A - Archived
** H - Hidden
** S - System
** R - Read-only
** ...and possibly others.

Examples:
* attrib
** Displays the attributes of all files in the current directory.
* attrib File.txt
** Displays the attributes of the file.
* attrib +r File.txt
** Adds the &quot;Read-only&quot; attribute to the file.
* attrib -a File.txt
** Removes the &quot;Archived&quot; attribute from the file.
* attrib -a +r File.txt
** Removes the &quot;Archived&quot; attribute and adds the &quot;Read-only&quot; attribute to the file.
* attrib +r *.txt
** Acts on a set of files.

===CHOICE===
Lets the user choose one of multiple options by pressing a single key, and sets the error level as per the chosen option. Absent in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, it was reintroduced in Windows Vista, and has remained in Windows 7 and 8.

Examples:
* choice /m &quot;Do you agree&quot;
** Presents the user with a yes/no question, setting the error level to 1 for yes and to 2 for no. If the user presses Control + C, the error level is 0.
* choice /c rgb /m &quot;Which color do you prefer&quot;
** Presents the user with a question, and indicates the letters for the user. Responds to user pressing r, g or b, setting the error level to 1, 2 or 3.

===DEBUG===
Allows to interactively examine file and memory contents in assembly language, hexadecimal or ASCII. Available in 32-bit Windows including Windows 7; the availability in 64-bit Windows is unclear. In modern Windows, useful as a quick hack to view hex content of a file. Keywords: hex dump, hexdump, hexadecimal dump, view hex, view hexadecimal, disassembler. 

Debug offers its own command line. Once on its command like, type &quot;?&quot; to find about debug commands.

To view hex of a file, invoke debug.exe with the file name as a parameter, and then repeatedly type &quot;d&quot; followed by enter on the debug command line.

Limitations:
* Being a DOS program, debug chokes on long file names. Use dir /x to find the 8.3 file name, and apply debug on that one.
* Debug cannot view larger files.

===DOSKEY===
Above all, creates macros known from other operating systems as aliases. Moreover, provides functions related to command history, and enhanced command-line editing. Macros are an alternative to very short batch scripts.

Macro-related examples:
* doskey da=dir /s /b
** Creates a single macro called &quot;da&quot;
* doskey np=notepad $1
** Creates a single macro that passes its first argument to notepad.
* doskey /macrofile=doskeymacros.txt
** Loads macro definitions from a file.
* doskey /macros
** Lists all defined macros with their definitions.
* doskey /macros | find &quot;da&quot;
** Lists all macro definitions that contain &quot;da&quot; as a substring; see also [[#FIND|FIND]].

Command history-related examples:
* doskey /history
** Lists the complete command history.
* doskey /history | find &quot;dir&quot;
** Lists each line of command history that contains &quot;dir&quot; as a substring
* doskey /listsize=100
** Sets the size of command history to 100.

To get help on doskey from command line, type &quot;doskey /?&quot;.

===FC===

Compares files, displaying the differences in their content in a peculiar way.

Examples:
* fc File1.txt File2.txt &gt;NUL &amp;&amp; Echo Same || echo Different or error
** Detects difference using the error level of fc. The error level of zero means the files are the same; non-zero can mean the files differ but also that one of the files does not exist.

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/fc.html fc at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fc.mspx fc at Microsoft]

===FIND===
Searches for a string in files or input, outputting matching lines. Unlike [[#FINDSTR|FINDSTR]], it cannot search folders recursively, cannot search for a regular expression, requires quotation marks around the sought string, and treats space literally rather than as a logical or.

Examples:
* find &quot;(object&quot; *.txt
* dir /S /B | find &quot;receipt&quot;
* dir /S /B | find /I /V &quot;receipt&quot;
** Prints all non-matching lines in the output of the dir command, ignoring letter case.
* find /C &quot;inlined&quot; *.h
** Instead of outputting the matching lines, outputs their count. If more than one file is searched, outputs one count number per file preceded with a series of dashes followed by the file name; does not output the total number of matching lines in all files.
* find /C /V &quot;&quot; &lt; file.txt
** Outputs the number of lines AKA line count in &quot;file.txt&quot;. Does the job of &quot;wc -l&quot; of other operating systems. Works by treating &quot;&quot; as a string not found on the lines. The use of redirection prevents the file name from being output before the number of lines.
* type file.txt | find /C /V &quot;&quot;
** Like the above, with a different syntax.
* type *.txt 2&gt;NUL | find /C /V &quot;&quot;
** Outputs the sum of line counts of the files ending in &quot;.txt&quot; in the current folder. The &quot;2&gt;NUL&quot; is a redirection of standard error that removes the names of files followed by empty lines from the output.
* find &quot;Schönheit&quot; *.txt
** If run from a batch file saved in unicode UTF-8 encoding, searches for the search term &quot;Schönheit&quot; in UTF-8 encoded *.txt files. For this to work, the batch file must not contain the byte order mark written by Notepad when saving in UTF-8. Notepad++ is an example of a program that lets you write UTF-8 encoded plain text files without byte order mark. While this works with find command, it does not work with [[#FINDSTR]].
* find &quot;Copyright&quot; C:\Windows\system32\a*.exe
** Works with binary files no less than text files.

Links:
* [http://ss64.com/nt/find.html find at ss64.com]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/find.mspx find at Microsoft]

===FINDSTR===
Searches for regular expressions or text strings in files. Does some of the job of &quot;grep&quot; command known from other operating systems, but is much more limited in the regular expressions it supports.

Treats space in a regular expression as a disjunction AKA logical or unless prevented with /c option.

Examples:
* findstr /s &quot;[0-9][0-9].*[0-9][0-9]&quot; *.h *.cpp
** Searches recursively all files whose name ends with dot h or dot cpp, printing only lines that contain two consecutive decimal digits followed by anything followed by two consecutive decimal digits.
* findstr &quot;a.*b a.*c&quot; File.txt
** Outputs all lines in File.txt that match any of the ''two'' regular expressions separated by the space. Thus, the effect is one of ''logical or'' on regular expressions.
* echo world | findstr &quot;hello wo.ld&quot;
** Does not match. Since the 1st item before the space does not look like a regex, findstr treats the whole search term as a plain search term.
* echo world | findstr /r &quot;hello wo.ld&quot;
** Matches. The use of /r forces regex treatment.
* findstr /r /c:&quot;ID: *[0-9]*&quot; File.txt
** Outputs all lines in File.txt that match the single regular expression containing a space. The use of /c prevents the space from being treated as a logical or. The use of /r switches the regular expression treatment on, which was disabled by default by the use of /c. To test this, try the following:
***echo ID: 12|findstr /r /c:&quot;ID: *[0-9]*$&quot;
**** Matches.
***echo ID: 12|findstr /c:&quot;ID: *[0-9]*$&quot;
**** Does not match, as the search string is not interpreted as a regular expression.
***echo ID: abc|findstr &quot;ID: *[0-9]*$&quot;
**** Matches despite the output of echo failing to match the complete regular expression: the search is interpreted as one for lines matching &quot;ID:&quot; ''or'' &quot;*[0-9]*$&quot;.
* findstr /ric:&quot;id: *[0-9]*&quot; File.txt 
** Does the same as the previous example, but in a case-insensitive manner.
** While findstr enables this sort of accumulation of switches behind a single &quot;/&quot;, this is not possible with any command. For instance, &quot;dir /bs&quot; does not work, while &quot;dir /b /s&quot; does.
** To test this, try the following:
*** echo ID: 12|findstr /ric:&quot;id: *[0-9]*$&quot;
*** echo ID: ab|findstr /ric:&quot;id: *[0-9]*$&quot;
* findstr /msric:&quot;id: *[0-9]*&quot; *.txt
** Like above, but recursively for all files per /s, displaying only matching files rather than matching lines per /m.
* echo hel lo | findstr /c:&quot;hel lo&quot; /c:world
** /c switch can be used multiple times to create logical or.
* echo \hello\ | findstr &quot;\hello\&quot;
** Does not match. Backslash before quotation marks and multiple other characters acts as an escape; thus, \&quot; matches &quot;.
* echo \hello\ | findstr &quot;\\hello\\&quot;
** Matches. Double backslash passed to findstr stands for a single backslash.
* echo \hello\ | findstr \hello\
** Matches. None of the single backslashes passed to findstr is followed by a character on which the backslash acts as an escape.
* echo ^&quot;hey | findstr \^&quot;hey | more
** To search for a quote (quotation mark), you need to escape it two times: once for the shell using caret (^), and once for findstr using backslash (\).
* echo ^&quot;hey | findstr ^&quot;\^&quot;hey there^&quot; | more
** To search for a quote and have the search term enclosed in quotes as well, the enclosing quotes need to be escaped for the shell using caret (^).
* echo //comment line | findstr \//
** If forward slash (/) is the 1st character in the search term, it needs to be escaped with a backslash (\). The escaping is needed even if the search term is enclosed in quotes.
* findstr /f:FileList.txt def.*():
** Search in the files stated in FileList.txt, one file per line. File names in FileList.txt can contain spaces and do not need to be surrounded with quotation marks for this to work.
* findstr /g:SearchTermsFile.txt *.txt
** Search for the search terms found in SearchTermsFile.txt, one search term per line. A space does not serve to separate two search terms; rather, each line is a complete search term. A line is matched if at least one of the search terms matches. If the first search term looks like a regex, the search will be a regex one, but if it looks like a plain search term, the whole search will be a plain one even if 2nd or later search terms look like regex.
* findstr /xlg:File1.txt File2.txt
** Outputs set intersection: lines present in both files.
* findstr /xlvg:File2.txt File1.txt
** Outputs set difference: File1.txt - File2.txt.
* findstr /m Microsoft C:\Windows\system32\*.com
** Works with binary files no less than text files.

Limitations of the regular expressions of &quot;findstr&quot;, as compared to &quot;grep&quot;:
* No support of groups -- &quot;\(&quot;, &quot;\)&quot;.
* No support of greedy iterators -- &quot;*?&quot;.
* No support of &quot;zero or one of the previous&quot; -- &quot;?&quot;.
* And more.

Other limitations: There is a variety of limitations and strange behaviors as documented at

===FORFILES===
Finds files by their modification date and file name pattern, and executes a command for each found file. Is very limited, especially compared to the find command of other operating systems. Available since Windows Vista. For more, type &quot;forfiles /?&quot;.

Examples:
* forfiles /s /d 06/10/2015 /c &quot;cmd /c echo @fdate @path&quot;
** For each file in the current folder and its subfolders modified on 10 June 2015 or later, outputs the file modification date and full file path. The date format after /d is locale specific. Thus, allows to find most recently modified files. Keywords: most recently changed files.
* forfiles /m *.txt /s /d 06/10/2015 /c &quot;cmd /c echo @fdate @path&quot;
** As above, but only for files ending in .txt.

===MORE===
Displays the contents of a file or files, one screen at a time. When redirected to a file, performs some conversions, also depending on the used switches.

Examples:
* more Test.txt
* more *.txt
* grep -i sought.*string Source.txt | more /p &gt;Out.txt
** Taking the output of a non-Windows grep command that produces line breaks consisting solely of LF character without CR character, converts LF line breaks to CR-LF line breaks. CR-LF newlines are also known as DOS line breaks, Windows line breaks, DOS newlines, Windows newlines, and CR/LF line endings,as opposed to LF line breaks used by some other operating systems.
** In some setups, seems to output gibberish if the input contains LF line breaks and tab characters at the same time.
** In some setups, for the conversion, /p may be unneeded. Thus, &quot;more&quot; would convert the line breaks even without /p.
* more /t4 Source.txt &gt;Target.txt
** Converts tab characters to 4 spaces.
** In some setups, tab conversion takes place automatically, even without the /t switch. If so, it is per default to 8 spaces.

Switch /e:
* The online documentation for &quot;more&quot; in Windows XP and Windows Vista does not mention the switch.
* The switch /e is mentioned in &quot;more /?&quot; at least in Windows XP and Windows Vista.
* Per &quot;more /?&quot;, the switch is supposed to enable extended features listed at the end of &quot;more /?&quot; help such as showing the current row on pressing &quot;=&quot;. However, in Windows XP and Windows Vista, that seems to be enabled by default even without /e.
* Hypothesis: In Windows XP and Windows Vista, /e does not do anything; it is present for compatibility reasons.

===TASKKILL===
Ends one or more tasks.

Examples:
* taskkill /im AcroRd32.exe
** Ends all process with the name &quot;AcroRd32.exe&quot;; thus, ends all open instances of Acrobat Reader. The name can be found using [[#TASKLIST|tasklist]].
* taskkill /f /im AcroRd32.exe
** As above, but ''forced''. Succeeds in ending some processes that do not get ended without /f.
* tasklist | find &quot;notepad&quot;&lt;p&gt;taskkill /PID 5792
** Ends the process AKA task with process ID (PID) of 5792; the assumption is you have found the PID using tasklist.

===TASKLIST===
Lists tasks, including task name and process id (PID).

Examples:
* tasklist | sort
* tasklist | find &quot;AcroRd&quot;
* tasklist | find /C &quot;chrome.exe&quot;
** Displays the number of tasks named &quot;chrome.exe&quot;, belonging to Google Chrome browser.

===TIMEOUT===
Waits a specified number of seconds, displaying the number of remaining seconds as time passes, allowing the user to interrupt the waiting by pressing a key. Also known as delay or sleep. Available in Windows Vista and later.

Examples:
* timeout /t 5
** Waits for five seconds, allowing the user to cancel the waiting by pressing a key.
* timeout /t 5 /nobreak
** Waits for five seconds, ignoring user input other than Control + C.
* timeout /t 5 /nobreak &gt;nul
** As above, but with no output.

Workaround in Windows XP:
* ping -n 6 127.0.0.1 &gt;nul
** Waits for five seconds; the number after -n is the number of seconds to wait plus 1.

Perl-based workaround in Windows XP, requiring Perl installed:
* perl -e &quot;sleep 5&quot;
** Waits for 5 seconds.

Displays a tree of all subdirectories of the current directory to any level of recursion or depth. If used with /F switch, displays not only subdirectories but also files.

Examples:
* tree
* tree /f
** Includes files in the listing, in addition to directories.
* tree /f /a
** As above, but uses 7-bit ASCII characters including &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot; and \&quot; to draw the tree.

A snippet of a tree using 8-bit ASCII characters:
&lt;pre&gt;
├───winevt
│   ├───Logs
│   └───TraceFormat
├───winrm
&lt;/pre&gt;

===WHERE===

Outputs one or more locations of a file or a file name pattern, where the file or pattern does not need to state the extension if it listed in [[#PATHEXT|PATHEXT]], such as .exe. Searches in the current directory and in the PATH by default. Does some of the job of &quot;which&quot; command of some other operating systems, but is more flexible.

Available on Windows 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and later; not available on Windows XP. An alternative to be used with Windows XP is in the examples below.

Does not find internal commands, as there are no dot exe files for them to match.

Examples:
* where find
** Outputs the location of the find command, possibly &quot;C:\Windows\System32\find.exe&quot;. The .exe extension does not need to be specified as long as it is listed in [[#PATHEXT|PATHEXT]], which it is by default.
** If there are more find commands in the path, outputs paths to both. In some situations, it can output the following:&lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\System32\find.exe&lt;br&gt;C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin\find.exe
* for %i in (find.exe) do @echo %~$PATH:i
** Outputs the location of &quot;find.exe&quot; on Windows XP. The name has to include &quot;.exe&quot;, unlike with the where command.
* where /r . Tasks*
** Searches for files whose name matches &quot;Task*&quot; recursively from the current folder. Similar to &quot;dir /b /s Tasks*&quot;. The /r switch disables search in the folders in PATH.
* where *.bat
** Outputs all .bat files in the current directory and in the directories that are in PATH. Thus, outputs all .bat files that you can run without entering their full path.
* where ls*.bat
** As above, constraining also the beginning of the name of the .bat files.
* where ls*
** As above, but with no constraint on the extension. Finds lsdisks.bat, lsmice.pl, and lsmnts.py if in the current directory or in the path.
* where *.exe *.com | more
** Displays countless .exe and .com files in the path and in the current folder, including those in C:\Windows\System32.
* where $path:*.bat
** Outputs .bat files in the path but not those in the current folder unless the current folder is in PATH. Instead of path, another environment variable containing a list of directories can be used.
* where $windir:*.exe
** Outputs .exe files found in the folder stated in WINDIR environment variable.
* where $path:*.bat $windir:*.exe
** A combination is possible. Outputs all files matching either of the two queries.
* where /q *.bat &amp;&amp; echo Found
** Suppresses both standard and error output, but sets the error level, enabling testing on it. The error level is set either way, with or without /q.

===WMIC===
Starts Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC), or with arguments given, passes the arguments as commands to WMIC. Not in Windows XP Home. For more, type &quot;wmic /?&quot;.

Examples:
* wmic logicaldisk get caption,description
** Lists drives (disks) accessible under a drive letter, whether local hard drives, CD-ROM drives, removable flash drives, network drives or drives created using [[#SUBST]].

===XCOPY===
Copies files and directories in a more advanced way than [[#COPY|COPY]], deprecated in Windows Vista and later. Type xcopy /? to learn more, including countless options.

Examples:
* xcopy C:\Windows\system
** Copies all files, but not files in nested folders, from the source folder (&quot;C:\Windows\system&quot;) to the current folder.
* xcopy /s /i C:\Windows\system C:\Windows-2\system
** Copies all files and folders to any nesting depth (via &quot;/s&quot;) from the source folder (&quot;C:\Windows\system&quot;) to &quot;C:\Windows-2\system&quot;, creating &quot;Windows-2\system&quot; if it does not exist (via &quot;/i&quot;).
* xcopy /s /i /d:09-01-2014 C:\Windows\system C:\Windows-2\system
** As above, but copies only files changed on 1 September 2014 or later. Notice the use of the month-first convention even if you are on a non-US locale of Windows.
* xcopy /L /s /i /d:09-01-2014 C:\Windows\system C:\Windows-2\system
** As above, but in a test mode via /L (list-only, output-only, display-only). Thus, does not do any actual copying, merely lists what would be copied.

=== Overview ===

=== Network packet filtering ===

Network packet filtering is done in one of three ways under Linux :
* Ipfwadm : kernel 2.0.x and up (RedHat 5.x)
* Ipchains : kernel 2.2.x and up (RedHat 6.x, 7.0)
* Iptables : kernel 2.4.x and up (RedHat 7.1 – 9.0)
Their design and capabilities are quite different – note that ipfwadm is considered obsolete, iptables being the most advanced and current
In iptables, the packet flow diagram looks like :

Iptables need some options configured in your kernel (or as modules) :

;CONFIG_PACKET : This option allows applications and utilities that needs to work directly to various network devices. Examples of such utilities are tcpdump or snort. 

;CONFIG_NETFILTER : This option is required if you're going to use your computer as a firewall or gateway to the Internet.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK : This module is needed to make connection tracking. Connection tracking is used by, among other things, NAT and Masquerading. If you need to firewall machines on a LAN you most definitely should mark this option.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP : This module is required if you want to do connection tracking on FTP connections. Since FTP connections are quite hard to do connection tracking on in normal cases, conntrack needs a so called helper, this option compiles the helper. If you do not add this module you won't be able to FTP through a firewall or gateway properly.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES : This option is required if you want do any kind of filtering, masquerading or NAT. It adds the whole iptables identification framework to the kernel. Without this you won't be able to do anything at all with iptables.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LIMIT : This module isn't exactly required. This option provides the LIMIT match, that adds the possibility to control how many packets per minute that are to be matched, governed by an appropriate rule. For example, -m limit --limit 3/minute would match a maximum of 3 packets per minute. This module can also be used to avoid certain Denial of Service attacks. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC : This allows us to match packets based on MAC addresses. Every Ethernet adapter has its own MAC address. We could for instance block packets based on what MAC address is used and block a certain computer pretty well since the MAC address very seldom change. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MARK : This allows us to use a MARK match. For example, if we use the target MARK we could mark a packet and then depending on if this packet is marked further on in the table, we can match based on this mark. This option is the actual match MARK, and further down we will describe the actual target MARK. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT : This module allows us to match packets with a whole range of destination ports or source ports. Normally this wouldn't be possible, but with this match it is. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS : With this match we can match packets based on their TOS field. TOS stands for Type Of Service. TOS can also be set by certain rules in the mangle table and via the ip/tc commands. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS : This option adds the possibility for us to match TCP packets based on their MSS field.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE : This is one of the biggest news in comparison to ipchains. With this module we can do stateful matching on packets. For example, if we have already seen traffic in two directions in a TCP connection, this packet will be counted as ESTABLISHED.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_UNCLEAN : This module will add the possibility for us to match IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP packets that don't conform to type or are invalid. We could for example drop these packets, but we never know if they are legitimate or not. Note that this match is still experimental and might not work perfectly in all cases.
 
;CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER : This option will add the possibility for us to do matching based on the owner of a socket. For example, we can allow only the user root to have Internet access. This module was originally just written as an example on what could be done with the new iptables. Note that this match is still experimental and might not work for everyone. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER : This module will add the basic filter table which will enable you to do IP filtering at all. In the filter table you'll find the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains. This module is required if you plan to do any kind of filtering on packets that you receive and send. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT : This target allows us to specify that an ICMP error message should be sent in reply to incoming packets, instead of plainly dropping them dead to the floor. Keep in mind that TCP connections, as opposed to ICMP and UDP, are always reset or refused with a TCP RST packet. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MIRROR : This allows packets to be bounced back to the sender of the packet. For example, if we set up a MIRROR target on destination port HTTP on our INPUT chain and someone tries to access this port, we would bounce his packets back to him and finally he would probably see his own homepage. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT : This module allows network address translation, or NAT, in its different forms. This option gives us access to the nat table in iptables. This option is required if we want to do port forwarding, masquerading, etc. Note that this option is not required for firewalling and masquerading of a LAN, but you should have it present unless you are able to provide unique IP addresses for all hosts.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE : This module adds the MASQUERADE target. For instance if we don't know what IP we have to the Internet this would be the preferred way of getting the IP instead of using DNAT or SNAT. In other words, if we use DHCP, PPP, SLIP or some other connection that assigns us an IP, we need to use this target instead of SNAT. Masquerading gives a slightly higher load on the computer than NAT, but will work without us knowing the IP address in advance.

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT : This target is useful together with application proxies, for example. Instead of letting a packet pass right through, we remap them to go to our local box instead. In other words, we have the possibility to make a transparent proxy this way. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG : This adds the LOG target and its functionality to iptables. We can use this module to log certain packets to syslogd and hence see what is happening to the packet. This is invaluable for security audits, forensics or debugging a script you are writing. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS : This option can be used to counter Internet Service Providers and servers who block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets. This can result in web-pages not getting through, small mails getting through while larger mails don't, ssh works but scp dies after handshake, etc. We can then use the TCPMSS target to overcome this by clamping our MSS (Maximum Segment Size) to the PMTU (Path Maximum Transmit Unit). This way, we'll be able to handle what the authors of Netfilter them selves call &quot;criminally brain-dead ISPs or servers&quot; in the kernel configuration help. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS : Adds a compatibility mode with the obsolescent ipchains. Do not look to this as any real long term solution for solving migration from Linux 2.2 kernels to 2.4 kernels, since it may well be gone with kernel 2.6. 

;CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPFWADM : Compatibility mode with obsolescent ipfwadm. Definitely don't look to this as a real long term solution.

When a packet first enters the firewall, it hits the hardware and then gets passed on to the proper device driver in the kernel. Then the packet starts to go through a series of steps in the kernel, before it is either sent to the correct application (locally), or forwarded to another host - or whatever happens to it. 

First, let us have a look at a packet that is destined for our own local host. It would pass through the following steps before actually being delivered to our application that receives it: 

Note that this time the packet was passed through the INPUT chain instead of the FORWARD chain. Quite logical. Most probably the only thing that's really logical about the traversing of tables and chains in your eyes in the beginning, but if you continue to think about it, you'll find it will get clearer in time. 
Now we look at the outgoing packets from our own local host and what steps they go through.

In this example, we're assuming that the packet is destined for another host on another network. The packet goes through the different steps in the following fashion : 

As you can see, there are quite a lot of steps to pass through. The packet can be stopped at any of the iptables chains, or anywhere else if it is malformed; however, we are mainly interested in the iptables aspect of this lot. Do note that there are no specific chains or tables for different interfaces or anything like that. FORWARD is always passed by all packets that are forwarded over this firewall/router. 

Do not use the INPUT chain to filter on in the previous scenario! INPUT is meant solelyfor packets to our local host that do not get routed to any otherdestination. 

We have now seen how the different chains are traversed in three separate scenarios. If we were to figure out a good map of all this, it would look something like this: 

To clarify this image, consider this. If we get a packet into the first routing decision that is not destined for the local machine itself, it will be routed through the FORWARD chain. If the packet is, on the other hand, destined for an IP address that the local machine is listening to, we would send the packet through the INPUT chain and to the local machine. 

Also worth a note, is the fact that packets may be destined for the local machine, but the destination address may be changed within the PREROUTING chain by doing NAT. Since this takes place before the first routing decision, the packet will be looked upon after this change. Because of this, the routing may be changed before the routing decision is done. Do note, that all packets will be going through one or the other path in this image. If you DNAT a packet back to the same network that it came from, it will still travel through the rest of the chains until it is back out on the network.

=== Mangle table ===

This table should as we've already noted mainly be used for mangling packets. In other words, you may freely use the mangle matches etc that could be used to change TOS (Type Of Service) fields and so on. 

You are strongly advised not to use this table for any filtering; nor will any DNAT, SNAT or Masquerading work in this table. 

Targets that are only valid in the mangle table: 
* TOS
* TTL
* MARK

The TOS target is used to set and/or change the Type of Service field in the packet. This could be used for setting up policies on the network regarding how a packet should be routed and so on. Note that this has not been perfected and is not really implemented on the Internet and most of the routers don't care about the value in this field, and sometimes, they act faulty on what they get. Don't set this in other words for packets going to the Internet unless you want to make routing decisions on it, with iproute2. 

The TTL target is used to change the TTL (Time To Live) field of the packet. We could tell packets to only have a specific TTL and so on. One good reason for this could be that we don't want to give ourself away to nosy Internet Service Providers. Some Internet Service Providers do not like users running multiple computers on one single connection, and there are some Internet Service Providers known to look for a single host generating different TTL values, and take this as one of many signs of multiple computers connected to a single connection. 

The MARK target is used to set special mark values to the packet. These marks could then be recognized by the iproute2 programs to do different routing on the packet depending on what mark they have, or if they don't have any. We could also do bandwidth limiting and Class Based Queuing based on these marks. 

=== NAT table ===

This table should only be used for NAT (Network Address Translation) on different packets. In other words, it should only be used to translate the packet's source field or destination field. Note that, as we have said before, only the first packet in a stream will hit this chain. After this, the rest of the packets will automatically have the same action taken on them as the first packet. The actual targets that do these kind of things are: 
* DNAT
* SNAT
* MASQUERADE

The DNAT target is mainly used in cases where you have a public IP and want to redirect accesses to the firewall to some other host (on a DMZ for example). In other words, we change the destination address of the packet and reroute it to the host. 

SNAT is mainly used for changing the source address of packets. For the most part you'll hide your local networks or DMZ, etc. A very good example would be that of a firewall of which we know outside IP address, but need to substitute our local network's IP numbers with that of our firewall. With this target the firewall will automatically SNAT and De-SNAT the packets, hence making it possible to make connections from the LAN to the Internet. If your network uses 192.168.0.0/netmask for example, the packets would never get back from the Internet, because IANA has regulated these networks (among others) as private and only for use in isolated LANs.

The MASQUERADE target is used in exactly the same way as SNAT, but the MASQUERADE target takes a little bit more overhead to compute. The reason for this, is that each time that the MASQUERADE target gets hit by a packet, it automatically checks for the IP address to use, instead of doing as the SNAT target does - just using the single configured IP address. The MASQUERADE target makes it possible to work properly with Dynamic DHCP IP addresses that your ISP might provide for your PPP, PPPoE or SLIP connections to the Internet. 

=== Filter table ===

The filter table is mainly used for filtering packets. We can match packets and filter them in whatever way we want. This is the place that we actually take action against packets and look at what they contain and DROP or /ACCEPT them, depending on their content. Of course we may also do prior filtering; however, this particular table, is the place for which filtering was designed. Almost all targets are usable in this chain. We will be more prolific about the filter table here; however you now know that this table is the right place to do your main filtering. 

=== The state machine ===

The state machine is a special part within iptables that should really not be called the state machine at all, since it is really a connection tracking machine. However, most people recognize it under the first name. Throughout this chapter i will use this names more or less as if they where synonymous. This should not be overly confusing. Connection tracking is done to let the Netfilter framework know the state of a specific connection. Firewalls that implement this are generally called stateful firewalls. A stateful firewall is generally much more secure than non-stateful firewalls since it allows us to write much tighter rule-sets. 

Within iptables, packets can be related to tracked connections in four different so called states. These are known as NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED and INVALID. We will discuss each of these in more depth later. With the --state match we can easily control who or what is allowed to initiate new sessions. 

All of the connection tracking is done by special framework within the kernel called conntrack. conntrack may be loaded either as a module, or as an internal part of the kernel itself. Most of the time, we need and want more specific connection tracking than the default conntrack engine can maintain. Because of this, there are also more specific parts of conntrack that handles the TCP, UDP or ICMP protocols among others. These modules grabs specific, unique, information from the packets, so that they may keep track of each stream of data. The information that conntrack gathers is then used to tell conntrack in which state the stream is currently in. For example, UDP streams are, generally, uniquely identified by their destination IP address, source IP address, destination port and source port. In previous kernels, we had the possibility to turn on and off defragmentation. However, since iptables and Netfilter were introduced and connection tracking in particular, this option was gotten rid of. The reason for this is that connection tracking can not work properly without defragmenting packets, and hence defragmenting has been incorporated into conntrack and is carried out automatically. It can not be turned off, except by turning off connection tracking. Defragmentation is always carried out if connection tracking is turned on. 

All connection tracking is handled in the PREROUTING chain, except locally generated packets which are handled in the OUTPUT chain. What this means is that iptables will do all recalculation of states and so on within the PREROUTING chain. If we send the initial packet in a stream, the state gets set to NEW within the OUTPUT chain, and when we receive a return packet, the state gets changed in the PREROUTING chain to ESTABLISHED, and so on. If the first packet is not originated by ourself, the NEW state is set within the PREROUTING chain of course. So, all state changes and calculations are done within the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains of the nat table. 

=== The conntrack entries ===

Let's take a brief look at a conntrack entry and how to read them in /proc/net/ip_conntrack. This gives a list of all the current entries in your conntrack database. If you have the ip_conntrack module loaded, a cat of /proc/net/ip_conntrack might look like: 

 tcp      6 117 SYN_SENT src=192.168.1.6 dst=192.168.1.9 sport=32775 \
     dport=22 [UNREPLIED] src=192.168.1.9 dst=192.168.1.6 sport=22 \
     dport=32775 use=2

This example contains all the information that the conntrack module maintains to know which state a specific connection is in. First of all, we have a protocol, which in this case is tcp. Next, the same value in normal decimal coding. After this, we see how long this conntrack entry has to live. This value is set to 117 seconds right now and is decremented regularly until we see more traffic. This value is then reset to the default value for the specific state that it is in at that relevant point of time. Next comes the actual state that this entry is in at the present point of time. In the above mentioned case we are looking at a packet that is in the SYN_SENT state. The internal value of a connection is slightly different from the ones used externally with iptables. The value SYN_SENT tells us that we are looking at a connection that has only seen a TCP SYN packet in one direction. Next, we see the source IP address, destination IP address, source port and destination port. At this point we see a specific keyword that tells us that we have seen no return traffic for this connection. Lastly, we see what we expect of return packets. The information details the source IP address and destination IP address (which are both inverted, since the packet is to be directed back to us). The same thing goes for the source port and destination port of the connection. These are the values that should be of any interest to us.      

The connection tracking entries may take on a series of different values, all specified in the conntrack headers available in linux/include/netfilter-ipv4/ip_conntrack*.h files. These values are dependent on which sub-protocol of IP we use. TCP, UDP or ICMP protocols take specific default values as specified in linux/include/netfilter-ipv4/ip_conntrack.h. We will look closer at this when we look at each of the protocols; however, we will not use them extensively through this chapter, since they are not used outside of the conntrack internals. Also, depending on how this state changes, the default value of the time until the connection is destroyed will also change.

Recently there was a new patch made available in iptables patch-o-matic, called tcp-window-tracking. This patch adds, among other things, all of the above timeouts to special sysctl variables, which means that they can be changed on the fly, while the system is still running. Hence, this makes it unnecessary to recompile the kernel every time you want to change the timeouts. These can be altered via using specific system calls available in the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter directory. You should in particular look at the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_ct_* variables. 

When a connection has seen traffic in both directions, the conntrack entry will erase the [UNREPLIED] flag, and then reset it. The entry tells us that the connection has not seen any traffic in both directions, will be replaced by the [ASSURED] flag, to be found close to the end of the entry. The [ASSURED] flag tells us that this connection is assured and that it will not be erased if we reach the maximum possible tracked connections. Thus, connections marked as [ASSURED] will not be erased, contrary to the non assured connections (those not marked as [ASSURED]). How many connections that the connection tracking table can hold depends upon a variable that can be set through the ip-sysctl functions in recent kernels. The default value held by this entry varies heavily depending on how much memory you have. On 128 MB of RAM, you will get 8192 possible entries, and at 256 MB of RAM, you will get 16376 entries. You can read and set your settings through the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max setting.

=== User-land states ===

As you have seen, packets may take on several different states within the kernel itself, depending on what protocol we are talking about. However, outside the kernel, we only have the 4 states as described previously. These states can mainly be used in conjunction with the state match which will then be able to match packets based on their current connection tracking state. The valid states are NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED and INVALID states. The following table will briefly explain each possible state

These states can be used together with the --state match to match packets based on their connection tracking state. This is what makes the state machine so incredibly strong and efficient for our firewall. Previously, we often had to open up all ports above 1024 to let all traffic back into our local networks again. With the state machine in place this is not necessary any longer, since we can now just open up the firewall for return traffic and not for all kinds of other traffic. 

=== TCP connections ===

In this section and the upcoming ones, we will take a closer look at the states and how they are handled for each of the three basic protocols TCP, UDP and ICMP. Also, we will take a closer look at how connections are handled per default, if they can not be classified as either of these three protocols. We have chosen to start out with the TCP protocol since it is a stateful protocol in itself, and has a lot of interesting details with regard to the state machine in iptables. 

A TCP connection is always initiated with the 3-way handshake, which establishes and negotiates the actual connection over which data will be sent. The whole session is begun with a SYN packet, then a SYN/ACK packet and finally an ACK packet to acknowledge the whole session establishment. At this point the connection is established and able to start sending data. The big problem is, how does connection tracking hook up into this? Quite simply really. 

As far as the user is concerned, connection tracking works basically the same for all connection types. Have a look at the picture below to see exactly what state the stream enters during the different stages of the connection. As you can see, the connection tracking code does not really follow the flow of the TCP connection, from the users viewpoint. Once it has seen one packet(the SYN), it considers the connection as NEW. Once it sees the return packet(SYN/ACK), it considers the connection as ESTABLISHED. If you think about this a second, you will understand why. With this particular implementation, you can allow NEW and ESTABLISHED packets to leave your local network, only allow ESTABLISHED connections back, and that will work perfectly. Conversely, if the connection tracking machine were to consider the whole connection establishment as NEW, we would never really be able to stop outside connections to our local network, since we would have to allow NEW packets back in again. To make things more complicated, there is a number of other internal states that are used for TCP connections inside the kernel, but which are not available for us in User-land. Roughly, they follow the state standards specified within RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol at page 21-23.

As you can see, it is really quite simple, seen from the user's point of view. However, looking at the whole construction from the kernel's point of view, it's a little more difficult. Let's look at an example. Consider exactly how the connection states change in the /proc/net/ip_conntrack table. The first state is reported upon receipt of the first SYN packet in a connection. 

 tcp      6 117 SYN_SENT src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.1.35 sport=1031 \
     dport=23 [UNREPLIED] src=192.168.1.35 dst=192.168.1.5 sport=23 \
     dport=1031 use=1

As you can see from the above entry, we have a precise state in which a SYN packet has been sent, (the SYN_SENT flag is set), and to which as yet no reply has been sent (witness the [UNREPLIED] flag). The next internal state will be reached when we see another packet in the other direction. 

 tcp      6 57 SYN_RECV src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.1.35 sport=1031 \
     dport=23 src=192.168.1.35 dst=192.168.1.5 sport=23 dport=1031 \
     use=1

Now we have received a corresponding SYN/ACK in return. As soon as this packet has been received, the state changes once again, this time to SYN_RECV. SYN_RECV tells us that the original SYN was delivered correctly and that the SYN/ACK return packet also got through the firewall properly. Moreover, this connection tracking entry has now seen traffic in both directions and is hence considered as having been replied to. This is not explicit, but rather assumed, as was the [UNREPLIED] flag above. The final step will be reached once we have seen the final ACK in the 3-way handshake. 

tcp      6 431999 ESTABLISHED src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.1.35 \
     sport=1031 dport=23 src=192.168.1.35 dst=192.168.1.5 \
     sport=23 dport=1031 use=1

In the last example, we have gotten the final ACK in the 3-way handshake and the connection has entered the ESTABLISHED state, as far as the internal mechanisms of iptables are aware. After a few more packets, the connection will also become [ASSURED], as shown in the introduction section of this chapter. 
When a TCP connection is closed down, it is done in the following way and takes the following states. 

As you can see, the connection is never really closed until the last ACK is sent. Do note that this picture only describes how it is closed down under normal circumstances. A connection may also, for example, be closed by sending a RST(reset), if the connection were to be refused. In this case, the connection would be closed down after a predetermined time. 

When the TCP connection has been closed down, the connection enters the TIME_WAIT state, which is per default set to 2 minutes. This is used so that all packets that have gotten out of order can still get through our rule-set, even after the connection has already closed. This is used as a kind of buffer time so that packets that have gotten stuck in one or another congested router can still get to the firewall, or to the other end of the connection. 

If the connection is reset by a RST packet, the state is changed to CLOSE. This means that the connection per default have 10 seconds before the whole connection is definitely closed down. RST packets are not acknowledged in any sense, and will break the connection directly. There are also other states than the ones we have told you about so far. 

Here is the complete list of possible states that a TCP stream may take, and their timeout values.

These values are most definitely not absolute. They may change with kernel revisions, and they may also be changed via the proc file-system in the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_ct_tcp_* variables. The default values should, however, be fairly well established in practice. These values are set in jiffies (or 1/100th parts of seconds), so 3000 means 30 seconds. 

Also note that the User-land side of the state machine does not look at TCP flags set in the TCP packets. This is generally bad, since you may want to allow packets in the NEW state to get through the firewall, but when you specify the NEW flag, you will in most cases mean SYN packets. 

=== UDP connections ===

UDP connections are in them selves not stateful connections, but rather stateless. There are several reasons why, mainly because they don't contain any connection establishment or connection closing; most of all they lack sequencing. Receiving two UDP datagrams in a specific order does not say anything about which order in which they where sent. It is, however, still possible to set states on the connections within the kernel. Let's have a look at how a connection can be tracked and how it might look in conntrack. 

As you can see, the connection is brought up almost exactly in the same way as a TCP connection. That is, from the user-land point of view. Internally, conntrack information looks quite a bit different, but intrinsically the details are the same. First of all, let's have a look at the entry after the initial UDP packet has been sent. 

 udp      17 20 src=192.168.1.2 dst=192.168.1.5 sport=137 dport=1025 \
     [UNREPLIED] src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.1.2 sport=1025 \
     dport=137 use=1

As you can see from the first and second values, this is an UDP packet. The first is the protocol name, and the second is protocol number. This is just the same as for TCP connections. The third value marks how many seconds this state entry has to live. After this, we get the values of the packet that we have seen and the future expectations of packets over this connection reaching us from the initiating packet sender. These are the source, destination, source port and destination port. At this point, the [UNREPLIED] flag tells us that there's so far been no response to the packet. Finally, we get a brief list of the expectations for returning packets. Do note that the latter entries are in reverse order to the first values. The timeout at this point is set to 30 seconds, as per default. 

 udp      17 170 src=192.168.1.2 dst=192.168.1.5 sport=137 \
     dport=1025 src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.1.2 sport=1025 \
     dport=137 use=1

At this point the server has seen a reply to the first packet sent out and the connection is now considered as ESTABLISHED. This is not shown in the connection tracking, as you can see. The main difference is that the [UNREPLIED] flag has now gone. Moreover, the default timeout has changed to 180 seconds - but in this example that's by now been decremented to 170 seconds - in 10 seconds' time, it will be 160 seconds. There's one thing that's missing, though, and can change a bit, and that is the [ASSURED] flag described above. For the [ASSURED] flag to be set on a tracked connection, there must have been a small amount of traffic over that connection.

 udp      17 175 src=192.168.1.5 dst=195.22.79.2 sport=1025 \
     dport=53 src=195.22.79.2 dst=192.168.1.5 sport=53 \
     dport=1025 [ASSURED] use=1

At this point, the connection has become assured. The connection looks exactly the same as the previous example, except for the [ASSURED] flag. If this connection is not used for 180 seconds, it times out. 180 Seconds is a comparatively low value, but should be sufficient for most use. This value is reset to its full value for each packet that matches the same entry and passes through the firewall, just the same as for all of the internal states. 

=== ICMP connections ===

ICMP packets are far from a stateful stream, since they are only used for controlling and should never establish any connections. There are four ICMP types that will generate return packets however, and these have 2 different states. These ICMP messages can take the NEW and ESTABLISHED states. The ICMP types we are talking about are Echo request and reply, Timestamp request and reply, Information request and reply and finally Address mask request and reply. Out of these, the timestamp request and information request are obsolete and could most probably just be dropped. However, the Echo messages are used in several setups such as pinging hosts. Address mask requests are not used often, but could be useful at times and worth allowing. To get an idea of how this could look, have a look at the following image. 

As you can see in the above picture, the host sends an echo request to the target, which is considered as NEW by the firewall. The target then responds with a echo reply which the firewall considers as state ESTABLISHED. When the first echo request has been seen, the following state entry goes into the ip_conntrack. 

 icmp     1 25 src=192.168.1.6 dst=192.168.1.10 type=8 code=0 \
     id=33029 [UNREPLIED] src=192.168.1.10 dst=192.168.1.6 \
     type=0 code=0 id=33029 use=1

This entry looks a little bit different from the standard states for TCP and UDP as you can see. The protocol is there, and the timeout, as well as source and destination addresses. The problem comes after that however. We now have 3 new fields called type, code and id. They are not special in any way, the type field contains the ICMP type and the code field contains the ICMP code. These are all available in ICMP types appendix. The final id field, contains the ICMP ID. Each ICMP packet gets an ID set to it when it is sent, and when the receiver gets the ICMP message, it sets the same ID within the new ICMP message so that the sender will recognize the reply and will be able to connect it with the correct ICMP request. 

The next field, we once again recognize as the [UNREPLIED] flag, which we have seen before. Just as before, this flag tells us that we are currently looking at a connection tracking entry that has seen only traffic in one direction. Finally, we see the reply expectation for the reply ICMP packet, which is the inversion of the original source and destination IP addresses. As for the type and code, these are changed to the correct values for the return packet, so an echo request is changed to echo reply and so on. The ICMP ID is preserved from the request packet. 

The reply packet is considered as being ESTABLISHED, as we have already explained. However, we can know for sure that after the ICMP reply, there will be absolutely no more legal traffic in the same connection. For this reason, the connection tracking entry is destroyed once the reply has traveled all the way through the Netfilter structure. 

In each of the above cases, the request is considered as NEW, while the reply is considered as ESTABLISHED. Let's consider this more closely. When the firewall sees a request packet, it considers it as NEW. When the host sends a reply packet to the request it is considered ESTABLISHED. 

Note that this means that the reply packet must match the criterion given by the connection tracking entry to be considered as established, just as with all other traffic types. 

ICMP requests has a default timeout of 30 seconds, which you can change in the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_ct_icmp_timeout entry. This should in general be a good timeout value, since it will be able to catch most packets in transit. 

Another hugely important part of ICMP is the fact that it is used to tell the hosts what happened to specific UDP and TCP connections or connection attempts. For this simple reason, ICMP replies will very often be recognized as RELATED to original connections or connection attempts. A simple example would be the ICMP Host unreachable or ICMP Network unreachable. These should always be spawned back to our host if it attempts an unsuccessful connection to some other host, but the network or host in question could be down, and hence the last router trying to reach the site in question will reply with an ICMP message telling us about it. In this case, the ICMP reply is considered as a RELATED packet. The following picture should explain how it would look. 

&lt;!-- [[Image:...]] --&gt;

In the above example, we send out a SYN packet to a specific address. This is considered as a NEW connection by the firewall. However, the network the packet is trying to reach is unreachable, so a router returns a network unreachable ICMP error to us. The connection tracking code can recognize this packet as RELATED. thanks to the already added tracking entry, so the ICMP reply is correctly sent to the client which will then hopefully abort. Meanwhile, the firewall has destroyed the connection tracking entry since it knows this was an error message. 

The same behavior as above is experienced with UDP connections if they run into any problem like the above. All ICMP messages sent in reply to UDP connections are considered as RELATED. Consider the following image. 

This time an UDP packet is sent to the host. This UDP connection is considered as NEW. However, the network is administratively prohibited by some firewall or router on the way over. Hence, our firewall receives a ICMP Network Prohibited in return. The firewall knows that this ICMP error message is related to the already opened UDP connection and sends it as an RELATED packet to the client. At this point, the firewall destroys the connection tracking entry, and the client receives the ICMP message and should hopefully abort. 

=== Default connections ===

In certain cases, the conntrack machine does not know how to handle a specific protocol. This happens if it does not know about that protocol in particular, or doesn't know how it works. In these cases, it goes back to a default behavior. The default behavior is used on, for example, NETBLT, MUX and EGP. This behavior looks pretty much the same as the UDP connection tracking. The first packet is considered NEW, and reply traffic and so forth is considered ESTABLISHED. 

When the default behavior is used, all of these packets will attain the same default timeout value. This can be set via the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_ct_generic_timeout variable. The default value here is 600 seconds, or 10 minutes. Depending on what traffic you are trying to send over a link that uses the default connection tracking behavior, this might need changing. Especially if you are bouncing traffic through satellites and such, which can take a long time. 

=== Complex protocols and connection tracking ===

Certain protocols are more complex than others. What this means when it comes to connection tracking, is that such protocols may be harder to track correctly. Good examples of these are the ICQ, IRC and FTP protocols. Each and every one of these protocols carries information within the actual data payload of the packets, and hence requires special connection tracking helpers to enable it to function correctly. 

Let's take the FTP protocol as the first example. The FTP protocol first opens up a single connection that is called the FTP control session. When we issue commands through this session, other ports are opened to carry the rest of the data related to that specific command. These connections can be done in two ways, either actively or passively. When a connection is done actively, the FTP client sends the server a port and IP address to connect to. After this, the FTP client opens up the port and the server connects to that specified port from its own port 20 (known as FTP-Data) and sends the data over it. 

The problem here is that the firewall will not know about these extra connections, since they where negotiated within the actual payload of the protocol data. Because of this, the firewall will be unable to know that it should let the server connect to the client over these specific ports. 

The solution to this problem is to add a special helper to the connection tracking module which will scan through the data in the control connection for specific syntaxes and information. When it runs into the correct information, it will add that specific information as RELATED and the server will be able to track the connection, thanks to that RELATED entry. Consider the following picture to understand the states when the FTP server has made the connection back to the client. 

Passive FTP works the opposite way. The FTP client tells the server that it wants some specific data, upon which the server replies with an IP address to connect to and at what port. The client will, upon receipt of this data, connect to that specific port, from its own port 20(the FTP-data port), and get the data in question. If you have an FTP server behind your firewall, you will in other words require this module in addition to your standard iptables modules to let clients on the Internet connect to the FTP server properly. The same goes if you are extremely restrictive to your users, and only want to let them reach HTTP and FTP servers on the Internet and block all other ports. Consider the following image and its bearing on Passive FTP.

Some conntrack helpers are already available within the kernel itself. More specifically, the FTP and IRC protocols have conntrack helpers as of writing this. If you can not find the conntrack helpers that you need within the kernel itself, you should have a look at the patch-o-matic tree within user-land iptables. The patch-o-matic tree may contain more conntrack helpers, such as for the ntalk or H.323 protocols.

Conntrack helpers may either be statically compiled into the kernel, or as modules. If they are compiled as modules, you can load them with the following command :

 modprobe ip_conntrack_*

Do note that connection tracking has nothing to do with NAT, and hence you may require more modules if you are NAT'ing connections as well. For example, if you were to want to NAT and track FTP connections, you would need the NAT module as well. All NAT helpers starts with ip_nat_ and follow that naming convention; so for example the FTP NAT helper would be named ip_nat_ftp and the IRC module would be named ip_nat_irc. The conntrack helpers follow the same naming convention, and hence the IRC conntrack helper would be named ip_conntrack_irc, while the FTP conntrack helper would be named ip_conntrack_ftp. 

=== How a rule is built ===

As we have already explained, each rule is a line that the kernel looks at to find out what to do with a packet. If all the criteria - or matches - are met, we perform the target - or jump - instruction. Normally we would write our rules in a syntax that looks something like this: 

 iptables [-t table] command [match] [target/jump]

There is nothing that says that the target instruction has to be last function in the line. However, you would usually adhere to this syntax to get the best readability. Anyway, most of the rules you'll see are written in this way. Hence, if you read someone else's script, you'll most likely recognize the syntax and easily understand the rule. 

If you want to use another table than the standard table, you could insert the table specification at the point at which [table] is specified. However, it is not necessary to state explicitly what table to use, since by default iptables uses the filter table on which to implement all commands. Neither do you have to specify the table at just this point in the rule. It could be set pretty much anywhere along the line. However, it is more or less standard to put the table specification at the beginning.

One thing to think about though: The command should always come first, or alternatively directly after the table specification. We use 'command' to tell the program what to do, for example to insert a rule or to add a rule to the end of the chain, or to delete a rule. We shall take a further look at this below. 
The match is the part of the rule that we send to the kernel that details the specific character of the packet, what makes it different from all other packets. Here we could specify what IP address the packet comes from, from which network interface, the intended IP address, port, protocol or whatever. There is a heap of different matches that we can use that we will look closer at further down.

Finally we have the target of the packet. If all the matches are met for a packet, we tell the kernel what to do with it. We could, for example, tell the kernel to send the packet to another chain that we've created ourselves, and which is part of this particular table. We could tell the kernel to drop the packet dead and do no further processing, or we could tell the kernel to send a specified reply to the sender. As with the rest of the content in this section, we'll look closer at it further down. 

=== Tables ===

The -t option specifies which table to use. Per default, the filter table is used. We may specify one of the following tables with the -t option. Do note that this is an extremely brief summary

=== Commands ===

In this section we will cover all the different commands and what can be done with them. The command tells iptables what to do with the rest of the rule that we send to the parser. Normally we would want either to add or delete something in some table or another. The following commands are available to iptables: 

&lt;!-- [[Image:...]] --&gt;

You should always enter a complete command line, unless you just want to list the built-in help for iptables or get the version of the command. To get the version, use the -v option and to get the help message, use the -h option. As usual, in other words. Next comes a few options that can be used with various different commands. Note that we tell you with which commands the options can be used and what effect they will have. Also note that we do not include any options here that affect rules or matches. Instead, we'll take a look at matches and targets in a later section of this chapter. 

Options :

=== Matches ===

First of all we have the generic matches, which can be used in all rules. Then we have the TCP matches which can only be applied to TCP packets. We have UDP matches which can only be applied to UDP packets, and ICMP matches which can only be used on ICMP packets. Finally we have special matches, such as the state, owner and limit matches and so on. These final matches have in turn been narrowed down to even more subcategories, even though they might not necessarily be different matches at all.

=== Generic matches ===

This section will deal with Generic matches. A generic match is a kind of match that is always available, whatever kind of protocol we are working on, or whatever match extensions we have loaded. No special parameters at all are needed to use these matches; in other words. I have also included the --protocol match here, even though it is more specific to protocol matches. For example, if we want to use a TCP match, we need to use the --protocol match and send TCP as an option to the match. However, --protocol is also a match in itself, since it can be used to match specific protocols. The following matches are always available. 

Generic matches

=== Implicit matches ===

Those are matches that are loaded implicitly. Implicit matches are implied, taken for granted, automatic. For example when we match on --protocol tcp without any further criteria. There are currently three types of implicit matches for three different protocols. These are TCP matches, UDP matches and ICMP matches. The TCP based matches contain a set of unique criteria that are available only for TCP packets. UDP based matches contain another set of criteria that are available only for UDP packets. And the same thing for ICMP packets. On the other hand, there can be explicit matches that are loaded explicitly. Explicit matches are not implied or automatic, you have to specify them specifically. For these you use the -m or --match option, which we will discuss in the next section. 

=== TCP matches ===

These matches are protocol specific and are only available when working with TCP packets and streams. To use these matches, you need to specify --protocol tcp on the command line before trying to use them. Note that the --protocol tcp match must be to the left of the protocol specific matches. These matches are loaded implicitly in a sense, just as the UDP and ICMP matches are loaded implicitly. The other matches will be looked over in the continuation of this section, after the TCP match section. 

=== UDP matches ===

will only work together with UDP packets. These matches are implicitly loaded when you specify the --protocol UDP match and will be available after this specification. Note that UDP packets are not connection oriented, and hence there is no such thing as different flags to set in the packet to give data on what the datagram is supposed to do, such as open or closing a connection, or if they are just simply supposed to send data. UDP packets do not require any kind of acknowledgment either. If they are lost, they are simply lost (Not taking ICMP error messaging etc into account). This means that there are quite a lot less matches to work with on a UDP packet than there is on TCP packets. Note that the state machine will work on all kinds of packets even though UDP or ICMP packets are counted as connectionless protocols. The state machine works pretty much the same on UDP packets as on TCP packets. 

=== ICMP matches ===

These are the ICMP matches. These packets are even more ephemeral, that is to say short lived, than UDP packets, in the sense that they are connectionless. The ICMP protocol is mainly used for error reporting and for connection controlling and suchlike. ICMP is not a protocol subordinated to the IP protocol, but more of a protocol that augments the IP protocol and helps in handling errors. The headers of ICMP packets are very similar to those of the IP headers, but differ in a number of ways. The main feature of this protocol is the type header, that tells us what the packet is for. One example is, if we try to access an unaccessible IP address, we would normally get an ICMP host unreachable in return. For a complete listing of ICMP types, see the ICMP types appendix. There is only one ICMP specific match available for ICMP packets, and hopefully this should suffice. This match is implicitly loaded when we use the --protocol ICMP match and we get access to it automatically. Note that all the generic matches can also be used, so that among other things we can match on the source and destination addresses. 

=== Explicit matches ===

Explicit matches are those that have to be specifically loaded with the -m or --match option. State matches, for example, demand the directive -m state prior to entering the actual match that you want to use. Some of these matches may be protocol specific . Some may be unconnected with any specific protocol - for example connection states. These might be NEW (the first packet of an as yet unestablished connection), ESTABLISHED (a connection that is already registered in the kernel), RELATED (a new connection that was created by an older, established one) etc. A few may just have been evolved for testing or experimental purposes, or just to illustrate what iptables is capable of. This in turn means that not all of these matches may at first sight be of any use. Nevertheless, it may well be that you personally will find a use for specific explicit matches. And there are new ones coming along all the time, with each new iptables release. Whether you find a use for them or not depends on your imagination and your needs. The difference between implicitly loaded matches and explicitly loaded ones, is that the implicitly loaded matches will automatically be loaded when, for example, you match on the properties of TCP packets, while explicitly loaded matches will never be loaded automatically - it is up to you to discover and activate explicit matches. 

=== Limit match ===

The limit match extension must be loaded explicitly with the -m limit option. This match can, for example, be used to advantage to give limited logging of specific rules etc. For example, you could use this to match all packets that does not exceed a given value, and after this value has been exceeded, limit logging of the event in question. Think of a time limit : You could limit how many times a certain rule may be matched in a certain time frame, for example to lessen the effects of DoS syn flood attacks. This is its main usage, but there are more usages, of course. The limit match may also be inverted by adding a ! flag in front of the limit match. It would then be expressed as -m limit ! --limit 5/s.This means that all packets will be matched after they have broken thelimit. 

To further explain the limit match, it is basically a token bucket filter. Consider having a leaky bucket where the bucket leaks X packets per time-unit. X is defined depending on how many matching packets we get, so if we get 3 packets, the bucket leaks 3 packets per that time-unit. The --limit option tells us how many packets to refill the bucket with per time-unit, while the --limit-burst option tells us how big the bucket is in the first place. So, setting --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 5, and then receiving 5 matches will empty the bucket. After 20 seconds, the bucket is refilled with another token, and so on until the --limit-burst is reached again or until they get used.

Consider the example below for further explanation of how this may look. 
# We set a rule with -m limit --limit 5/second --limit-burst 10. The limit-burst token bucket is set to 10 initially. Each packet that matches the rule uses a token. 
# We get packet that matches, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10, all within a 1/1000 of a second. 
# The token bucket is now empty. Once the token bucket is empty, the packets that qualify for the rule otherwise no longer match the rule and proceed to the next rule if any, or hit the chain policy. 
# For each 1/5 s without a matching packet, the token count goes up by 1, upto a maximum of 10. 2 seconds after receiving the 10 packets, we will once again have 10 tokens left. 
# And of course, the bucket will be emptied by 1 token for each packet it receives.

=== MAC match ===

The MAC (Ethernet Media Access Control) match can be used to match packets based on their MAC source address. As of writing this documentation, this match is a little bit limited, however, in the future this may be more evolved and may be more useful. This match can be used to match packets on the source MAC address only as previously said. 

Do note that to use this module we explicitly load it with the -m mac option. The reason that I am saying this is that a lot of people wonder if it should not be -m mac-source, which it should not. 

=== Mark match ===

The mark match extension is used to match packets based on the marks they have set. A mark is a special field, only maintained within the kernel, that is associated with the packets as they travel through the computer. Marks may be used by different kernel routines for such tasks as traffic shaping and filtering. As of today, there is only one way of setting a mark in Linux, namely the MARK target in iptables. This was previously done with the FWMARK target in ipchains, and this is why people still refer to FWMARK in advanced routing areas. The mark field is currently set to an unsigned integer, or 4294967296 possible values on a 32 bit system. In other words, you are probably not going to run into this limit for quite some time. 

=== Multiport match ===

The multiport match extension can be used to specify multiple destination ports and port ranges. Without the possibility this match gives, you would have to use multiple rules of the same type, just to match different ports. 

You can not use both standard port matching and multiport matching at the same time, for example you can't write: --sport 1024:63353 -m multiport --dport 21,23,80. This will simply not work. What in fact happens, if you do, is that iptables honors the first element in the rule, and ignores the multiport instruction. 

=== Owner match ===

The owner match extension is used to match packets based on the identity of the process that created them. The owner can be specified as the process ID either of the user who issued the command in question, that of the group, the process, the session, or that of the command itself. This extension was originally written as an example of what iptables could be used for. The owner match only works within the OUTPUT chain, for obvious reasons: It is pretty much impossible to find out any information about the identity of the instance that sent a packet from the other end, or where there is an intermediate hop to the real destination. Even within the OUTPUT chain it is not very reliable, since certain packets may not have an owner. Notorious packets of that sort are (among other things) the different ICMP responses. ICMP responses will never match. 

=== State match ===

The state match extension is used in conjunction with the connection tracking code in the kernel. The state match accesses the connection tracking state of the packets from the conntracking machine. This allows us to know in what state the connection is, and works for pretty much all protocols, including stateless protocols such as ICMP and UDP. In all cases, there will be a default timeout for the connection and it will then be dropped from the connection tracking database. This match needs to be loaded explicitly by adding a -m state statement to the rule. You will then have access to one new match called state.

=== TOS match ===

The TOS match can be used to match packets based on their TOS field. TOS stands for '''Type Of Service''', consists of 8 bits, and is located in the IP header. This match is loaded explicitly by adding -m tos to the rule. TOS is normally used to inform intermediate hosts of the precedence of the stream and its content (it doesn't really, but it informs of any specific requirements for the stream, such as it having to be sent as fast as possible, or it needing to be able to send as much payload as possible). How different routers and administrators deal with these values depends. Most do not care at all, while others try their best to do something good with the packets in question and the data they provide.

=== TTL match ===

The TTL match is used to match packets based on their TTL (Time To Live) field residing in the IP headers. The TTL field contains 8 bits of data and is decremented once every time it is processed by an intermediate host between the client and recipient host. If the TTL reaches 0, an ICMP type 11 code 0 (TTL equals 0 during transit) or code 1 (TTL equals 0 during reassembly) is transmitted to the party sending the packet and informing it of the problem. This match is only used to match packets based on their TTL, and not to change anything. The latter, incidentally, applies to all kinds of matches. To load this match, you need to add an -m ttl to the rule. 

=== Targets/Jumps ===

The target/jumps tells the rule what to do with a packet that is a perfect match with the match section of the rule. There are a couple of basic targets, the ACCEPT and DROP targets, which we will deal with first. However, before we do that, let us have a brief look at how a jump is done. 

The jump specification is done in exactly the same way as in the target definition, except that it requires a chain within the same table to jump to. To jump to a specific chain, it is of course a prerequisite that that chain exists. As we have already explained, a user-defined chain is created with the -N command. For example, let's say we create a chain in the filter table called tcp_packets, like this:
iptables -N tcp_packets

We could then add a jump target to it like this: 

 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j tcp_packets

We would then jump from the INPUT chain to the tcp_packets chain and start traversing that chain. When/If we reach the end of that chain, we get dropped back to the INPUT chain and the packet starts traversing from the rule one step below where it jumped to the other chain (tcp_packets in this case). If a packet is ACCEPTed within one of the sub chains, it will be ACCEPT'ed in the superset chain also and it will not traverse any of the superset chains any further. However, do note that the packet will traverse all other chains in the other tables in a normal fashion.

Targets on the other hand specify an action to take on the packet in question. We could for example, DROP or ACCEPT the packet depending on what we want to do. There are also a number of other actions we may want to take, which we will describe further on in this section. Jumping to targets may incur different results, as it were. Some targets will cause the packet to stop traversing that specific chain and superior chains as described above. Good examples of such rules are DROP and ACCEPT. Rules that are stopped, will not pass through any of the rules further on in the chain or in superior chains. Other targets, may take an action on the packet, after which the packet will continue passing through the rest of the rules. A good example of this would be the LOG, ULOG and TOS targets. These targets can log the packets, mangle them and then pass them on to the other rules in the same set of chains. We might, for example,

2|Oort cloud Facts:|=
3|* The Oort cloud is as far from the Sun as you can go without leaving the Solar System.
* It is believed that most comets originate in the Oort cloud before &quot;falling&quot; toward the Sun.
}}
The Oort cloud is a huge halo made of millions of comets that lies at the outermost edge of the Solar System.

==What is the Oort Cloud?==
Scientists say there is a distant group of objects, made of rock and ice, that forms a cloud-like region surrounding our Solar System. It is a cloud of comet-like objects orbiting far away from the Sun. Even though the comets are very widely scattered from each other, there many millions of them. The total mass of all these comets may be up to 100 times the mass of the Earth. The Oort Cloud is named after a Dutch astronomer [[wikipedia:Jan_Oort|Jan Oort]] who took the original idea, improved upon it and made it widely known.

[[File:Oort_cloud_Sedna_orbit.jpg|thumb|left|350px|This diagram shows about how far away the Oort cloud might be compared to the planets of the Solar System. Start in the upper left frame, then follow the pictures clockwise. Each picture shows a bigger volume of space.]]

As a comet makes several passes through the solar system, the Sun slowly melts and vaporizes the ice and only little bits of solid debris are left behind. But if the comets are all destroyed when they pass through the system, then new comets will need to appear. Otherwise we would not see any more comets. Jan Oort used the idea of the Oort cloud to explain why new comets keep appearing.

==Where is the Oort Cloud?==
If you can imagine the distance from the Earth to the Sun, then the comets in the Oort cloud are 50,000 to 100,000 times further away! That is 1,000 times further away from the Sun than is Pluto, and about one fourth the distance to the nearest neighboring star&amp;mdash;Proxima Centauri. Light takes a year to travel from the Sun to the outer edge of the Oort Cloud.

{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

==How did the Oort Cloud start?== 
The Oort cloud objects may have started closer to the Sun during the Solar System's formation. When they passed near the gas giants, the gravity of those planets hurled the objects into very distant orbits. The Oort cloud objects were sent in all directions, making the Oort cloud ball-shaped instead of disk-shaped. The gravity of passing stars also made the orbits of these objects more circular, and pulled them further from the Sun. But sometimes the gravity of other far away stars can send the objects hurtling back toward the Sun. These become the comets.

==What objects are in the Oort Cloud?==
An object named Sedna has been discovered that may belong to the Oort Cloud (although it is actually between the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.) It is from 1,180 to 1,800 km across. Its orbit stretches from 76 to 928 times further from the Sun than does the Earth's. Sedna orbits the Sun about once every 11,250 Earth years. The last time Sedna was where it is now in its orbit, Earth's last Ice Age was ending! Some scientists think that Sedna should be included in the Kuiper Belt, making the belt bigger.

Not to knock the work done here but is the oort cloud really appropriate for what is after all a basic intro to the sloar system. I've never heard of it before, and since there seems to be some debate if it is part of the keppler belt or not, maybe it should be cut... [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 04:51, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Minor clarification ==

Current Text:
&quot;It is believed that most comets originally were in the Oort Cloud before &quot;falling&quot; into the Sun.&quot;

I think falling &quot;into&quot; the Sun might not be what we're looking for - would falling &quot;toward&quot; the Sun be better?  Falling into the Sun implies a fiery end for the comet.
:While I think that the toward is perhaps more correct, &quot;falling into&quot; the sun does indeed happen.  In fact, SOHO has seen several with a very fiery end as they go right into the photosphere (with a strong assumption that they don't make it back out).  Perhaps some clarification on the comet page of both types?  I was just trying to put some content in for this page, so don't worry about bruising my ego to make it more correct.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:32, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Is this really necessary?==

[[w:Oort cloud|The Wikipedia article]] admits that &quot;The Oort cloud ... is a '''postulated''' spherical cloud of comets...&quot; and &quot;Although '''no direct observations have been made''' of such a cloud, it is believed to be the source of most or all comets entering the inner solar system...&quot;. Is there any evidence that the Oort cloud even exists (besides the fact that comets enter the inner solar system)? And if there isn't, or if the only evidence is one comet that isn't even close to far enough away, why teach this to kids? And why call this armchair speculation science? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:32, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
:There is large amount of evidence to support the Oort cloud, Hubble Space Telescope has seen large amounts of very small (20 km or so) objects in the far outer solar system. [[User:N1person|N1person]] 21:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

No there is no evidence for the oort cloud, it has never been observed, but guess what, WITHOUT the oort cloud evolution is impossible, they will make it there i am sure. I am sure the vatican would stand up to any silly arguments put forward by nasa about a oort cloud, even a quote from the author, i now doubt the oort cloud exists as there is not a shred of evidence for its existance. Stop teaching junk to kids and brain washing them with propogander nonsence.

[[Wikipedia:90377 Sedna]] is plenty far enough away. (What about [[Wikipedia:50000 Quaoar]] ?).
Apparently other smaller objects are not newsworthy enough to make my newspaper.
Do you have a reference for any observations of these small objects?
[http://nineplanets.org/kboc.html The Kuiper Belt and The Oort Cloud] seems to imply that Hubble has only seen 1 such object.
Have there been more discoveries (by Hubble or anything else) since that was written?
There are quite a few obstinate, stubborn people who prefer links and literature references over &quot;the evidence exists, trust me!&quot; :-).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:10, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

:I think the problem here is that any observation of objects as small as a typical comet is not likely to occur until after the object becomes a comet and enters the inner Solar System.  The objective scientific evidence is comparing the frequence of comets over the past several centuries, especially records of comets by Chinese astronomers over the past three millenia, and extrapolating the number of objects that would hypothetically be needed in the Oort cloud to produce that many comets with the seemingly consistant frequency of these cometary appearances.  Cometary infalls measured by SOHO have given another much larger set of datapoints for smaller objects that are not normally seen by terrestrial telescopes simply because they are so tiny that normally they wouldn't even be seen even if passing between the Earth and the Moon.  As for other Kuiper Belt objects, there have been many, but keep in mind that objects like Sedna and Quaoar have to be large enough to be resolved with current telescopes simply because they emit so little light by reflection that there is hardly anything at all that can be measured at all.  Pluto was right at the resolution limits of telescopes at the time of Tombaugh, and had it been any smaller Pluto would not have been discovered at all.
:If you want to see a current list of confirmed asteroids, please look at [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.html the Minor Planet Center] for current updates.  This site is the &quot;official&quot; organization that desinates any asteroid discoveries and is the central clearing house for any current asteroid observations, including Kuiper objects.  Of particular interest may be the [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/OuterPlot.html plot of Kuiper Belt objects] which show a large number beyond Neptune.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== Passing stars? ==

Reading about passing stars makes me very curious about which ones just passed our solar system given the relative stable positions of the stars in space? My suggestion is that someone will come up with a better explanation or point out these passing stars please.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:IArnold|IArnold]] ([[User talk:IArnold|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IArnold|contribs]]) 09:09, 1 March 2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;</text>

Engineering synthesis of State-Machines, Arithmetic and Logic.&lt;br&gt;
Formal approach (Semigroup structure) - Background: Industrial Research.

Relevant subjects are [[Associative algebra]] , [[Algebraic structure]] and:

* [[Computer Science]]: Basic structure of algorithms, software, hardware, Automaton , finite state machine (FSM) : Sequential logic. &lt;br&gt;
* Finite [[transformation semigroup]]:  Function Composition, Residue Arithmetic, [[Electronics/Boolean Algebra]] : Combinational logic. &lt;br&gt;
* [[Electrical Engineering]]: Digital circuit design, Combinational and Sequential logic, Finite Log-arithmetic with single- and dual bases. &lt;br&gt;
'''Purpose''' : This book is intended for researchers at industrial laboratories, teachers and students at technical universities, in electrical engineering, computer science and applied mathematics departments, interested in new developments of modelling and designing digital networks (DN : combinational and sequential logic, arithmetic) in general, as a combined math/engineering discipline. As background an undergraduate level of modern applied algebra will suffice..&lt;br&gt;
[1]. Birkhoff-Bartee (1970) - ''Modern Applied Algebra''&lt;br&gt;
[2]. Clifford-Preston (1960) - ''Algebraic Theory of Semigroups'' (part I)&lt;br&gt;
[3]. Hartmanis-Stearns (1970) - ''Algebraic structure of Sequential Machines''

'''Summary''' : The basic ideas of algebra relating to the structure of sequential and combinational logic, although well known from discrete mathematics [1][2], will be recalled briefly and, for practical state machine design purposes, interpreted in terms of the original additive and multiplicative arithmetic principles from which they developed in the nineteenth century (essentially the 1840's - Boole, Hamilton, Grassmann)
The subsequent three parts follow the developments in reverse historical order:&lt;br&gt;
I . ''Sequential logic'' (state machines),&lt;br&gt;
II. ''Combinational logic'' (Boolean algebra), and&lt;br&gt;
III. ''Arithmetic''.&lt;br&gt;
The respective disciplines: CS/EE/NT (computer science/ electrical engineering digital circuit design/ number theory) are merged under one heading:&lt;br&gt;
- - Finite Associative Algebra = Finite transformation Semigroups - - including:&lt;br&gt;
-- ''Non-commutative'' function composition, for sequential logic&lt;br&gt;
-- ''Commutative'' arithmetic (+, x) for residues and integers&lt;br&gt;
-- ''Commutative and Idempotent'' for combinational logic (binary, Boolean)

'''Structured Design''' : The original motivation for this work appears in appendix A , which is a report on the state of the art of computing science in 1973 (ICS73 Davos) regarding a controversy about the existence of a ''software crisis'', and the need for more attention to ’structure’ in programming and design. In matters of abstract mathematical material with practical applications, there is the usual dilemma of how to present it:&lt;br&gt;
— either ''top down'' : starting with an abstract concise definition of the essential concepts involved and developing the consequences, ending up with corollaries, as selected examples of important special cases;&lt;br&gt;
— or ''bottom up'' : by appealing to practical (engineering) intuition and experience, to begin with special essential examples and applications, and gradually extracting their abstract essence to develop the general theory.&lt;br&gt;
This dilemma is here resolved by alternating these two approaches, with a preference for starting bottom-up. By familiar examples in arithmetic, digital circuits or state machines, the essence of a formal viewpoint is introduced, as basis for computer aided design (CAD) synthesis algorithms in practice. Synthesis is taken to mean: efficient binary coding of a - functionally specified - symbolic description of desired sequential or combinational logic behaviour.

'''Intro''' : Essential concepts and their engineering interpretation are introduced in a practical fashion with examples, e.g:

* The known ''5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2'' as :&lt;br&gt;
- - the '''elementary components''' of '''sequential behaviour''' (''the 5 basic state machine types'') &lt;br&gt;
* Any finite '''semigroup''' ''S'' is the '''sequential closure''' of a''' state Machine''', uniquely decomposable as a ''coupled network'' of the 5 basic machine types. 
* Two of the five basic component types are non-commutative (branch- and reset- machines), the other three occur in residue arithmetic semigroups. 
* Excluding these non-comm've components, ''non-commutativity'' of S can be modelled by coupling - with combinational logic functions - between components (which does not occur if S is commutative). 
* ''Finite Group Decomposition'' (of ''any permutation machin''e) requires only right-congruence(s), thus proper subgroups suffice. Hence also a non-trivial simple group (like A5, without normal subgroup, resp. full congruence) can be decomposed as a coupled network of prime cycle machines, contrary to Krohn-Rhodes' decomposition which uses only 2 of the 5 basic machine types (reset- and permutation machines) and has the rather complex non-trivial simple groups (minimal order 60) as indecomposable components. 
* ''Binary Residue Arithmetic'' : each k-bit odd residue is a unique signed power of 3. So each residue n == +/- 3^i.2^j mod 2^k for unique natural pair i&lt;2^(k-2), j&lt;k, yielding an efficient dual base for log-arithmetic (US patent #5923888). 
* ''Fault Tolerant Logic'' by ''Error Correcting Codes'' : the known Hamming-code and Product-code methods for reliable transmissions can also be applied to (non-linear) Boolean combinational logic circuits. Practical examples show the trade-off between protection performance and cost. 
* ''Planar Boolean Functions'' : a new representation of BFn (n-input Boolean functions) uses the concept of (rank-) spectrum as an ordered sequence of n+1 natural numbers that characterizes a circuit, based on counting paths (minterms) in an orthogonal XY grid onto which a BFn is mapped. An essential algebraic composition property holds : the Spectrum of a (disjoint) product of BF's is the product of their Spectra : Sp(F1 * F2) = Sp(F1) x Sp(F2) , where disjoint means: no common input(s). 
* ''Residue Arithmetic'' (mod m_k): The ''additive'' structure of ''multiplicative'' residue arithmetic semigroup ''S(*) [mod m_k]'' is analysed, for two characteristic moduli: ''m_k = p^k'' (prime power), and ''m_k = \prod{p_k}'' (the product of the first k primes). This yields insight into notoriously difficult representation theorems of ''Fermat, Waring and Goldbach'' (for integers, by controlled extension of residues with a ''carry'', constructively ''breaking the Hensel lift'' ).

Hi Krischik.

I'm following your book on Ada programming, good work. I just wanted to warn you about a little recurrent spelling error: standart -&gt; standard.

Good luck. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:29, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Thanks, I watch it - it's a common mistake for native german speakers.

==AVR==

Thanks for the correction :-)

== [[Computer programming/Types]] ==
got additions by [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] effectively doubling the size of the article since you last worked on it.  I just thought you might like to see what I did to it. [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 23:50, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== Ada Quality and Style Guide ==

Hello, I would like to know your opinion about a new proposal [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Programming:Ada:Contributing&amp;diff=193995&amp;oldid=173025 I've made] about the name of the Ada Quality and Style Guide section. Thanks!

== C++ book forkings ==

Hi Krischik. I've noticed that you're involved with some the C++ book discussions. As you may know, I have called for administrators to look at the issue, at Panic2k4's request, of the forced a merge of the forked content with what is now two C++ books. If you could add your eyeballs to this it would be greatly appreciated by all. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:43, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Naming of language books ==

Hi Krischik. Panic2k4 has recently been renaming the &quot;C -/- -/-&quot; book and left a note saying it was by your suggestion?

: [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] was thinking aobut a new name and I was pointing out the [WB:NP]]

The name has been changed to &quot;Programming in C -/- -/-&quot; (not that it much matters, since it will be deleted in less than two weeks anyway). For the while, I'm wondering what to use for the name of the real C++ book.

: They should have a vote just like [[Ada Programming]] ([[Talk:Ada Programming/New Name needed]]) did - but they did not Panic just renamed without consulting the other programmers. I have not pointed that out to him yet because I don't want to loose him as a contributer by nagging him all the time.

I was under the impression that &quot;Programming:&quot; was just our idea of a namespace, so a book called &quot;Programming:Java&quot; is really just named &quot;Java&quot; and is in the &quot;Programming:&quot; namespace. This is the route I've taken with some &quot;Computer Science:&quot; books. (Likely the &quot;Programming&quot; module itself should go away, since it's really just a bookshelf or is far too general to be a single book.) I'd like the C++ book to match the pattern of other PL books, which all seem to be &quot;Programming:X&quot;, except for our flagship book on Ada. What do you suggest going forward? Thanks. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

Yes - but the [[Bookshelf:Book]] idea has been found to inflexible is is now a [[WB:NP#Historical_conventions]] and as such unsuitable for new book or renames. It actualy fits very well with the may-be [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote#.22eternal_stub.22_semi-books_should_be_merged]] rule - there are lots of ''eternal stubs'# in [[Programming]].

== font size in tables ==

You can resize the font with CSS. You might have to adjust the line-height style as well since it seems that the tables don't adjust correctly otherwise. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:21, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

== WB:NP ==

I see, you are eager to change naming conventions in programming books. But you should understand, it's not so easy.

Today, many of programming books use space convention: &lt;tt&gt;Programming:Perl Variables&lt;/tt&gt;. I understand it's really bad, but programming books widely use {{tl|prognav}} - a convenient navigation template. The template applies only to space convention-named books. Besides renaming whole books, you would have to replace the template in every single chapter or change the template and rename every book using it.

I don't agree we should use slash convention. As I wrote before, it creates unnecessary links, duplicating navigational templates, and confuses readers. You mentioned problems with statistics - you're right, but, hey, who are the statistics for? For us. We shouldn't complicate everything just so that statistics look pretty. Anyway, does anyone use statistics?

I believe we should leave big existing programming books (like [[Programming:Perl]]) with wrong naming convention as they are now. There's no sense putting lots of effort only to rename them; I think it's better to write new chapters or enhance existing.

: I guess I have a different opinion on big - working on a 200 chapter book ([[Ada Programming]])

But I agree that new books should follow naming policy. It's worth considering to correct new books or existing, but very short, having no navigatinal template yet (like [[Programming:Pascal]]). I can make new template like prognav, using semicolon (IMO best suitable for Programming: books) convention (and looking much better).

And another thing: according to current naming policy, using bookshelf information like &lt;tt&gt;Programming:&lt;/tt&gt; is depreciated. Should we rename new books from f.e. &lt;tt&gt;Programming:Nemerle&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;Nemerle&lt;/tt&gt;?

: Renaming is optional - but yes: Booknames should be something like [[Ada Programming]] instead of [[Programming:Ada]]

If you want, we can move this discussion to Staff lounge so that other Wikibookians could write their opinions. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 09:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

: This has been discussed several times - I just wanted to make some suggestions.

== Wikiversity Vote ==

I fixed my page [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 03:39, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

== adminship ==

I was looking at your recent contributions and I wonder, why are you still not a sysop? As far as I can see you are active in Wikibooks cleanup and you know Wikibooks policies well. What's the reason? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:39, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

: None at all. I just feel a bit shy about nominating myself. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:25, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

Are you willing to become an administrator? I can nominate you or ask other admin to do it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:27, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

: Shure - I would be willing ;-). --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:15, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I'd like to ask you some questions. Are you familiar with sysop's tools available at Wikibooks? Do you know current policies? Do you have time to patrol Recent changes and fight vandalism? Do you know how to solve copyright violation problems and which image licenses should and should not be used in uploaded files? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

: sysop's tools: you are never familar with any tool until you can actualy use them. But I heard of them. And especialy the one click revert was something I have missed several times.
: current policies: I try to keep up to date with them and suggest them to other users.
: vandalism: I fight it whenever I see it. I check the &quot;changes&quot; of user in question as well and follow him up.
: copyright violation : put up the  copyright violation notice wait a week and delete. That much for the theory - the praxis will be a lot more complicated but then one can allways read it up at [Wikibooks:Copyrights] when the problem arises.
: images : just read that one up [Wikibooks:Image use policy]  ;-)

: Generaly I go with the German saying: &quot;Man muss nicht wissen wie es geht - man muss nur wissen wo es steht.&quot; --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:04, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

Just a few more questions. How often do you plan to check recent changes (in days per week)? Do you read Staff lounge? Recently we have some controversies about Wikibooks mission and policies, you probably have noticed it. Are you interested in this issue? I also would like to know your opinion about [[Jokebook]], [[White Heritage Security]] and [[Naturism]] listed (now or recently) on [[WB:VFD]]. Can you write here a short comment about each of these three books? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:46, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

: If possible I will have a look at recent changes every day. Times of high workload and holidays wont coun't - so that leaves an avarage of 5 days a week.

: Yes indeed I am interested in the Wikibooks mission and policies. See for example [[Talk:FAQ_for_alt.internet.wireless]].

: Two of the books are delete so I can't read them. Still:
:: [[Jokebook]] : I think it would be akzeptable as an annotated text. But just a collection of jokes is not enough - give more time to develop.
:: [[White Heritage Security]] : sound's like it was a politial soapbox - delete.
:: [[Naturism]] : In theory there could be a textbook on [[Naturism]] but from the discussion I feel the book failed the aim - delete.

I have no further quistions. Discussion at [[WB:RFA]] has been just opened, good luck! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:17, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

== Learning to be an Admin ==

You have to learn a few good habits - like always checking &quot;what links here&quot;. This is subpage of Wikiversity (and should be renamed). You can leave this page - I don't think it harmful. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:18, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

Congrats on Adminship. Use your super-powers wisely. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

== Bookkeeping ==

I saw you deleted bookkeeping. It was said to be transwikied, but have you checked it? The problem is that you deleted text leaving unlinked images. Furthermore, these images were not present at Wikisource. I copied them and deleted from Wikibooks so hopefully everything is fine now, but keep it in mind in the future. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

: I checked Wikisource, the page history and user which requested the delete. I did indeed noticed that the pictures are missing but as the request was made by one (or even the) book author of the book so I expected the author to fix that later.

== Idea for a Program... ==

Hello, I have an idea for a small, simple program that would help many.  Some people like to erase their Google usenet histories, but it is time consuming to look up every message you've ever posted and code in each &lt;Message ID&gt; into their &quot;automatic&quot; removal tool here:

http://services.google.com:8882/urlconsole/controller?cmd=reload&amp;lastcmd=login

Is there anyway to write a program that searches for all messages by your e-mail address, compiles a list of message IDs, then feeds that list into Google's tool?  

I think a lot of people would use this.  What language would you use to code this?

Thanks!

-Ian

== Deleting Templates ==
Should i get old useless/unusable templates deleted or should i just blank them (assuming no good redirect)?  For example [[Template:MapleStoryArmorTOC]] -- [[User:Prod|Prod-You]] 00:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Rueda de Casino ==

You said that the Rueda de Casino book was an orphaned chapter, but it is a book.  It has a number of subpages etc.  The proposed policy on naming conventions doesn't seem to suggest any change to it.  If you do decide to move it, take a look at the templates it uses carefully first, they're probably quite fragile.

== [[:Template:Cleanup-NC]] ==

I don't understand change you made to this template.

: Prehaps I a wrong - but I think that cleanup templates should have a place where one can make a small descriptions of what needs doing. Not all problems are clean cut and easy to spot. In [[Nutrition]] only the reference chapters at the 2nd level are at fault. Looking at the main page and you would never know what's wrong. Just adding the template is not enough to know where the problems lies.

BTW, take a look at [[WB:RFA]], we could use a bot instead of inserting 'rename' templates.

: The authors of the book in question need to decide how to structure there book before we can let the boot loose.
:: Ok, but if we have such bot, book authors would be able to rename books easier. In addition: there are some dead, inactive Wikibooks. Will you wait a year until one of authors visits Wikibooks to rename the book? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:36, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

: Sorry, I forgot to log in. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:30, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Re:  [[Ada Programming/Algorithms/Intro]] ==

I'm sorry about deleting it.  I thought it really was duplicate and abandoned.  I apologize.

BTW, it would be nice to put a note to that effect on the talk page as well if you are planning on using it through transclusion without being a template.  A small thing, but it would prevent another admin from doing the same thing that I did.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== {{tl|delete}} ==

Where I haven't given a reason, the reason is &quot;useless redirect&quot;. Maybe I'll develop a new &lt;nowiki&gt;{{dr}}&lt;/noiki&gt; template that inserts that reason automatically, ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Prolog ==

Could you please check [[Computer_programming#Programming_Languages|the new version]]? [[User:Matusz|Matusz]] 09:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

Well, ummm, maybe the problems are caused by much bigger audience of the wikipedia. It's not that easy to change the way you shape your thoughts. I'm a long time wikipedia user, and only very seldom do I contribute to other subprojects, as you've probably guessed. Anyway - there is a new phrasing and I hope it's not worse than the previous one. --''[[user_talk:matusz|matusz]]'' 22:16, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

==Hit counters==
Is there any way that a Wikibooks hit counter can be used on a sampling basis? I know that Wkibooks hit counters were removed but what I had in mind was including Wikibooks counters in a few chosen places for a week and then removing them so that we can gauge hit rates. This would not put excessive strain on the servers. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:19, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

===Typos===
Do you mind if I correct some typos in your edit of the vote for collaboration of the month.  I would normally just go ahead and correct typos, but these are kind of comments, so I thought is should ask. [[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 12:15, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Bookshelf protection ==

A month ago, you [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=Krischik&amp;page= protected five bookshelves]. I think this does more harm than good, because some users can't add books they've created (contradictory to {{tl|cleanup-link}}) and many users have bookshelves on their watchlist ready to revert user mistakes. Could you please unprotect these bookshelves, or at the very least make the editing approval consistent across all bookshelves. Thanks and regards, [[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 07:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Haskell and types ==

Hello there!  I'm not too sure what we should do about the Haskell and types line.  If you glance at the wikibook, you'd see that nearly half of it is fundamentally about types in one way or another (consider the fun with types section on the bottom part of the advanced side).

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

I've reverted some of them, but most of them need to be moved by a sysop. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]] 07:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Ada Print Version ==

Do you know who the &quot;main guy&quot; is behind the ADA book? Just wondering if there is any major contributor who is helping out and stuff. I'm making a LaTeX version of the ADA book, and I'm changing a couple of things around so that things are better suited for the LaTeX version. If the project is leaderless, that is fine. I'll just '''be bold''' and merge my changes as they come (kind of how I've been doing it so far :-p).

As for specific changes to the print version so far, I'm going to focus on GNAT instead of the other ones. The other sections seem useful in a list, but are too stubby IMO to go into a printed book. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 08:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Ada Programming lounge ==

Hi, I've posted a couple of new topics in the [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge]], maybe you want to contribute. Cheers, &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 17:59, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

== Transclusion ==

Hi Martin. Take a loot at [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Transclusion_of_content_between_books]]. I undid the deletion of the transclusion by [[User:Panic2k4|Panic2k4]] from some of the pages you started. I don't know whether it is better to share the contents or copy the contents: in any case I undid his edits because he deleted them. I wanted to warn you about this discussion so you can participate on it, given that the idea of transclusion among basics on programming languages was yours. --[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 11:02, 20 December 2008 (UTC)

Hi.

My main interest for the moment in Wikibooks is to help a bit with the [[Ada Programming]] book.

For further information see my pages on Wikipedia: [[:w:es:Usuario:ManuelGR|es]], [[:w:User:ManuelGR|en]] and Wikibooks: [[:es:Usuario:ManuelGR|es]].

Thanks to all that have supported my proposal of activating subpages in the Wikibooks main namespace. See [[m:Wikibooks should use subpages]].

==Useful things (at least for me, they are)==
*[[:es:Usuario:ManuelGR/awb.el|awb.el]]: this is an Emacs Lisp module that I use for adding the code and link templates to the [[Ada Programming]] pages.

==Proposals==
* [[/Centralized development status proposal/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is a Noun? ==
A noun is a word that can be used to refer to a person, place, thing, quality, or idea, that is, a part of Speech. It can serve as the subject or object of a verb. For example, a yable (''ein Tisch'', ''eine Tafel'') or a computer (''ein Computer''). What makes nouns in German special is that they must start with a capital letter in the written language.

== Plurals ==
German, unlike English, has more than one way to make nouns plural, and plural form, like gender, must be memorized with every noun. 

There are twelve different ways to form plurals in German. They are formed by affixes at the end of the word, and the umlaut of the vowel of the stem.  They are - (changing nothing); -¨; -e; -¨e; -n; -¨n; -en; -¨en; -er; -¨er; -nen (to feminine suffix ''-in''); -s (mainly with English loan-words); adding &quot;foreign&quot; endings (mainly Latin words); and changing suffixes (mainly Latin words).

When German nouns are used in the plural, their gender becomes irrelevant. The plural can almost be thought of as a gender on its own. In the plural, the definite article is always &quot;die&quot; when using the nominative and accusative cases. 

When using the dative case, &quot;den&quot; is the definite article of all plurals. All plurals not ending in -n or -s affix an ''-n''.

The definite article of the plural in the genitive case is &quot;der&quot;.

'''Examples'''

Nominative:
'''''Die alten Männer'' spielen Schach.''' ''The old men'' are playing chess.

Accusative:
'''Ich sah ''die alten Männer'' beim Schachspielen.''' I saw ''the old men'' as they played chess.

Dative:
'''Ich spielte mit ''den alten Männern'' Schach.''' I played chess with ''the old men''.

Genitive:
'''Das Schachspiel ''der alten Männer'' war nicht sehr spannend.''' ''The old men's'' chess game was not very exciting.

===Suffixes===
Although gender and plural form are often arbitrary, there exist certain suffixes whose gender and plural form are regular.  They are mainly feminine.

'''-ung, -heit, -keit, -schaft, -ion, and -tät'''

These are all feminine endings, which are pluralized by '''-en'''.

*''Diskussion(en)''                                    
:Discussion(s)
*''Universtät(en)''                                    
:University(ies)

'''-unft'''

This ending is feminine and is pluralized by '''changing the stem vowel and adding -e'''

*''Unterkunft''                                       
:Lodging
*''Unterkünfte''                                       
:Lodgings

'''-ik'''

This ending often doesn't have a plural. When it does however, you add '''-en''

*''Technik(en)''                                         
:Technique(s)

'''Other'''

When verb infinitives transform into nouns, they do not have a plural form.

*''das Sprechen''                                        
:Language

Many masculine nouns are formed by verbal stems without a suffix.  Many of these receive an umlaut in their plural form.

== Gender ==
German, like many other languages, gives each noun a gender: Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. Plural nouns also act differently not only with the verb of the sentence, but the article preceding it.

The way any particular word is classified may not be logical. 

Examples:
 das Mädchen       the girl (neuter)
 die Person        the person (feminine - even when talking about a man)

However, not all German Nouns are randomly allocated a gender. The following notes will apply to most nouns but not all.

A note on Mädchen:

This is derived from the diminutive form of Maid (old, rarely used) - Maidchen. Grammatically it is neuter, but when referenced, nowadays the logical feminine gender can takes over: &quot;Das Mädchen und ihr Hund&quot;, instead of &quot;Das Mädchen und sein Hund&quot;.

 Compound nouns have the same gender as the last noun.
Example: die Armbanduhr (wristwatch) (der Arm, das Band, die Uhr)

=== Masculine ===
There are far more masculine nouns than of either of the other genders. The masculine nominative definite article is '''der'''.

====Semantic Groups Which Are Masculine====
 days              z.B. der Montag
 times of the day  z.B. der Morgen
 months            z.B. der August
 seasons           z.B. der Sommer
 compass points: Norden, Osten, Süden, Westen, Nordwesten, ...
 (male) animals      z.B. der Löwe, der Hahn, der Ochse
 alcohol**         z.B. der Wein, der Likör, der Alkohol, der Champagner
 car***            z.B. der Wagen, der Opel, der Mercedes, der BMW

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; However, it is '''das Bier''', '''die Spirituose''' (because of the ending &quot;-ose&quot;), '''das Pils''' (because it is a beer), '''das Methanol''' (because it is a scientific term of a substance)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt; Excepting &quot;das Auto&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

 Nouns meaning a male person are usually masculine. Typical endings for such nouns are '''-er''', '''-iker''', '''-or''', '''-ar''', '''-är''', '''-ent''', '''-ant''', '''-ist''', '''-loge''', '''-graph''', '''-graf''', '''-eur''', '''-arch'''.
*Examples (masculine): Mann, Sohn, Bub, Junge, Bruder, Vater, Enkel, Onkel, König, Lehrer, Mathematiker, Student, Arzt, Professor, Ingenieur, Demonstrant, Kommissar, Tourist, Meteorologe, Fotograf, Biograph, Monarch, Millionär

===Tips For Learning===
As most German articles can not be attributed to certain rule, it is best to always learn the article when learning the noun. You may think of the article as necessary information belonging to every noun. You avoid a lot of looking-up-time that way.

===Looking Up Gender in Dictionaries===
Most dictionaries do not give the article. Instead, you find different sets of abbreviations which tell you to which class the noun in question belongs.

The most common sets of abbreviations are:
 '''r''', '''e''', and '''s'''.
   '''r''': de''r'', masculine; 
   '''e''': di''e'', feminine; 
   '''s''': da''s'', neuter.
 The abbreviations of this type are usually given before the noun.

 '''m.''', '''f.''', and '''n.'''. &lt;br&gt;
   '''m.''': masculine; 
   '''f.''': feminine; 
   '''n.''': neuter. 
 The abbreviations of this type are usually given after the noun.

 '''m.''', '''w.''', and '''s.'''. &lt;br&gt;
   '''m.''': '''m'''ännlich, masculine;
   '''w.''': '''w'''eiblich, feminine; 
   '''s.''': '''s'''ächlich, neuter. 
 The abbreviations of this type are usually given after the noun.

== Basic BIND 8 configuration ==

=== Setting up a caching-only nameserver ===

To speed up the cumbersome process of DNS queries, DNS servers usually cache answers from other DNS servers – even negative queries (i.e an authoritative server's answer « name does not exist » is also cached by your local DNS)

Configuring BIND as a caching-only nameserver involves setting up only a « . » zone, that is, only tell it about the root nameservers and not specifying any zones, as follows :

 zone « . » in {
 type hint;
 file « named.cache »;
 };

The file named.cache can be generated by using dig @a.root-servers.net
 
Logging in BIND is controlled by two main concepts : channels and categories
A channel specifies where logged data goes : to syslog, to a file, etc...
A category specifies what data is logged

Channels allows you to filter messages by priority, like syslog's priorities. They are essentially the same, but two more are available for BIND : debug and dynamic, which affect debug level logging
Debug sets a debug level, which will be active after the first trace command is given via ndc; dynamic  will increment and decrement debug levels after each trace command is given via ndc

Example of logging configuration:

 logging {
 channel my_syslog {
 syslog daemon;
 severity info;
 };
 channel my_file {
 file « log.msgs »;
 severity dynamic;
 };
 category statistics { my_syslog; my_file; };
 category queries { my_file; };
 };

To activate logging, after bind is started, issue a command :

 ndc trace

Key terms, files and utilities :
/etc/named.conf

=== Exercises ===.

== Create and maintain DNS zones ==

DNS zone files are composed mostly by resources records (RR)
Resource records must start in the first column of a line
The order in which they appear is not important, but most people tend to follow the order in the DNS RFCs
SOA (Start Of Authority) : indicates authority for this zone
NS (NameServer) : lists a nameserver for this zone
Other records :

A : name-to-address mapping
PTR : address-to-name mapping
CNAME (canonical name) : aliases
Don't forget to create a zone for 127.0.0 !
Create and maintain DNS zones
Usual zone file format :

 $TTL &lt;ttl value&gt;
 &lt;domain name&gt;. IN SOA &lt;nameserver name&gt;. &lt;user.email&gt;. (
 &lt;serial&gt;;  serial number
 &lt;refresh&gt;; refresh value
 &lt;retry&gt;;  retry value
 &lt;expire&gt;;  expire value
 &lt;n-ttl&gt;;  negative caching TTL of 1 day
 &lt;domain name&gt;.  IN  NS  &lt;authoritative NS name&gt;.
 &lt;domain name&gt;.  IN  NS  &lt;authoritative NS name&gt;.
 ...
 &lt;hostname&gt;.  IN  A  &lt;IP address&gt;
 &lt;hostname&gt;.  IN  A  &lt;IP address&gt;
 ...

Create and maintain DNS zones
For reverse mappings :
$TTL &lt;ttl value&gt;
&lt;reverse net addr&gt;.in-addr.arpa. IN SOA &lt;NS name&gt;. &lt;user.email&gt;. (
&lt;serial&gt;;  serial number
&lt;refresh&gt;; refresh value
&lt;retry&gt;;  retry value
&lt;expire&gt;;  expire value
&lt;n-ttl&gt;;  negative caching TTL of 1 day
&lt;rev net addr&gt;.in-addr.arpa.  IN  NS  &lt;authoritative NS name&gt;.
&lt;rev net addr&gt;.in-addr.arpa.  IN  NS  &lt;authoritative NS name&gt;.
...
&lt;rev IP addr&gt;.in-addr.arpa.  IN  PTR  &lt;fqdn&gt;.
&lt;rev IP addr&gt;.in-addr.arpa.  IN  PTR  &lt;fqdn&gt;.
...

== Securing a DNS server ==

First of all, check security mailing lists and web sites for new versions of BIND. Particularly, versions prior to 8.2.3 are vulnerable to known attacks.

Hide your version number from foreign queries – it could be used to craft a special attack against you. Since BIND 8.2, you may use in named.conf:

 options {
 version « None of your business »;
 };

You can also restrict queries :
Globally :

 options {
 allow-query { address-match-list; };
 };

Or per-zone (which take precedence over global ACLs) :

 zone « test.com » {
 type slave;
 file « db.test »;
 allow-query { 192.168.0.0/24; };
 };

Even more important, make sure only real slave DNS can transfer your zones from your master.
Use the keyword allow-transfer :
Globally (in an « options » statement), applies to all zones
Per-zone
On the slaves, disable zone transfers! Use « allow-transfer { none; }; »

Don't run BIND as root ! Since 8.1.2, there are options to change the user (-u ) and group (-g) under which BIND runs. Use a non-privileged user (i.e create a new one, without shell access). Make sure your zone files have their correct permission (named.conf is read while BIND is still under root's permissions, so don't change this file's permissions)

Also, run bind in a chroot jail. Since 8.1.2, there is option -t to specify the directory for the nameserver to chroot() to. Make sure all the files needed by BIND (i.e log files, etc..) are under the root-jail
If you plan to use ndc with a chroot'ed BIND, don't forget to pass the new pathname to the UNIX socket to ndc !

Here's a little bit on how to setup a chrooted bind9 environment in Debian. As the configuration in bind9 is very similar, the same procedure applies to bind8 for creating a chrooted environment.
* Stop the currently running bind. 
 /etc/init.d/bind9 stop
* In order to chroot bind in a jail, we need to specify what environment in /etc/default/bind9:
 OPTIONS=&quot;-u bind -t /var/lib/named&quot;
* We still want logging in our /var/log/syslog, so we change /etc/default/syslogd that it opens an extra socket to which the chrooted bind can log through into /var/log/syslog.
 SYSLOGD=&quot;-a /var/lib/named/dev/log&quot;
* Run a couple of mkdir's for the environment
 mkdir /var/lib/named
 mkdir -p /var/lib/named/var/run/bind/run
 mkdir /var/lib/named/etc
 mkdir /var/lib/named/dev
 mkdir /var/lib/named/var/cache 
* Move over our existing config
 mv /etc/bind /var/lib/named/etc/bind
* Link it
 ln -s /var/lib/named/etc/bind /etc/bind
* Change ownership in the chrooted var and etc
 chown -R bind:bind /var/lib/named/var/* 
 chown -R bind:bind /var/lib/named/etc/bind
* Create some devices &amp; set permissions
 mknod /var/lib/named/dev/null c 1 3
 mknod /var/lib/named/dev/random c 1 8
 chown 666 /var/lib/named/dev/random /var/lib/named/dev/null
* Restart syslogd &amp; start bind
 /etc/init.d/sysklogd restart
 /etc/init.d/bind9 start

If bind does not start and there are error messages in the syslog, keep in mind that these messages where created from ''inside'' the chrooted domain, hence a permission problem about /var/run/bind/run/named.pid would mean that it is really a problem about /var/lib/named/var/run/bind/run/named.pid

Exercises
* Implementing a proxy server

We will be using the squid web proxy server version 2.4 and Linux kernel version 2.4 .

Proxying can be done in two ways : ''normal proxying'' and ''transparent proxying''
* In ''normal'' proxying, the client specifies the hostname and port number of a proxy in his web browsing software. The browser then makes requests to the proxy, and the proxy forwards them to the origin servers.
* In ''transparent'' proxying, ...

Use transparent proxying if :
You want to force clients on your network to use the proxy, whether they want to or not.
You want clients to use a proxy, but don't want them to know they're being proxied.
You want clients to be proxied, but don't want to go to all the work of updating the settings in hundreds or thousands of web browsers.

There are two types of transparent proxying :

* Squid on the gateway
* Squid on a separate box than the gateway


=== Squid on the gateway box ===

Setting up squid for ordinary proxying  is quite simple : after installing squid, edit the default configuration file squid.conf
Find the following directives, uncomment them, and change them to the appropriate values:
* httpd_accel_host virtual
* httpd_accel_port 80
* httpd_accel_with_proxy on
* httpd_accel_uses_host_header on
Next, look at the cache_effective_user and cache_effective_group directives, and set them up with a dedicated user and group (i.e squid/squid)

Finally, look at the http_access directive. The default is usually ``http_access deny all''. This will prevent anyone from accessing squid. For now, you can change this to ``http_access allow all'', but once it is working, you will probably want to read the directions on ACLs (Access Control Lists), and setup the cache such that only people on your local network (or whatever) can access the cache.


ACLs in squid will enable you to restrict access to the proxy. &lt;br&gt;
The general format for an ACL rule is :&lt;br&gt;
acl aclname acltype string1 ...&lt;br&gt;
ACL rules can then be used in the http_access directive&lt;br&gt;

ACL types are :
* Src : acl aclname src ip-address/netmask
 acl aclname src 172.16.1.0/24
* Dst : acl aclname dst ip-address/netmask
 acl aclname dst 172.16.1.0/24
* Time : acl aclname time [day-abbreviations: M,T,W,H,F,A,S] [h1:m1-h2:m2]&lt;br&gt;
 acl ACLTIME time M 9:00-17:00
* Port : acl aclname port port-no
 acl acceleratedport port 80
* Proto : acl aclname proto protocol
 acl aclname proto HTTP FTP
* Method : acl aclname method method-type
 acl aclname method GET POST
* Maxconn : acl aclname maxconn integer
 acl twoconn maxconn 5


Next, initialize the cache directories with '''squid -z''' (if this is a not a new installation of squid, you should skip this step). 
Next, launch squid via the /etc/init.d/squid script, and you should be able to set your web browser's proxy settings to the IP of the box and port 3128 (unless you changed the default port number) and access squid as a normal proxy. 
Implementing a proxy server
Transparent proxying can be set up in two different ways : on the router or on another (remote) host
Transparent proxying on the router will involve setting up squid in the « normal », and configuring the packet filtering subsystem to redirect clients' connections to squid &lt;br&gt;
The kernel's networking options required are :
* Under 'General Setup' &lt;br&gt;
: Networking support &lt;br&gt;
: Sysctl support
* Under 'Networking Options' &lt;br&gt;
: Network packet filtering &lt;br&gt;
: TCP/IP networking
* Under 'Networking Options' -&gt; IP: Netfilter Configuration &lt;br&gt;
: Connection tracking &lt;br&gt;
: IP tables support &lt;br&gt;
: Full NAT &lt;br&gt;
: REDIRECT target support
* Under 'File Systems' &lt;br&gt;
: /proc filesystem support

You must say NO to '''Fast switching''' under Networking Options !



Once you have your new kernel up and running, make sure you have IP forwarding enabled.
Next, to configure iptables to enable transparent proxying, all you have to do is : &lt;br&gt;
'''iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128''' &lt;br&gt;
'''iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128'''

=== Transparent proxying to a remote box ===

Let's assume we have two boxes called squid-box and iptables-box, and that they are on the network local-network.
First, on the machine that squid will be running on, squid-box, you do not need iptables or any special kernel options on this machine, just squid. You *will*, however, need the 'http_accel' options as described above.
Now, on the machine that iptables will be running on, iptables-box, you will need to configure the kernel as described above, except that you don't need the REDIRECT target support. You will need 2 iptables rules :&lt;br&gt;
'''iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -s ! squid-box -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to squid-box:3128'''&lt;br&gt;
'''iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s local-network -d squid-box -j SNAT --to iptables-box'''&lt;br&gt;
The first one sends the packets to squid-box from iptables-box. The second makes sure that the reply gets sent back through iptables-box, instead of directly to the client. This is very important, because otherwise squid will never receive the answer from the target web server (and thus, no caching can take place!)


Key terms, files and utilities :
* squid.conf
* Acl
* http_access

== DHCP configuration ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure a DHCP server and set default options, create a subnet, and create a dynamically-allocated range. This objective includes adding a static host, setting options for a single host, and adding bootp hosts. Also included is to configure a DHCP relay agent, and reload the DHCP server after making changes.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 dhcpd.conf 
 dhcpd.leases

=== Exercises ===
==== DHCP? ====
Most people reading this will already know the DHCP protocol. Just as a quick reminder.
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and is commonly used to distribute specific network settings in networks. Settings such as the default gateway, nameservers, IP addresses and much more.

As for a small illustration of the protocol itself.

&lt;insert schematic about DHCP Requests here&gt;

==== Configuring dhcpd ====

After the installation of dhcpd the main configuration file can be found at /etc/dhcpd.conf. For Debian installations, one should edit /etc/default/dhcp as soon as the installation is finished and change the following line according to your setup.

 INTERFACES=&quot;eth1&quot; # or &quot;eth1 eth2&quot;, whatever interfaces you wish to serve ip's.

The dhcpd.conf file is divided in global parameters and subnet specific parameters. Each subnet can override the global parameters. The most commonly used parameters are the following.

 option domain-name &quot;example.com&quot;; 
 option domain-name-servers &quot;192.168.0.1, 193.190.63.172&quot;
 option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; # global Subnet mask
 default-lease-time 600; # Seconds each DHCP lease is granted and after which a request for the same ip is launched.
 max-lease-time 7200; # If DHCP server does not respond, keep IP till 7200 seconds are passed.
 
 subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.240 { # Subnet for first 13 devices, 10 of which are servers, 3 printers
  range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.13;  # Range of IP's for our printers
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.240;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.0.15; # This is the subnets broadcast address
  option routers 192.168.0.14; # The gateway of this subnet
  option time-servers 192.168.0.14; # Gateway is running a timeserver
  option ntp-servers 192.168.0.14; # Gateway running a timeserver
 }
 subnet 192.168.0.16 netmask 255.255.255.224 { # Subnet for 29 computers
  range 192.168.0.17 192.168.0.45;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.224;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.0.47;
  option routers 192.168.0.46;
 }
 group {
  host server1 { # the first fixed server for subnet 192.168.0.0/28
   server-name server1;
   hardware ethernet 0f:45:d3:23:11:90;
   fixed-address 192.168.0.1;
  }
  host server2 {
   server-name server2;
   hardware ethernet 0f:45:d3:23:11:91;
   fixed-address 192.168.0.2;
  }
 }

This example is just providing a hint about possible options and overrides.

More info can be found on dhcpd.conf and dhcp-options in man pages. Look in those pages too for information about using the DHCP server to serve BOOTP as well, useful for diskless clients..

== NIS configuration ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure an NIS server and create NIS maps for major configuration files. This objective includes configuring a system as a NIS client, setting up an NIS slave server, and configuring ability to search local files, DNS, NIS, etc. in nsswitch.conf.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 nisupdate, ypbind, ypcat, ypmatch, ypserv, ypswitch, yppasswd, yppoll, yppush, ypwhich, rpcinfo
 nis.conf, nsswitch.conf, ypserv.conf 
 /etc/nis/netgroup
 /etc/nis/nicknames
 /etc/nis/securenets 

=== NIS ===

NIS stands for Network Information Service. Its purpose is to provide information, that has to be known throughout the network, to all machines on the network. Information likely to be distributed by NIS is login names/passwords/home directories (/etc/passwd) and group information (/etc/group)

If, for example, your password entry is recorded in the NIS passwd database, you will be able to login on all machines on the network which have the NIS client programs running.

Within a network there must be at least one machine acting as a NIS server. You can have multiple NIS servers, each serving different NIS &quot;domains&quot; - or you can have cooperating NIS servers, where one is the master NIS server, and all the other are so-called slave NIS servers (for a certain NIS &quot;domain&quot;, that is!) - or you can have a mix of them...

Slave servers only have copies of the NIS databases and receive these copies from the master NIS server whenever changes are made to the master's databases. Depending on the number of machines in your network and the reliability of your network, you might decide to install one or more slave servers. Whenever a NIS server goes down or is too slow in responding to requests, a NIS client connected to that server will try to find one that is up or faster.

NIS databases are in so-called DBM format, derived from ASCII databases. For example, the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group can be directly converted to DBM format using ASCII-to-DBM translation software (&quot;makedbm&quot;, included with the server software). The master NIS server should have both, the ASCII databases and the DBM databases.

Slave servers will be notified of any change to the NIS maps, (via the &quot;yppush&quot; program), and automatically retrieve the necessary changes in order to synchronize their databases. NIS clients do not need to do this since they always talk to the NIS server to read the information stored in it's DBM databases.

To run any of the software mentioned below you will need to run the program /usr/sbin/portmap.
The RPC portmapper (portmap(8)) is a server that converts RPC program numbers into TCP/IP (or UDP/IP) protocol port numbers. It must be running in order to make RPC calls (which is what the NIS/NIS+ client software does) to RPC servers (like a NIS or NIS+ server) on that machine. When an RPC server is started, it will tell portmap what port number it is listening to, and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve. When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it will first contact portmap on the server machine to determine the port number where RPC packets should be sent.

Since RPC servers could be started by inetd(8), portmap should be running before inetd is started.
For secure RPC, the portmapper needs the Time service. Make sure, that the Time service is enabled in /etc/inetd.conf on all hosts:

 # Time service is used for clock synchronization.
 #
 time    stream  tcp     nowait  root    internal
 time    dgram   udp     wait    root    internal

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to restart inetd after changes on its configuration file !

What do you need to set up NIS?

Determine whether you are a Server, Slave or Client :
Your machine is going to be part of a network with existing NIS servers
You do not have any NIS servers in the network yet

In the first case, you only need the client programs (ypbind, ypwhich, ypcat, yppoll, ypmatch). The most important program is ypbind. This program must be running at all times, which means, it should always appear in the list of processes. It is a daemon process and needs to be started from the system's startup file (eg. /etc/init.d/nis, /sbin/init.d/ypclient, /etc/rc.d/init.d/ypbind, /etc/rc.local). As soon as ypbind is running your system has become a NIS client.

In the second case, if you don't have NIS servers, then you will also need a NIS server program (usually called ypserv). Section 9 describes how to set up a NIS server on your Linux machine using the &quot;ypserv&quot; daemon.

=== Setting Up the NIS Client ===

The ypbind daemon 

Newer ypbind versions have a configuration file called /etc/yp.conf. You can hard code a NIS server there - for more info see the manual page for ypbind(8). You also need this file for NYS. An example:

  ypserver 10.10.0.1
  ypserver 10.0.100.8
  ypserver 10.3.1.1

If the system cam resolv the hostnames without NIS, you may use the name, otherwise you have to use the IP address. ypbind 3.3 has a bug and will only use the last entry (ypserver 10.3.1.1 in the example). All other entries are ignored. ypbind-mt handle this correct and uses that one, which answered at first.

It might be a good idea to test ypbind before incorporating it in the startup files. To test ypbind do the following:

Make sure you have your YP-domain name set. If it is not set then issue the command:
/bin/domainname nis.domain

where nis.domain should be some string _NOT_ normally associated with the DNS-domain name of your machine! The reason for this is that it makes it a little harder for external crackers to retrieve the password database from your NIS servers. If you don't know what the NIS domain name is on your network, ask your system/network administrator.

Start up &quot;/usr/sbin/portmap&quot; if it is not already running.
Create the directory &quot;/var/yp&quot; if it does not exist.
Start up &quot;/usr/sbin/ypbind&quot; 

Use the command &quot;rpcinfo -p localhost&quot; to check if ypbind was able to register its service with the portmapper. The output should look like:

       program vers proto   port
        100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
        100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
        100007    2   udp    637  ypbind
        100007    2   tcp    639  ypbind

Or like this (depending on the version of ypbind you are using) :

       program vers proto   port
        100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
        100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
        100007    2   udp    758  ypbind
        100007    1   udp    758  ypbind
        100007    2   tcp    761  ypbind
        100007    1   tcp    761  ypbind

You may also run &quot;rpcinfo -u localhost ypbind&quot;. This command should produce something like:

        program 100007 version 1 ready and waiting
        program 100007 version 2 ready and waiting

The output depends on the ypbind version you have installed. Important is only the &quot;version 2&quot; message.
At this point you should be able to use NIS client programs like ypcat, etc... For example, &quot;ypcat passwd.byname&quot; will give you the entire NIS password database.

IMPORTANT: If you skipped the test procedure then make sure you have set the domain name, and created the directory /var/yp. This directory MUST exist for ypbind to start up successfully.
To check if the domainname is set correct, use the /bin/ypdomainname from yp-tools 2.2. It uses the yp_get_default_domain() function which is more restrict. It doesn't allow for example the &quot;(none)&quot; domainname, which is the default under Linux and makes a lot of problems.

If the test worked you may now want to change your startupd files so that ypbind will be started at boot time and your system will act as a NIS client. Make sure that the domainname will be set before you start ypbind.
Well, that's it. Reboot the machine and watch the boot messages to see if ypbind is actually started.
For host lookups you must set (or add) &quot;nis&quot; to the lookup order line in your /etc/host.conf file. Please read the manpage &quot;resolv+.8&quot; for more details.
Add the following line to /etc/passwd on your NIS clients:

 +::::::

You can also use the + and - characters to include/exclude or change users. If you want to exclude the user guest just add -guest to your /etc/passwd file. You want to use a different shell (e.g. ksh) for the user &quot;linux&quot;? No problem, just add &quot;+linux::::::/bin/ksh&quot; (without the quotes) to your /etc/passwd. Fields that you don't want to change have to be left empty. You could also use Netgroups for user control.

For example, to allow login-access only to miquels, dth and ed, and all members of the sysadmin netgroup, but to have the account data of all other users available use:

      +miquels:::::::
      +ed:::::::
      +dth:::::::
      +@sysadmins:::::::
      -ftp
      +:*::::::/etc/NoShell

Note that in Linux you can also override the password field, as we did in this example. We also remove the login &quot;ftp&quot;, so it isn't known any longer, and anonymous ftp will not work.
The netgroup would look like :

sysadmins (-,software,) (-,kukuk,)

=== The nsswitch.conf File ===

The Network Services switch file /etc/nsswitch.conf determines the order of lookups performed when a certain piece of information is requested, just like the /etc/host.conf file which determines the way host lookups are performed. For example, the line :

    hosts: files nis dns

specifies that host lookup functions should first look in the local /etc/hosts file, followed by a NIS lookup and finally through the domain name service (/etc/resolv.conf and named), at which point if no match is found an error is returned. This file must be readable for every user! You can find more information in the man-page nsswitch.5 or nsswitch.conf.5.

A good /etc/nsswitch.conf file for NIS is:

 # /etc/nsswitch.conf
 passwd:     compat
 group:      compat

 # For libc5, you must use shadow: files nis
 shadow:     compat
 passwd_compat: nis
 group_compat: nis
 shadow_compat: nis
 hosts:      nis files dns
 services:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 networks:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 protocols:  nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 rpc:        nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 ethers:     nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 netmasks:   nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 netgroup:   nis
 bootparams: nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 publickey:  nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
 automount:  files
 aliases:    nis [NOTFOUND=return] files

=== Setting up a NIS Server ===

The Server Program ypserv

If you run your server as master, determine what files you require to be available via NIS and then add or remove the appropriate entries to the &quot;all&quot; rule in /var/yp/Makefile. You always should look at the Makefile and edit the Options at the beginning of the file.

There was one big change between ypserv 1.1 and ypserv 1.2. Since version 1.2, the file handles are cached. This means you have to call makedbm always with the -c option if you create new maps. Make sure, you are using the new /var/yp/Makefile from ypserv 1.2 or later, or add the -c flag to makedbm in the Makefile. If you don't do that, ypserv will continue to use the old maps, and not the updated one.

Now edit /var/yp/securenets and /etc/ypserv.conf. For more information, read the ypserv(8) and ypserv.conf(5) manual pages.

Make sure the portmapper (portmap(8)) is running, and start the server ypserv. The command « rpcinfo -u localhost ypserv » should output something like :

    program 100004 version 1 ready and waiting
    program 100004 version 2 ready and waiting

The &quot;version 1&quot; line could be missing, depending on the ypserv version and configuration you are using. It is only necessary if you have old SunOS 4.x clients.

Now generate the NIS (YP) database. On the master, run :

    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

On a slave make sure that ypwhich -m works. This means, that your slave must be configured as NIS client before you could run « /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s masterhost » to install the host as NIS slave. That's it, your server is up and running.

If you have bigger problems, you could start ypserv and ypbind in debug mode on different xterms. The debug output should show you what goes wrong.

If you need to update a map, run make in the /var/yp directory on the NIS master. This will update a map if the source file is newer, and push the files to the slave servers. Please don't use ypinit for updating a map.
You might want to edit root's crontab *on the slave* server and add the following lines:

      20 *    * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_1perhour
      40 6    * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_1perday
      55 6,18 * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_2perday

This will ensure that most NIS maps are kept up-to-date, even if an update is missed because the slave was down at the time the update was done on the master.

You can add a slave at every time later. At first, make sure that the new slave server has permissions to contact the NIS master. Then run :

    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s masterhost

on the new slave. On the master server, add the new slave server name to /var/yp/ypservers and run make in /var/yp to update the map.

=== The Program rpc.ypxfrd  ===

rpc.ypxfrd is used for speed up the transfer of very large NIS maps from a NIS master to NIS slave servers. If a NIS slave server receives a message that there is a new map, it will start ypxfr for transfering the new map. ypxfr will read the contents of a map from the master server using the yp_all() function. This process can take several minutes when there are very large maps which have to store by the database library.

The rpc.ypxfrd server speeds up the transfer process by allowing NIS slave servers to simply copy the master server's map files rather than building their own from scratch. rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer protocol, so that there is no need for building a new map.

rpc.ypxfrd can be started by inetd. But since it starts very slow, it should be started with ypserv. You need to start rpc.ypxfrd only on the NIS master server.

=== The Program rpc.yppasswdd  ===

Whenever users change their passwords, the NIS password database and probably other NIS databases, which depend on the NIS password database, should be updated. The program &quot;rpc.yppasswdd&quot; is a server that handles password changes and makes sure that the NIS information will be updated accordingly. rpc.yppasswdd is now integrated in ypserv. You don't need the older, separate yppasswd-0.9.tar.gz or yppasswd-0.10.tar.gz, and you shouldn't use them any longer. The rpc.yppasswdd in ypserv 1.3.2 has full shadow support. yppasswd is now part of yp-tools-2.2.tar.gz.

You need to start rpc.yppasswdd only on the NIS master server. By default, users are not allowed to change their full name or the login shell. You can allow this with the -e chfn or -e chsh option.
If your passwd and shadow files are not in another directory then /etc, you need to add the -D option. For example, if you have put all source files in /etc/yp and wish to allow the user to change his shell, you need to start rpc.yppasswdd with the following parameters:

   rpc.yppasswdd -D /etc/yp -e chsh
or
   rpc.yppasswdd -s /etc/yp/shadow -p /etc/yp/passwd -e chsh

There is nothing more to do. You just need to make sure, that rpc.yppasswdd uses the same files as /var/yp/Makefile. Errors will be logged using syslog.

If everything is fine (as it should be), you should be able to verify your installation with a few simple commands. Assuming, for example, your passwd file is being supplied by NIS, the command :

    % ypcat passwd

should give you the contents of your NIS passwd file. The command :

    % ypmatch userid passwd

(where userid is the login name of an arbitrary user) should give you the user's entry in the NIS passwd file. The &quot;ypcat&quot; and &quot;ypmatch&quot; programs should be included with your distribution of traditional NIS or NYS.
Once you have NIS correctly configured on the server and client, you do need to be sure that the configuration will survive a reboot. On RedHat, create or modify the variable NISDOMAIN in the file /etc/sysconfig/network.

== PAM authentication == test

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a flexible mechanism for authenticating users. 
Since the beginnings of UNIX, authenticating a user has been accomplished via the user entering a password and the system checking if the entered password corresponds to the encrypted official password that is stored in /etc/passwd . The idea being that the user *is* really that user if and only if they can correctly enter their secret password. 
That was in the beginning. Since then, a number of new ways of authenticating users have become popular. Including more complicated replacements for the /etc/passwd file, and hardware devices Smart cards etc.. The problem is that each time a new authentication scheme is developed, it requires all the necessary programs (login, ftpd etc...) to be rewritten to support it. 
PAM provides a way to develop programs that are independent of authentication scheme. These programs need &quot;authentication modules&quot; to be attatched to them at run-time in order to work. Which authentication module is to be attatched is dependent upon the local system setup and is at the discretion of the local system administrator. 
PAM authentication
Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users. 
In other words, without (rewriting and) recompiling a PAM-aware application, it is possible to switch between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses. Indeed, one may entirely upgrade the local authentication system without touching the applications themselves. 
Historically an application that has required a given user to be authenticated, has had to be compiled to use a specific authentication mechanism. For example, in the case of traditional UN*X systems, the identity of the user is verified by the user entering a correct password. This password, after being prefixed by a two character ``salt'', is encrypted (with crypt(3)). The user is then authenticated if this encrypted password is identical to the second field of the user's entry in the system password database (the /etc/passwd file). On such systems, most if not all forms of privileges are granted based on this single authentication scheme. Privilege comes in the form of a personal user-identifier (uid) and membership of various groups. Services and applications are available based on the personal and group identity of the user. Traditionally, group membership has been assigned based on entries in the /etc/group file. 
PAM authentication
Unfortunately, increases in the speed of computers and the widespread introduction of network based computing, have made once secure authentication mechanisms, such as this, vulnerable to attack. In the light of such realities, new methods of authentication are continuously being developed. 
It is the purpose of the Linux-PAM project to separate the development of privilege granting software from the development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes. This is accomplished by providing a library of functions that an application may use to request that a user be authenticated. This PAM library is configured locally with a system file, /etc/pam.conf (or a series of configuration files located in /etc/pam.d/) to authenticate a user request via the locally available authentication modules. The modules themselves will usually be located in the directory /lib/security and take the form of dynamically loadable object files (see dlopen(3)). 
PAM authentication
Overview
For the uninitiated, we begin by considering an example. We take an application that grants some service to users; login is one such program. Login does two things, it first establishes that the requesting user is whom they claim to be and second provides them with the requested service: in the case of login the service is a command shell (bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.) running with the identity of the user. 
Traditionally, the former step is achieved by the login application prompting the user for a password and then verifying that it agrees with that located on the system; hence verifying that as far as the system is concerned the user is who they claim to be. This is the task that is delegated to Linux-PAM. 
From the perspective of the application programmer (in this case the person that wrote the login application), Linux-PAM takes care of this authentication task -- verifying the identity of the user. 
PAM authentication
The flexibility of Linux-PAM is that you, the system administrator, have the freedom to stipulate which authentication scheme is to be used. You have the freedom to set the scheme for any/all PAM-aware applications on your Linux system. That is, you can authenticate from anything as naive as simple trust (pam_permit) to something as paranoid as a combination of a retinal scan, a voice print and a one-time password! 
To illustrate the flexibility you face, consider the following situation: a system administrator (parent) wishes to improve the mathematical ability of her users (children). She can configure their favorite ``Shoot 'em up game'' (PAM-aware of course) to authenticate them with a request for the product of a couple of random numbers less than 12. It is clear that if the game is any good they will soon learn their multiplication tables. As they mature, the authentication can be upgraded to include (long) division! 
PAM authentication
Linux-PAM deals with four separate types of (management) task. These are: authentication management; account management; session management; and password management. The association of the preferred management scheme with the behavior of an application is made with entries in the relevant Linux-PAM configuration file. The management functions are performed by modules specified in the configuration file.
The Linux-PAM library consults the contents of the PAM configuration file and loads the modules that are appropriate for an application. These modules fall into one of four management groups and are stacked in the order they appear in the configuration file. These modules, when called by Linux-PAM, perform the various authentication tasks for the application. Textual information, required from/or offered to the user, can be exchanged through the use of the application-supplied conversation function.
PAM authentication
Linux-PAM is designed to provide the system administrator with a great deal of flexibility in configuring the privilege granting applications of their system. The local configuration of those aspects of system security controlled by Linux-PAM is contained in one of two places: either the single system file, /etc/pam.conf; or the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
Linux-PAM specific tokens in this file are case insensitive. The module paths, however, are case sensitive since they indicate a file's name and reflect the case dependence of typical Linux file-systems. The case-sensitivity of the arguments to any given module is defined for each module in turn. 
In addition to the lines described below, there are two special characters provided for the convenience of the system administrator: comments are preceded by a `#' and extend to the next end-of-line; also, module specification lines may be extended with a `\' escaped newline. 
A general configuration line of the /etc/pam.conf file has the following form: :
service-name   module-type   control-flag   module-path   args
PAM authentication
Below, we explain the meaning of each of these tokens. The second (and more recently adopted) way of configuring Linux-PAM is via the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. Once we have explained the meaning of the above tokens, we will describe this method.



Service-name
The name of the service associated with this entry. Frequently the service name is the conventional name of the given application. For example, `ftpd', `rlogind' and `su', etc. . 
There is a special service-name, reserved for defining a default authentication mechanism. It has the name `OTHER' and may be specified in either lower or upper case characters. Note, when there is a module specified for a named service, the `OTHER' entries are ignored. 

PAM authentication
Module-type
One of (currently) four types of module. The four types are as follows: 

auth; this module type provides two aspects of authenticating the user. Firstly, it establishes that the user is who they claim to be, by instructing the application to prompt the user for a password or other means of identification. Secondly, the module can grant group membership (independently of the /etc/groups file discussed above) or other privileges through its credential granting properties.

account; this module performs non-authentication based account management. It is typically used to restrict/permit access to a service based on the time of day, currently available system resources (maximum number of users) or perhaps the location of the applicant user---`root' login only on the console.

session; primarily, this module is associated with doing things that need to be done for the user before/after they can be given service. Such things include the logging of information concerning the opening/closing of some data exchange with a user, mounting directories, etc. .

password; this last module type is required for updating the authentication token associated with the user. Typically, there is one module for each `challenge/response' based authentication (auth) module-type.
PAM authentication
Control-flag
The control-flag is used to indicate how the PAM library will react to the success or failure of the module it is associated with. Since modules can be stacked (modules of the same type execute in series, one after another), the control-flags determine the relative importance of each module. The application is not made aware of the individual success or failure of modules listed in the `/etc/pam.conf' file. Instead, it receives a summary success or fail response from the Linux-PAM library. The order of execution of these modules is that of the entries in the /etc/pam.conf file; earlier entries are executed before later ones. As of Linux-PAM v0.60, this control-flag can be defined with one of two syntaxes. 
The simpler (and historical) syntax for the control-flag is a single keyword defined to indicate the severity of concern associated with the success or failure of a specific module. There are four such keywords: required, requisite, sufficient and optional. 
PAM authentication
Control-flag
The Linux-PAM library interprets these keywords in the following manner: 
required; this indicates that the success of the module is required for the module-type facility to succeed. Failure of this module will not be apparent to the user until all of the remaining modules (of the same module-type) have been executed.

requisite; like required, however, in the case that such a module returns a failure, control is directly returned to the application. The return value is that associated with the first required or requisite module to fail. Note, this flag can be used to protect against the possibility of a user getting the opportunity to enter a password over an unsafe medium. It is conceivable that such behavior might inform an attacker of valid accounts on a system. This possibility should be weighed against the not insignificant concerns of exposing a sensitive password in a hostile environment.

sufficient; the success of this module is deemed `sufficient' to satisfy the Linux-PAM library that this module-type has succeeded in its purpose. In the event that no previous required module has failed, no more `stacked' modules of this type are invoked. (Note, in this case subsequent required modules are not invoked.). A failure of this module is not deemed as fatal to satisfying the application that this module-type has succeeded.

Optional; as its name suggests, this control-flag marks the module as not being critical to the success or failure of the user's application for service. In general, Linux-PAM ignores such a module when determining if the module stack will succeed or fail. However, in the absence of any definite successes or failures of previous or subsequent stacked modules this module will determine the nature of the response to the application. One example of this latter case, is when the other modules return something like PAM_IGNORE.
PAM authentication
Control-flag :
The more elaborate (newer) syntax is much more specific and gives the administrator a great deal of control over how the user is authenticated. This form of the control flag is delimeted with square brackets and consists of a series of value=action tokens: 
    [value1=action1 value2=action2 ...]
Here, valueI is one of the following return values: success; open_err; symbol_err; service_err; system_err; buf_err; perm_denied; auth_err; cred_insufficient; authinfo_unavail; user_unknown; maxtries; new_authtok_reqd; acct_expired; session_err; cred_unavail; cred_expired; cred_err; no_module_data; conv_err; authtok_err; authtok_recover_err; authtok_lock_busy; authtok_disable_aging; try_again; ignore; abort; authtok_expired; module_unknown; bad_item; and default. The last of these (default) can be used to set the action for those return values that are not explicitly defined. 
The actionI can be a positive integer or one of the following tokens: ignore; ok; done; bad; die; and reset. A positive integer, J, when specified as the action, can be used to indicate that the next J modules of the current module-type will be skipped. In this way, the administrator can develop a moderately sophisticated stack of modules with a number of different paths of execution. Which path is taken can be determined by the reactions of individual modules. 
PAM authentication

ignore - when used with a stack of modules, the module's return status will not contribute to the return code the application obtains.

bad - this action indicates that the return code should be thought of as indicative of the module failing. If this module is the first in the stack to fail, its status value will be used for that of the whole stack.

die - equivalent to bad with the side effect of terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning to the application.

ok - this tells PAM that the administrator thinks this return code should contribute directly to the return code of the full stack of modules. In other words, if the former state of the stack would lead to a return of PAM_SUCCESS, the module's return code will override this value. Note, if the former state of the stack holds some value that is indicative of a modules failure, this 'ok' value will not be used to override that value.

done - equivalent to ok with the side effect of terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning to the application.

reset - clear all memory of the state of the module stack and start again with the next stacked module.
PAM authentication
Each of the four keywords: required; requisite; sufficient; and optional, have an equivalent expression in terms of the [...] syntax. They are as follows: 

required is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad]

requisite is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=die]

sufficient is equivalent to [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore]

optional is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok default=ignore]

Just to get a feel for the power of this new syntax, here is a taste of what you can do with it. With Linux-PAM-0.63, the notion of client plug-in agents was introduced. This is something that makes it possible for PAM to support machine-machine authentication using the transport protocol inherent to the client/server application. With the ``[ ... value=action ... ]'' control syntax, it is possible for an application to be configured to support binary prompts with compliant clients, but to gracefully fall over into an alternative authentication mode for older, legacy, applications. 
PAM authentication
 Module-path
The path-name of the dynamically loadable object file; the pluggable module itself. If the first character of the module path is `/', it is assumed to be a complete path. If this is not the case, the given module path is appended to the default module path: /lib/security

Args
The args are a list of tokens that are passed to the module when it is invoked. Much like arguments to a typical Linux shell command. Generally, valid arguments are optional and are specific to any given module. Invalid arguments are ignored by a module, however, when encountering an invalid argument, the module is required to write an error to syslog(3). For a list of generic options see the next section. 

Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is not formatted correctly, will generally tend (erring on the side of caution) to make the authentication process fail. A corresponding error is written to the system log files with a call to syslog(3). 
PAM authentication
Directory based configuration 
More flexible than the single configuration file, as of version 0.56, it is possible to configure libpam via the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. In this case the directory is filled with files each of which has a filename equal to a service-name (in lower-case): it is the personal configuration file for the named service. 
Linux-PAM can be compiled in one of two modes. The preferred mode uses either /etc/pam.d/ or /etc/pam.conf configuration but not both. That is to say, if there is a /etc/pam.d/ directory then libpam only uses the files contained in this directory. However, in the absence of the /etc/pam.d/ directory the /etc/pam.conf file is used (this is likely to be the mode your preferred distribution uses). The other mode is to use both /etc/pam.d/ and /etc/pam.conf in sequence. In this mode, entries in /etc/pam.d/ override those of /etc/pam.conf. 
The syntax of each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to that of the /etc/pam.conf file and is made up of lines of the following form: 
module-type   control-flag   module-path   arguments
The only difference being that the service-name is not present. The service-name is of course the name of the given configuration file. For example, /etc/pam.d/login contains the configuration for the login service.
PAM authentication
This method of configuration has a number of advantages over the single file approach. We list them here to assist the reader in deciding which scheme to adopt: 
A lower chance of misconfiguring an application. There is one less field to mis-type when editing the configuration files by hand.
Easier to maintain. One application may be reconfigured without risk of interfering with other applications on the system.
It is possible to symbolically link different services configuration files to a single file. This makes it easier to keep the system policy for access consistent across different applications. (It should be noted, to conserve space, it is equally possible to hard link a number of configuration files. However, care should be taken when administering this arrangement as editing a hard linked file is likely to break the link.)
A potential for quicker configuration file parsing. Only the relevant entries are parsed when a service gets bound to its modules.
It is possible to limit read access to individual Linux-PAM configuration files using the file protections of the filesystem.
Package management becomes simpler. Every time a new application is installed, it can be accompanied by an /etc/pam.d/xxxxxx file.
PAM authentication
The following are optional arguments which are likely to be understood by any module. Arguments (including these) are in general optional. 
Debug : Use the syslog(3) call to log debugging information to the system log files. 
 no_warn : Instruct module to not give warning messages to the application. 
 use_first_pass : The module should not prompt the user for a password. Instead, it should obtain the previously typed password (from the preceding auth module), and use that. If that doesn't work, then the user will not be authenticated. (This option is intended for auth and password modules only). 
 try_first_pass : The module should attempt authentication with the previously typed password (from the preceding auth module). If that doesn't work, then the user is prompted for a password. (This option is intended for auth modules only). 
 use_mapped_pass : This argument is not currently supported by any of the modules in the Linux-PAM distribution because of possible consequences associated with U.S. encryption exporting restrictions. Within the U.S., module developers are, of course, free to implement it (as are developers in other countries).
expose_account : In general the leakage of some information about user accounts is not a secure policy for modules to adopt. Sometimes information such as users names or home directories, or preferred shell, can be used to attack a user's account. In some circumstances, however, this sort of information is not deemed a threat: displaying a user's full name when asking them for a password in a secured environment could also be called being 'friendly'. The expose_account argument is a standard module argument to encourage a module to be less discrete about account information as it is deemed appropriate by the local administrator. 
PAM authentication
Example configuration file entries 
Default policy : If a system is to be considered secure, it had better have a reasonably secure `OTHER' entry. The following is a paranoid setting (which is not a bad place to start!): 
#
# default; deny access
#
OTHER   auth     required       pam_deny.so
OTHER   account  required       pam_deny.so
OTHER   password required       pam_deny.so
OTHER   session  required       pam_deny.so

Whilst fundamentally a secure default, this is not very sympathetic to a misconfigured system. For example, such a system is vulnerable to locking everyone out should the rest of the file become badly written.
The module pam_deny is not very sophisticated. For example, it logs no information when it is invoked so unless the users of a system contact the administrator when failing to execute a service application, the administrator may go for a long while in ignorance of the fact that his system is misconfigured. 
PAM authentication
The addition of the following line before those in the above example would provide a suitable warning to the administrator. 
#
# default; wake up! This application is not configured
#
OTHER   auth     required       pam_warn.so
OTHER   password required       pam_warn.so

Having two ``OTHER auth'' lines is an example of stacking.
On a system that uses the /etc/pam.d/ configuration, the corresponding default setup would be achieved with the following file: 
#
# default configuration: /etc/pam.d/other
#
auth     required       pam_warn.so
auth     required       pam_deny.so
account  required       pam_deny.so
password required       pam_warn.so
password required       pam_deny.so
session  required       pam_deny.so
PAM authentication
On a less sensitive computer, one on which the system administrator wishes to remain ignorant of much of the power of Linux-PAM, the following selection of lines (in /etc/pam.conf) is likely to mimic the historically familiar Linux setup. 

#
# default; standard UN*X access
#
OTHER   auth     required       pam_unix.so
OTHER   account  required       pam_unix.so
OTHER   password required       pam_unix.so
OTHER   session  required       pam_unix.so

== Configuring a router ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure ipchains and iptables to perform IP masquerading, and state the significance of Network Address Translation and Private Network Addresses in protecting a network. This objective includes configuring port redirection, listing filtering rules, and writing rules that accept or block datagrams based upon source or destination protocol, port and address. Also included is saving and reloading filtering configurations, using settings in /proc/sys/net/ipv4 to respond to DOS attacks, using /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to turn IP forwarding on and off, and usingtools such as PortSentry to block port scans and vulnerability probes.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 /proc/sys/net/ipv4 
 /etc/services 
 ipchains 
 iptables
 routed

=== Configuring a router ===

There are numerous steps you should take to configure a router connected to insecure networks like the Internet
First of all, identify what services you need, and have a policy of blocking everything else ! This minimize your exposure to security breaches.

Common steps for routers are :

Log all dropped/rejected packets (and limit the rate at which you log, to avoid logfiles size explosion)
Use NAT whenever you can – unroutable addresses are more difficult to hack
Define a default policy for TCP/UDP block ports answers: drop/reject/reset ?

Dropping isn't really helpful, scanners nowadays detect it easily. Rejecting may still show that a firewall is blocking access, resetting acts as if nothing is listening (i.e the « normal » way)

Unless you know you need it, drop (and log + limit) all ICMP packets except the most useful : dest-unreachable, time-exceeded and echo-reply

Protect against known attacks, i.e : anti-spoofing of IP addresses, disable source_route packets, disable icmp_redirect, log « martians » IP addresses (i.e addresses which appear on an interface they don't belong to), disable syn_cookies, disable ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification), disable TCP timestamps, ICMP broadcasts and ICMP bogus errors

=== Exercises ===
.

== Securing FTP servers ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure an anonymous download FTP server. This objective includes configuring an FTP server to allow anonymous uploads, listing additional precautions to be taken if anonymous uploads are permitted, configuring guest users and groups with chroot jail, and configuring ftpaccess to deny access to named users or groups.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 ftpaccess, ftpusers, ftpgroups 
 /etc/passwd 
 chroot

Securing an FTP server will include :

* FTP Warning Banner customization
* FTP Greeting Banner customization
* Securing, denying and restricting User Accounts
* Securing Anonymous Access
* Securing Anonymous Upload

=== FTP protocol ===

The File Transport Protocol (FTP) is an older TCP protocol designed to transfer files over a network. Because all transactions with the server, including user authentication, are unencrypted, it is considered an insecure protocol and should be carefully configured.

=== wu-ftpd FTP server ===

We will focus on the wu-ftpd FTP server from Washington University

Wu-ftpd's main configuration files are in /etc : ftpusers,ftpaccess and ftpconversions
the ftpusers file contains a list of all those users who are not allowed to log into your FTP server. As you can imagine, user root should be listed here. You should also make sure that other special user accounts such as lp, shutdown, mail, etc. are included here.

the ftpaccess file is used to configure issues such as security, user definitions, etc. It's actually the general configuration file. Some interesting settings that you can establish here are:
loginfails [number]

     where number is a number that stands for the amount of times that a user is allowed to fail to authenticate before being totally disabled.
shutdown [filename]

     where filename is the name of a file that, if it exists, automatically shuts down the FTP server without a need to actually close the port in the /etc/inetd.conf file and then restarting inetd.
Finally, the ftpconversions file is used to allow the clients special &quot;on-the-fly&quot; conversions of files, i.e automatic decompression of files on download

=== FTP Warning Banner ===

Returning a customized banner to FTP clients when they connect is a good idea, as it helps disguise what system the FTP server is running on. ou can send banners to incoming connections either using TCP wrappers, or as described below.

Add the following line to its configuration file, /etc/ftpaccess :
banner /etc/banners/warning.msg

The contents of the banner file should look something like this :
Hello, all activity on ftp.example.com is logged.

=== FTP Greeting Banner  ===

After login, all users are presented with a greeting banner. By default, this banner includes version information useful to crackers trying to identify weaknesses in a system..
To change the greeting banner for wu-ftpd, add the following directive to /etc/ftpusers:
greeting text &lt;insert_greeting_here&gt;
Securing FTP servers

Because FTP passes unencrypted usernames and passwords over insecure networks for authentication, it is a good idea to deny system users access to the server from their user accounts.
To disable user accounts in wu-ftpd, add the following directive to /etc/ftpusers: deny-uid *
To disable specific user accounts in wu-ftpd, add the username to /etc/ftpusers

=== Anonymous Access ===

The best way to setup anonymous FTP is by configuring a chroot jail : instead of allowing total access to the system, this will limit access to a given directory. In other words, after an anonymous user logs into the system  she will only have access to the user ftp's home directory and nothing else. If she enters cd /, which in most other cases should take her to the system's root directory, it will only take her to /home/ftp most likely (it's the default home directory for the user ftp).

Most distributions like RedHat provide an anonymous ftp package, to help prepare the chroot jail
It's important to give to your strictly FTP users no real shell account on the Linux system. In this manner, if for any reasons someone could successfully get out of the FTP chrooted environment (see below for definition), it would not have the possibility of executing any user tasks since it doesn't have a bash shell. First, create new users for this purpose. This has to be separate from a regular user account with unlimited access because of how the chroot environment works. Chroot makes it appear from the user's perspective as if the level of the file system you've placed them in is the top level of the file system.

Setup these new users with a shell as /dev/null, and add /dev/null in the list of allowed shells, /etc/shells. Make sure also that in /etc/passwd, their home dir is listed as /home/./ftp (for user ftp), even though the real dir is /home/ftp

Setup a chroot user environment : what you're essentially doing is creating a skeleton root file system with enough components necessary, binaries, password files, etc. to allow Unix to do a chroot when the user logs in. Note that wu-ftpd may be compiled with the --enable-ls option, in which case the /home/ftp/bin, and /home/ftp/lib directories are not required since this new option allows Wu-ftpd to use its own ls function. We still continue to demonstrate the old method for people that prefer to copy /bin/ls to the chroot'd FTP directory, /home/ftp/bin and create the appropriated library related tools. The following are the necessary steps to run Wu-ftpd software in a chroot jail: first create all the necessary chrooted environment directories: 

 [root@deep ] /# mkdir /home/ftp/dev
 [root@deep ] /# mkdir /home/ftp/etc
 [root@deep ] /# mkdir /home/ftp/bin
 [root@deep ] /# mkdir /home/ftp/lib

Change the new directories permission to 0511 for security reasons: The chmod command will make our chrooted dev, etc, bin, and lib directories readable and executable by the super-user root and executable by the user-group and all users :

 [root@deep ] /# chmod 0511 /home/ftp/dev/
 [root@deep ] /# chmod 0511 /home/ftp/etc/
 [root@deep ] /# chmod 0511 /home/ftp/bin
 [root@deep ] /# chmod 0511 /home/ftp/lib

Copy the /bin/ls binary to /home/ftp/bin directory and change the permission of the ls program to 0111. You don't want users to be able to modify the binaries:

 [root@deep ] /# cp /bin/ls /home/ftp/bin
 [root@deep ] /# chmod 0111 /bin/ls /home/ftp/bin/ls

Find the shared library dependencies of the ls Linux binary program: :

 [root@deep ] /# ldd /bin/ls
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00125000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =7gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00110000)
          
Copy the shared libraries identified above to your new lib directory under /home/ftp directory:

 [root@deep ] /# cp /lib/libc.so.6 /home/ftp/lib/
 [root@deep ] /# cp /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /home/ftp/lib/ 

Create your /home/ftp/dev/null file:

 [root@deep ] /# mknod /home/ftp/dev/null c 1 3
 [root@deep ] /# chmod 666 /home/ftp/dev/null

Copy the group and passwd files in /home/ftp/etc directory. This should not be the same as your real ones. For this reason, we'll remove all non FTP users except for the super-user root in both of these files, passwd and group. 

Edit the passwd file, vi /home/ftp/etc/passwd and delete all entries except for the super-user root and your allowed FTP users. It is very important that the passwd file in the chroot environment has entries like:

 root:x:0:0:root:/:/dev/null
 ftpadmin:x:502:502::/ftpadmin/:/dev/null

(notice two things here: first, the home directory for all users inside this modified passwd file are now changed to reflect the new chrooted FTP directory i.e. /home/ftp/./ftpadmin/ begins /ftpadmin/, and also, the name of the user's login shell for the root account has been changed to /dev/null)
Edit the group file, vi /home/ftp/etc/group and delete all entries except for the super-user root and all your allowed FTP users. The group file should correspond to your normal group file:

 root:x:0:root
 ftpadmin:x:502:              

Now we must set passwd, and group files in the chroot jail directory immutable for better security.

 [root@deep ] /# cd /home/ftp/etc/
 [root@deep ] /# chattr +i passwd

Set the immutable bit on group file:

 [root@deep ] /# cd /home/ftp/etc/
 [root@deep ] /# chattr +i group

Configure your /etc/pam.d/ftp file to use pam authentication by creating the /etc/pam.d/ftp file and add the following lines:

 #%PAM-1.0
 auth    required /lib/security/pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny \ file=/etc/ftpusers onerr=succeed
 auth    required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
 auth    required /lib/security/pam_shells.so
 account required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
 session required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so

=== Anonymous Upload ===

If you want to allow anonymous users to upload, it is recommended you create a write-only directory within /var/ftp/pub/.
To do this type:

 mkdir /var/ftp/pub/upload

Next change the permissions so that anonymous users cannot see what is within the directory by typing:

 chmod 744 /var/ftp/pub/upload

A long format listing of the directory should look like this:

 drwxr--r--    2 root     ftp          4096 Aug 20 18:26 upload

=== Exercises ===.

== Secure Shell (OpenSSH) ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure sshd to allow or deny root logins, enable or disable X forwarding. This objective includes generating server keys, generating a user's public/private key pair, adding a public key to a user's authorized_keys file, and configuring ssh-agent for all users. Candidates should also be able to configure port forwarding to tunnel an application protocol over ssh, configure ssh to support the ssh protocol versions 1 and 2, disable non-root logins during system maintenance, configure trusted clients for ssh logins without a password, and make multiple connections from multiple hosts to guard against loss of connection to remote host following configuration changes.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 ssh, sshd
 /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
 ~/.ssh/identity.pub, ~/.ssh/identity
 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
 .shosts, .rhosts

=== OpenSSH ===

OpenSSH is a free, open source implementation of the SSH (Secure SHell) protocols. It replaces telnet, ftp, rlogin, rsh, and rcp with secure, encrypted network connectivity tools. OpenSSH supports versions 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0 of the SSH protocol.

If you use OpenSSH tools, you are enhancing the security of your machine. All communications using OpenSSH tools, including passwords, are encrypted. Telnet and ftp use plaintext passwords and send all information unencrypted. The information can be intercepted, the passwords can be retrieved, and then your system can be compromised by an unauthorized person logging in to your system using one of the intercepted passwords. The OpenSSH set of utilities should be used whenever possible to avoid these security problems.
Another reason to use OpenSSH is that it automatically forwards the DISPLAY variable to the client machine. In other words, if you are running the X Window System on your local machine, and you log in to a remote machine using the ssh command, when you execute a program on the remote machine that requires X, it will be displayed on your local machine. This is convenient if you prefer graphical system administration tools but do not always have physical access to your server. 

The ssh command is a secure replacement for the rlogin, rsh, and telnet commands. It allows you to log in to and execute commands on a remote machine.

Logging in to a remote machine with ssh is similar to using telnet. To log in to a remote machine named penguin.example.net, type the following command at a shell prompt:
ssh penguin.example.net

The first time you ssh to a remote machine, you will see a message similar to the following:
The authenticity of host 'penguin.example.net' can't be established.

 DSA key fingerprint is 94:68:3a:3a:bc:f3:9a:9b:01:5d:b3:07:38:e2:11:0c.
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
 Type yes to continue. This will add the server to your list of known hosts as seen in the following message:
 Warning: Permanently added 'penguin.example.net' (DSA) to the list of known hosts.

Next, you'll see a prompt asking for your password for the remote machine. After entering your password, you will be at a shell prompt for the remote machine. If you use ssh without any command line options, the username that you are logged in as on the local client machine is passed to the remote machine. If you want to specify a different username, use the following command:

 ssh -l username penguin.example.net

You can also use the syntax ssh username@penguin.example.net.
The ssh command can be used to execute a command on the remote machine without logging in to a shell prompt. The syntax is ssh hostname command. For example, if you want to execute the command ls /usr/share/doc on the remote machine penguin.example.net, type the following command at a shell prompt:

 ssh penguin.example.net ls /usr/share/doc

After you enter the correct password, the contents of /usr/share/doc will be displayed, and you will return to your shell prompt. 

The scp command can be used to transfer files between machines over a secure, encrypted connection. It is similar to rcp.

The general syntax to transfer a local file to a remote system is scp localfile user@hostname:/newfilename. The localfile specifies the source, and the group of user@hostname:/newfilename specifies the destination.
To transfer the local file shadowman to your account on penguin.example.net, type the following at a shell prompt (replace user with your username):

 scp shadowman user@penguin.example.net:/home/user

This will transfer the local file shadowman to /home/user/shadowman on penguin.example.net.
The general syntax to transfer a remote file to the local system is scp user@hostname:/remotefile /newlocalfile. The remotefile specifies the source, and newlocalfile specifies the destination.

Multiple files can be specified as the source files. For example, to transfer the contents of the directory /downloads to an existing directory called uploads on the remote machine penguin.example.net, type the following at a shell prompt:

scp /downloads/* username@penguin.example.net:/uploads/

The sftp utility can be used to open a secure, interactive FTP session. It is similar to ftp  except that it uses a secure, encrypted connection. The general syntax is sftp username@hostname.com. Once authenticated, you can use a set of commands similar to using FTP. Refer to the sftp manual page for a list of these commands. To read the manual page, execute the command man sftp  at a shell prompt. The sftp utility is only available in OpenSSH version 2.5.0p1 and higher. 

=== Generating Key Pairs ===

If you do not want to enter your password every time you ssh, scp, or sftp to a remote machine, you can generate an authorization key pair.

Note: Separate Authorization Key Pairs
You must have separate authorization key pairs for SSH Protocol 1 (RSA) and SSH Protocol 2 (DSA).

Warning : Each User Needs Their Own Key Pair !
 
Keys must be generated for each user. To generate keys for a user, follow the following steps as the user who wants to connect to remote machines. If you complete the following steps as root, only root will be able to use the keys. 

Use the following steps to generate a DSA key pair. DSA is used by SSH Protocol 2 and is the default for Red Hat.
1. To generate a DSA key pair to work with version 2.0 of the protocol, type the following command at a shell prompt:

 ssh-keygen -t dsa

Accept the default file location of ~/.ssh/id_dsa. Enter a passphrase different from your account password and confirm it by entering it again.

(A passphrase is a string of words and characters used to authenticate a user. Passphrases differ from passwords in that you can use spaces or tabs in the passphrase. Passphrases are generally longer than passwords because they are usually phrases instead of just a word.)

2. Change the permissions of your .ssh directory using the command chmod 755 ~/.ssh.

3. Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the machine to which you want to connect. If the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 doesn't exist, you can copy the file ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the other machine.

Use the following steps to generate a RSA key pair for version 2.0 of the SSH protocol.

1. To generate a RSA key pair to work with version 2.0 of the protocol, type the following command at a shell prompt:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Accept the default file location of ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Enter a passphrase different from your account password and confirm it by entering it again. [1]

2. Change the permissions of your .ssh directory using the command chmod 755 ~/.ssh.

3. Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the machine to which you want to connect. If the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 doesn't exist, you can copy the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the other machine.

Use the following steps to generate an RSA key pair, which is used by version 1 of the SSH Protocol.

1. To generate an RSA (for version 1.3 and 1.5 protocol) key pair, type the following command at a shell prompt:

ssh-keygen

Accept the default file location (~/.ssh/identity). Enter a passphrase different from your account password. Confirm the passphrase by entering it again.

2. Change the permissions of your .ssh directory and your keys with the commands chmod 755 ~/.ssh and chmod 644 ~/.ssh/identity.pub.

3. Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/identity.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the machine to which you wish to connect. If the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys doesn't exist, you can copy the file ~/.ssh/identity.pub to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine. 

=== Exercises ===.

== TCP_wrappers ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure tcpwrappers to allow connections to specified servers from only certain hosts or subnets.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 inetd.conf, tcpd 
 hosts.allow, hosts.deny 
 xinetd

=== TCP_wrappers ===

The TCP wrapper is a system to control access to network services
For each service protected by TCP wrappers, the tcpd program is used  and consults 2 files where access rights are defined, in search order :

 /etc/hosts.deny: if a rule here is met, access is denied
 /etc/hosts.allow: if a rule here is met, access is allowed

Rules are constructed to match all services or specific services. If no match occurs in the two files, access is granted.

It is common to set specific rules in /etc/hosts.allow, and provide a blanket denial in /etc/hosts.deny (i.e deny everything except when specifically allowed)
Rules format are :

 [list of services] : [list of hosts]

i.e : deny all incoming requests except FTP from  the local domain

 /etc/hosts.allow :
 ftp : LOCAL

 /etc/hosts.deny :
 ALL : ALL

=== Exercises ===.

== Security tasks ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to install and configure kerberos and perform basic security auditing of source code. This objective includes arranging to receive security alerts from Bugtraq, CERT, CIAC or other sources, being able to test for open mail relays and anonymous FTP servers, installing and configuring an intrusion detection system such as snort or Tripwire. Candidates should also be able to update the IDS configuration as new vulnerabilities are discovered and apply security patches and bugfixes.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 Tripwire 
 nessus
 netsaint
 snort
 telnet 
 nmap

=== Security tasks ===

Task: Install and Configure Kerberos

Installing:

Configuration files:

Kerberos Reference:

Use atelnet client to test/debug your servers
This implies you know a little about the protocol used : read the corresponding RFCs
Check security mailing lists such as Bugtraq, CERT, et al. regularly 
Patch your systems ASAP !

Run a security scanner on your system  regularly
Network security scanners Nessus and Netsaint are widely used, highly considered and open-source
Bastille Linux is a great host-based security scanner
Use some Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), both network- and hosts-based
Tripwire
Snort

Don't forget : security is a never-ending process, not a state or a product !

      <text xml:space="preserve">RAIL TRAVEL
'''Buying a train ticket'''

A young traveller goes up to the ticket office in a Railway Station in England:

*Traveller:  &quot;A ticket to Coventry, please.&quot;
*Clerk:        &quot;Is that a single or a return?&quot;
*Traveller: &quot;A return, please. &quot;
*Clerk:       &quot;That's five pounds seventy then.&quot;
*(The traveller hands over a ten pound note.)
*The Ticket Clerk takes the money and gives out a two part ticket along with some coins.
*Clerk:       &quot;Four pounds thirty is your change. Platform 3, you'd better hurry.&quot;
*Traveller:  &quot;Thanks&quot;

The young traveller checks his change and hurries off as the Ticket Clerk serves the next passenger.

(Note that the exchange tends to be hurried and clipped. Flowery, extended sentences aren't needed, just the required information, a little courtesy, and a check of the coins and the tickets. Mistakes do happen, especially if you are in a hurry.)

A quick check now can save problems later:

The traveller rushes back to the ticket office, and tries to speak to the same Ticket Clerk:

*Traveller: &quot;Sorry, these tickets say Daventry not Coventry&quot;
*Clerk: &quot;You said Daventry, sir.&quot;
*Traveller: &quot;I'm sure I did not. I wanted a ticket to Coventry.&quot;
*Clerk: &quot;Let's have a look then.&quot;
*(The Clerk takes the tickets back and examines the two pieces of the ticket.)
*Clerk: &quot;OK. Return to Coventry, same fare.&quot;
*(The Clerk prints out two new parts to the ticket.)
*Clerk: &quot;Here you go. Coventry, return.&quot;
*(The Clerk passes the new ticket back to the Traveller.)
*Traveller: &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;

The traveller hurries off again with the correct tickets, just in time to board the train to Coventry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to ask the same question (or be asked):
*&quot;Is this the train to Liverpool?&quot;
*&quot;Is this the train for Liverpool?&quot;
*&quot;Does this train go to Liverpool?&quot;
*&quot;This the Liverpool train?&quot; (notice that the &quot;is&quot; can be left out in general speech)
*&quot;Going to Liverpool?&quot; 
*&quot;Liverpool train?&quot;
*&quot;Liverpool?&quot; (although this can be confusing, meaning many things in just one word.)

(Note that some of these sentences are technically incorrect, but are acceptable in general speech. When writing English, outside of character dialogue or quotation, be specific and grammatically correct.)

*'''Glossary'''
**Luggage - Bags carried by a passenger. Can be suitcases, backpacks, boxes or any bag.
**Lost Luggage - An office where items that passengers have forgotten are taken.
**Fare  - The cost of the ticket. 
**Ticket - The token given to a passenger to allow them to travel, showing the cost and destination etc.
**Guard - on British trains, a train company worker checking tickets and keeping passengers safe.
**Change - The money returned to somebody who paid with more than the cost of the transaction.
**Train  -  A group of carriages rolling along rails, carrying passengers or freight.
**Passenger -   A person, usually not counting the driver, riding in a vehicle.
**Return - A type of ticket allowing ''there and back'' travel.
**Single - A type of ticket allowing one way travel, that is just to ''there''.
**Destination - another word for the place the train passenger is going to.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd initially thought this page will have short examples for quick reference of syntax as this page was supposed to be a continuation of [[Programming:C plus plus Reference Tables]] which is already a bit large. Specific examples like the &lt;tt&gt;Temperature&lt;/tt&gt; class should probably go into the main text (i.e. the portion of the textbook not including appendices like reference tables, glossary, FAQ). But until we get chapters on constructors, it could be retained here. With this hindsight, probably even the long explanation on why prevention of copying might be necessary, and other such things that I wrote should also go to the main text.

BTW We could have separate pages for each section in the reference tables page, and probably have a page transcluding all those pages. Also some of the bloat in those tables could also be transferred to the main text.

Note that I am still under the assumption that we'd have a textbook spanning multiple modules. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:47, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== About pImpl example ==

Somehow I think using templates it would be more efficient to implement the pImpl example, although you wouldn't be able to use different implementations at run-time, you'd still get the same result with no need for memory management (new &amp; delete). Changed to something like this...

 template &lt;typename l_BookImpl&gt;
 class Book
 {
 public:
   void print();
 private:
   l_BookImpl m_p;
 }
 
 void Book::print()
 {
   m_p.print();
 }

The only difference here is the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;BookImpl&gt; book&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Book book&lt;/code&gt; (and the lack of new in ctor and the implied delete in dtor), the latter of which also would require something to pass another implementation in order to actually benefit from the pointer usage, which the example lacks completely.

BTW i'm in an arguing mood. 

&quot;For all those who're confused with the fact that a hacker merely enjoys exploiting the weakeness of any security system..&quot;
Really?! I'll be damned.. so white hats aren't excited they can keep their job by finding a weakness and improving on it? MAYBE... you should work on your English? OMG I found a security flaw in your writing. Pwned.

Why is this wikibook called Koibhi?--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 04:40, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== (empty header) ==

鼠 says: Pssh.. Hacking is hacking. I don't understand where people get off defining hackers by white hat and black hat. White hats should just be called Digital Defenders and black hats hackers. Hacking is hacking whichever way you look at it. Hacking does not equal protecting. It means breaking into a security system within an illegal manner.
I don't hack into things, I just find flaws in systems and use them to my advantage. It's not hacking, it's just using what they forgot to cover up. By the way, you spelled text,organizing, and many other things wrong.

I think I have to strongly agree with you there. Hacking is hacking, there is no point implying they should categorised them into some kind of a 'how bad is a hacker' barometer. The real issue how can others protect their security from hackers, that's the real issue! Of course, being aware of the tactics used by hackers, how they operate and deploy their tricks would be an advantage to anyone. For that being certified as a ethical hacker is important. But wait. What would happen if ethical hackers suddenly confounded black hat hackers, where consequently some kind of a 'team ethical hackers world police' version? I suppose one other major key issue would be to enable users to be aware of flaws in their systems. Perhaps this is why some hackers argue they are not hacking they just acute enough to pick up flaws to their advantage. The issue of raising awareness in this subject matter has always been something strongly advocated by Firebrand Training, formerly known as the Training Camp. Thank you for your points[[User:Tbarbosa|Tbarbosa]] ([[User talk:Tbarbosa|talk]]) 14:50, 19 November 2010 (UTC)

:Orignal Creator says: 'Ahem. If you find this book interesting, please edit what you want to be better. Yet I (the first author, who created it) would find it very pleasing not to delete whole sections of tekst without noting so. At least help orginising the book, it'll be a compensation for the deleted stuff. Many thanks for helping (in advance).'

There is a qaulification called certified ethical hacker if it helps [http://www.firebrandtraining.co.uk/courses/ec_council/ceh/hacking.asp this is a link to a course that leads to it].

== Hacker...nothing to do with breaking a security system ==

For all those who're confused with the fact that a hacker merely enjoys exploiting the weakeness of any security system..you're absolutely wrong..a hacker is just a guru of some field. Well, in the case of computers, a hacker, knows the ins and outs of any computer system. its operating system, how it connects over the network, the method deployed in transfering files over various protocols, etc. etc. and so can in a way, play tricks on those who dont know the details of the former to their advantage. Obviously, with great powers, come great responsibility ;) - i know i know..spiderman..so when a person is gifted with such knowledge, the better way to exploit a loophole in a system, is to inform the party and tell them a fix. Sadly, not everyone is responsible , and some use it to gain money. Some use it to create havoc. We call em hackers..or script kiddies. 
In essence a hacker, is a respected member of a community. check out this link.
http://catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html This will give you an idea of what a hacker is ..and how to become one..if you are really competent to be one.. I now advice not to further argue over who or what or whether its moral to be a hacker, and provide technical information on computing, and..hacking in a general way.

I will add a couple of articles i've bin working on soon. In the meanwhile..those who are interested in reading good stuff...then try this
http://www.insecure.org

:Thanks for helping out anyway you can. Be constructive and I think, even if hacking is hacking by using a forgotten flaw, you should be considered a grey hat for doing that. Anyways, thanks for correcting my problems. Though, do not that I prefer en-UK over en-US. So, maybe that's the issue. Anyways, I'll be waiting up just about any constructive edit. May the souce be with you (Tux?).[[xy]] 19:07, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

The grammar is just terrible:

From: &quot;A perspective view on hackers&quot;

&quot;Don't skip this part if you want to obtain an objective view on hacking. First of all, the definition of hackers is redefined, since a lot of commercial put it in a rather commercial perspective (so to say). Then, their history is covered. This 21 century hold many 'miracles', so hacking should be casted in the world of technology if people were to understand them. Yet the hacking-culture is covered in a seperate chapter. This is due the not-so simple way in which hackers tend to work. Finally, ethics, shared by most hackers are covered so that you know what hackers stand up for.&quot;


I mean, Jesus Christ!  Not only is there the horrendous grammar, there's the advocacy of the item being described... it just needs to be thrown out.

== [[Reverse Engineering]] merge (redirect) ==

I think we should probably move this page into a book with a little bit more form and function. Also, the way this &quot;book&quot; stands now, it is more likely to be deleted then it is to be expanded. If we merge this page into a more respectable book, we won't need to worry about this thing being deleted. We can discuss the issue here. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:56, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

I '''agree''', I vote that this page be merged. - brmwk 2/10/06

I also '''agree''', this would work better with some heavier editing and a merge into the larger Reverse Engineering work.  [[User:GrahamBignell|Lorax]] 01:13, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

I strongly '''disagree''', the reverse engineering book is focused on a specific area knowledge, this book should be retained as a more general overview.  There are many topics that would be overlooked by a merger with reverse engineering, and reverse engineering would suffer from too many segways.   Links would be more appropriate.
:I understand the disagreement, but I just want everybody to keep in mind that this kin of book, especially if it focuses on illegal activites, could very easily be deleted as per wikibooks policy. Wikibooks administrators (myself included) have already deleted other books that were flagrantly illegal. I just want to present some options for this book to legitimize itself, so that it doesnt fall on the chopping block later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:18, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

Disagree (or at least I '''disagree with this redirect''') - I just clicked on 'Computer Hacking' and it took me to 'Reverse Engineering'. That doesn't make any sense. You can't just redirect two unrelated topics, just because the development of the book was not going very well. If some content from the Computer Hacking book was rescued to the [[Reverse Engineering]] book, then we should make a page saying so, and saying that the rest of the book has been deleted because it was rubbish. -- (just visitor to wikibooks) 10:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== Unite ==

I am pretty new to wikipedia (just joined today 29/1/06!). And I think this is a wonderful site with a great mission. Imagine: 'free' access to 'any' type of knowledge within 5 years or so. But we must unite and stop condemning the grammar or any other idea! If you know something about hacking I think you can always edit or contribute in someway. It's easy to comment than to take responsibility. Together we can make this book a great resource. So, let's Unite!

== Collaborate ==
Grammer is essential to coherent communication.  This is why computer languages have structures that must be followed for the parser and compiler to be able to do anything

== Seems very jumbled and hard to read ==

Since this book has not seemed to be touched in some time I am being somewhat agressive with it.  I find this very hard to read in these huge paragraphs, with referances to graphics that are not even there.  Seems this was pasted right out of another document.  My intention is to seperate this into an introduction and a &quot;Structure of Bone&quot; section.  I think it will read much more smoothly.

== DONT PANIC ==

Foound much of this page to hard to follow so I cut a good deal of the Figure explainations out of the page.  I am certain that some of it will be reintroduced but a good portion of it was in referance to figures that were not even present in the book.  If this information is indeed from Grey's of 1918 it is certainly out of date.</text>

*5 ⅓ oz (150 g) granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tablespoons [[cookbook:starch syrup|starch syrup]], for shining
*a dash [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Procedure ===
#Wash the beans well.
#In a large sauce pan, put the beans and fill the 14 oz/400 ml water or the amount filled over the beans. Bring to a [[cookbook:boiling|boil]] over high heat. Drain the water. Do this step two more times to get rid of harshness.
#Fill up with water again and cook over low heat after boiling for 30-40 minutes. Add more water if the beans come out from the water. Remove any scum.
#If the bean can be crushed easily by fingers, it is done; if not, cook more. Shut off the heat and steam for 10 minutes with cover.
#Drain the beans and liquid. Do NOT throw the liquid away. Set the beans aside. Place back only the liquid, and add sugar and salt in it. Heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Shut the heat.
#Transfer the beans to the pan. Let it stay until sweet taste infiltrates to the beans for 30 minutes.
#Over low heat, boil away until it becomes thick enough to be able to form it into a ball by hand. Be careful not to get burned.
#Let it cool before filling.

== Dough ==
=== Ingredients ===
(Enough for 16 buns)

*1¼ oz package active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (2¼ teaspoons)
*1 teaspoon granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 cup lukewarm water (40-45°C)
*3 cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (reserve 1 tablespoon if mixing by hand)

=== Procedure ===

#In small bowl, sprinkle yeast and sugar evenly over the lukewarm water; stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand 10 minutes or until foamy.
#In large bowl or in food processor, combine flour and yeast mixture and mix well, or process 1 minute. If mixing by hand, sprinkle work surface with the reserved 1 tablespoon flour; turn dough out onto work surface and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
#Spray large bowl with non-stick cooking spray; place dough in bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let rise until dough triples in volume, about 3 hours. Punch down and wrap in plastic until ready to use. Will keep 3 days in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer.

Before 2010, there were only 4 levels of the JLPT, and the test agency released official vocabulary and grammar lists.  One level was split in two, forming the current N2 and N3 levels.  Since then, the test agency has not released vocabulary or grammar lists for either of these levels.  As such, the N2 and N3 lists here are formed using things test takers remember and general estimates as to the difficulty of the material, and should not be considered entirely comprehensive.  The N5, N4, and N1 material should be rather representative.

Some websites have not been updated to reflect the 2010 level changes to the JLPT.  If a site only talks about levels 4 through 1, it is referring to the old test levels.  See [[w:Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] for details.

----
== '''Traim''' as a verb ==
'''Traim''' (alternate spellings: '''traiim''', '''traeim''') is a [[Tok Pisin:Verbs|Tok pisin verb]] basically meaning ''to try''. 

Here are some examples of its use: 

'''Sampela man i kisim ol prut na &lt;u&gt;traim planim&lt;/u&gt; klostu long haus bilong ol.''' 
&lt;br&gt;''Some men took the fruits and &lt;u&gt;tried to plant them&lt;/u&gt; next to their houses.'' 
&lt;br&gt;(Masalai bilong Ailan Lep).

'''Planti man bilong Baluan i laik &lt;u&gt;traim long painim&lt;/u&gt; dispela Ailan Lep.''' 
&lt;br&gt;''Many men from Baluan wanted to &lt;u&gt;try to find&lt;/u&gt; this island called Lep.'' 
&lt;br&gt;(Masalai bilong Ailan Lep).

Please note that here, the same author is using '''traim''' once without '''long''', once with '''long'''. 

Other examples: 

'''Ol i bin &lt;u&gt;traim long givim&lt;/u&gt; halivim...''' 
&lt;br&gt;''They tried to bring help...'' 
&lt;br&gt;(Taim bilong toktok, Redio Ostrelia).

'''Ol wok ol i &lt;u&gt;traim bilong mekim&lt;/u&gt; ol gavman i abrusim ... pasin bilong bagarapim rait bilong pipol.''' 
&lt;br&gt;''They tried to make the officials renounce... to their disrespect of people's rights.'' 
&lt;br&gt;(Taim bilong toktok, Redio Ostrelia).

Here, the same speaker is using '''traim''' once with '''long''', once with '''bilong'''.

== '''Traim''' as a noun ==
'''Traim''' can be nominalized. It then becomes a noun meaning: ''a try, a challenge, an ordeal'', and in the Scriptures, ''temptation''. 

Examples: 

'''Mipela i save yupela i painim &lt;u&gt;kainkain traim&lt;/u&gt; long laip bilong yupela''' 
&lt;br&gt;''We know that you meet &lt;u&gt;all kinds of ordeal&lt;/u&gt; in your life.'' 
&lt;br&gt;(Catholic Bishop's Conference of PNG &amp; SI, 2001).

'''Sambai long mipela long taim bilong &lt;u&gt;traim&lt;/u&gt;, na rausim olgeta samting nogut long mipela.''' 
&lt;br&gt;''Protect us when we are in a time of &lt;u&gt;temptation&lt;/u&gt; and take all bad things away from us.'' 
&lt;br&gt;(The Lord's Prayer in Pidgin, litteral translation from Tok Pisin).

Tautologies and Contradictions


== Tautologies ==

A truth table column which consists entirely of T's indicates a situation where the proposition is true no matter whether the individual propositions of which it is composed are true or false.  The most simple example would be (p &amp;or; &amp;not;p).  

&lt;tt&gt;
p &amp;nbsp; &amp;not;p  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(p &amp;or; &amp;not;p)&lt;br&gt;
T &amp;nbsp;   F &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; T &lt;br&gt;
F &amp;nbsp;   T &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; T &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;

''A proposition which is true independently of the truth or falsity of the atomic propositions from which it is composed is known as a '''tautology'''.''


== Contradictions ==

Similarly, ''a proposition which is false independently of the truth or falsity of the atomic propositions from which it is composed is known as a '''contradiction'''.''  The simplest example of this would be (p &amp;and; &amp;not;p).

&lt;tt&gt;
p &amp;nbsp; &amp;not;p  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(p &amp;and; &amp;not;p)&lt;br&gt;
T &amp;nbsp;   F &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; F &lt;br&gt;
F &amp;nbsp;   T &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; F &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;

Perl syntax includes both lists and arrays.

==Lists==

A ''list'' in perl is an ordered set of scalar values.  It is represented in your code as a comma-separated sequence of values, which may or may not be contained in scalar variables.  Lists can be used to make multiple assignments at once, and can be passed as arguments to several built-in and user-defined functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my ($length, $width, $depth) = (10, 20, 15);

print &quot;The values are: &quot;, $length, $width, $depth;
&lt;/source&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''Parentheses are ''not'' required in the construction of a list.  They are used only for precedence.''  
|}

===Alternate List Construction===

When creating a list of several strings that do not include spaces, Perl provides a shortcut to get around typing multiple quotes and commas.  Instead of 
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;($name1, $name2, $name3, $name4) = ('Paul', 'Michael', 'Jessica', 'Megan');&lt;/source&gt;
you can use the &lt;tt&gt;qw//&lt;/tt&gt; operator.  This operator uses any non-alpha-numeric character as a delimiter (typically the / character), and encloses a space-separated sequence of barewords. A delimeter separates the command with the arguments.  The above line is identical to the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;($name1, $name2, $name3, $name4) = qw/Paul Michael Jessica Megan/;&lt;/source&gt;

and both are equal to this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
($name1, $name2, $name3, $name4) = qw(Paul Michael Jessica Megan);
&lt;/source&gt;

The last example uses the open and close parenthesis as a different delimeter. If there is an open and close version of the delimiter you choose, you need to use them both. Otherwise just repeat the same symbol twice. For example, you cannot type &lt;tt&gt;qw&lt;Paul Michael&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; you have to type &lt;tt&gt;qw&lt;Paul Michael&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.

You can also abuse the glob syntax, when the strings do not include shell metacharacters:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
($name1, $name2, $name3, $name4) = &lt;Paul Michael Jessica Megan&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''The resulting strings from the &lt;tt&gt;qw//&lt;/tt&gt; operator are ''single-quoted'', meaning no interpolation happens in the set.  If you need to include a variable in your list, you cannot use this method.''
|}

===List Assignments===

As shown above, lists can be used to make several assignments at once.  If the number of variables on the left is the same as the number of values on the right, all variables are assigned to their corresponding values, as expected.

If there are fewer variables on the left than values on the right, the 'extra' values are simply ignored:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
($length, $width) = (10, $w, 15);  #$length gets 10, $width gets the value of $w.  15 is ignored
&lt;/source&gt;

If there are more variables on the left than values on the right, the 'extra' variables are assigned the default &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt; value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

($length, $width, $depth) = (10, $w); #$length gets 10, $width gets the value of $w.  $depth is undef
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The existence of list assignment creates the ability to 'swap' two variables' values without the need of an intermediary temporary variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
$foo = 10;
 
$bar = 5;
 
($foo, $bar) = ($bar, $foo);  #$foo now equals 5, while $bar equals 10;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arrays==

An array in Perl is a variable which contains a list.  An array can be modified, have elements added and removed, emptied, or reassigned to an entirely different list.  Just as all scalar variables start with the &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; character, all array variables start with the &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; character.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''It is a common and frequent mistake in Perl to use the terms 'list' and 'array' interchangeably.  They do not have the same meaning.  &lt;/br&gt;A decent analogy is that a list (such as &lt;tt&gt;qw/foo bar baz/&lt;/tt&gt;) is to an array (such as &lt;tt&gt;@values&lt;/tt&gt;) as a string (such as &lt;tt&gt;'Paul'&lt;/tt&gt;) is to a scalar variable (such as &lt;tt&gt;$name&lt;/tt&gt;).''
|}

===Array Assignment===

Arrays are assigned lists of values.  The list of values can be arbitrarily large or small (it can even contain 0 elements).

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 @nums = (1,2,3,4,5);
 
 @more = 6..1000; #using the 'range' operator
 
 @none = ();  # empty array.
 
 @names = qw/Paul Michael Jessica Megan/;
 
 @all = (@nums, @more);  #@all contains all integers from 1 to 1000
&lt;/source&gt;

That last example exemplifes a feature of Perl known as 'array flattening'.  When an array is used in a list, it is the array's '''elements''' that populate the list, not the array itself.  As stated above, a list is a set of '''scalar''' values only.  Therefore, the &lt;tt&gt;@all&lt;/tt&gt; array contains 1000 elements, not 2.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''Although this implies you cannot create an 'array of arrays', or 'two-dimensional arrays', such things do exist in Perl.  They are simulated by using [[../References and Data Structures|references]].''
|}

===Arrays in Scalar context===

When an array is used in scalar context - either by assigning a scalar variable to the array's value, or using it in an operation or function that expects a scalar - the array returns its size.  That is, it returns the number of elements it currently contains
&lt;!-- don't use a qw() list for following... behavior of qw() in scalar context changed in perl 5.6, and that would confuse older Perl users --&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 @names = ('Paul','Michael','Jessica','Megan');
 
 $how_many = @names;
  
 print &quot;I have a total of $how_many names\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''A common misconception is that a '''list''' in scalar context will also return its size.  This is untrue.  In fact, there is no such thing as a list in scalar context: using the comma operator in a scalar context does not create a list, instead it evaluates each of its arguments, left to right, and returns the last one:''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;$name = ('Paul','Michael','Jessica','Megan');
 print &quot;The last name in my list is $name\n&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|}

===Printing an Array===

There are two general ways of printing the values of an array.  You can either print the list of items in the array directly, or you can interpolate the array in a double-quoted string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 @names = qw/Paul Michael Jessica Megan/;
 print &quot;My names are: &quot;, @names, &quot;.\n&quot;;
 print &quot;My names are: @names.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first example, the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; function is being given a list of 6 arguments: the string 'My names are: ', each of the four values in &lt;tt&gt;@names&lt;/tt&gt;, and the string &quot;.\n&quot;.  Each argument is printed separated by the value of the &lt;tt&gt;$,&lt;/tt&gt; variable (which defaults to the empty string), resulting in the values from the array being 'squished' together:
 My names are: PaulMichaelJessicaMegan.

In the second example, the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; function is being given exactly one argument: a string that contains an interpolated array.  When Perl interpolates an array, the result is a string consisting of all values in the array separated by the value of the &lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; variable (which defaults to a single space):
 My names are: Paul Michael Jessica Megan.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top| 
|'''Note'''&lt;/br&gt;''Both the &lt;tt&gt;$,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; variables can be changed to any string you like.  For example, to separate the array's items with a comma and a space instead of just a space:''
 &lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;$&quot; = ', ';
 print &quot;My names are: @names.\n&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
 
 My names are: Paul, Michael, Jessica, Megan.

&lt;i&gt;You generally do not want to do that as this may cause problems in other parts of your program depending on the default values of those variables though! A safer way to print your arrays with custom separator will be explained later.&lt;/i&gt;
|}

===Accessing Elements of an Array===

The elements of an array are accessed using a numerical reference within square brackets. Because each item within an array is a scalar value, you need to use $ when referencing a value. The first element of an array is number 0 and all the others count up from there.

A negative number will count down from the right side of the array. This means that -1 references the last element of the array and -3 references the third to last element. Let's see some examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 print $array[0];   # Prints 1
 print $array[3];   # Prints 4
 print $array[-1];  # Prints 5
&lt;/source&gt;

What if you need to know the last index? &lt;code&gt;$#array&lt;code&gt; will return it for you:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 print $array[4];         # Prints 5
 print $array[-1];        # Same as above
 print $array[ $#array ]; # Also prints 5
&lt;/source&gt;

A common mistake is to do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 print @array[0];  # Also prints 1, but for the wrong reasons
&lt;/source&gt;

In fact &lt;code&gt;@array[0]&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;i&gt;slice&lt;/i&gt; (that is, a sub-array of an array) that contains one element, whereas &lt;code&gt;$array[0]&lt;/code&gt; is a scalar which contains the value 1.

===Common Array Functions===

== Command line arguments ==

As you may wonder, Perl scripts support command line arguments.  The entire list of parameters is stored in the array @ARGV, with the first entry containing the first command line argument.  If no command line parameters were passed, @ARGV is an empty array.  

The array functions and operators listed above can easily be used to detect the passed command line arguments and to detect the number of arguments provided.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The '''Standard''' package is implicit. This means two things:

# You do not need to {{Ada/kw|with}} or {{Ada/kw|use}} the package, in fact you cannot &lt;small&gt;(see below)&lt;/small&gt;. It's always available &lt;small&gt;(except where hidden by a homograph, RM {{Ada/RM2|8|3|(8)}})&lt;/small&gt;.
# '''Standard''' may contain constructs which are not quite legal Ada &lt;small&gt;(like the definitions of &lt;tt&gt;Character&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Wide_Character&lt;/tt&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;.

A {{Ada/kw|with}} clause mentioning &lt;tt&gt;Standard&lt;/tt&gt; references a user-defined package &lt;tt&gt;Standard&lt;/tt&gt; that hides the predefined one. So do not do this. However any library unit hidden by a homograph can be made visible again by qualifying its name with &lt;tt&gt;Standard&lt;/tt&gt;, like e.g. &lt;tt&gt;Standard.My_Unit&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Implementation ==

Since the package &lt;tt&gt;Standard&lt;/tt&gt; is very important for portability, here are some examples for various compilers:

* The package [[/RM|Standard]] from [[w:ISO 8652|ISO 8652]].
* The package [[/GNAT|Standard]] from [[w:GNAT|GNAT]].
* The package [[/Apex|Standard]] from [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/developer/ada Rational Apex].
* The package [[/ObjectAda|Standard]] from [http://www.aonix.com/objectada.html ObjectAda]
* The [[/AppletMagic|Standard]] definitions for [http://www.sofcheck.com/products/adamagic.html#appletmagic AppletMagic]

== Portability ==

The only mandatory types in Standard are Boolean, Integer and its subtypes, Float, Character, Wide_Character, Wide_Wide_Character, String, Wide_String, Wide_Wide_String, Duration. There is an implementation permission in RM {{Ada/RM2|A|1|(51)}} that there may be more integer and floating point types and an implementation advice RM {{Ada/RM2|A|1|(52)}} about the names to be chosen. There even is no requirement that those additional types must have different sizes. So it is e.g. legal for an implementation to provide two types Long_Integer and Long_Long_Integer which both have the same range and size.

Note that the ranges and sizes of these types can be different in every platform &lt;small&gt;(except of course for Boolean and [[Wide_]Wide_]Character)&lt;/small&gt;. There is an implementation requirement that the size of type Integer is at least 16 bits, and that of Long_Integer at least 32 bits (if present) RM {{Ada/RM3|3|5|4|(21..22)}}. So if you want full portability of your types, do not use types from Standard &lt;small&gt;(except where you must, see below)&lt;/small&gt;, rather define you own types. A compiler will reject any type declaration whose range it cannot satisfy.

This means e.g. if you need a 64-bit type and find that with your current implementation Standard.Long_Long_Integer is such a type, when porting your program to another implementation, this type may be shorter, but the compiler will not tell you - and your program will most probably crash. However, when you define your own type like

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Integer_64 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -(2**63) .. +(2**63 - 1);

then, when porting to an implementation that cannot satisfy this range, the compiler will reject your program.

The type Integer is mandatory when you use [[wide] wide] strings or exponentiation x**i. This is why some projects even define their own strings, but this means throwing out the child with the bath tub. Using Integer with strings and exponentiation will normally not lead to portability issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Let's start at the very beginning. A very good place to start&quot; - ''[[Wikipedia:The Sound of Music | do-re-mi]]''
==Objective==
Students demonstrate understanding by identifying and giving examples of undefined terms, axioms, theorems, and inductive and deductive reasoning.
==Section 1.1 - Introduction==
&quot;[[Wikipedia:Geometry|Geometry]],&quot; meaning &quot;measuring the earth,&quot; is the branch of math that has to do with spatial relationships. In other words, geometry is a type of math used to measure things that are impossible to measure with devices. For example, no one has been able take a tape measure around the earth, yet we are pretty confident that the circumference of the planet at the equator is [http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970401c.html 40,075.036 kilometres (24,901.473 miles) ]. How do we know that? The first known case of calculating the distance around the earth was done by [[Wikipedia:Eratosthenes | Eratosthenes]] around 240 BCE. What tools do you think current scientists might use to measure the size of planets?  The answer is geometry.

However, geometry is more than measuring the size of objects. If you were to ask someone who had taken geometry in high school what it is that s/he remembers, the answer would most likely be &quot;proofs.&quot; (If you were to ask him/her what it is that s/he liked the least, the answer would probably be &quot;proofs.&quot;) A study of Geometry does not have to include proofs. Proofs are not unique to Geometry. Proofs could have been done in Algebra or delayed until Calculus. The reason that High School Geometry almost always spends a lot of time with proofs is that the first great Geometry textbook, &quot;The Elements,&quot; was written exclusively with proofs.

This textbook is based on Euclidean (or elementary) geometry. &quot;Euclidean&quot; (or &quot;elementary&quot;) refers to a book written over 2,000 years ago called &quot;[[Wikipedia:Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]&quot; by a man named Euclid. In the book, Euclid started with some basic concepts. He built upon those concepts to create more and more concepts. His structure and method influence the way that geometry is taught today. Euclid's book and interpretations of it were used as part of the curriculum of many high schools even until the beginning of the 20th century. Although this textbook is not a re-interpretation of ''The Elements'', it will include more than just facts about geometric objects; the ability to &quot;prove&quot; that a particular answer is correct is part of the course.

==Section 1.2 - Reasoning==
There are two general ways of reaching conclusions: [[Wikipedia:Induction_(philosophy)|inductive reasoning]] and [[Wikipedia:Deductive_reasoning|deductive reasoning]].
===Inductive Reasoning===
Inductive reasoning is what we use most often. Inductive reasoning is reaching a conclusion based on previous observations. For example, if I notice that the sun rises in the east every day, then through inductive reasoning I could conclude that the sun will rise from the east tomorrow. In math, we may notice a pattern from which we draw conclusions. Look at the following pattern:

:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:center;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 1^2 = 1\, &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1 \le 1 &lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 2^2 = 4\, &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;2 \le 4 &lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;3^2 = 9 \, &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;3 \le 9&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(-1)^2 = 1 \, &lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;-1 \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(-2)^2 = 4 \, &lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;-2 \le 4&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Through inductive reasoning, we might conclude that whenever a number is squared, the result is a number which is greater than or equal to the original number. Based on observations, this appears to be true. Inductive logic is not certain, though. Looking at the example above, you may have already surmised that there are some numbers for which our conclusion does not hold:

:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:center;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;20&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} &lt;/math&gt; 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \;&gt; \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

|}

The same can be applied to problems outside of Math. A beginning observer of American [[Wikipedia:Baseball | baseball]] may conclude, after watching several games, that the game is over after 9 innings. He will only realize that this observation is false after observing a game which is tied after 9 innings. Inductive reasoning is useful but not certain. There will always be a chance that there is an observation that will show the reasoning to be false. Only one observation is needed to prove the conclusion to be false. 

----

Much of the reasoning in geometry is like this, consisting of three simple stages (see example A):
;1. Look for commonalities 
:A pattern.
;2. Make a ''conjecture'':
:An unproven statement that you will prove.
;3. Prove/Disprove 
:The conjecture.

===Deductive Reasoning===
Deductive reasoning is reaching a conclusion by combining known truths to create a new truth. 
Unlike inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning is certain, provided that the normal rules of logic are used to conclude such truths. In order to use deductive reasoning there must be a starting point, normally called the axioms or postulates of the theory. For example, an axiom in geometry asserts that given two points there is only one line that contains both points. Observe that while this is an axiom, it can be used to deduce that two different lines intersect in at most one point.

Not only axioms can be used to deduce new truths. Other knowledge deduced from the axioms using the rules of logic can be used to validate new truths. For example, we can conclude that if three points A, B and C are not in the same line then the lines determined by two of them can only meet at A, B and C (since we already know that two lines can only intersect at one point, all that is necessary to prove is that the lines determined by two of the three points are different, and that is immediate since the given points do not belong to any one line).

===Exercises===
&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;All vegetables are good for you.  Broccoli is a vegetable.  Therefore, broccoli is good for you.&lt;/i&gt;  This is an example of what type of reasoning?

&lt;b&gt;2)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Broccoli is a vegetable.  Broccoli is green.  Therefore, all vegetables are green.&lt;/i&gt;  Why is this conclusion invalid?

&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Berries are sweet.  Berries are fruits.  Therefore, all fruits are sweet.&lt;/i&gt;  Why is this conclusion invalid?

&lt;b&gt;4)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;If all of x is positive, and y is part of x, then y is positive.&lt;/i&gt; What type of reasoning is this?


 
    Examples:



 &lt;u&gt; '''''Group A''''' &lt;/u&gt;    
     (D is negative)  
     (B is negative)            
     (E is positive)  
     (C is positive)                  
     (F is positive)

  
   Just because D is negative, and is part of group A, doesn't mean that all of group A is negative.


 &lt;u&gt; '''''Group Z''''' &lt;/u&gt; [ = 5 ]
     (Y is 5)
     (X is 5)
     (W is 5)
     (V is 5)
     (U is 5)


   Since all of group Z equals 5, then you can say that Y=W, W=U, U=X, X=V, and that V=Y, etc.
   Because you know that all of group Z equals the same thing, then you can say, because T = 5, 
   then it is part of group Z

==Section 1.3 - Undefined Terms==
In Geometry, there are three undefined terms: '''points''', '''lines''', and '''planes'''.  Although most terms in geometry are defined based on previously defined terms, it is impossible to define every geometric term this way. The first geometric term cannot be defined based on previously defined terms.

Although we cannot formally define these three terms, we can informally describe them.   We also use these terms to help us write definitions of other terms such as segment or ray. There is no axiom that says that '''lines are drawn straight'''. What this means, is that the definition of line depends on the theory that you are studying, so in Hyperbolic Geometry a line does not look like a line in Euclidean Geometry, since they are defined differently.

In Euclidean Geometry, a '''point''' is thought of as having neither breadth, nor width, nor height. Now imagine taking a very sharp pencil, and making a dot on a piece of paper. Now imagine looking at it under a magnifying glass, the dot would be big, and we would be able to see it has a height and a breadth. A point is not a dot, because a point would have neither height nor breadth, but we can imagine that in the very middle of the dot is a point.

With the non-definitions out of the way, let's look at how these things work.  A point is usually represented by a dot on a piece of paper. A point is useful because it tells us ''exactly'' where something is, and we can then build observations, conjectures, and rules from that information.  For example, we can say that two points determine a line.  What this means is that once you know where two points are, you know where the line that contains both of the points must be.  Notice that if you only know where one point is, there are an infinite number of lines that can contain that one point, and if you know where three points are, there is a pretty good chance that there isn't any single line that would contain all three points.

In Euclidean Geometry, a '''line''' is thought of as having length but neither width, nor height. A line is such that any two points on the line describe the shortest distance between those two points. Lines also carry on forever in both directions. Imagine a piece of string, hold the two ends and pull them tight. The string represents the shortest distance between the two ends. Remember though that a line does not have any width or height. Under a magnifying glass we see the string has width. A tightly drawn string is not a line, because a line would not have a width, but we can imagine a line in the exact middle of the string.

Now usually when we talk about a line in geometry we mean a straight line as described above, but there are other lines in Euclidean geometry, called curves. Curves are not straight. The circumference of a circle is an example of a curve. (We will get to circles later in the syllabus).

Okay, we have talked about lines, now, so how do they behave? We usually represent a line by drawing it on a piece of paper using a ruler to connect the points and extending it past the points. We can take pieces of a line and call them '''line segments''' (more on that later in the book) and we can cross two lines and get both a point (where they intersect) and some '''angles''' (more on those later too).  We can also choose to ignore half of a line by cutting it off at a point and calling what we have left a '''ray''' (again, more later).

A plane has two dimensions: width and length.  Both of these dimensions are infinite, and, because there are only two dimensions, a plane is perfectly flat and infinitely thin, meaning it has no thickness dimension.  Because of this, a plane doesn't really have a top or a bottom because whatever is on the top is also on the bottom.  If you take two planes and make them intersect, you get a line (more on that later) and if you take three points that are not all in the same line, there is only one plane that can contain all three (more on that later too). Planes are useful because a plane can hold all of the two dimensional (flat) shapes that geometry uses.  We usually think of one side of a piece of paper (or a computer screen) as part of a plane.  While this is not exactly correct, like the representations of a point and a line, this is useful.

===Exercises===

==Section 1.4 - Axioms/Postulates==

A postulate or axiom is a statement which is taken to be self-evident, and cannot be proved. They are the starting point from which any system in Mathematics (such as geometry) is built up. The axioms of geometry state properties of points, lines, and planes that are consistent with our intuitive understanding of them. For example, one axiom states that given two points there is a unique line that passes through those two points (a property of incidence between points and lines). In Euclidean geometry, there are five axioms:

#A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.
#Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
#Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as its radius and one endpoint as its center.
#All right angles are [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/congruent congruent].
#Given a line and a point off the line, exactly one new line can be drawn through the point that is parallel to the given line.

From these postulates we can deduce all the theorems of Euclidean geometry.

==Section 1.5 - Theorems==
'''Postulates:'''

1) Between any two points, there exists one and only one line.

2) If two lines intersect, then their intersection is a point.

3) Given any 3 non-collinear points, there is exactly one plane that can be constructed which will include all of them.

4) If two planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.

===Exercises===
1) Draw a point on a piece of paper.  How many lines can you draw through that point?

2) Draw two points on a piece of paper.  How many lines can you draw through both points?

3) Draw three points on a piece of paper.  How many lines can you draw through all three points?  Why?  What undefinable object could connect all three points?  Is there a way to draw the points so that a line goes through all three?

Welcome to the first installment of the hiragana lessons. In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write the Japanese vowels, &quot;あ&quot;, &quot;い&quot;, &quot;う&quot;, &quot;え&quot; and &quot;お&quot;.

{{Japanese kana
| kana = あ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;a&lt;/big&gt; as in alright.
| mnemonic =
It's an apple. First you draw the leaves on the stem, then you draw the stem down into the apple, and then you draw the round fruit.&lt;br /&gt;
The t shape is the person and its being wrapped by a snake saying &quot;aaah'
| example =
* あお (ao) blue
* あか (aka) red
* あき (aki) autumn
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = い
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/big&gt; as in the beginning of irritate or like the first '''e''' in evening. Also called a 'long' e in some English elementary schools.
| mnemonic = Itch - It's a hooked hand reaching to scratch a back. First you draw the hand, then you draw the back.&lt;br /&gt; It also looks like two undotted i's.
| example =
* いぬ (inu) dog
* いもうと (imōto) little sister
* いいえ (īe) no
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = う
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;{{audio|U (Japanese).ogg|u}}&lt;/big&gt; (similar to the '''u''' in truce, but with the lips unrounded; sounds more like a German '''ü''')
| mnemonic = '''U''' - It's the lowercase ''u'' from the Latin alphabet.  Tilt your head to the left, it's a sideways u.
| example = 
* うえ (ue) above
* うさぎ (usagi) rabbit
* うなぎ　(unagi) eel
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = え
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/big&gt; as in envy or egg
| mnemonic = '''equal sign''' the = equal sign has an &quot;h&quot; on it! First draw the equal and then the &quot;h&quot; under it, don't forget a long tail on the h.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a &quot;Z&quot;.  &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; makes EZ (easy).
| example =
* えいご (eigo) English
* えき (eki) station
* えんぴつ (enpitsu) pencil
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = お
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;{{audio|O (Japanese).ogg|o}}&lt;/big&gt; as in open and over.
| mnemonic = '''Oh!''' - It's a shocked face saying &quot;Oh!&quot;.  First draw the eyebrow on the left, then the side of the face and mouth.  Finish with the eyebrow on the right.  Both are raised since he's quite surprised.&lt;br /&gt;
Looks like a golf green with a flag and a golf ball coming in for a &quot;hole&quot; (お) in one.
| example =
* おおきい (ōkī) big
* おちゃ (ocha) tea
* おんな (onna) woman
}}

== The Long Vowel Sound ==
One can extend the vowel sound of a kana by affixing either a あ、い、or う depending on the vowel. The vowel would be extended for one more ''mora'', or beat. In most cases: あ follows あ; い follows い or え; う follows う or お.

There are rare exceptions where an え vowel is extended by adding え or an お vowel is extended by お. Some examples of this include おねえさん (oneesan or onēsan), おおい, and おおきい (ōkii).

One giveaway to an English-speaking accent in Japanese speech is the use of a diphthong for the elongated &quot;e&quot; sound (Such as the sound in &quot;''Ei''ght&quot;). In actuality, &quot;えい&quot; is pronounced correctly by speaking the え sound twice as long as normal.

It is important to make sure you hold the vowel sound long enough because you can be saying &quot;middle-aged lady&quot; （おばさん）(obasan) instead of &quot;grandmother&quot; （おばあさん）(obaasan or obāsan) if you do not stretch it out correctly.

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write か, き, く, け, こ. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound. Thus, adding the {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'' marks will cause か, き, く, け, and こ to produce が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご. 

== Clear Sounds ==
{{Japanese kana
 | kana=か
 | sound= &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ka&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; as in karma, or like the '''ca''' in car.
 | mnemonic=It looks like the head of a '''cock''' (rooster).  The neck and wattle are on the left, and the beak is the stroke on the right.
 | example=
* かいもの (kaimono) shopping
* かばん (kaban) briefcase, suitcase
* かお (kao) face
 | voiced          = が

* がっこう (gakkou) school
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana=き
 | sound=&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ki&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; as in kiwi, or like the word '''key'''.
 | mnemonic= It looks like a key!
 | example=
* きのう (kinou) yesterday

* ぎん (gin) silver
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana=く
 | sound=&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ku&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; as in kudos or haiku, or like the word '''coup'''
 | mnemonic = It's a bird's beak opened wide to make the sound &quot;Coo!&quot; (Ku!)
 | example=
* くるま (kuruma) car
* ください (kudasai) please (do me the favor)
* くも (kumo) cloud
 | voiced          = ぐ

* ぐあい (guai) condition (health, state)
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana=け
 | sound =&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ke&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; as in kettle or as in keg (or between these two sounds)
 | mnemonic = It's a '''ke'''g. &lt;br /&gt; Picture a Spanish missionary facing you, holding up a cross, saying, &quot;¿Que?&quot; (Spanish for &quot;What?&quot;)
 | example=
* けいさつ (keisatsu) police
* けっこん (kekkon) marriage
* けが (kega) injury
 | voiced          = げ
 | voiced_sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ge&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | voiced_mnemonic = 
 | voiced_example  = 
* げきじょう (gekijou) theatre
* げんき (genki) energy, healthy
* げんだい (gendai) modern
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana=こ
 | sound = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ko&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; as in koala or the '''co''' in cola.
 | mnemonic = The second line is a '''co'''py of the first one.&lt;br /&gt;It's the top and bottom of a '''co'''in.&lt;br /&gt;It's a race, with the finish line at the top and the starting line at the bottom (with a flag): ready, set, '''GO'''!
 | example=
* こども (kodomo) child

 | voiced_mnemonic = 
 | voiced_example  = 
* ごご (gogo) afternoon
* ごはん (gohan) meal, rice (cooked)
* ごみ (gomi) trash
}}

An optical fibre is a transparent, thin (~120 micrometres) fibre of glass or plastic used for transmitting light.

==How it is made==
A fibre optic cable has a core and cladding.  The core is the part that the light travels through.  It is made out of plastic or glass.  Glass is always used for long-distance applications due to its low optical absorption.  It is surrounded by material that has a low refractive index.  This is called cladding.  Fibre optic cables will work without cladding, but this offers less protection; Ergo, cladding is always used in real-world situations.  Cladding also ensures that outside light does not get into the cable and interfer with the light transmitted.  In addition, the cladding keeps the value of the critical angle constant throughout the whole length of the fibre, regardless of what it travels through.  This is important, since the cables often have to travel underground.

If the cables travel underground without cladding, then light would escape, since the optical density of the outside environment would be higher than that of the core, and total internal reflection only occurs when the optical density of the first medium is higher than that of the second.

==Total internal reflection==
Fibre optics takes advantage of total internal reflection by having the optical density of the core higher than that of the cladding:

''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = refractive index for plastic = 1.6

''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = refractive index for air = 1.0

''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 60°

''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = angle of refraction

sin ''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=sin ''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

solve for ''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

sin ''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (sin 60°)(1.6) = (0.866)(1.6) = 1.39

''Θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; 1.39 = impossible (there are no angles whose sine is greater than one)


This produces an error, since there is no angle of refraction.  This tells us that total internal reflection has occurred, since there is no refracted ray.

The fact that there is total internal reflection means that light doesn’t escape, since it does not refract outside, but rather keeps on reflecting inside the fibre.  The phenomenon of &lt;b&gt;Total Internal Reflection&lt;/b&gt; (TIR) causes 100% reflection.  This is very useful in this case, since all light will remain inside the fibre.

The light which enters the fibre is a beam.  It consists of many rays behaving in a similar way.  They will keep on crossing each other- thereby filling up the core with light.  A pulse of light traveling through a fibre optic cable is just a bunch of these rays.

There is a limit to how fast pulses of light can be sent through fibre optics.  This is due to pulse spreading.  Since light is dispersed over long distances, the pulses of light will change as they travel along the fibre.  When pulses are sent, it is in a square wave shape.  However, the pulses gradually get wider.

==Pulse spreading==
There are two types of dispersion which cause pulse spreading:  
===Chromatic dispersion===
When different wavelengths of light are sent through the fibre, they will travel at different speeds.  For example, since white light contains all the different wavelengths of light, if white light is shone through a fibre optic cable, chromatic dispersion will occur.  This is due to the fact that the different colours in white light will travel at different speeds.

===Modal dispersion===
If rays are oblique they will take a longer route than others.  The rays traveling parallel to the centre of the fibre reach the end the fastest, and the more oblique rays reach the end last.

Therefore, we can conclude that:

Total dispersion=Chromatic dispersion + Modal dispersion

===Problems caused by pulse spreading===
Pulse spreading causes a few major problems:
#Bandwidth limit: Pulse spreading limits the rate at which bursts of light can be sent, thereby limiting the bandwidth.
#Distance limit: Since light is dispersed more as the fibre optic cable becomes longer, the bandwidth is reduced as the distance is increased.  After a certain distance, the bandwidth becomes unacceptably low.

==Fibre optics in our world==
Modern fibre optics can have up to a thousand fibres in one cable.

Fibre optics have advantages and disadvantages when compared to regular copper wires.
#lower loss
#large data-carrying capacity (thousands of times greater)
#immune to electromagnetic interference
#High electrical resistance (safe to use near high voltage equipment)
#Light weight
#Signals contain very little power
#Faster (speed of light)
#Very hard to tap fibre optic cables without being detected
#Existing wires must be replaced with fibre optics
#Much more difficult to splice.  Requires special training and special tools

Fibre optics today are so advanced that no amplification is required for distances of up to hundreds of kilometers.  However, longer-range systems still must use optical amplifiers.

== What is Smarty? ==
Smarty is a templating engine for PHP. It allows you to separate '''logic''' and '''presentation''' by separating the PHP code from the HTML (or anything else for that matter) presentation.

== Old/custom templating engine example ==
It is just like below: (The code below is a demo of a custom template engine - not Smarty)

There are two files here &amp;quot;mail.html&amp;quot; (we can say this is a template file) and &amp;quot;mail_engine.php&amp;quot; (ya, you are right...it is an engine.)&lt;br&gt;

;&lt;code&gt;mail.html&lt;/code&gt;
 &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My company name is #COMPANY#&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
   Please note our address #ADDRESS1#, #ADDRESS2#, #CITY#-#PIN#.
   Contact us on #PHONE#.
 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Hope you like my mail.
 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Thanking You,
 &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;address&amp;gt; Jaydeep Dave, +919898456445, jaydipdave@yahoo.com &amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;

;&lt;code&gt;mail_engine.php&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;?php
 $contents = file_get_contents(&quot;mail.html&quot;);
 function rtemplate(&amp;$tdata,$vars)
 {
   $nv = array();
   foreach($vars as $key =&gt; $value)
   {
     $kk = &quot;#&quot;.strtoupper($key).&quot;#&quot;;
     $nv[$kk] = $value;
   }
   unset($vars);
   $tdata = strtr($nv,$tdata);
   return true;
 }
 $vars = array(
   &quot;company&quot; =&gt; &quot;Premier Business Softwares&amp;quot&quot;,
   &quot;address1&quot; =&gt; &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,
   &quot;address2&quot; =&gt; &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,
   &quot;city&quot;=&gt;&quot;bHAVNAGAR&quot;,
   &quot;pin&quot;=&gt;&quot;364001&quot;,
   &quot;phone&quot;=&gt;&quot;+919898456445&quot;
 );
 rtemplate($contents,$vars);
 echo $contents;
?&gt;
This example allows small functionality. You might have big problems if your company value contains #CITY#, for example. There are much more advantages of using smarty. But anyway, raw PHP templating is most effective and fastest.

==How does it work?==

Smarty is a template engine which actually compiles the template file to the php file that can be later executed. This simply saves time on parsing and variable outputs, beating other Template Engines with much smaller memory use and regex.

==Installation==
Installation is very basic and easy to use

# Download Smarty Source from [http://www.smarty.net/download.php smarty.net]
# Open it using your archive extractor (must be compatible with .tar.gz files)
# Go to the directory called Smarty-x.x.x
# Copy the '''libs''' folder to your website's root ( where you want the website to exist, for example /My_Site/ )
# You are done!
There is no requirement to copy other files as they are simple examples.

==Usage==
===Basic Syntax===
 {* Sample Smarty Template *}
 
 {* Include a header file *}
 
 {* Include a file from a variable $header_file, which is defined by the php script *}
 {include file=$header_file}
 {include file=&quot;middle.tpl&quot;}
 {* Simple alternative to PHP's echo $title;
 {$title}
 {* Include a file from a variable #footer#, which is defined by the config file *}
 {include file=#footer#}
 
 {* display dropdown lists *}
 &lt;select name=&quot;company&quot;&gt;
 {html_options values=$vals selected=$selected output=$output}
 &lt;/select&gt;
 {*end*}

===Basic Syntax #2===
Comments:
 {* Comment *}
Writing a variable, assigned from the PHP script:
 {$variable}
Writing a variable, assigned from the config file:
 #variable#
Using a variable in a function:
 $variable
Other Examples (Smarty Documentation):
 {$foo}        &lt;-- displaying a simple variable (non array/object)
 {$foo[4]}     &lt;-- display the 5th element of a zero-indexed array
 {$foo.bar}    &lt;-- display the &quot;bar&quot; key value of an array, similar to PHP $foo['bar']
 {$foo.$bar}   &lt;-- display variable key value of an array, similar to PHP $foo[$bar]
 {$foo-&gt;bar}   &lt;-- display the object property &quot;bar&quot;
 {$foo-&gt;bar()} &lt;-- display the return value of object method &quot;bar&quot;
 {#foo#}       &lt;-- display the config file variable &quot;foo&quot;
 {$smarty.config.foo} &lt;-- synonym for {#foo#}
 {$foo[bar]}   &lt;-- syntax only valid in a section loop, see {section} 
 
 Many other combinations are allowed 
 
 {$foo.bar.baz}
 {$foo.$bar.$baz}
 {$foo[4].baz}
 {$foo[4].$baz}
 {$foo.bar.baz[4]}
 {$foo-&gt;bar($baz,2,$bar)} &lt;-- passing parameters
 {&quot;foo&quot;}       &lt;-- static values are allowed

Calling Functions:
 {function}

===Integrating into a website===
To make use of the Smarty Template engine you will need to change your php script, which is used for controlling the Smarty engine and compile the template file.
Simple example:
&lt;?php
 // Include Smarty Library
 require_once(&quot;libs/Smarty.inc.php&quot;);
 // Create new variable $smarty from the class Smarty
 $smarty=new Smarty();
 // Set the template directory, very useful for different templates
 $smarty-&gt;template_dir=&quot;templates&quot;;
 // From here you should put your own code
 // Set some variables
 $smarty-&gt;assign(&quot;Title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Just a test&quot;);
 // Create an array, which we will assign later
 $contacts=array(
   array(&quot;Name&quot;=&gt;&quot;John Parkinson&quot;,&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;john.parkinson.test@domain.tld&quot;,&quot;age&quot;=&gt;26),
   array(&quot;Name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Super Mario&quot;,&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;super.mario@domain.tld&quot;,&quot;age&quot;=&gt;54),
   array(&quot;Name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pete Peterson&quot;,&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;pete.peterson@domain.tld&quot;,&quot;age&quot;=&gt;18),
   array(&quot;Name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Smarty Creator&quot;,&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;smarty.creator@domain.tld&quot;,&quot;age&quot;=&gt;37)
 );
 // Assign the array
 $smarty-&gt;assign(&quot;contacts&quot;,$contacts);
 // Compile and Display output of the template file '''templates/index.tpl'''
 // Up to here you should put your own code
 $smarty-&gt;display(&quot;index.tpl&quot;);
?&gt;

===Variables===
[[#Basic Syntax #2]]

===Arrays===
Please refer to [[#Variables]]

===Classes===
&lt;!--(explains passing / accessing classes)--&gt;
???

==Looping==
Looping in smarty is just like PHP, except that there are different ways of approaching the variables. For example, in PHP you would write this:
 foreach($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
    echo &quot;$key =&gt; $value\n&quot;;
 }
As Smarty compiles similar piece of code by this:
 {foreach from=$array key=&quot;key&quot; item=&quot;value&quot;}
 {$key} =&gt; {$value}
 {/foreach}

Also, you can use a '''[[Programming:PHP:smarty:functions:section|section]]''' function which is very similar to '''[[Programming:PHP:smarty:functions:foreach|foreach]]'''

In the case the designer wanted to add bullet points, or indexes of the array items, there would be no need to do anything for the programmer as you can use other variables that would change themselves after each loop. Lookup here:
*'''[[Programming:PHP:smarty:functions:section|section]]'''
*'''[[Programming:PHP:smarty:functions:foreach|foreach]]'''

==Conditions==
&lt;!--(explains {if}{elseif}{else}{/if})--&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{if} statements in Smarty have much the same flexibility as PHP if statements, with a few added features for the template engine. Every {if} must be paired with an {/if}. {else} and {elseif} are also permitted. All PHP conditionals are recognized, such as ||, or, &amp;&amp;, and, etc. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

The following is a list of recognized qualifiers, which must be separated from surrounding elements by spaces. Note that items listed in [brackets] are optional. PHP equivalents are shown where applicable. 

&lt;TABLE BORDER=&quot;1&quot;  CLASS=&quot;CALSTABLE&quot;&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;

:: You are open to disagree and state your objections what you are not open to do is to force you view on others... like you did here. Opposition has also a time limitation. A right timing to be expressed. It is not that things can't be undone, but the task of undoing or changing what other previously have done if not seen as beneficial has the label of destruction, at least to anyone but the one that destroys. This is why a process of discussion has to take primacy to most drastic actions.

== Stage short vs decistage ==

I have replaced {{tlx|decistage}} with {{tlx|stage short}} in [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++/Summary]], as the latter seems much less intrusive. If people agree with this replacement, we can perform it in all subchapters. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 12:49, 28 March 2012 (UTC)

:At this stage that is only an aesthetic choice, I myself have a mental idea of how each section is but even so the bar permits to have a better understanding of the development stage that your proposed change (something that I wouldn't object if the stages were already at a level that was usable).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:44, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:: I disagree, but until there is more support for my proposal, there is not much I can do. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 17:04, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

::: Thanks for you this special regard to the opposition. It is not a case of support but consensus and ultimate benefit to the work. It seems clear that alienating those that have been working on would be rather unsocial...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:32, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

== Flat structure ==

Not sure if I should put my comment at the beginning or the end.  Sorry if it is in the wrong place.  This book is on hold, because of a dispute.  Not sure if the flat file vs. slash method is reason.  But if it is why not just use redirection?  Keep the slash version for maintenance of the book structure and actual pages, but also make redirection pages for individual items.  This is a programming language.  One person may look up classes while other may look up exceptions. 19:52, 12 January 2015 (UTC)

:It should have been at the end. This discussion has been over for a while. I think what you are stating as redirection is transclusion, we already use it in some pages as to increase maintainability but there is an issue with the print function that has a limit to the number of transcluded pages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:11, 12 January 2015 (UTC) 

IMHO flat structure is much better suited to Wikibooks than a deep structure. Thus, I propose to move [[C++_Programming/Programming_Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type_Casting]] to [[C++_Programming/Type_Casting]], thus undoing a move from 7 October 2010‎ by {{user|Panic2k4}}. I propose to proceed in a similar fashion with other chapters.

Related discussions: [[Talk:C++_Programming/Conventions#flat page structure]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 13:11, 28 March 2012 (UTC)

:The book presently uses extensive deep structures for instance in the case of keywords and other general structures, flat structure would go against the normal practice and be non productive since the / convention is being used for navigation. A reader on the type casting page will be easily able to navigate to the Variables page as it is now...
:What improvement do you see in that move and why are you posting here in place of the proper discussion page that others may be watching ? Also, why the change to the assigned talk structure that is easier to fallow in such a big project ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:40, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:: Flat structure is the normal practice in Wikibooks; just check around. This practice is productive in countless books in Wikibooks. The path &quot;C++_Programming/Programming_Languages/C++&quot; seems like a particularly poor redundancy.
:: I am posting here to make it easier for me and others to collaborate on this book. Dispatching contributors to several discussion pages for a single book creates needless barrier of entry for newcomers. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 11:48, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
::: Flat structure is not &quot;the norm&quot; it is the most common only because of historical reasons, after the adoption of the slash convention that to some point deprecated most extraneous navigational schemes (that I profoundly dislike and see as a maintenance nightmare on the long run), the new works have been implementing similar complex structures even older project have moved rapidly to adopt the advantages provided by the riches structure (like the Ada project). I think you can take me on my word since I'm on the project since 2004... 
::: Since this page clearly provides specific forums for specific issues I don't see a problem in accommodating the existing setup if as it is properly indicated. Wikibooks is not Wikipedia pages aren't individual articles and most people will miss discussions if not made in a more general location.
::: I noticed that your unwillingness to comply was intentional, since you even removed the previous request for compliance. I do not agree with your view on this regard and question how you can infer that it is a barrier for newcomers since it has worked well so far...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:30, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:::: To begin with, you would do well to separate sentences by punctuation; 'Flat structure is not &quot;the norm&quot; it is the most common only because of historical reason' is ungrammatical, and hard to parse.
:::: The flat structure is not an artifact of Wikibooks history. It has been discussed in Wikibooks, but I cannot find the discussion.
:::: The confusing setup of discussion pages for this book has not worked well, as far as I can see. I have no reason to comply with regulations that you have invented for this talk page, especially if they create artificial bareers for contributors. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 14:21, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
::::: I defend that it is an artifact of Wikibooks history and Wikimedia software in general, people are still not fully aware of the slash convention and the benefit to navigation of works it provides. The flat structure for simple projects is fine for instance in the work I'm doing on [[Remembering the Templars]] it is still a flat structure (or in the [[House Construction]] project), in this case since the material may be used sequential or as quick reference there is a benefit to the slash convention and deep paths.
::::: Being contrary is your option, I doubt that you did not understood the request and I continue to disagree that you (or I for that matter) can claim any knowledge on how it impacts contributors (even if I can claim more experience if not only on this specific instance). All persons that have intentionally gone out of their way to make a point about the setup have been perfectly aware and able to comply with the request to use the proper indicated forum...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:17, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:::::: To verify that creating the dedicated pages has stiffled contribution to talk pages, one only needs to look at the separate pages and the rates of recent contributions:
::::::* [[Talk:C++_Programming/Q&amp;A]]; last post: February 2012
::::::* [[Talk:C++_Programming/Content]]; last post: 8 May 2010
::::::* [[Talk:C++_Programming/Conventions]]; last post: 9 August 2010
:::::: Furthermore, the benefit of having two pages for content and conventions is obviously missing, given the two pages host 10 section headings with posts in total. The number of posters on these two pages is 7, including you. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 16:25, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

::::::: That does not prove your point, in fact having different discussion pages is logically older than any posts on those pages, since the pages were created as specific discussion forums, hence your conclusion fails to be validated.
::::::: It also interesting to note that there hasn't been generally many contributors to the work, in fact the principal decline in contributions was due to two factors, the forced merge of the two distinct versions of the project and the adoption of the new page revision system (globally), this regarding activity in all the specific project's pages in regards to the discussion pages in general the activity has always been very small and it only get active when there is some edit conflict going on, all attempts to coordinate participation have never succeeded, not even when there was a single main talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:59, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: It does prove my point, especially when you compare the current rate of contribution to these talk pages with the rate of contribution that this talk page used to have. You have removed great many contributions from this talk page without properly archiving them; see also [[#Removed discussions]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 09:55, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

*Reset
I think I have expressed well why a flat structure is something that is not beneficial in many levels, from navigations to the complexity of the works that would be required now to enact that transformation. Even to the point of degrading the structure of the work (as mentioned how the keyword systems works, transclusions, tables etc.). I also note that most new works have stopped using flat structures unless they are single paged or with a few pages (that makes sense). As such I'm blocking the proposal for a change to this specific work, as a contributor to it and even as a rule (I would oppose this move in any other complex work).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:49, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

Just to further explain the path you first mentioned (note that the path may be long but that is relatively unimportant since readers don't need to worry about that and editors only when referencing). The idea of the C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++ was used to introduce comparisons with other languages it is also intended in the future to demostrate how the languages can interact. I'm just adding this bit of info since I did not make it clear above.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:11, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

: For what it is worth, I would like to second the nomination for a flat structure.  The current system is needlessly complex.  KISS is good advice in this case. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 03:48, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:: To revert the work to a flat structure would be almost impossible and at least extremely disruptive, any contributor that does not like of finds difficulty in handling the the slash convention structure that is adopted can simply ignore it or ask for help.
:: Yes it is complex but we could say the same about understanding Wikimedia markup, the template system etc if the functionality of the software would permit to have the same easy of auto-updated navigational aids and structuring in a flat structure I would fully support the idea but the number of pages and content in the work no longer permits that basic structure. There are no longer any flat structure books being created after the introduction of the possibility doing it with increasing path depths.
:: Look at the freaking structure of this book and consider the works it would take to make it flat, well not flat, since  some pages would still have to be at least at level 3 or 4 to have any usefulness, like the keywords use that I stated to implement before all this tackling tactics stated to implement something similar to what is on the [[Ada Programming]] (Ada Programming/Keywords/for). I'm half minded to put you in the spot to implement the &quot;flat&quot; structure, just to see you putting in the effort of doing what you are promoting. Believe me that I know the difficulty (I moved the freaking thing 2 times) and even now it is still not all in the right position.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:56, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Well I would disagree that there aree that there are &quot;no longer any flat structure books being created&quot; I have personally witnessed several.  I also find the navigational aids far from being useful.  They seem to amount to little more than categories, there is no device for moving from one page to the next page.  The auto-generated links at the top do not provide a way of doing this that I am aware of.  So overall I would prefer a flat sturcture where it is clear to new comers where to place new pages, and navigational aids for getting from one page to the next. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:47, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I grant you that all books are initiated in a flat structure, and that we haven't had since mid 2006 any big book come about. If you look at any large book before that they use multiple and hard to maintain navigational schemes (and have been stale for some time) [[Ada Programming]] has some action from time to time (depth 4). Navigational schemes was something that was tested on the C++ Programming, but since were removed.
:::: We can look at books around the same size [[Chess]] (depth 5), [[Cultural Anthropology]] (monolithic flat, needs splitting up) but for instance [[Radiation Oncology]] one of the large book created recently has a depth of (depth 5). I could probably have been more specific in mentioning complex subjects for instance the [[C Programming]] that I have made only toke edits has evolved to replicate the C++ Programming (now has a depth of 5), examples abound that with complexity and large number of pages (smaller pages) the flat structure soon becomes impossible.
:::: I note to you that I fought strongly to keep the page in a single page during much of his development and most of the structure was not even my creation, so I can not even be seen as in defending the superiority of one structure over the other what I defend is that due to software limitations the slash convention and deeper paths helps automate a navigation system that suffices in most instances (I'm not opposing adding navigational aids as soon as the book is near &quot;fleshed out&quot;, you can look in the records and I always defended this position). What I strongly object is a new reshuffle, adding premature navigational aids as having proven a failure or that the current format is the reason for lack of contributions, when most of what keeps people contributing is these endless discussions and alterations about aesthetics.
:::: Another reason that the argument becomes invalid is simply because of my continued availability to help anyone that has any difficulties contributing, in this project and on Wikibooks in general.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:42, 16 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::  To give an example in the other direction work on [[Linear Algebra]] came about after 2006, and uses a flat structure outside pages which give solutions to exercises, which are outside the main flow of the text.  A flat structure is not difficult and certainly not impossible. Navigational aides are not that difficult to add or maintain either.

::::: The argument that you'll be around to help is not very convincing.  Everyone, including yourself, from time to time is not around.  Even if you were around 24/7, you may never realize that someone somewhere is struggling to figure it out.  It is only when people stop at the discussion page that you would have any indication there is trouble.  If they give up in frustration before that point we would have no idea.  Let me be clear that I am not suggestion the structure discourages all people, or even most people, but certainly it does discourage some people.

::::: Lastly if discussion of alterations keep people contributing why oppose them so strongly? Did you mean to say this is what discourages people? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 03:32, 16 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: Glancing back over some old conversations I realized it seemed that until about 2 years ago the convention was to use a flat page structure, until it was changed without consensus [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1902825 here].  I would like to point out several of the arguments made at the time of the change, about the ambiguity of where to create pages was also expressed [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions&amp;diff=1904355&amp;oldid=1903220 in this comment].

== Location of table of contents ==

I propose to bring the table of contents back to [[C++ Programming]] page. The TOC was there back on 22 March 2007, as you can see in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;oldid=800776 this revision]. 

Put differently, I disagree with the creation of a deep structure for TOC, which does not bring any benefits and makes it harder to edit and understand what is going on. The deep structure includes [[C++ Programming/Chapters]] (created on 8 May 2010‎), [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++/Summary]], [[C++ Programming/Chapters/Fundamentals/Summary]], [[C++ Programming/Chapter Object Oriented Programming Summary]], [[C++ Programming/Chapter Advanced Features Summary]], and [[C++ Programming/Chapter Beyond the Standard Summary]].  --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 11:58, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

:I have looked on your contribution to the Wikibooks project. Any special reason for your interest in this project ?
:The chapter pages are all done to centralize alteration to the book structure in a way that it facilitates changes and maintenance. The book structure should not be altered haphazardly since a lot of effort was made to keep a flow on the book structure. In fact the work is still under restructuring, only the first two chapters are more or less in a final state, location wise. To have a better vision on page locations use the category page of the book. I also note that the existing TOC does bring benefits to at least the work primary editor and is not a recent creation, it is something that has evolved along the years, I could not disagree more on the issue that it makes the structure harder to understand. I would agree that I could make changing the structure a bit harder to do for those that have less experience with wikimedia markup (but that at this stage is a plus).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:55, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

== Removed discussions ==

This talk page had discussions about [[C++ Programming]] that were removed. It is possible that they were moved to [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archives]], but that page has been deleted on 2 August 2011. To see more of these discussions, see the revision history of this talk page. IMHO someone should restore [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archives]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 06:55, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

== Plagiarism ==

In the following page, charges of plagiarism have been mentioned:
* [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/C++_Programming]]
It seems that some content licensed under GNU GFDL has been taken over into this book, back when Wikibooks content was licensed under GNU GFDL rather than under CC-BY-SA. I emphasize that GNU GFDL requires ''attribution''; even if the Wikibooks editor taking over the content was free to add the content to Wikibooks, he must not misrepresent himself as ''the author'' of the content.

I would like to know which GNU GFDL resources have been incorporated into [[C++ Programming]], and who the authors are. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 09:12, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

== User:Panic2k4 ==

In 2010, {{user|Panic2k4}} has turned ''C++ Programming'' Wikibook upside down. The user was subject to arbitration back in 2007 in [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny]]. According to [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges]], Panic2k4 had made it difficult for other editors to edit the C++ Wikibook. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 09:18, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

:That is your opinion and you are free to express it. The arbitration process was aborted if any conclusion can be extracted from it was that the general community found the facts were not substantiative enough to reach a consensus about the subject. As for the quality of the work or even to its structure I find it amusing that many other works have duplicated my approach and historically records prove that by a large margin without my contributions there wouldn't be much of a book to turn upside down.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:10, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

== Talk page reorganization ==

I strenuously oppose any attempt to further &quot;reorganize&quot; this talk page in a way that is not customary in Wikibooks. In particular, I oppose any attempt to move my contributions made to this talk page to any other place but a proper archive, which would be something like [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archive]], [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archive 2]], or the like.

{{user|Panic2k4}} has been asked not to reorganize the talk pages before, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=695359&amp;oldid=692174 in this edit to his talk page] from 23 December 2006 by {{user|SBJohnny}}.

A quotation: &quot;I also would like to add that right from his early days here Panic probably didn't understand how talk pages work and kept rearranging the talk pages of the C++ book, causing a concern that my comments/ideas were being made less prominent for others to discuss/build on.

== Big text ==

:::You had mentioned that before (not on this work) and I thought that it was a problem solved. (An alternative that some have adopted was to use an image) Do you have problems with it in other pages ? (interesting to note that google can't detect &quot;{{DISPLAYTITLE:&quot;). The works I contribute to are not the only using it to permit a distinction in title size (or removal of it completely and substitute the function by an image) but all have been moved to that setup check [[On spies and stratagems]] I think is using exactly the same font configuration that was active on the C++ Programming (if and when you have the time try tweaking the fonts characteristic and size and see if it does anything for you).

:::: Sadly I am scoring no bonus points today.  Looking back through the history more carefully some versions cut off and some do not.  It does seem to be fixed in the most recent version.  I was looking back at the version referenced by Ruakh.  For what it is worth, I find the smaller text more appealing, but it seems it is a purely aesthetic matter.

::::: Even if restoring the previous state would not void the position presented by Dan Polansky. In case a Be Bold action the any opposition means the preservation of the status quo previous to the opposed change. That is the right to block an alteration and proceed a discussion toward a consensus to validate that change.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:46, 14 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::: I am not sure I follow your logic above.  You seem to say there is a &quot;right to block an alteration&quot;?  Whose right?  And I am very unsure what you mean by the sentence &quot;Even if restoring the previous state would not void the position presented by Dan Polansky&quot;... I am taking it to mean: &quot;Restoring the previous [big text] state will not void Dan Polansky's position&quot;.  Correct me if you meant something else

:::::: In any case, this is the situation as I understand it.  Ruakh comes along and removes the display title and gets reverted by you. Dan Polansky agrees with Ruakh and changes it back, I come along and agree with both of them.  You disagree with your fellow editors, ignore their input and change it back to a big text display.  This seemed a bit heavy handed to me, so I changed it back and suggested we give the conversation a bit more time to reach a consensus (via an edit summary).

:::::: Am I understanding your comments from my talk page correctly?  You find this to be illogical and contrary to common practice and Policy? The rest of your comment suggests we have different opinions about when one can/should use the undo tool, but let's put that aside for the moment.  And focus on the title. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:16, 14 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::: Anyone is (and should) be able to block any type of alteration within reason (modicum of commonsense) and valid argumentation, lets say the &quot;Because I do not like it&quot; types of arguments will not justify a block and that those that will attempt to block must be able to at least listen to the motives behind the proposed change.
::::::: This type of logic is basic. Lets say I alter any page, I will not require justification nor permission what is asked is that I recognize that others will be permitted to object to that change (by the Be Bold) and that the change will be addressed by the normal decision process.
::::::: Imagine that I change any page, any WIkibookian will be allowed to block within reason my alteration, the change is reversed and the decision process initiated. High impact alterations, that we could even argue that altering a work's cover page may constitute, especially if it has active editors would even require a proposal of the intended change before making it (it depends on the change and the state of the work) I have altered many cover pages or restructured works but never attempted to impose my structure in works I'm not involved.
::::::: You also state a wrong understanding of this particular situation. See the date of the discussion of Ruakh (that was addressed properly on [[User talk:Ruakh]]), put that in context with the general actions of Dan Polansky, and you will have your answer regarding validity and intention. In any case I gave 7 days for Dan Polansky to continue exposing his view that is resumed to &quot;oppose inserting big text to the top of the main page of the book&quot; that my last action does not go directly against, granted that it is a thin distinction. I simply restored a earlier proposal by a previous Wikibookian that users an image, even as an attempt to address the concerns you expressed here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:44, 14 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: If I understand correctly you feel the current version doesn't meet Dan's complaint because it is an image of text instead of text it the CS sense? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 00:39, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::: Since Dan's complain does not go beyond opposing the insertion of big text to the top of the page (something that was in place for at least several months), it is hard to decide what reasons he has for it or give any validity to his position. There are plenty of works that use the same solution (I have taken the idea from other works in the first place). I see no reason at this time to validate or heed Dan's objection, but in place of reversing it (again) I have opted by an image in accordance to your own participation on the discussion (that it seems also had no technical ground) but serves the same purpose and was in place for several years before I substituted with the text.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:10, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::: I cannot speak for Dan, but personally I don't find switching for text to an image a reasonable compromise.  The comments were more the display size rather then the method by which the characters are formed.  As an aside, the number of months is irrelevant, as new editors get involved in existing projects they will invariably be changing things that had been in place for quite a long time. Of course existing editors also have a vested interest in the project, and they opinion should be considered equally with the new editors.  In this case I suggest we leave the title as is now until Dan returns to clarify if he is happy with it, or until someone else chimes in.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 02:42, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::::: It was not an attempt to compromise, since Dan's objection is not fully explained (and understood). But as I said it was also not a reversal or in direct opposition to Dan's statement.
::::::::::: The number of months is not irrelevant. One thing is to object to a recent change like I did, another is to object to something that obtained consensus by no timely objection (discussions do not remain indefinitely opened, unless that is a stated consensual choice). This is how things work, I can not come to the project and state that a policy or a guideline is not valid because I did not participate in its discussion or I dislike it even if I have extremely good arguments for a change. One can only propose the it is changed. In other words what you are stating is that anyone could go altering any page (even cause disruption or havoc) without consideration for what others have done before without ever bothering about obtaining consensus, the Be Bold specifically states that this is not the way to go (this in not about editorial control, but civility). Even if Dan continued to object to the change, the best option failing a consensus agreement would the be the preservation of the status quo that existed before he took any action, because my objection is not founded in a rigid attempt to be uncompromising, that this it was unique to this work and ultimately if the issue is merely esthetical both views have the same value.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:16, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:Noted but I express my reservations and will address the action properly at a later time. I must state to the record that per previous precedence you had all incentives to exclude yourself for taking any action. To me and taking in consideration the version you decided to make static, the action was not impartial nor proper. I see nothing that was addressed by the protection, besides a validation for you own reversion. Since there was not a real conflict going on, a discussion yes but with Thenub314 not the original proponent for the change. If Thenub314 was promoting escalation by the user that was at best being unreasonable, you action is just baffling (but sadly not totally unexpected even if I hopped people had gained some sense, as for me I'm only being consistent).

If this was not occurring I wouldn't believe it to be possible, the freaking title was an image of text before I removed the redundancy, this thread is of such absurdity that any validity was a stillborn. I stick to what I have said, again an improper user of administrative tools. The simple and undeniable fact is that simple dialog would have removed the need for the protection, and there is no argumentation against that simple fact.

{{outdent|::}} Continuation since the questions made in 15 April 2012 (UTC) were not answered properly and the issues have arisen in another discussion.&lt;br&gt;
My understanding today is that there is no way in hell that Darklama agrees with me on how to address edit conflicts or how his interventions have always been destructive.
My view is simple. Be Bold everywhere, but be civil and respectful of objections. An opposition to a Be Bold action can only be resolved by a reversal of the action, preferentially by mutual agreement, but that is not always possible, and should be a door for the process of consensus. Process that may not be forced (coerced, lack of participation results in failure to advance ones motion) and may even not end in consensus, but in a block position to the change. Deadlocks are ultimately temporal, participants with less motivation will drop the issue or time will provides a solution. A block of a decision should not be seen as permanent (our decision process permits a majority bypass of a block, but that should be a drastic exception not the rule, if not all decisions are by majority).&lt;br&gt;
I'm only stating this for others. I know Darklama's position is antagonic and unlikely to change. But it is at the core of dispute resolutions (and most of my past conflicts with Darklama).&lt;br&gt;
A reverse war (edit conflict) arises when 3 edits are made in close succession by at least 2 people around the same edit content (it can be argued how close or similar the changes need to be, as to become relevant) and 2 of these contents are reversals (real - functional, or practical - content change). A single change and a subsequent reversal is not an edit conflict by itself if well commented and/or dialog is opened (I only do this with registered users, this is common practice).&lt;br&gt;
Darklama raises the issue of past conflicts, something that I do not recognize as relevant. A conflict or dispute ends in time after a process of dialog is terminated (it can be conclusive or inconclusive but it terminates if neither part takes more action during at least 7 days 30 max, depending on the relevance). I have always worked to address any conflicts, this is so documented.&lt;br&gt;
I do not recognize Darklama's (or any other Wikibookians) claim to represent other Wikibookians interests/views/opinions or wishes without those users explicit consent to it in a timely (on a valid time frame near the relevant discussion) and verifiable fashion (logs on project), exceptions were policy or guidelines are being violated. Not the case.
Being this my view. I do not recognize Darklama's as lawful (right or based in Wikibooks policy or guidelines) or called for (requested by another, justified or necessary) and in fact abusive and intentional by the simple fact that dialog was not attempted first and the change validated by administrative action was against my block position and is an imposition by Darklama on his on behalf, to this is added our previous history of permanent conflict in all things linked to this book. In fact acting here as he did goes against claims made by himself previously, since the reason for action was not significant (in fact avoidable) it makes it all more difficult to comprehend or why and from whom is the page still protected ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:07, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

{{outdent|:::::::}} I do not know why you feel harassed. I think there is nothing I can write that can assure you that harassment is not my intention nor a motivation. I cannot, do not, have not, and would not claim to represent anyone. The page is still edit protected to encourage and give people ample time to represent their own case through dialog. In time, the edit protection will be lifted.

I believe being bold everywhere with civility and respect for objections is an accurate interpretation of the policies, guidelines, and practices. I believe most people most of the time engage in dialog and address objections without reversing actions made in good faith because it is considered civil, out of respect for the possibility that the actions that are objected to may also be due to objections that were addressed through be bold action, and to break the be bold cycle through self restraint that might otherwise continue indefinitely with increase escalation. I believe reversal is not the only nor the recommended means of addressing objections to low impact decisions made in good faith. I believe civility and any decision making strategy requires people compromise and reach a consensus to address objections if decisions are to endure and have any value for awhile. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 07:45, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

:How do you classify actions that have repeatedly and with exhausting efforts attempt not only to thwart my participation (this is clearly one sided, I have not reciprocate in any occasion), or jump to every minor chance of escalating conflicts that I'm involved, this is almost persecutory. Granted that until this last one thing had calmed down. But this page protection is a repetition on how you use the admins tool badly (another example was the situation with james that resulted in my block, exactly the same and uncalled for). So yes this is harassment compounded by effects on the past spread of misinformation and character attack.
:My actions in the project speak for themselves I should not have to endure this special treatment and by my work on the project should be given a medic of leeway when handling conflicts (just like most admins give to each-over when they address issues or even when they go out out of control, this is one example of such events). What outcome have you gained by your intervention here and what was your motivation as I do not accept the justification you gave as valid nor see any benefit to the work, project or community in general.
:Everyone reverts actions on the spot, it depends a) how has done the action b)what action was take. I do this every day multiple times some I execute a rollback, some I explain the reversion and some I do not revert but open dialog, the number of times this occurs with me and others makes your statement intentionally deceptive and ultimately false.
:What I do not accept is that a new change be recognized as valid in face of objections to that change. This is the common practice on how we apply the decision process we do not implement changes before they are agreed upon. 
:This is also extremely damaging to the project as this book that ultimately depended on my efforts is one of the more active work on Wikibooks. Creating false conflict situations and bypassing other available methods of resolution, to me can only result from an intentional attack or results from incompetency, since it clearly has no considerations for any other factors and consequences (now or in the past, including you initial support for the deletion of the book).
:In any case time again will prove me right and show that you used the tools for your own personal purposes...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:21, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

::I do not know why you feel persecuted. I do not know why you feel you receive special treatment. I am also confused because you seem to feel persecuted and harassed for receiving special treatment while wanting to receive special treatment in how you handle conflicts. I do not know why you feel you should receive special treatment in addressing conflicts. I do not know why you feel administrators give each other leeway when actions are, as you put it, &quot;out of control&quot;. I do not know why you feel my actions are out of control. I do not understand why the past continues to influence your actions and emotions. I do not know what your intentions are by discussing the past. I do not understand why you feel or think recent/current concerns can be addressed by discussing past events. I do not understand why you feel or think the action to protect the book's main page from edits is about you and not about unresolved objections to the book's main page.

::I can agree that this book may be one of the more active books on Wikibooks. I can agree that how things are addressed here might be extremely damaging to Wikibooks. I can agree that the community may need to clarify when reversions are and are not an appropriate course of action. I do not understand why you would suggest that bypassing other available methods of resolution is the result of an intentional attack or incompetence while you bypass other available methods of resolution. Maybe I have misunderstood something, but thus far what you have written suggests, in my opinion, that you expect special treatment in other ways too which have not yet been expressed. Should I take your statement to mean that your reversions are the result of an intentional attack on Dan and thenub314, or the result of incompetence (in case of confusion, this is a rhetorical question because I do not know how I was meant to take it or what I was meant to think)?

::I assume every revision is the wrong revision, there is no right revision, and people will be unhappy with any revision standing while there is no resolution to objected to revisions. I have and do consider that stepping in to stop reversions from continuing may result in other problems and people focusing on other things besides the original objections. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:18, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

:::You are being disingenuous to say the least. It only requires to take a look on how we have being in conflict in multiple times to clearly observe that I've been not only persecuted, but you have used your administrative powers to escalate issues whenever you could. As I said previously this new &quot;intervention&quot;  is extremely similar on how you blocked me on my dialog with James. Only anyone that is not aware of our past divergences could believe in your sincerity regarding that statement. The issue is also not much about our divergences, some are justified and normal. But your constant lack substantiation in your arguments. You consecutively argue about points that have no rational defense ((mostly, I'll grant you that it not always). One could examine the issue you made about the inclusion of the text of the GFDL on print versions and other such previous issues that I had to engage with you about simple commonsensical issues, even this &quot;intervention&quot; will not lead anyware and so becomes clearly abusive and detrimental to the project.
:::I will agree that our core divergences are in a gray area, but by now we should have a full understanding on our mutual positions. One thing I do not recognize in you is the admission that you have at times been wrong, acted wrongly and that ultimately all you conflicts with me have lead nowhere and have caused damage to the project. One look at the RfD about this work, will serve to see how you quickly put you personal distaste for me above the good of the project. On my part my actions are not personal, I have no personal beef with you beyond your attitudes that from now on I will not excuse as based in bad judgment or as accidents, but fully consciously directed in support of a personal feud you have with me.
:::Have I ever gone out of my may to prevent you from participating in the project, obstructed you to express your opinions or even commented on your contributions outside of police or guideline discussion ? Have I ever attacked your judgments, qualifications or integrity beyond your actions as an administrator and your actions against me ? Could you say that you have never spread misinformation, deprecated my contributions to the project and connived to do my participation in the project harm. No, you can't, this was clearly admitted. A conspiracy of sorts did exist... 
:::It can further be proven undoubtedly that every time you acted against me has damaged the project unnecessarily, mostly all resulting in annoyances to me, in a continuous process of defamation, even to the point of alienating several Wikibookians, as people do not come to the project to spend time arguing.
:::I understand your faulty rational of how to deal with reversions. Faulty because it can't be justly implemented. It clearly is an example of your impartiality that you chose the revision that I opposed to be the one locked in place by the page protection. A protection that again I state that is not justified and serves no purpose, since no one objected to my change (this has been clearly stated).
:::I hope this is the end of this sordid business, time will prove once again who is right or wrong. I have better things to dedicate my time. I will no longer continue to expect you to take the high road, ever...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:09, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

(outdent) I would like to get back to the actual content issue at hand.  Above I made a suggestion about using the {{tlx|book title}}, does this seem like a reasonable compromise? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:29, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

:Thenub314 what in view of the previous discussion makes you think that there is an issue at hand, artificially creating an issue is not advancing any open discussion, it only serves in a contrived way to provide grounds to justify Darklama's action. Unless that is the objective please stop...
:There are other stale books you could better discuss the title issues or implement your visions without conflict, but in regard to this work lets agree that we had a compromises (between me and you) and let the issue rest.
:That is not to say that I stopped defending my right to block the initial change. This is probably a point to initiate a new discussion, we can even come to a communal understanding on how to resolve edit conflicts once and for all, if you see that as important or support the way Darklama intervenes in such issues, as he states above, by all means initiate a discussion on the reading rooms.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:24, 25 April 2012 (UTC)
:: The reason I think there is still an issue is that, despite anything that has been said by Darklama, yourself or I, nothing has been attempted to find a compromise that also takes into account Dan's view on the title.  I would be satisfied with the template, it uses a smaller text size so it takes in to account Dan's sense of style.  If your also satisfied with it then we have a compromise that works for everyone and the main page of the book can be unprotected.  Seems straight forward enough.  How do you feel about the title generated by the template? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 04:31, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

:::You seem not to want to leave the carcass alone. Dan's view is ultimately irrelevant since he is not and did not defend it beyond the initial statement, this is why this  subject is unworthy of the trouble it has caused and the time spent on it. There is no compromise needed just because there is no one to compromise with.
:::In any case I disagree that a sense of style is a valid justification to make a change in a work without granting those working on it an option to veto it. But again this issue is too broad to be made regarding this particular work as I said some posts early if style is something that should have a special treatment or guidelines, or exception to the normal decision process then it should be discussed more broadly.
:::No one in his perfect senses would object to a clearly beneficial style change but when we star discussing colors, font types etc those it is only a show of civility that those invested in the work should have a say.
:::I feel that we should not accommodate this type of behavior and still defend Wikibookians right to block any alteration they do not agree with, any edit in any part of Wikibooks. That is the normal process, I do not see any reason to do otherwise. The initial state has been, and is, the point where all discussions begin, the outcome (alteration or not), is reached by consensus. If we must paint the bike-shed, we don't paint it pink and then ask for consensus about keeping the new color we ask consensus about pinking it pink in the first place...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:09, 26 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: I feel like this is rephrasing a lot of what you said before, but you fail to address the question asked.  What do you think of using the book title template? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 05:26, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: I was not intending to escape the question but the answer had became irrelevant.
::::: In generic terms I do not like the template because it does not address the issue of visually duplicating something that is already stated on the page title. Of course that if we suppress the page title then the template serves more of less the same function than for example the image use I restored in this book. But it then becomes mater of aesthetics, I do not like to see the &quot;From Wikibooks, open books for an open world&quot; alone nor the completion state chevron insulated on the top corner of the page without the title near it. But these are my preferences and aesthetics.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:50, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::: The title, slogan, and chevron can be suppressed in the book's stylesheet for the book's main page only with &lt;code&gt;.page-C_programming h1, .page-C_programming .subtitle { display:none; }&lt;/code&gt;. &quot;+&quot; is stripped from the class name because of its special meaning if anyone is wondering. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:10, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::: In this case I would like to propose the following.  We use the template to display the title, and suppress chevron and slogan as Panic suggests.

:::::::: I still do not understand what is the goal in pursuing this thread. Unless you intend to make yourself a party on the discussion regarding the future of this specific item, but that is a new discussion and as I said before badly timed, serving only to put salt on the wound, therefore it is unproductive, not to call it intentionally malevolent by the discrimination made about this particular book, the selection of the time to argue about it and the context in what it is made.
:::::::: You can not state to be promoting any compromise since there is are no two parties that can establish a compromise.
:::::::: If you are now defending your own position on the subject, that would constitute a new proposal. In any case the subtraction of useful metadata can not be seen as positive. Darklama was merely being informative.   
:::::::: Your intervention in this subject, as stated, was in defense of Dan's position but not to state your own (when you intervened the discussion was about over since no reply was made), you shouldn't have reverted and if you did revert to impose your own vision that would constitute an abusive move (not that I interpreted it that way), since the discussion on the subject had already happened and you acted with previous knowledge of it. My subsequent alteration (not a reversion) took in consideration Dan's objection (&quot;no big text&quot;) and was agreeable to your concerns, ending the issue as you and I have now also stated multiple times. Even if not toward my satisfaction (I continued to prefer the previous version).
:::::::: Since Dan's was the initiator of the discussion but he did not pursue the subject further in a timely fashion, the course of action now is simply to revert it to the state previous to Dan's intervention since there was no consensus found for keeping the change.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:51, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::: Thankfully understanding my goals is not necessary to discuss content.  But if you must know, my goal is to build a consensus.  I don't know where you got that I did not have a personal position on this subject.  I wouldn't have joined the conversation if I did not.  I am not simply defending Dan's position, but also advocating my own.  And no, that does not constitute a new proposal.  
::::::::: Where did you get the idea that your alteration was agreeable to my concerns.  Let me quote myself about your last alteration: &quot;I cannot speak for Dan, but personally I don't find switching &lt;s&gt;for&lt;/s&gt; [the] text to an image a reasonable compromise.&quot;  Outside of a small grammar issue I think this is pretty clear.  My statement that we should wait for Dan to resurface was because at the time I didn't have the energy to argue with you endlessly.  When it is just the two of us we rarely come to an understanding.  Don't confuse this to mean I have more energy now.  I do not.  But with the page protected I have been given a bit more motivation to actually try to work with you and build a consensus, rather than the throwing up my hands a walking away. So from this point forward can we please keep the discussion to finding a font/format that we are both happy with?

:::::::::: Time of discussion does not preclude significance, in fact it is a demonstration of interest to come to a common understanding, non participation however not only serves to demonstrate lack of interest as in this project serves as to indicate a conclusion (as a block, consensus or non-opposition). In fact there is no time limitation on active discussions.   
:::::::::: I read that as you validating it as compromise, but not that I was required to also compromise with you. This indication now that you reverted my change based on your own aesthetic opinion, knowing that a recent discussion existed only aggravates your action. I have fully qualified above the event of this type of consideration.
:::::::::: I think most times we discussed we came to an understanding of divergence, but nevertheless an understanding, most of the time a compromise can be found but in situations every view is equally valid and they can be non-consensusal, there is no issue with that... I personally see diversity of thought as being important and valuable, but at the right moments and the right places and toward something of significance. My objection to Dan's alteration was not simply about aesthetics, but in context to his other actions a refusal to validate his irrational activity.

:Thanks. 
:The Print version of the same page seems to be complete I did a quick look and did not noticed any cut in content (can it be that the limitation was resolved).
:On your PDF I was looking on the content from the back and notice a list of contributors identified as authors (that is incorrect). Liked the image list (sadly part of it is not populated). No code highlight also.
:Without the box and a title correction to the list of contributors I have no issue with it. Seems complete for the examination I gave.

I will make a new version solving the contributors and box issues. Code is highlighted if and only if it is enclosed by a source tag. In order to populate the list of authors one has to add Information templates to the images on the File: pages respectively. I might do that, once upon a time. I can disable internal links globally. But some of them might be useful since you can click on the footnotes in order to jump to linked page in the pdf, so I don't think that is a good idea. [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 13:08, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

:Good point. I missed any highlight code (and the linking on the PDF) I used the internal viewer maybe that is probably why.
:The wikipedia links would be great to include as a generated glossary (and  simply not show in full text at bottom, but actual links like on wikibooks, including links to the same book). I've never created a glossary page on Wikibooks because it seems not only redundant but extremely complex to maintain consistent with the rest of the work (even duplicating some content). In any case these are my preferences, the points I saw as negative were the box and the labellings on contributors. Thanks for having the time to address that.
:You said that the you were not using the full page version, IIRC the box warning is only added there. Did it came from anywhere else, it shouldn't... If it facilitates to remove it you can use set another type of box that is unique on the source (making less problematic to create an exception).

I am using LaTeX as pdf generator and there are libraries for glossaries and I have well documented extension points (custom template mechanism (templates.user)) where you can implement this. I don't really think it is a good idea to make a glossary out out links to wikipedia and related sites, but if you really want that you can implement it yourself, its not that hard. To have a glossary you can also simply create a list of book internal links and include that list as a new chapter called glossary. I am using the full page version. But I am not using MediaWikis transclusion mechanism, that is why my PDF contains the full text. And thus there are not parts missing as you found out yourself. Since I got the LaTeX Code on my local disk I can easily remove the box with a text editor. But before I can do anything like that I have to wait until Daniels contributers.php on the toolserver becomes stably responsive again. We can also have a template for that kind of box. I can map that template to null in my configuration file, which simplifies the generation of future versions.

The problem with highlighting is our different understanding of the word highlighting. You think about colors and I think about bold font, italic font and underline. So from my point of view the two example images you uploaded are highlighted correctly. I can indeed enable a colorful highlighting, and it is quite easy to do so. But I opted for the monochrome highlighting you see. This is for many reasons. Firstly it is usual to do so in books and scientific articles. You may look at an example from the inventor of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup [http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/crc.pdf]. He also uses a monochrome highlighting. The other reason is a practical one. Many people you monochrome Laser printers. And print offices usually charge monochrome pages a factor of 4 lower that color pages. [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]])

:Much information is lost without the color (and it is not even coherent, images are in color). The issue of color or not should be left to the final user, not on the generation of a mostly intermediate format. I do not support your color idea, if the possibility exists to permit higher definition without detriment to the content why block it in the first place...
:Scientific articles/papers are a bit different they fallow strict normalizing guidelines (there is no normalization in syntax highlighting, color) and are intended for cheap dissemination, number and visibility are often more important than content ;)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:30, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

Well as you said the images are in color. The only thing where I don't use color is syntax highlighting of source. The source is still highlighted by bold, italic and underline. I don't think that the code will become significantly more readable with colored highlighting. If I used color, the source might turn very hard to read when printed with a monochrome Laser printer, or watched monochrome EbookReader. So basically I want to keep it like that. If somebody really wants color he can just paste in the proper LaTeX header and gets the color scheme s/he wants. [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]])

:Never had any problem but I trust your experiences. I noticed the underline, on the web environment it makes sense that the links are rendered so, but on a PDF it shouldn't look underlined (the bolds are on line for removal and being substituted by the highlight, there are some bits here and there, that missed being conversion). I don't remember how it looked on the collections but the simple print version removes all those WEB artifacts. In any case I hope you understand that I'm only commenting on my preferences. The highlight it this book is not extremely important, small pieces of code, but there are wikibooks that have more complex source code that would greatly benefit from having it show.
:Did you include something about your PDF creator on the generated book. Like created by xpto get it here source here. Probably as metadata that is visible on the PDF properties ? It would be interesting for the final user.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:55, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

Well Ok, I think I will just keep the highlighting the way it is. Otherwise you could maybe discuss with some professional typesetter including my arguments and develop an new highlighting scheme. Technically defining a highlighting scheme is easy, but making reasonable definition, that suits the needs of a broad group of users is hard. If you are done with that I will include into my generator. Currently I am not including any links to my generator in the pdf. I am not really sure why I do this. A reason might be well described by the German word Bescheidenheit, which unfortunately does not directly translate to English. Possible translations are understatement, meekness, modesty, although none of them really fits. Or put it more simply I don't want to advertise my generator like a commercial product. Still it is easy to find out for the PDF that it comes from Wikibooks. On the Wikibooks webpage it is easy to find out that I made the pdf and where my homepage is, on my homepage there is a link to the generator, so it is not so hard to find out[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]])

:Agree and that it is your prerogative (in regards to the highlighting). 
:I was again just pointing out that it could be useful to anyone, not specifically wanting your generator, to know how to build something similar or derive from your software creation for their own purposes. Seeking recognition for your own work and be proud of ones accomplishments is nothing to be ashamed, it is even your legal right, it depends on good taste and it even can be made modestly. You also have no guarantee of the duration of the project or how long a PDF will be attached to a particular book, not mentioning that why would a person take the trouble in finding more about it, there is 1001 ways to generate a PDF file, if the information is not provided, it seems a lot to assume that simple curiosity would make your solution visible and generally used. Even among Wikibookians (you could post something in the general reading room).

* The images in section http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Flow_Control#if_.28Fork_branching.29 should be conerted to svg thus from raster graphics to vector graphics. 
* The image [[:File:TaxonomyofProgrammingLanguages.png]] is to detailed to be printed on paper in a reasonable way. It is a good idea to create a less detailed version as SVG. 
* The source codes should not use more than 80 characters per line. First of all because it is often done that way, in particular a limit of 80 is chosen. And secondly since the size of paper is limited and thus a limit like this makes sense for printing on paper. You can look at the PDF version, at which places additional line breaks were added by the pdf generator to fulfill the 80 characters rule, and thus make the source fit to the width of the page.

:Ho I see, good catch, I was racking my brain attempting to understand what could be a valid reason for the exclusion.
:In that case in place of altering the main print version, create a new print version that transcludes the &quot;normal&quot; one and on that put noinclude on the offending section, create a new box for the TOC pages and explain that that version does not use the fair use content this will keep both version actualized and give a greater choice to users and ease the actualization of the PDF.
:It would be interesting to know if other works here are violating commons because of that. Yet an easier solution would be uploading it here (on the rational that there really is not a good reason to avoid fair use). Commons does it, I think, because it avoid any errors in judgment, for example of art work or even photographic works, something that here is a bit more limited in usefulness in a textbook.

the see below is autogenerated you may move the licence template to the (to be added) license parameter of the information template. I was just careless in this respect. I have got an other suggestion on how to exclude the image from the pdf. I would simply add a new template that simply passes through its first parameter. So essentially it does nothing. In my local template mapping file I can map this template to null. So it won't make it into the pdf. Certainly you have to add documentation to the template describing its intended use. I would be very of you, if you created that template, because of my minor knowledge of English and the Template policies on this wiki. This template of course also solve the problem about the transclusion notice in the beginning of the file.

&lt;b&gt;LaTeXVersionNoInclude&lt;/b&gt;
* Documentation: This templated passes through its first parameter. This is true for the Webversion, the Printversion and PDF Version generated by MWLib. But it evaluates to the empty sting when compiles with [[http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf MediaWiki to LaTeX]]. In this respect it is similar to the nocinclude tag. This template is often used to exclude nonfree content, since the LaTeX Version is hosted on the commons and nonfree content is disallowed by the guidelines of the commons.

== Vocabulary ==

I know the term STL is largely used (including in some ISO proposal) but please, consider changing the term STL with a more precise term. The name STL (Standard Template Library) '''does not''' appear in the standard (I checked C++03 and n3290) and can mean a lot of different things.
(quoting nolyc ##C++ bot at freenode) STL can mean:
# C++ standard library
# the library Stepanov designed
# the parts of [1] based on [2]
# specific vendor implementations of [1], [2], or [3]; 
# the underlying principles of [2]
# The parts of [1] only in C++03
# The Standard Thread Library (part of C++11 standard library) (nolyc11 needed :) )
If you mean [1] and insist on abbreviating, &quot;stdlib&quot; is a far better choice.

:You are correct, the terms &quot;STL&quot; and &quot;Standard Template Library&quot; do not appear in the current standard. The Standard Template Library refers collectively to various containers, iterators, algorithms, and functors which do however appear in the standard.

::::: Linking two works that have nothing but the subject matter serves no real purpose (and misses the rest of the target readers here), ultimately it would mean linking every C++ book here to the single book at Korean Wikibooks (very unmaintainable).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:43, 5 July 2012 (UTC)

I agree that an interwiki between a book and a subject page may not make sense. Are there reasonable similarities between the Korean C++ book and this book other than both are about the C++ programming language and their titles are basically the same when translated? People at English Wikibooks often seem to believe Interwikis links only make sense for books when two or more books across projects intend to educate the audience in the subject matter with reasonably similar approaches, the order in which things are explained are reasonably similar, the educational outcomes or goals are reasonably similar, and the books have reasonably similar scopes, depths, coverages, presentations, style guidelines, prerequisites, audiences, etc. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:29, 8 July 2012 (UTC)

== Basic functioning example? ==

From what I've seen, this book starts with a very in-depth explanation of C++, but there isn't any minimal, complete, functioning example of C++, i.e. a Hello World in C++.

I'd recommend the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// My first C++ program
int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note a few things:
* I include the iostream header. Certain compilers might not require you to do so, but it's bad style.
* I include iostream, not iostream.h, which is deprecated (although some C++ textbooks still use it)
* I do not use using namespace std, as it pollutes the main namespace and is generally discouraged.
* I give an example of a comment.
* main returns int, not void.
* The &quot;Hello, world!&quot; is fairly basic. Note that I finish with std::endl, not with \n (which does not flush) or no newline at all (certain operating systems might insert these for you -- not all)
* I return 0, though it is not strictly required to do so.

:Can you be more specific. The Hello World example we use has been stable since 28 July 2010‎ [[C++ Programming/Examples/Hello World]] and conforms to your proposal. We also do have a complete, functioning example step by step examination right there in the beginning of the book there is a link to [[C++ Programming/Examples/Hello world|Hello World - Writing, Compiling and Running a C++ Program]].
:I disagree that being verbose is ever bad style even if the compiler does some stuff for you putting stuff into the source code can only help to document your code and prevent errors. As per your own example of returning 0...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:54, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

::First of all, I never said being verbose is bad -- I said not being verbose (i.e. not including iostream) was bad. My apologies if i phrased that wrongly.
::Secondly, this book seems to be more of a depth-first examination of C++ (take one topic, and discuss it completely to the bottom) instead of a breadth-first examination (gently introduce the reader to the basic concepts of programming and C++ and then build on that knowledge).
::The first chapter of the book starts with explaining headers and source files, showing how they are used with classes (while simultaneously handwaiving the concept of classes until &quot;later&quot;) without even showing a basic program. If there is a link to an example in the first chapter, my apologies, but I -- and probably most readers -- haven't noticed it. Examples of working code should be a fundamental part of teaching the basics, not an aftertought you stuff away in some appendix. [[User:SeySayux|SeySayux]] ([[User talk:SeySayux|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SeySayux|contribs]]) 13:59, 8 March 2013 (UTC)

:::Yes the example is linked in the first &quot;page&quot; of the book (the introduction to the language). I have tried to introduce concepts in sequence but at times that is extremely hard and I intentionally chose to introduce basic concepts first including the portion regarding the C library before going into the more complex abstractions and concepts, in any case I have attempted to provide always a cross link to other avenues of going about the material.
:::Note that the book in the past did attempt to cater simultaneous to other presentation structure and format but it proved to be impractical and disruptive. There are now other C++ wikibooks that may conform to a different approaches, including one that is strictly practical (see the C++ subject page).
:::As for the lack of code you should take a look into the monolithic chapter views, examples only start to be common after the introduction of the concept of functions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:01, 8 March 2013 (UTC)

== transclusion ==

My understanding is that in nearly all Wikibooks, the only page in that Wikibook that transcludes any other page of that Wikibook is the &quot;print version&quot; page that directly transcludes *every* other page of the book. ( [[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs]] )

If the C++ Programming Wikibook were like those other books, then
[[C++ Programming/Print version]]
would directly transclude every other page in the book,
and it would be the only page that transcludes any other page of the book.

At the moment, the C++ Programming &quot;Print version&quot; page ([[C++ Programming/All Chapters]]) directly transcludes [[C++ Programming/Chapter Beyond the Standard]], which in turn transcludes [[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns]], which transcludes [[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns/Creational Patterns]].

My understanding is that this nested structure was created as a work-around to try to avoid a bug that (incorrectly) truncated the last few pages when viewing or printing the &quot;Print version&quot; page.

Has that bug been fixed?
Is there any other reason to keep this nested structure?

It would be nice to point out some common programming errors, pitfalls and the like by highlighting it. Many books on programming have an inset with an icon indicating the type of the inset (general notes, common errors made in general &amp; errors made mostly by people coming from some background (e.g. in our case a C or Java background may cause some confusion in people adopting C++), general pitfalls , pitfalls in some  C++ implementations, etc.) beside it. We could also probably do something similar. There is already a common programming error in [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:46, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)
: What about [[Programming:Improving programming skills]] that will assume knowledge of programming and just focuses on improving style/skill so on? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:01, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Brace Style ==

An important problem is how to have NPOV in the indent styles of examples. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]]

:Present all the styles and &quot;let the reader decide&quot;...  at least that is my idea. -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 19:59, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::I didn't quite get that. Obviously each example cannot be presented in all styles. So we should present one particular example in all styles &amp; the rest all in the same style as a `convention we'll adopt in this book' (which may itself be controversial). But then the example must be comprehensive enough (to include, e.g. cuddling of else, do-while, etc.). Then what about the examples which are presented ''before'' this comprehensive example? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 07:37, 17 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Separate Chapters ==
y not split the content into different chapters? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:48, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Follow the link to &quot;your first program&quot;. I have been making separate chapters. I am just reluctant to make N different pages now itself (them each would be with nothing more than a few lines). Once each chapter is sort of complete, content from here would be moved there and a link added here. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 06:47, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Broad overview ? == 

Sorry to ask, but do you think you have here a broad overview of C++, like the first chapter in Kernighan &amp; Ritchie ? 

Now the same subjects would have to be expanded in specialized chapters, right ? 

[[User:Hgfernan|Hgfernan]] 12 May 2004

== What must be covered ==

IMHO there should be a book covering C++ without reference to platform &amp; non-ANSI libraries, so that people who want to use various C++ libraries can first get to learn C++ ''per se''. And, IMHO this is that book. Of course, there could/should be books about the various C++ libraries, e.g. MFC, boost, GTK--, etc. But they should be covered in books different from the book meant for learning C++. Any comments on this? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 07:12, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I do agree that things must have a structure and a logical one if possible, using as many references to any C++ oriented content information would be only contributing to the goal (readers &lt;= contributors), if there is any part that would could be made into a separate work they should be moved, I've done that with OOP part (as a test, but it pretty empty, if someone dislikes it they can change it), more important would be saving any work already done under the same license like *[http://web.archive.org/web/20030211041642/www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCScpp/ How To Think Like A Computer Scientist Learning with C++ by Allen B. Downey] and other free work under a compatible license before they are lost and mailing other free content authors so the information remains free for all...

::OOP is central to C++ and would have to be dealt with in a book on C++, but a book on C++ should not deal with MFC, etc. as they are not required to learn C++. There could/should be (a) separate book(s) on OOP; they'd probably deal with not only C++ but other OO languages as well. IMHO C++ is one subject for a book, MFC is another, general OO is yet another. Each would ideally be dealt with a separate wikibook. 

:::Agree... but other libraries should be referred to... I personably don’t have a problem with some examples on the differences of approaches etc... but yes I agree that C++ and STL should be the main subject...  -- [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]]

::Trying to pour in material from 3 subjects into one book would IMHO not lure contributors but would turn them away, since they'd think it's an unorganised set of notes rather than a textbook. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:45, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Disagree... as we are working on virtual space and not restricted to paper or other media a dif. page or chapter for MFC (until enough data to form a dif. work) is more logical than a different empty book for it... people would participate more if given a vast range of options to build upon, this is one of the reasons that a single &quot;huge&quot; page would work better, given the restrictions of wiki.

== Rearranged discussion &quot;area&quot; ==

The above three sections enclosed within horizontal rules is [[User:Panic2k4]]'s interpretation of the previous discussion. I'm opposed to his/her refactoring at least because:
#I was misquoted at least once &amp;mdash; Panic's interpretation is that I asked someone to be nice, though I'd just said that doing something would be nice.

:Geezz Paddu just correct them, people do make errors, English is not my natural language, and try to not spend my time taking things that seriously... (probably the mess this was, if anyone changes your lines you wouldn't notice it :)

#The interpretation makes at least one false claim &amp;mdash; It's false that I didn't implement the highlighting I proposed. All the pages that I edited (except those in which I added navigation links) follow the convention I proposed.

:Didn't see any and I didn't contribute to any modules only to &quot;the book&quot; (modules have seperate discussion &quot;boxes&quot; (hint) ) was this miss plassed here ? 

#It calls proposals without any opposition as dead.

I didn't check for more errors as I don't have much time. Besides, even then I wouldn't be correcting them as IMHO they form a comment Panic has posted and I believe I shouldn't edit his/her comment. Presenting the original is an easy way to make clear what each person said.

:Humm the originals are still there only commented out so to reduce the mess (I reverted it again), and missquoted are is not the same as edited, it's easier to prioritize stuff as I have arranged it, please try to give it a chance, as for the dead proposals as adopted, heck if a house is pink I say it's pink I dind't select the color...  

:Please state what proposals you wish still to debate (if you still consider that for example the highlights are open, you should consider helping on heerr highlighting stuff :) lol at this point in time I don't think it's a great idea if that would have been settled before no time would be have to be lost on this (humm btw for example &quot;In My First C++ ...&quot; I didn't seem to notice any nor in the other modules I've seen...)
:It can be done when all sections are filled and a full revision starts, but now it's a bit late on the game

I'm just asking for your opinion on some proposals (and some were already &quot;adopted&quot; by contributors or just ignored) and take your point or of any other &quot;major&quot; contributor into account, the ideia is to make contributors in general happy... geezz 

As for the warped ideia you have on the humm wiki way... wiki pages may have passwords and other &quot;protections&quot;, I didn't and can't prevent any non humm &quot;major&quot; contributor from editing the section, it's just a request and I do think it's a logical one so to keep some order on it... geeezz you are to litral for me, first you wrongly accused me of vandalizing and them make me spend this time debating a self evident point don't be so single minded (almost anal) on the subjects, take the time to think on what/how you did/react and how I could have gone about it, I think I've been contributing so don't call me a vandal ... txs

== Having all material in a book in a single page ==


Can't the reference tables be moved to the main page into the related part of the doc and use anchors to refer to them ?

This does have something to have with previous discussions about removing part of the work to other pages but as this is not an independent topic (it relates to misc. parts of the main topic) -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:It's infeasible to have an entire book in a single wiki page. It may be OK for some people to read that (there do exist a lot of e-books available in &quot;one-big HTML&quot; format), but editing such a page would be difficult. Yeah, we have section editing and all that, but still it is a pain. After submiting it, you've to wait for the whole book to load again. Which reminds me... What about people trying to learn about just one language feature. Do you want them to wait for the entire book to load? That's why pages in the context of wikibooks are called &quot;modules&quot;, not &quot;books&quot;. Depending on the size of the book, each &quot;module&quot; may be a separate chapter or section or sub-section or anything.

::If you want all chapters in one big HTML, it should be possible to create a page like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name 1}}
 		----
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name 2}}
 		----
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::but the navigational links I've added to some of the chapters won't point within the page but to the page for individual chapters. But that should be the least of our problems. The real problem is that the servers would slow down. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:17, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::A single page from my point of view is the best trade off, for the user and the writer, as stated above any contributor would find more easily were he can be most useful and avoid repeating already contributed information, as a reader I do really hate wiki because of the limitations it gives to export to a non wiki env. like to get a copy of the work as a PDF.  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:What was dicussed before was not trying to include all C++-related topics into this book but to deal with only one topic &amp;mdash; C++. The other topics must be in different books. Of course there should be a link to those books here and a link to this one in those, but each chapter in those other books should not be mentioned in the table of contents of this book. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]]

::Agree, but the &quot;topics&quot; can be easily moved later if found to be extensible enough to be a stand alone book, moving empty topics will only fragment the user/contributor base...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

and there isn't a wiki &quot;extractor&quot; (does it?) that would facilitate getting a copy of all the work I do think that
it should be avoided and only use external pages to start independent &quot;books&quot; (works with private topics), I have also tried to find an offline editor (that isn't a Emacs or Unix solution...), does anyone know about one ? -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:Probably you are looking for [[Special:Export]]?

::Nope, something like a OpenOffice plugin something on those lines... I dont want to install a server and wiki on my comp to be able to edit offline :)...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

... and still on forking the work into multiple books. First lets have a working &quot;book&quot; and then we'll trim it out, using s streamline structure without references to multiple subpages will help to desegregate other topics, hec... even STL, that is part of the standard should have a separated book only for it, but lets try to just keep it on topic and with a simple and logic structure, then we can see if it is worth to fork it for the moment all content (on topic) will help to bring contributions ...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:It's difficult to have a working &quot;book&quot; without structure, with just random stuff about every C++-related topic thrown about. Talking of forks, splitting a program into a lot many source files is not equivalent to creating forks. Forks in wikibooks would be having two different wikibooks on the same subject. Is there any other book on C++ here? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:45, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::Ok, I should have used thread of subject and not fork (topic would also be wrong as a topic can be linked to a external subject), but I've seen your changes to the &quot;Guide to Writers&quot; but is there a way to list all &quot;modules&quot; on a single page so anyone can get a easy copy of the book (for printing or just to avoid repeating info or just to link to the relevant areas ? ) if not dividing the work into multiple modules is not a good idea it will only hide information and segment the readers reducing the writers as they will only see blocks of the work and probably if a users comes to the book as a reader the probability that he will contribute to a section he wants to read about is less that to a part he already knows, in modules only people that already have some degree of knowledge on the subject would contribute and I really doubt that this would result on more work being done, to do spell checking I don't need to know C++ (for example)...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:::The intent is to make the readers aware that they can edit ''any page'', not just what they are reading. With [[w:|Wikipedia]], the average newcomer is tempted to read more &amp; more pages following various internal links, and hence can easily arrive at something known and start contributing to that article. In wikibooks, the no. of links is low and this ''may'' be a problem. But IMHO the reader can easily guess that there is more than one module to a book and search for other modules in a book.

:::As far as coverage of new subjects is concerned, the idea probably was to list the books expected to be written in a bookshelf, and a visitor to the bookshelf can easily find what subjects he could contribute to. This approach would not work if bookshelves are (e.g.) given lower Google ranking than to a particular book. In such a case most visitors would only visit that book and might not be able to guess that they are free to contribute to any of the other books listed in the bookshelf.

:::I can't think of a solution to the problem other than what I've mentioned, namely have a huge page that instantiates each page of the wikibook as a template (did you know you could insert the contents of any page into any other page using templates?). It is possible to also have an edit link to individual pages, so any reader could be lured into adding content for any of the modules. But the real problem is that having large pages both irritates the reader and stresses the servers. I think we could get a better solution if we ask this in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], which has a greater visibility.

Here's my 2c. A book has a lot of largish chapters - let's emulate this. Having everything on one page disadvantages the reader in having things referenced, it's easy to bookmark a module page to a certain section, but it's not if everything's on one page, since one has to look through that to find something. Not to mention it's more difficult on dialup connections. It also allows one to structure the material and have different people working on different things without loss of apparent continuity in the text.
Speaking of forks, I am strongly against this. If we have any chance of making something decent here we need to pool our resources and create something unified. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:32, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

----
Here is a possible solution: Either way, the text needs to be split up into different sections. How about splitting up this page into chapters and having more lecture style material more suited for a [[Wikiversity]] type course which can be a bit more freeform as Panic seems to be more comfortable with? (Though you will need to break it up into a set of lectures regardless, ''and'' most importantly keep it structured).

Lol, sorry about the &quot;he&quot; [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] you are part of a minority so I did take it for granted, I've been corrected and switched any wrong gender references :) (Hope it alright now...)

I'll elaborate it more here and them move relevant parts to the &quot;proposals section&quot;, I understand that you are referring to modules (separated pages) as chapters and sections... as for the order or structure I do think it's taking shape but stuff needs from time to time to be moved around just to make sense (we can't talk about classes before going into what OOP brings to C++ etc...), as for the fixed idea [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] has with modules, I'm not against it nor mind set into a huge page but to make it a logical work. If we have multiple pages and with it discussion pages etc... it makes it a very difficult job on making a good work just take a look on the wiki bib. (on the previous modules) they go all over the place, I think that the problem is that people tend to look at this wiki book as an extension of wikipedia and this is separated work that must stand by itself if we fragment it it stops being a book. I'm taking the road set by P3 &quot;move chapters to modules as they were finished&quot; (they aren't) and see if the solution [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] indicated will work (transclusion, I think its a great option), still waiting for him to give me a working example but that would solve the problem of extracting all content to let's say a .TXT file and make it easier to coordinate edits (stop the duplication) and keep the ease of editing (if you go into the history you can easily see that people edit and contribute to different &quot;chapters&quot; that would be made impossible if using modules at this stage... ufff I think it's all, combined with I and others have said before, will this close the subject ?!? (until we have a complete &quot;chapter&quot;) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:05, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Where is the reference to the STL ? ==

The book doesn't have any reference tothe STL. Since it is a part of the C++ standards, is there a plan to create a section on it? --[[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]] 13:31, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Altering how talk pages are structured ===
As there seems to be no discussion about the cover image any more and seems to have been finished, I think its discussion should be removed. If for some reason someone disagrees with this I suggest, merging it with an archieve of previous proposals. I also think the link to book editing should be removed as well replaced with a link to [[m:Help:Editor|help for editors]] and/or [[Help:Contents|help for wikibook users]]. I also think the parts on merging contents and orphaned pages can be elemented since any merging and orphans should of been taken care of by now and the end of the main page lists anything that people think should be merged or added and the discussion on book contents seems to be the place to discussion it. I think copying and/or moving conventions and future contents that have been discussed and agreed to should be placed on the main  talk page for quick access with a notice to not remove whats listed here, but to debate them if people disagree in the aproperate discussion.

Something like this to replace the main talk page:

&lt;div style=&quot;background:white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;== See Also ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
*Before '''contributing''' to this book, read [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Wikibook Policies and Guidelines]].
*For information on '''editting wikis''' see [[m:Help:Editor|help for editors]] and [[Help:Contents|help for wikibook users]].
*See [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archives|Archives]] for '''older talk''' pages.

'''Please try to limit discussions to the related discussion page''':
*See [[Talk:C++ Programming/Conventions|Conventions]] for debates over '''conventions''' used in this book.
*See [[Talk:C++ Programming/Content|Contents]] for discussion and planning of books '''contents'''.
*See the talk/discussion page of the related module for discussions and debates limited to that module.

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Conventions used in this book==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;==Book Focus and Direction==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

with maybe the see also part placed on its own page so that it can be included on any talk page for this wikibook to elemenate duplication.
--[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

----

Please move this to the proper section... And I disagree.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:48, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Is there anything you disagree with specifically? The choice of what cover image to use seems like a proposal that was finished. The help for editors seems like it would answer any questions related to editting making the book edit part unnessary. it also looks like its dead and could potially be duplicate contents. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 17:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

----

*''Before contributing to this book, read Wikibook Policies and Guidelines.''

This is already on the book itself and sending it in that &quot;In your face&quot; form, could just scare contributors.

Probably including the link in every existing talk page to the policies and guidelines would be helpful l is there a template we can implement on contributors discussion areas in genera (small fonts) and not in a red background would be great. (or on the side of the page, as V2 of the book something on those lines...) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:41, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Your right, it is be a bit &quot;in your face&quot;. If you have better wording suggestion, go for it. The idea is to cut down on needing to point out specific guidelines or policies that are better understood by reading them. For example &quot;avoid copyright paranoia&quot; is better understood by reading the policies and guidelines. Then again it may not be necessary at all since the &quot;help for wikibook users&quot; includes a link already to policy and guidelines. I don't see a red background, its all white here, must be something on your end. I don't know if a template for it exists or not yet. The closes I know of off hand is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; which gives:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
{{{1|Welcome, {{PAGENAME}}!}}}
{| style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid #abd5f5;; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;background:#d0e5f5;&quot; | [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|Getting started]] with Wikibooks

--[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 05:58, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

Again you misunderstood me, what I said was, we could probably use a banner (or something like V2 toc) and place those links and other info in all talk pages but not with a red background or big fonts.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:14, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I don't think I misunderstood you this time. I was answering your question. There doesn't seem to be any existing template, except maybe &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, we would need to create one to use on all talk pages. It doesn't have to be a red background or big fonts, I was pointing out that what I used above doesn't use a red background, but a white background, in case thats what you see on your end. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:08, 12 October 2006 (UTC)


=== Altering the TODO box logic ===
I Propose altering the way the TODO boxes are used at the moment, the idea would be adding a TODO template on the C++ Programming namespace with a redirect to the existing root: template, this would provide a easy what on checking where TODO boxes are on the book and add the what links here link to the Content discussion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

----

The TODO template could probably be changed to categorize pages in something like Bookname/Todo, but why is it needed? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

----

A new template (reworked that is) will not be needed a simple redirect from a local (in the book namespace) to the general one would provide a whatlinksHere list of were all the TODO boxes are, so to facilitate contributions and prevent that people that add them forget or get confused by moves or text changes...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Sounds to me like the category would be the better option, because the TODO template may be used by more then one book and people may forget to create a redirect. The category would ensure its always available for any book that has things to do that makes use of the TODO template. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 12:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Try it then lets seem how it feels, I do think that the TODO box in itself doesn't need a link to the category, that could be done in per book bases in the talk section.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
PS: This discussion should be moved to the template page, so if anyone objects sees what our intentions are.

----

Making the template not appear in the category isn't a problem, thats easly done. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 16:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Humm ok but I don't see another way of doing what I said having a [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:TODO]] with only the C++ Programming Pages.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Yup I remember now why we didn't use the category on the TODO box, the box is intended to help editors/contributors not to crowd the navigational aids, even if in part it would help the page listing isn't specific to a book.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:23, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
PS: I will be moving this discussion to the TODO box talk in a few days (3 max)

----

So are you saying now you don't want it?! I had went ahead an added a category for it already, since pages (including templates) should be categorized. Maybe it can be somewhat helpful anyways. See [[:Category:TODO]]. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

-----

I'm saying that I don't like it, there is no need to have an extra link in each page (on set of pages) that use the TODO, a quick way to see what book pages used it would suffice, as it is it only makes like a bit more confused to users, but I can live with it.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

=== Tables, Figures and More ===
'''From prev. debates...'''
I like the green boxes, and i would re-use them until someone can come up with a better solution.

Here is an example:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Programming:C_plus_plus/Pitfall|As variables are not automatically initialized in C++, make sure your variables always
  contain a useful value '''before''' you use them for the first time}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{Programming:C_plus_plus/Pitfall|As variables are not automatically initialized in C++, make sure your variables always contain a useful value '''before''' you use them for the first time}}

I would suggest:
* TODO for TODO notes (since that's already there)
* Programming:C_plus_plus/Pitfall for common errors
* Programming:C_plus_plus/Portability for portability tips
* Programming:C_plus_plus/Practice for good practice

with right now the only difference being what is written there.

--[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:26, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

----

Have a box template that can be used for tables, figures, examples and other commonly tools used in technical books. For now use a fix style. In the future if we can get it approved, allow for customize style by way of class or id name thats available in all monobook themes.

&lt;pre&gt;
 {| style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 0; background: white; color: black&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;
  |-
  | style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;&quot; | {{{1|{{{name}}}}}}
  |-
  |
 {{{msg|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}}}}
  {{#ifeg:&quot;{{{desc|{{{3|{{{2|{{{1|+}}}}}}}}}}}}&quot;|&quot;{{{desc|{{{3|{{{2|{{{1|-}}}}}}}}}}}}&quot;|
  {{!}}-
  {{!}} style=&quot;border-top: 1px solid gray;&quot; {{!}} {{{desc|{{{3|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}}}}}}}
  }}
  |}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Usage would be one of:

&lt;pre&gt;
 {{box|
 Example of using cout |
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 }}

 {{box|
 '''Figure 1''' |
 [[Image:Byte45.png]] |
 image of binary code
 }}

 {{box|name='''Table 1'''|
 * list
 * list
 * list
 | desc=''list of stuff''
 }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

which would be rendered as:

{| style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 0; background: white; color: black&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;
 |-
 | style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;&quot; | Example of using cout
 |-
 |
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 |}


{| style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 0; background: white; color: black&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;
 |-
 | style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;&quot; | '''Figure 1'''
 |-
 |
[[Image:Byte45.png]]
 |-
 | style=&quot;border-top: 1px solid gray;&quot; | image of binary code
 |}


{| style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 0; background: white; color: black&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;
 |-
 | style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;&quot; | '''Table 1'''
 |-
 |
* list
* list
* list
 |-
 | style=&quot;border-top: 1px solid gray;&quot; | ''list of stuff''
 |}

I also agree that we need to use several different types of notes with different styles to distinguish level of importance of the information being given. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called MrItty. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name MrItty~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''Béchamel''' is one of the five &quot;mother [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]]&quot; in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]].  A basic white sauce, it can be used as the base of many other sauces.

Yield is 4 cups béchamel.

==Ingredients==
avoirdupois:
*¼ cup unsalted butter
*¼ cup white flour
*4½ cups scalded whole milk &gt; 3% milk fat
metric units:
* 50g butter
* 50g white wheat flour (type 405)
* 1000ml milk

And optional spices:
* salt
* pepper
or
*1 small onion peeled &amp; stuck with a clove 
*1 fresh bay laurel leaf

==Procedure==

#Soften the unsalted butter and knead into the flour.
#Cook the roux of butter and flour over gentle heat, but do not brown.
#Test the roux as it should not have apparent flour taste.
#Add milk to new pot
#Peel the onion and stick with one clove.
#Assemble into a scalding pot with one bay leaf.
#Stir some more. Do not let the milk adhere and cook to pot bottom.
#Keep stirring until milk is scalded at 80°C.
#Remove cloved onion and bay leaf.
#Combine scalded milk slowly into cooked roux.
#Stir and cook for 15 minutes. No lumps should be present.

==Variations==
The first is for general all-purpose usage.
The second is for desserts requiring a thickening.
The third is for my signature lasagne ferrera.
The fourth is for Atkins compliance.
The last one lends a peculiar sweetness when made with a two-row brewers' malt.

Pure olive oils and virgin olive oils are somewhat orthodox.
Vegetable oils and other oils are certainly outside orthodoxy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Classical music''' was a musical style that was popular in Europe in the 18th century.  By convention, it begins in 1750, with the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, although &quot;classical&quot; music appeared earlier. The Classical era marked a move away from the intense emotionalism of the Baroque period towards a highly structured, stylistic manner, and was the flowering period of the sonata-allegro form (a three-part structure, with the first movement allegro, a slower second movement, and a faster--often allegro-- third movement). Later Classical-era symphonies often added a minuet-trio section as the third movement, and the faster third movement became the symphonic fourth movement. Popular composers include Haydn and Mozart.

Beethoven is sometimes considered to be a classical composer, but is a special case, as his early music was classical, and his later music romantic. In fact, his ''Pathetique'' sonata for piano is sometimes thought of as the piece that ushered in the romantic era.

== Reorganized ==

I tried to reorganize the Swing topic so that it was more on par with the others -- ie, navigation boxes at the top of the pages, discrete pages instead of giant ones; hopefully I did alright.  The content needs some serious work as well, but hopefully this was a step in the right direction :-)</text>

== [[C++ Programming]] ==

I see you've started contributing to this book again. I just wish to say thanks for your corrections to errors and am glade to see you've decided to start contributing to this book again and hope you will continue to do so. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the encouragement; I don't know how much time I'll have to contribute.  It rather depends on how worthwhile (or, to look at it differently, how futile) it seems.  Last time I tried to work on the predecessor of the C++ wikibook, I found that mistakes were being added faster than they could be corrected, and re-added after being corrected; there were some contributors with more time than (correct) knowledge.  (On the other hand: if I do get something wrong, please fix it, and ideally tell me.   I like it when I learn I was wrong about something, even more than I hate the fact that I was wrong in the first place.)  [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 05:27, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

My hat's off to folk including [[User:SBJohnny]] and [[User:Swift]] who invest so much in trying to make wikibooks work. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 10 December 2006

It seems appropriate to acknowledge their work by giving this one more try; I've added some new material to the [[C++  Programming]] book, and saw somewhere that [[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]] might have persuaded someone else to contribute.  In a cooperative environment it shouldn't take a lot of people to make good progress.  

Let's hope that past troubles can stay in the past.  There are plenty of people here who care passionately about doing good work, and it can be tough to yield to others in the community, and to truly accept that once we write something on Wikibooks it is, in a very real sense, no longer our private property, but rather a common good.

(And if it doesn't work out, I hope I can disappear as quickly as I came in, leaving small ripples that soon die out!) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 00:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

Glad to see you decided not to leave after all. Completely true, all we can do is try to work together to make great books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm afraid it'll have to be other books that I help with after all; the C++ Programming situation is still not viable , for me at least, in spite of the efforts of various admins and others.  I wish those who continue the best of luck; as I've noted elsewhere, the release of the next C++ standard (hopefully in 2009) might be a good time for me to try again, perhaps with a separate book if The Powers That Be find that appropriate. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 23:34, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[C++ Programming/Classes/Polymorphism]] ==

I'm curious about your motivation behind making a distinction behind dynamic and static polymorphism, as far as I know, C++ doesn't make any distinction.

I'd also be curious to know what you think about combining the bits within Abstract Classes and Pure Abstract Classes into the chapter on Inheritance. C++ AFAIK, doesn't really make a distinction between classes and other sorts of classes, but it does related to inheritance in the sense that an abstract class is typically used as a base or parent class for a derived or child class. I'm not entirely sure what to do about the &quot;nice class&quot; information. I was thinking maybe it makes more sense in the general Classes chapter, but then the Classes chapter seems to be missing information on operator overloading and probably shouldn't be introduced until operator overloading has, so I've though maybe it makes since in the operator overloading chapter instead. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

The distinction between static and dynamic polymorphism is applicable to C++; alternative terms are compile-time and run-time polymorphism.  Various kinds of polymorphism are supported in C++; templates provide one or two kinds of static polymorphism, overloading provides a form of static polymorphism, and runtime/dynamic polymorphism (which is commonly, if loosely, often just called &quot;polymorphism&quot;) is of course based on the virtual dispatch mechanism.  Having thought about this a little though, I think this might be best covered as a small diversion for context, and then the book could state that it will use the term polymorphism only in the context of dynamic/runtime polymorphism, specifically the features supported by virtual functions in C++.  Presentation could be too awkward if the term &quot;polymorphism&quot; is qualified every time it is used, and there is occasion to speak of polymorphic classes (such as if we get around to saying what typeid does in detail).

It would seem to me that it does make sense to include discussion of abstract classes with the material on inheritance.

Off the top of my head, it might be good to cover classes in a number of phases; first introduce concrete classes (without any operator overloading), then introduce inheritance, then virtual functions, and then operator overloading.  Alternatively operator overloading could be covered before inheritance; I can imagine a good case can be made for either order.  There might even be room for another &quot;advanced&quot; chapter on classes to cover things like class-specific operator new/operator delete, techniques to restrict inheritance (and why they're a bad idea), the &quot;pimpl&quot; idiom, and more.

The term &quot;polymorphism&quot; is indeed not used much (if at all) in the C++ standard, but then the standard isn't trying to be a tutorial.  It might make sense for us to link to Wikipedia material on different types of polymorphism rather than trying to rewrite it all here -- it's a CS notion much broader than C++, and I figure we might want to give only a brief overview of the general idea and focus on the C++ aspects.

No idea on &quot;nice classes&quot;.  I'd have to take a look.  Might do that sometime. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 06:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

Generally I understand polymorphism in C++ to refer to classes such that transparently one class may be treated as another through the use of virtual functions and multiple inheritance. I think it may be confusing to refer to function overloading and the use of templates as forms of polymorphism. I admit I'm of the opinion that a book on C++ should compliment the C++ standard. I don't think its necessary to cover the broader CS notion to explain polymorphism as it applies to C++. I agree that a brief overview of the general concept makes sense, but I think it should focus on what it means in terms of its usage in C++.

There's a difference here with regard to using links from how it is on Wikipedia. Books are for the most part suppose to be self contained so that any information needed to learn the subject is available in the book, rather then relying on outside information to provide it. So while linking to Wikipedia material sounds like an easy solution, I don't think it makes sense.

A nice class in summary is basically one with copy constructors and provides operators with the expected operations of that operator and does so safely. For example overloading = is expected to involve assignment of one class instant to another and check to make sure that both aren't the same class when doing so which if failed to do can lead to memory leaks if assignment involves allocating memory with new. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 07:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

I think our viewpoints on the use of the term &quot;polymorphism&quot; here aren't far apart.  We shouldn't get too bogged down in generalities; it would be nice to at least mention that there *are* more general notions that apply.  I still feel that a link to Wikipedia would be helpful as a supplement, but I'm not all that concerned either way.

The only thing that seems to set a &quot;nice&quot; class apart from other working classes are that it allows copying, and it allows comparisons for (in-)equality.  Fair enough.  I've done some minor fixes in that section recently (as it said that the default copy operations are binary, which seems untrue).

Time for me to sleep; happy editing.  The new front page is great, incidentally.

-- James

I think the broader meaning of polymorphism could be discussed earlier in the book where general programming concepts are introduced with as you said a note regarding thhe use of polymorphism as it applies to C++. The entire introduction chapter is in need of a rewrite, and thats the main part of this book that I'm going to be concentrating on for now. If you want to pitch in I'm all for it. To get an idea of what I have in mind you might wish to read (if you haven't already) the [[Talk:C++ Programming#Book Reorganization|discussion]] that took place in regarding to doing just this. I've already begun the first steps twards this aim in [[C++ Programming/Programming Basics]] if you want to take a look.

I agree with your ordering for teaching classes. I think this book could use a chapter on advance classes as well. Both to cover mixing everything thats been taught previous about classes, and to introduce things like overloading the new and delete operator. Might even be the best place to discuss &quot;nice&quot; classes and other good tips for using classes effectively. So maybe all that needs to be done for the nice class page is to change the name and expand its focus. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:44, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Essences ==

I noticed you changed the TOC2 Print version to say Essentials instead of Essences. Any reason for that?

Essences (n): The intrinsic or indispensable properties that serve to characterize or identify something.

Essentials (adj): Constituting or being part of the essence of something; inherent.
--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

: Sure, but if you have a strong preference, change it back; it seems an odd place to use the term &quot;essences&quot;.  It's a question of the &quot;feel&quot; of a word, if I can be vague (and it seems that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, for better or worse).  &quot;Essences&quot; struck me as seeming non-idiomatic in this context, something that would most likely be written by a non-native speaker.  Not that you seem to be one (nor is there anything amiss about the majority of the world's population who don't speak English as their first language, come to that).  I guess in the end I just feel it's more readable to most people as &quot;Essentials&quot;.  If you'd like to challenge people to &quot;think differently&quot; then &quot;Essences&quot; will quite possibly do so.  (Or maybe this is a US/UK English thing; I'm British, though living in the US.  I've noticed that some fraction of things that strike me as poor English are just poor English by British conventions, and are idiomatic elsewhere.  Similarly the other way around.)  Incidentally, I'm assuming you're watching this page, having left notes here... -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 23:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I am a native US English speaker (but my spelling and grammer tends to end up bad anyways, without comparing color to colour), however I was actually going for a word similar in meaning to essential, so I ended up going with essences in order to avoid using the word essentials twice. I think its going to be a mute point anyways, as I was thinking of combing the two sections together and renaming it to maybe &quot;The Essentials&quot;, soon anyways. I was just wondering if there was more to it, like in preperation for futher changes, so as not to step on your toes if you were in the middle of doing something. I'm somewhat watching this page. I don't have it on my watchlist, but I am checking it maybe once or twice a day, if I see any activity from you. I don't have it in my watchlist, because it seemed to me, like you don't really look at this page much yourself. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Nice of you to include &quot;grammer&quot;, &quot;mute&quot; (for &quot;moot&quot;), &quot;preperation&quot; ;-) but luckily one thing Wikipedia and Wikibooks are good at is having people who know things write them down, and then wikignomes can come along and fix the trivial things.  (Yup, I'm some kind of spelling/grammar freak.)  As for me watching this page; when I'm active on Wikibooks, I'll watch it.  &quot;Free&quot; time comes and goes.  One of my writing flaws, getting back to the subject at hand, is a tendency to repeat words when it might be better to use a synonym or to rephrase.  So maybe one of us should revert my change.  It's a pretty minor issue, sure, but I suggest you just do whatever you feel is best; I'm not going to &quot;fight&quot; about such a thing, now that I know it was a deliberate choice.  Today I've been working mostly on the memory management section.  It's maybe 35% done, to give a ridiculously over-precise and under-accurate estimate. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

== C++ functions ==

Now that you mentioned malloc()/free(), I'd like to mention that I was of the opinion that we should be calling these &lt;tt&gt;std::malloc()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;std::free()&lt;/tt&gt; in the text, and we should not be using the &lt;tt&gt;'''using''' '''namespace'''&lt;/tt&gt; construct, so the readers will get a better grasp of the correct way to use namespaces earlier in the book (that would just be a few simple &quot;find-&amp;-replace&quot;s but could go a long way in ensuring we teach namespaces correctly). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:44, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'd like to go the way, certainly (indeed, I recently removed the &quot;using namespace std;&quot; directives from a moderately sized commercial project).  You might notice that examples I've added use '''std::''' qualifications.  (And in my own code I'm sometimes, just sometimes, crazy enough to write '''::std''' for the namespace name!) I'll mention the idea on the [[Talk:C++ Programming]] page and if nobody objects I'll do some of the &quot;busy work&quot; soon. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 20:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Sounds good to me. I think &quot;using namespace std;&quot; teaches bad habits. I think we even should explain why its a bad idea to make use of it in the chapter on Namespaces (eg because its clobbers/pollutes the namespace). --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

Now the &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; page has gone, and redirects to Panic's talk page?  That seems odd to me.

We need this discussion to happen in one place, that won't move around, with some clearly defined goals and a visible, updated current status being prominent.

== Re:C++/TOC ==

Hello James. I certainly feel your frustration on the matter, sometimes it seems that people would rather argue then come to any sort of compromise. When this happens, I agree that it's usually best to find a new project to work on. There are certainly plenty of books available, especially programming language books. I am even planning to create a few new books, once I have the time to do it. What other kinds of things are you interested in? what other programming languages? I've got a book right now on [[Microprocessor Design]] that i'm putting some serious effort into, and there are several books that i've worked on in the [[Assembly Language]] realm, if any of that is your cup of tea. Also, I know that the [[C Programming]] book is in lousy shape (comparatively) and could use some helping hands. 

I've thrown around the idea of creating two C++ books before, but that idea met with the usual resistance, as you can imagine. The people who don't want a second C++ book are generally the same people who stay far away from the problems in the first book, however. It's never ending, and you are a saint for putting up with it all for this long. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think canonization is likely in the near future... ;)

:I've worked fairly extensively with only a couple of assemblers (ARM, 6502), moderately with a couple (POWER/PowerPC and MIPS), and less with others.  x86 is largely a mystery to me.  I'm competent to contribute usefully on C and various other languages in that family, or on Perl, and can brush up on my Smalltalk, Haskell, Python, Modula-2, Ada, and some others easily enough.  I'll have a look at the C book in a little more details (I've briefly glanced at it in the past) to get a feel for it and its community, and see if there's anything useful I can do there; thanks for the pointers. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 03:37, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I've decided to start a new C++ book, in response to the problems with the existing one, since it is very unlikely to ever be resolved. The book is directed at readers who have no experience in programming, but who have enough knowledge about using the operating environment of their choice, to be able to install and use a compiler without needing to explain it to them in this book. This book is only going to cover standard C++ and common programming constructs that are portable, like creating linked lists, hash tables, trees, etc. Things like graphic libraries aren't going to be covered. I would also like to emphases throughout the book, good habits to have and things to watch out for or to avoid, in order to avoid making bad assumptions or writing non-portable code. Of course having fun writing about it is also a must. If your interested you can take a look at [[Understanding C++]].
:: I haven't done much yet, the first chapter Introduction is trying to take the approach of discussing the basics of programming starting from general and ending in more detailed information with an emphases on a C++ perspective throughout. I'm hoping to give enough information for readers to have insight into what programming is all about and what this book is going to cover with links to chapters for more information. For myself I would prefer to have this more or less done first, before any other chapters are added, sine I think it will provide a good guide or roadmap of what to cover in each chapter. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:38, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Understanding C++ ==

I haven't really decided on a single approach yet. One approach that comes to mind though is mixing both high level and low level together. For example teaching both the basic variables types as well as the ones provided through the standard library in the same chapter, side by side. Making little distinction between high level and low level, since part of C++ is about abstraction. I'm also thinking about maybe covering pointers and references in the same chapter, and touching a little bit on new, delete, unions, structs and classes. Maybe in a later chapter covering new, delete, unions, structs and classes in more detail, and point out how some of the standard types that have been used so far like string are implemented using classes. I don't think the approach of separating based on a specific aspect of C++ is going to be used, like seems to be done in a lot of books. Hopefully better emphasizing the importance of learning all aspects of C++ and providing a better insight of both the whole picture and C++'s parts. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:20, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

: Interesting.  The key thing, to me, is to have a coherent way of getting the first few chapters to lead people to feel that they're achieving something.  Which suggests leaving new/delete and pointers until later, as they don't add new capabilities for a while, from a beginner's perspective.  But maybe we can work awhile on sketching some plausible outlines and documenting their rationales, so choose one we would wish to pursue.  And maybe we should discuss this on a more public place than our talk pages? ;) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 23:20, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

:: We can discuss this on [[Talk:Understanding C++]] if you wish, it doesn't really mater to me, whichever you would prefer. I agree a plausible outline is needed, which is why I've been holding off adding the book to a bookshelf and making its existent more prominent.

I would love for readers to come away from every chapter feeling like they've achieved something. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:35, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

It has been awhile and I have found myself stuck on how to move forward, I still don't have a decent outline/plan/notion for tackling the subject. I know every aspect of C++ that needs to be covered, but maybe my lack of teaching experience on the topic is blocking me from seeing any easy way to teach C++. I could use your creative inspiration on this. You have mentioned using a top/down model for teaching C++. When I think of a top/down or bottom/up model I always think of a pyramid. Is a pyramid the wrong way to think about this? What do you consider to be the rough/top of the pyramid? What do you consider to be the foundation/bottom of the pyramid? How would you teach C++ using a top/down model? Can you provide some examples? I think figuring that out has turned out to be the hardest part for me. Once I have a decent idea of how to teach C++ using a top/down model, the rest in theory should come easily. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:14, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

== About manual memory management with new, delete etc. ==

James,

Could you clarify what you're basing the you finding in this section on?


&quot;Modern C++ code tends to use new quite rarely, and delete very rarely.&quot;

Wouldn't code use delete precisely the same amount as new, in order to avoid memory leaks?


&quot;Heap allocation times are much slower than allocations off the stack.&quot;

Isn't this completely negligent considering the real bottlenecks
of modern software systems on modern hardware?

&quot;However, there are still times when it's appropriate to do so&quot;

I would say that there are many more times than you lead people to believe, where it makes no sense from a design standpoint to allocate your memory off the stack, as far as object lifetime or object size is concerned.

You also make no mention of stack size limitations.

--[[User:Shomron|Shomron]] 09:21, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

: When I note that delete is &quot;used&quot; less often than &quot;new&quot;, I mean that it appears in fewer places in source code.  Obviously it must be executed the same number of times.

: In ''some'' kinds of work, heap allocation times may be negligible; in many fields, it's simply untrue that it doesn't matter.  Busy servers, embedded systems, high-performance computing, games, and more, still need to care about performance, and dynamic allocation in tight loops can be a killer.  Much of the optimization work I've done in the past has come down to reducing the amount of dynamic allocation performed (in C++, Java, C and others).  The other big bottleneck I see these days tends to be excessive synchronization between threads, or poor use of parallelism in databases, but that's an aside.

: Obviously we cannot cover every factor in choosing memory allocation patterns in a book that's intended to teach C++, otherwise we would end up teaching every related aspect of software engineering.  My note about times when it's appropriate to use heap allocation is intended to acknowledge situations such as limited stack sizes (which are common in embedded or multi-threaded applications) and others, without getting into too much distracting depth. 

: Naturally, if you think you can make the text better... it's a wiki.  Go ahead and contribute.  I'm no longer actively working on this book. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 22:18, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

I appreciate all the work you've done with this book.

Is this what you intended ? I see it as a contradiction, to include a default garbage collection into the C++ language we would not have a C++ implementation, but something else, I also attempted to locate something that validated you change and came out empty were you referring to D ? I don't think the new wording and referring other languages on that section is an improvement to clarify the point. A better place to advance that issue, if we must, would be here [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons]], see if you agree...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:26, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Yes, that's what I intended, and I was talking about C++ (certainly not D -- nothing against D, but it isn't very close to C++).  Some implementations of C++ include garbage collectors, i.e., they are &quot;garbage collected implementations of C++&quot;.  The next version of C++ is more explicit in allowing for such implementations, but they've existed for a long time. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 07:40, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

::: But if C++ is defined by the standard and the standard doesn't include any such default capabilities any deviant implementation will not be C++, right ?&lt;br&gt;
::: Can you point me to one of those implementations, as I said I searched for them and came up empty I'm curious to see if they are really labeled as C++, if so it can have a detrimental effect on the language. For what I know &quot;C++&quot; is not a trademark (brand) like &quot;Java&quot; is and so open to be abused, but I would like to think that they would clearly make a distinction that it was not an implementation of C++ but an '''extension''' to it (as defined and permitted on the standard, not everything can be added as a library), even Microsoft has done so in the past. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:50, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:::: Nothing in the C++ standard forbids garbage collection, though C++0x makes it clearer that GC is permitted (and provides some more control for it).  C++ permits garbage collection, but does not require it.  &quot;CC -library=gc&quot; is an option from Sun (see http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/libgc.html) but it's also somewhat common to use the Boehm collector  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 03:57, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

::::: Humm I think we have crossed wires somewhere. What I'm attempting to understand and to what I disagree is the wording of &quot;implementations of C++&quot; (notice that you last edit to the page added also C++ to the phrase), I don't think I'm getting the definition of garbage collecting wrong with you, from the above url &quot;Garbage collection deals with the automatic management of dynamic memory.&quot; this so far I know is excluded from the standard, that is the C++ languages doesn't define or implement it, but does support external (to the language) implementations. In the example above that compiler uses the libgc and they clearly state &quot;The library takes care of freeing memory that is not in use.&quot;.
::::: I agree with all the rest you have said on the above post. I'll retrace the steps to see were I (or you) got lost. I claim that &quot;a garbage collected implementations of C++&quot; is not a good statement, first the use of the adjective &quot;collected&quot; indicate that the actions is finished/done, literally can be read as indicating an implementation of C++ that was generated using garbage collection, this can be true but that is not very relevant to the paragraph and can be confusing, and from the argumentation above this is not what you were attempting to say, since you stated «Some implementations of C++ include garbage collectors, i.e., they are &quot;garbage collected implementations of C++&quot;», and this is incorrect, any garbage collecting mechanism incorporated into the language would by default generate a new language (or at least a new version of the language) and any external inclusion of garbage collecting capabilities would be '''extensions''' (and are permitted and defined as such in the standard), and so, the previous statement on that page &quot;C++ does allow for garbage collection, and garbage collection implementations (often based on the so-called Boehm collector) do exist&quot; seem clearer and with only a correct interpretation.
::::: Since we clearly understands the concepts and agree on the theory behind it, can you state where my rational as explained above is wrong and the downside of the statement before your last edit ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:24, 3 January 2009 (UTC)
:::::: It is idiomatic to speak of &quot;garbage-collected implementations of C++&quot;, and doesn't imply anything more than that they are (a) implementations of the C++ language and (b) they offer facilities for garbage collection.  For example, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) which says &quot;Other languages were designed for use with manual memory management, but have garbage collected implementations (e.g., C, C++).&quot;  There's a difference between saying that &quot;garbage collection implementations&quot; (i.e., implementations of garbage collection) exist and noting that &quot;garbage-collected implementation of C++&quot; (i.e., implementations of the C++ programming language that offer garbage collection support) exist.  The very fact that people mistakenly think that a C++ implementation cannot include garbage collection is why we should not write the former.   Note also: the C++ standard defines &quot;implementations&quot; which cover both language and library, as well as any underlying platform; a feature may well be implemented by a library and yet still be very much a part of the associated &quot;implementation&quot; of C++.  The original phrase used, &quot;garbage collected implementations&quot; meant &quot;implementations [of C++]&quot; implicitly, but your edit shows that it was not clear enough. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 20:50, 3 January 2009 (UTC)
::::::: Ha, yup that was it, now we identified the problem (my native language is not English), I did some searches (and looked on that Wikipedia link content), it a bit disconcerting that I've never noticed this, my education on the subjects was mostly based in English (US) literature, and have read some paper since then and never noted the wording &quot;garbage collected languages&quot; was used, and as I pointed above it doesn't seem correct English. I've learned OOP and about GC with Smalltalk, I've looked into the literature I have and it isn't never used, not even on the C++ literature, it is proper to say garbage-collected heap or class but stating that a language is garbage collected never appears and it still seems wrong, but now I understand that we were referring to the same thing. I will think in a way to extend that section in a way that this issue is made clearer, I strongly doubt that I'm alone on the literal interpretation I gave to the wording, even if your wording is commonly used (4,190-5,590 hits on google, not hugely common, but well above my option)...

::::::::: C++ already has optional support for garbage collection.  The key is that it is optional, so C++ does not lose any low-level capability as code does not have to use GC at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Design Considerations==

Designing a robot requires balance between size (mostly weight), motor power and battery power. These three elements are connected with each other (more battery power increases the weight of the robot and requires stronger motors) and finding the &quot;perfect&quot; balance requires a lot of tweaking and experimenting. Try to describe heavy components in output/mass (e.g. motors: torque/Kg; batteries: mAh/Kg) and pick the one that gives the highest value.

Using light materials brings down the weight significantly (aluminum instead of steel). Building a frame out of light metal and using plastic plates as surfaces would be a lot lighter than using metal plates. For small robots acrylic plastic is a good material to use and it is easy to work with.

There are other ways to build a robot than to cut and drill your own aluminum plates. Toys like Lego Technic and Meccano, although expensive, are an alternative when you don't have the ability to cut and drill your own parts. Especially Meccano (or better: the cheap imitations) can be useful even when you do make your own parts. There is something convenient about having a collection of parts with standard holes and sizes. Of course you would need to drill your own holes at the right distances and size, if you intend to add Meccano parts. The values can (most likely will) differ between different &quot;brands&quot; of imitations. So it's a good idea to buy a few boxes when they are on sale. Screws tend to be M5 (on the set I've seen so far this is the only value that is common. The hole spacing very rarely matches up).

Another kit that would be good to use is the Vex™ Robotic Design Kit from Radio Shack. The parts in this kit are all metal with holes predrilled every half an inch. That makes it easier to add to parts that you may already have. This kit gives you everything you need to get started with robots. If you do not want to buy the kit you could just buy the Vex™ Metal and Hardware Kit for Robotics Starter Kit.

When you start your design, first decide how big you want your robot to be. Don't think about exact sizes, compare it to the size of an object (&quot;the size of a shoe box&quot;) will be sufficient. Exact values can be &quot;calculated&quot; after you've got your motors and batteries, as these have a large influence on the size and shape of the robot.

Make an estimate about the weight of the complete robot and pick your motors and wheels. Keep in mind you need high torque and low speed. A bare DC-motor has high speed and low torque, adding a gear reduction will solve this one. Motors with reduction gears are also available. The speed of your motor and the size of your wheels determine how fast your robot will be able to move.

For example: RB-35 is a motor with a 1:50 reduction. It makes 120 RPM or 2 rounds per second. Lets pick a wheel with a diameter of 20cm (radius R = 10cm). This wheel has a circumference of 2 x &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; x R = 2 x 3.14 x 10 = 62.8cm. This means in one turn the wheel moves 62.8cm. When we mount this wheel on the motor it'll turn twice every second and therefore move 2 x 62.8cm = 125.6cm. So its speed would be 125.6cm/second or 1.256m/s.

In reality this speed is going to be a little lower as the motor turns 120RPM without a load. But even a 1 m/s is pretty fast for indoor robots. You'll probably use PWM or other methods to slow it down.

Pick your batteries. Make sure you have enough power to keep the motors and all the electronics running for a sufficient amount of time and keep some reserve for future additions.
Compare the weight of the batteries and motors you've chosen to what you had planned. You might need to go over this part again (picking different motors and/or batteries).Keep in mind that your robot's body has a significant weight.

==Platforms==
===Wheeled Platforms===
Wheeled platforms can have any number of wheels. Most common are 3, 4 and 6 wheeled vehicles (excluding wheels used for feedback). Other numbers are also possible, but can be hard to build, such as 1-wheeled or 2-wheeled robots, or have superfluous wheels which can make turning difficult or complex. Basically there are 2 types of wheels: powered wheels and unpowered wheels. The first are powered by the motors and are used to move the robot forwards (or backwards). Unpowered wheels are used to keep the robot in balance by providing a point of contact with the ground.

====Turning====
Turning can be accomplished in several different ways:

*Differential Steering (Tank-like Turning):
**Moves one wheel forward and the other backwards. The robot turns around within a small circle which center lies in between the 2 powered wheels.
**Move one wheel slower than the other, the robot turns in the direction of the slower wheel. How fast it turns depends on how large the difference between the 2 speeds is.

[[Image:Tanklike.png|center|288px|Tank-Like Steering]]

*Ackerman Steering: This is the same steering system as the one used in cars. It is relatively complicated to implement since the inner and outer wheels need to turn to different angles.

*Crab Drive: Each wheel can turn independently in crab drive steering. This can be very flexible, but requires complex mechanics which either turn the entire motor/gearbox/wheel assembly or transfer power from a statically mounted motor. The second option is much more difficult to build but may have advantages over the first.

*3-wheeled platforms: These can come in a variety of forms, with the articulated wheel powered, or with the two fixed wheels powered, or a combination of the two. These are generally built for very specific purposes.

*Omnidirectional wheels: The omnidirectional wheels design is based upon the use of a series of free turning barrel-shaped rollers, which are mounted in a staggered pattern around the periphery of a larger diameter main wheel. For this you need 4 powered wheels. However these wheels allow movement in any direction without turning (including sideways and diagonal movement) and can turn the same way as in tanklike steering. Building these wheels is time-consuming, but it's a very powerful steering method. Also, inexpensive omnidirectional wheels are available commercially, often used in conveyors. One drawback, however, is the lack of sideways traction; if something is pushing the robot to the side, it relies on the strength of the motor or brakes to restrain it. Omnidirectional wheels used in place of caster wheels can provide quicker responses and can often roll over larger obstacles.

===Tracked Platforms===
Tracked platforms use tracks similar to tanks. This kind of propulsion is only useful on loose sand and mud, as concrete and carpet provide too much horizontal traction when turning and will strip the tracks off of their guides. 

===Walkers===
Walkers are robots that use legs instead of wheels or tracks. These robots are harder to build than wheeled robots and can be a nice challenge for an experienced builder.
Walkers are designed to imitate how animals (or humans) move.

====2-Legged Walkers or Bipeds====

This is the hardest type of walker. This type tries to imitate how humans walk. The biggest issue is balance.

Two-legged walkers are used for two main purposes: to imitate humans and to provide a great amount of force and traction. Taller walkers used to imitate humans are difficult to build, requiring many balancing circuits and devices, quick motions, and precise construction. Just like any human knows, these can also be knocked over, tripped, etc. Shorter, wider walkers can be used to move a large load. When using walkers, it is possible to use pneumatic systems, which can provide a much larger force than motors. However, turning with such a system is nearly impossible. 

====4-Legged Walkers====

4 Legged walkers imitate 4 legged animals. Many of these designs end up moving one leg at a time, instead of the 2-legged movements typical of animals. It requires 3 legs to be on the ground to provide static balance. Dynamic balance moving 2 legs at a time provides faster and more fluid motion.

====6-Legged Walkers or Hexapods====
These walkers are imitations of insects. Many of these move 3-legs-at-a-time to provide static balance. Because half of the legs can be moved at one time without losing static balance, 6-legged walkers can actually be simpler to build than 4-legged. 

'''Note:''' Static balance means the construction is at all time in balance. This means that if the robot would stop moving at any time it wouldn't fall over. In contrast there is ''Dynamic Balance''. This means that the robot is only in balance when it completes its step. If it's stopped in the middle of its step it would fall over. Although this might sound like a bad thing, dynamic balance allows much faster and smoother movement, but requires sensors to sense balance. Animals and humans move with dynamic balance.

===Whegs===
There are various combinations of wheels and legs that are useful for varying terrain.  For quick details see [http://biorobots.cwru.edu/projects/whegs/whegs.html].
&lt;!-- Please complete this section.... --&gt;

===Ball Wheels===
This means of propulsion is very similar to how a classic computer mouse works: A ball is mounted in a casing in such a way that it can freely rotate in any direction. Two wheels around the ball are mounted against this ball at an angle of 90° to each other, parallel to the ground. One wheel registers the up-down movements and the other the left-right movements.

A ball wheel uses the same setup but connects the internal wheels to motors. This way the ball can be made to rotate in any direction. A robot equipped with a ball wheel can move up-down and left-right, but can't rotate around its vertical axis. Using 3 ball wheels allows rotation as well.

==Electronics==

The electronics of a robot generally fall in 6 categories: 
* Motor control: controls the movement of the motors, servos and such. Relays and PWM  H-bridges fall under this category.
* Sensor reading: reads the sensors and provides this information to the controller.
* Communication: Provides a link between controller and an external PC, another robot, or a remote control.
* Controller: microcontroller board, processor board or logic board. This part makes decisions based on sensor input and the robot's program.
* Power management: parts that provide a fixed 5VDC, 12VDC or any other level coming from the batteries. Circuits that monitor the status of the batteries.  
* Glue logic: Additional electronics that allow all the parts to be connected with each other. An example is a CMOS to TTL level converter.

Not all of these categories are present in all robots, nor does every circuit fall completely into one category. Many robots don't require a separate sensor board as a whole lot of sensors have built-in electronics which allow them to connect directly to a µcontroller/processor.

===Some Tips===
*Use low-power (or simply dimmer) LEDs. Always. This drastically reduces how much current your circuits consume. A normal LED consumes around 15 mA. A modern microcontroller consumes about the same. Disabling unneeded LEDs is advisable, but not always possible.

*Use CMOS ICs instead of classic TTL. Again this reduces current usage and allows a more relaxed supply voltage. But pay attention to their sensitivity for static electricity when soldering them.

*Use good quality IC-sockets (or better don't use IC-sockets at all). They're worth their price.

*Avoid using IC-sockets on sensitive circuits (high speed digital, clock signal and analog signals). The moving robot can shake those ICs loose over time. Using In-Circuit programmable microcontrollers removes the need to be able to unplug an IC. 

*LEDs are very practical to make slow digital signals visible, adding them on some signal lines can be interesting for testing purposes, however, they do increase power consumption. Removing them when your circuit works correctly can make it more power efficient (replace LED with a wire, replace resistor with a higher value one).

*See if your microcontrollers can run with a lower clock speed. The higher the clock speed, the more they consume.

*Use your microcontrollers sleep functions whenever possible, disable any part that isn't required (e.g. on-chip ADC).

*Learn to make PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). It's not that hard and it makes your electronics look more professional. Don't throw away your breadboard, PCBs aren't very practical for prototyping. 

*If you're up to it: build your circuits in SMD components on PCBs. This reduces size, weight, and cost. However soldering SMD ICs isn't easy. SO-packages (Small Outline) aren't too hard for an experienced builder. Smaller packages are almost impossible to do by hand. Get good soldering tools before you attempt this. For many modern SMD microcontrollers are complete build and tested board available. These can be a solution for those who don't have the equipment, expertise and patience to solder these ICs themselves. These boards don't have to be large as the demo-boards most IC developers sell, e.g. the BasicStamp is such a board with the size of an IC.

*Buy a breadboard. They're invaluable for designing and testing circuits.

*If you intent to build your own electronic circuits, invest in a dual channel oscilloscope. Single channel is very restricting. Pick one with as high a bandwidth as you can afford. At least 4x the highest signal frequency you intend to use.

*A good variable power supply is very handy to test how your circuit operates at lower voltage levels (as happens when the batteries discharge).

*If you can choose between pull-up and pull-down resistors, pick the one that uses the lowest amount of power. If the circuits output is at +5V most of the time, use pull-up, if it's 0V use pull-down. Remember that such outputs consume power when the transistor is active (when it's inactive it consumes a small amount of power: a leak current through the resistor and through the input impedance of the next circuit).

*Use high value resistors as pull-up/pull-down. But keep in mind that high speed signal lines need lower value resistor in order to minimize signal distortion.

*Most electronic components on a robot will run on a 5V supply and need a 5V regulator. Use a regulator with low dropout to prevent the 5V supply from browning out.

== Display ==

Very simple robots need only a few LEDs to show everything that it is &quot;thinking&quot;.

When trying to debug more complex robot software, it is useful for the robot to display text.
A few calculators and PDAs have a RS232 connector or some other simple way to connect to a robot.

Many robots have such a calculator or PDA or other display strapped to the top in order to show the humans what the microcontroller is &quot;thinking&quot;, which is vastly more productive than trying to guess what's going on inside that little chip of silicon.

With large robots, sometimes a full-size laptop computer is strapped on top for such display purposes.

==Mechanical Design==

===Balance===
Everybody encounters balance every day. While walking, when putting down a glass of water or in so many other ways we have to keep a balance. Now in most of these cases you wouldn't need to think about it, but when designing your robot you'll have to keep an eye on this concept. For most designs, balance isn't hard to achieve, even without doing calculations on it. A few rules of thumb suffice. For more complex designs, e.g. a robot with an arm, you can get away with just some rules of thumb and some common sense, but there's no guarantee. Doing a simple calculation would make it clear if the robot is going to stay on its wheels or if it is going to tumble over and crush whatever it was trying to pick up.

If you're into walkers, you'll need to spend more attention to balance. The fewer amount of legs you have, the more important balance becomes.  

===Simple 4-Wheeled Robots===

Achieving balance on this type of robot is pretty trivial. Keep the center of mass between the wheels (picture a rectangle between the centers of the wheels) and as low as possible. In practice it mean you should place the heavy components, e.g. the batteries, somewhat in the center of the robot and as low as possible.

===Simple 3-Wheeled Robots===

These designs are nearly as simple as 4-wheeled robots; the difference lies in that you need to keep the center of mass close to the center of the triangle formed by the wheels. If your robot is rectangular avoid placing weight at the two unsupported corners. These points are prone to making the robot tumble over.

===Wheeled robots with an arm or gripper===
For the working of an arm or a gripper, we need to take the help of a stepper motor in simple cases or use sensors in sophisticated cases.

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write さ、し、す、せ、そ. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound. Thus, adding the {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'' marks to さ、し、す、せ、and そ will produce ざ、じ、ず、ぜ、ぞ.

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write た、ち、つ、て、と. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound. Thus, adding the {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'' marks to た、ち、つ、て、and と will produce だ、ぢ、づ、で、ど.

== Clear sounds ==
{{Japanese kana
 | kana = た
 | sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;'''ta'''&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic =

:'''Note:''' In Japan, the ''t'' is crossed first, not last.
{{Japanese kana
 | kana = ち
 | sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;{{audio|Chi (Japanese).ogg|'''chi'''}}&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic =
* It's a backwards ''c'' with a cross on top.  The horizontal line is drawn first, and the backwards ''c'' is drawn in the same stroke as the vertical line of the cross.
* ''chi'' translates as ''blood'', and this is a man raising his blood pressure by yelling.
* Your little sister's birthday is today, so you write a ''5'' on the card because ''she'' is 5 years old.
* It's like a '''chi'''ld's attempt at writing a ''5''.
 | example =
* ち (chi) blood
* ちいさい (chiisai) small, little
* ちず (chizu) map
 | voiced          = ぢ
 | voiced_sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ji&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | voiced_mnemonic = 
 | voiced_example  = 
* ち&lt;u&gt;ぢ&lt;/u&gt;む (chijimu) to shrink
* ち&lt;u&gt;ぢ&lt;/u&gt;れげ (chijirege) curly hair

}}
{{Japanese kana

 | voiced_mnemonic = 
 | voiced_example  = 
* かな&lt;u&gt;づ&lt;/u&gt;ち (kanazuchi) hammer
* かん&lt;u&gt;づ&lt;/u&gt;め (kanzume) canned food
* つ&lt;u&gt;づ&lt;/u&gt;り (tsuzuri) spelling
''In modern Japanese language, no words start with &quot;づ&quot; and only few have it.''
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana = て
 | sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;'''te'''&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic = 
* Looks like the capital letter ''T''.
* It's a broken '''te'''nnis racket.
 | example =

* It resembles a toenail. When thinking of &quot;to&quot;, think toenail.
 | example =

* とこや (tokoya) barber
* とびら (tobira) door
 | voiced          = ど
 | voiced_sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;do&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | voiced_mnemonic = 
 | voiced_example  = 
* どうぐ (dougu) tool, instrument
* どうぶつ (doubutsu) animal
* どく (doku) poison
}}

== Double Consonants ==
By adding a small &quot;っ&quot; (''tsu'')  in front of a syllable, it causes the subsequent consonant to double.  This is called the sokuon ({{furi|促音|そくおん}}). This kana results in a slight pause between the two consonants (a double consonant pause). There is an exception for the kana ''ち''. Instead of having a 'cch', a ''~tch'' is used.

A couple examples are かった (''katta'') and しっけ (''shikke'').

| kana = に
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;ni&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =*It looks sort of like a knee (when you bend your leg)
|One way to remember this is to knock the 'n' over (rotate anticlock 90 degrees) then knee (ni) it horizontally to the right. Alternatively, the smilie face fell over and skinned its knee (ni).
| example =
* にる (niru) to resemble, to be similar

}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = ぬ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;nu&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
* Looks like a bowl of soup with a chopstick and noodles (nu) spilling out.
* A way to remember the difference between ぬ (''nu'') and ね (''ne'') is that ぬ is the one with the ''u'' shape (it's actually more of a ''v'') near the center of the character.
| example =
* ぬるい (nurui) lukewarm, tepid
* ぬぐ (nugu) to take off (clothing)
* ぬれる (nureru) to get wet
}}
{{Japanese kana

| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;ne&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
*It looks like the letters 't' and 'e' with the e upside down.  Add an n and you get &quot;ten&quot;.  Reverse that and you get &quot;net&quot; (ne).
*One way to remember this is to rotate the 'e' of 'ne' until it's upside down then move it under arch on the 'n', merge the right sides of both letters together and hoist a mast (+) to signal your success.
| example =
* ねん (nen) year
* ねぎ (negi) spring (green) onion
* ねだん (nedan) price, cost
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = の
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;no&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
* の is similar to the forbidden traffic symbol. Which is the main word for forbidden: NO.&lt;br /&gt;
* の looks like both an ''n'' and an ''o'' morphed together into one character. It is ''n''-shaped, but has the roundedness of an ''o''.
| example =
* の (no) of; to 
* のう(nou) Nou play; brain, memory
* のる (noru) to ride, to board
* のうみん (noumin) farmer

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write は、ひ、ふ、へ、ほ. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound. Thus, adding the {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'' marks to は、ひ、ふ、へ、and ほ will produce ば、び、ぶ、べ、ぼ.　Adding a small circle called a {{furi|半|はん}}{{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''handakuten'', but commonly known simply as a {{furi|丸|まる}} ''maru'', &quot;circle&quot; causes clear sounds to change to their plosive sound. Thus, adding a {{furi|丸|まる}} ''maru'' to は、ひ、ふ、へ、and ほ will produce ぱ、ぴ、ぷ、ぺ、ぽ.

* もん (mon) gate
* もり (mori) forest

| mnemonic =
*It's the nose and cheek of '''Ri'''chard.
*It's a '''re'''peat (ri) of い (i) with the lengths of the lines inversed.
| example =
* りんご (ringo) apple
* りす (risu) squirrel
* りゅう (ryuu) dragon
}}
'''Note:''' The handwritten form varies slightly from the printed form り
{{Japanese kana
| kana = る
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;{{audio|Ru (Japanese).ogg|'''ru'''}}&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
* The arm and closed fist of a student who has to hold buckets of water out in the hall because he broke the '''ru'''les.
* A boat hit a message in a '''ru'''m bottle (the upper part being the boat, the lower the corked bottle).

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write &quot;や&quot;, &quot;ゆ&quot; and &quot;よ&quot;.

{{Japanese kana
| kana =や
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;ya&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic = Someone shouting 'Ya!' as they punch through a board.
| example =
* やま (yama) mountain
* やえいち (yaeichi) campsite
* やせい (yasei) wild, rough
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana =ゆ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;yu&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
* Picture a monkey sitting on a curled tree trunk. The monkey says, &quot;Hey you!&quot; (yu).
* It could also be '''you''' with your arm around another's arm.
* '''You''' are cutting up a fish.
| example =
* ゆらぐ (yuragu) to tremble
* ゆめ (yume) dream
* ゆげ (yuge) steam
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana =よ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;yo&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic =
* '''Yoyo''' - It's a hand playing a yoyo. First you draw the hand, and then the yoyo itself.
* Alternatively, imagine a Y conjoined with an O.
| example =
* よこう (yokou) rehearsal
* ようかい (youkai)  ghost, demon
* よあけ (yoake) dawn
}}

== Yōon Hiragana ==
Certain sounds ending with -い(i) ( き(ki), し(shi), ち(chi), に(ni), ひ(hi), み(mi), り(ri) and their voiced variants) can be followed by small versions (ゃ, ゅ, and ょ) of the hiragana や(ya), ゆ(yu), and よ(yo). In this case, the two hiragana are not pronounced individually, but rather as one sound.

In most cases, the compound sound is the consonant of the base syllable followed by the modifier (''fjord'' may be an example of a similar compound sound in English):
: きゃ (kya)
: きゅ (kyu)
: きょ (kyo)

In other cases the y sound disapears entirely:
: しゃ (sha)
: しゅ (shu)
: しょ (sho)
Look at the [[Japanese/Kana Chart|Kana Chart]] for the others.

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write &quot;わ&quot;, &quot;を&quot; and &quot;ん&quot;.

{{Japanese kana
| kana = わ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;wa&lt;/big&gt;
| mnemonic = The second part drawn looks like a '''wa'''shing motion or the &quot;'''wa'''x on, '''wa'''x off&quot; motion from The Karate Kid.
| The two perpendicular lines are the end of a pier being hit by a wave of '''wa'''ter.
| example =
* わし 鷲(washi) eagle
* わに 鰐(wani) alligator
* わるい 悪い(warui) bad
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = を
| sound = Similar to &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;o&lt;/big&gt;.  When spoken, the mouth is shaped as if saying 'w', and a trace of the 'w' appears in the sound so in English it is often written 'wo'.  The 'w' is particularly noticeable when the preceding word ends in 'n', for example in パンを食べる meaning ''to eat bread''.  
| mnemonic =
| A man stepping into  a bending river.  &quot;Whoa, it's cold.&quot;
| example =
* を (wo or o)  a particle introducing an object
* すさのを - Susano(w)o, an ancient god of the storms and seas
}}
'''Note:''' The &quot;を&quot; syllable is used only for the object marker particle. No other word is written with &quot;を&quot;.
{{Japanese kana
| kana = ん
| sound = Can sound like an &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;ng&lt;/big&gt;, or &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;m&lt;/big&gt; sound, depending on what consonant follows it (for example, if a &quot;p&quot; follows, this sound will be an &quot;m&quot;).  Because there is little differentiation between these sounds in Japanese, using &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/big&gt; for all examples will still be clearly understood.
| mnemonic = '''N''' - It looks like a badly drawn n from the Roman alphabet. The stem is too long and the tail extends too far.
| example =
* お&lt;u&gt;ん&lt;/u&gt;な 女(onna) woman
* さ&lt;u&gt;ん&lt;/u&gt;ご 珊瑚(sango) coral
* さ&lt;u&gt;ん&lt;/u&gt;そ 酸素(sanso) oxygen
}}
'''Note:''' No word starts with &quot;ん&quot;.

* ウィスキー (uisukii) whisky
}}
{{Japanese kana
| kana = エ

| mnemonic =
* Someone cut an 'E' in half, right through the middle of the second line, and pivoted the top half to rest on the ground.
* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  is the symbol for '''e'''lectric current.
| example =

{{Japanese kana
| kana = オ
| sound = &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;o&lt;/big&gt;

* オレンジ (orenji) Orange
}}

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write カ、キ、ク、ケ、コ. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound. Thus, adding the {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'' marks will cause カ、キ、ク、ケ、コ to be produced ガ、ギ、グ、ゲ、ゴ.

{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = カ
 | sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ka&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic = Like the か (ka) of Hiragana, just missing the extra stroke on the right.
 | example  =
* カナダ (kanada) Canada
* カメラ (kamara) camera
* カカオ (kakao) cacao
 | voiced          = ガ

* ガバナンス (gabanansu) governance
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = キ
 | sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ki&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic = Another '''key''', now just the top half.
 | example  =
* キルギズタン (kirugizustan) Kyrgyzstan
* キウイ (kiui) kiwi
* キス (kisu) kiss
 | voiced          = ギ
 | voiced_sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;gi&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | voiced_example  =
* ギア　(gia) gear
* ギアナ (giana) Guiana
* ギフト (gifuto) gift

{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = ク
 | sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ku&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic =

* The handle of a '''cu'''p
* '''Coo'''kie with a bite taken out of it, held in the lower left corner.
 | example  =
* クウェート (kueeto)　Kuwait
* クリック (kurikku) click
* クローン (kuroon) clone
 | voiced          = グ

 | voiced_example  =
* グアバ (guaba) guava
* グリーン (guriin) green
* グアム (guamu) Guam
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = ケ
 | sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ke&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic =
* Looks like a &quot;K&quot; tilted to the side. Just pronounce the K with a Japanese accent so its &quot;ke&quot;.
* You '''gue'''ssed wrong.  This isn't a pigeon wing but a bat wing, because it has a claw; the bat lives in a '''ca'''ve
 | example  =
* ケベック (kebekku) Quebec
* ケーブル (keeburu) cable
* ケーキ  (keeki) cake
 | voiced          = ゲ
 | voiced_sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ge&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | voiced_example  =
* ゲゲゲ (gegege) sound used to signify cackling
* ゲノム (genomu) genome
* ゲリラセン (gerirasen) guerilla warfare
}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = コ
 | sound    = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ko&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 | mnemonic =
* Like the hiragana こ, but connected at the right hand side.  The bottom stroke was to be a '''co'''py of the top one but ran out of room.
* It's the side-view of a '''go'''pher's burrow.
* Looks like the '''co'''rners of the edge of a table.
 | example  =
* コンゴ (kongo) Congo

* コンピュータ (konpyuuta) computer
 | voiced          = ゴ

 | voiced_example  =
* ゴブレット (goburetto) goblet
* ゴブリン (goburin) goblin
* ゴジラ (gojira) Godzilla

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write サ、シ、ス、セ、ソ. Adding two small lines called {{furi|濁|だく}}{{furi|点|てん}} ''dakuten'', but commonly known simply as {{furi|点々|てんてん}} ''tenten'', meaning &quot;two marks&quot;, causes clear sounds to change to their voiced sound.

Below we'll be looking into the characters &quot;ヤ&quot;, &quot;ユ&quot; and &quot;ヨ&quot;. These are transliterated as &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot; and &quot;yo&quot;, respectively.

{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = ヤ

 | mnemonic = 
* A black-belt yelling ' '''Ya'''!' as they jab with their elbow.
* Looks very similar to the hiragana version of it (や).

}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = ユ
 | sound    =
 | mnemonic =
*'''U'''seless - Someone tried to draw a tilted Y and a U at the same time, but it's useless because it doesn't look like either.
* '''You''' are going to be hung at the gallow.
* '''U for U-Boat''' - The first stroke is the periscope and the second one is Ocean's surface
 | example  =

* ユーロ Euro

}}
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     = ヨ
 | sound    =
 | mnemonic = * '''Yo'''del - The mouth and tongue of a yodeler.&lt;br /&gt;
 | example  =
* ヨーロッパ Europe
* ヨーグルト yoghurt
* ヨーヨー yo-yo
}}

== Choon Katakana ==

Certain sounds ending with -イ(i) ( キ(ki), シ(shi), チ(chi), ニ(ni), ヒ(hi), ミ(mi), レ(re) and their variations) can be followed by small versions (ャ, ュ, and ョ) of the katakana ヤ(ya), ユ(yu), and ヨ(yo). In this case, the two katakana are not pronounced individually, but rather as one sound, taking up one mora.

In most cases, the compound sound is the consonant of the base syllable followed by the modifier (''fjord'' may be an example of a similar compound sound in English):
* キャ (kya)
* キュ (kyu)
* キョ (kyo)
In other cases the y sound disapears entirely:
* シャ (sha)
* シュ (shu)
* ショ (sho)
Look at the [[Japanese/Kana Chart|Kana Chart]] for the others.

== healthy/healthful ==

See here: http://www.grammarerrors.com/wordchoice.html

Granted, the distinction is often ignored in recent years, but it's a good distinction to make.
I never eat healthy food, excepting bean sprouts and alfalfa sprouts I guess. Most of my food is dead.

yes, that's why i stopped and asked, if u dont find that, [[Japanese/Discussion|here]] is what i asked. thx for ur concerns. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 13:10, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Why this work needs to be written and read==

There is not, as far as I know, a really nice logic introduction available either on line or in print.  So it is time to try to write one.  I learned bits and pieces from here and there, and then struggled a bit when I went to a postgraduate logic class.  For me, this book review is a journey of discovery, to write it I need to know ''exactly'' how all the pieces fit together, and it is fun to identify gaps in my knowledge and then see how they can be filled.

I do not have the solution to all the world's problems, but believe that people will be better equipped to handle them if they know just a bit about the reasoning process.  If this book review helps a few people do that, I would be delighted.  Of course, knowledge and learning can be used to build more lethal weapons and more oppressive tyrannies, but it can also be used to stop such things.  I put my faith in reason and in human kindness, since if these are false gods, there isn't much hope for us anyway.

==Wiki and Myself==

I have put most of the effort into this so far, and see that this will remain the case for some time, so I consider it to be 'my' work, warts and all.  I have seen this introduction to logic grow from a red link going nowhere to the state it is today.  However wiki is a collective effort, so some would say that it would be unfair to call the work 'mine'.  The genitive case is fraught with ambiguity.  If you want to chip in, please do.  There are at the moment places where results are stated but proofs need to be written out, for example.
   
I use the word 'I' alot.  This keeps the style informal and accessible whereas using the passive voice would not.  Anyway, to make a brave philosophical assertion, speakerless propositions are a myth, so there is always a first person even if this is not made explicit.  (Well, we could talk about the status of computer-generated messages, or of stones on the beach just happening to arrange themselves into a well-formed sentence.)

==Logic and Mathematics==

When doing maths, the issue of whether propositions have speakers might not be so important as when we are talking about other things.  Logic needs to develop beyond the (relatively) safe domain of mathematics to deal with propositions which may be empirical, moral, emotional, aesthetic, etc.  My background however is in this mathematical tradition, and this is what I feel most competent to write about.  Further, the idea of a logic wikibook is revolutionary enough - a logic wikibook introduction which did not deal with the traditional math-centred core of logic would be just too revolutionary to be accepted.

Logicians sometimes try to mathematize reason, and sometimes they try to reason about mathematics.  Both are worthy aims, but we should remember that the latter aim is limited in its scope.  It can lead to difficulties when people do try to apply the principles which work so well within mathematics to things outside.  For example: the use of quantifiers to put differential and integral calculus on a sound conceptual footing is a rather neat achievement, while the use of quantifiers in Russell's theory of descriptions can appear to be rather clumsy by contrast, though Russell is to be commended for making the attempt.

==Work That Needs Doing==

There are whole chapters up for grabs.  I'm just working on the propositional calculus at the moment.  When I have done that I could write the predicate calculus chapter, but if you think you are up to this task, feel free.  Or you could start a new chapter, to go after the predicate calculus chapter, which proves Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and then discusses the far-reaching purported implications of this result.  If you wait long enough, I might do this myself, but I may find myself working right at the horizon of my abilities.

I would be delighted if anyone could take on the responsibility of writing about tense logic, modal logic, or any other kind of logical calculus, and will be one of your first readers.  Also classical logic needs to be written about, so far it tersely says what needs to be said before the exposition of propositional calculus can start.

==Prerequisites==

This is an introduction, so I assume as little as possible.  I try not to produce a wall of opaque jargon, and explain terms as I go along.  English may not be the first language of all readers, the writing therefore has to be plain but precise.  As a large part of what we are doing could be described as producing a mathematical model of the reasoning process, some mathematical ability will be needed.  If you can add, subtract, multiply and divide then you have enough.  If you know who Euclid was, so much the better.

==Acknowledgments==

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Japanese language uses three different systems for writing. There are two syllabaries&amp;mdash;''hiragana'' and ''katakana''&amp;mdash;which have characters for each basic [[../Pronunciation#Mora|mora]] (syllable.) Along with the syllabaries, there are also ''kanji'', which is a writing system based on Chinese characters. However, kanji have changed since their adoption, so it would not be recommended to learn them both Chinese and Japanese writing at the same time. 

== Kanji ==
{{wikipedia|kanji}}
{{further|Japanese/Kanji|l1=Kanji}}
The kanji are [[w:Logogram|logograms]] (pictures representing words), or symbols, that each represent a [[w:morpheme|morpheme]] (words or parts of words.) Usually, each kanji represents a native Japanese morpheme as well as a loaned Chinese morpheme. This means that each kanji usually has two or more different pronunciations. The different pronunciations of a particular {{furi|漢字|かんじ}}　(''kanji'') are called “readings.” It may seem daunting at first, but with extensive practice, knowing when to use which pronunciation will become second nature.

A 漢字 usually has two types of readings:
* {{furi|音読み|おんよみ}} (''on'yomi'')
* {{furi|訓読み|くんよみ}} (''kun'yomi'')

音読み readings are approximations of the Chinese pronunciations of that particular 漢字. This reading is mostly used for multi-kanji compound words, except for peoples' surnames where 訓読み-reading is used. A kanji may have multiple 音読み. Some kanji are of Japanese origin and thus do not have on-reading. 訓読み readings are the native Japanese sound(s) associated with that 漢字. There can be multiple or no kun readings for the same kanji. 

Although there are over 50,000 漢字, the Japanese government has approved 1,945 so-called “daily use” 漢字, known as {{furi|常用漢字|じょうようかんじ}} (''[[w:Jōyō kanji|jōyō kanji]]'') for publications, but usually about 3000 are recognized by an average adult.

== Kana ==
{{wikipedia|kana}}
[[File:Hiragana origin.svg|thumb|270px|right|The Chinese characters from which the modern ''hiragana'' characters are derived. At the top of every triplet is the original Chinese character, in the middle is a simplified cursive form, and at the bottom is the modern day ''hiragana''.]]
{{further|Japanese/Kana|l1=Kana}}
While Chinese characters are useful for writing a language with so many homophones, the inflections of the Japanese language make it necessary to have a phonetic script to indicate the inflection. A set of Chinese characters, the [[w:Man'yougana|man'yōgana]], were used to represent pronunciation and write words that lacked Chinese characters. Around 800 A.D. these had developed into the cursive ''hiragana'' script.

This method of writing was used primarily for poetry or by women, and did not gain recognition as an acceptable way to record historical records or scholarly works.{{citation needed}}

Another script, the ''katakana'' also developed from Chinese characters, some from the same source as the ''hiragana'', but others from different ones. This explains the similarities between some hiragana and katakana, while others are completely different. The katakana is primarily used for foreign loan-words. In other words, the katakana syllabary can be said to be the japanese writing equivalent of writing in ''italics''. 

The two are collectively known as the ''kana'' ({{furi|仮名|かな}}, ''e.'' false name). Both are syllabaries, so there are no isolated consonants, with one exception; the ''moraic nasal'', which sounds similar to most pronunciations of the latin character “n.” Each of the kana contains 45 characters and are typically listed in a table formation called ''gojūonzu'' ({{furi|五十|ごじゅう}}{{furi|音図|おんず}}, ''e.'' fifty sounds illustration) but the '''''yi, ye, wi, wu, we''''' sounds are obsolete in modern Japanese, so in fact only '''45''' sounds exist. '''''n''''' is not counted because it does not constitute a mora.

{{see also|Japanese/Kana Chart}}

== Punctuation ==
{{Japanese related|vocabulary|
* [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Punctuation]]
}}
Common punctuation marks are the comma &quot;、&quot; which connects two sentences, and the full stop &quot;。&quot; which indicates the end of a sentence. To separate words that the reader might not otherwise know how to read (most often in the case of foreign words written consecutively in katakana), a middle point &quot;・&quot; is used. Instead of quotation marks, the brackets &quot;「&quot; and &quot;」&quot; are used.

=== Examples ===
{| {{Japanese example}}
| 「ウィキペディアは、オンライン百科事典である。」 || (Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.)
|-
| 「キャント・バイ・ミー・ラヴ」  || (Can't buy me love) (Kyanto·bai·mī·ravu)
|}

== Latin alphabet ==
The [[w:Rōmaji|Latin alphabet]] (ローマ字, ''rōmaji'') is not part of the Japanese language but it is used as a fashionable way of writing words, mostly nouns such as the name of a company, business, sports team, etc. Rōmaji is also used for the transliteration of Japanese and to input Japanese text online and in word processors. There are two competing transliteration methods: the [[w:Kunrei-shiki|Kunrei-shiki]] developed by the Japanese government in the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and taught in elementary school; and the more widely used [[w:Hepburn romanization|Hepburn-shiki]] developed by Reverend James Curtis Hepburn in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.

== Stroke order ==

Japanese characters  were originally written by brush, and later by pen and pencil, so the stroke order is important.  When writing by hand, and particularly in cursive or calligraphic styles, using proper stroke order is crucial.  Additionally, some characters look very similar but are written differently.  Students who practice both reading and writing can easily distinguish these characters, but students who only practice reading may find it difficult.

The [[East Asian Calligraphy]] wikibook has some material on stroke orders.

== Mixed usage and notes of interest ==
There are instances where kanji, hiragana, and katakana may be replaced by another writing style. Frequently, words that have kanji are written in hiragana. Some kanji are simply rarely used but their reading is known. The swallow is called ''tsubame'' and has the kanji &quot;燕&quot;, but since it is obscure, the word will generally be written out with hiragana: &quot;つばめ&quot;.

[[File:Furigana example.png|thumb|right|Reading given on top of kanji.]]
When writing for an audience that isn't expected to know certain kanji (such as in texts aimed at young people or kanji outside the standard set), their reading is often added on top of, or to the right of the characters, depending on whether they are written horizontally or vertically, respectively. This form of writing is called ''furigana'' (振り仮名) or ''yomigana'' (読み仮名).

Since kanji can have several different readings, it may not be straightforward to determine how to read a certain word. This problem is particularly pronounced in place names where readings may be highly irregular and archaic.

Though katakana are principally used for loan words from other languages, it can be used for stylistic purposes. Either to highlight a certain word, or give it a different feel (e.g. make it look more hip). Furthermore, since some personal names don't have kanji, but are written in hiragana, personal name readings are generally written in katakana to indicate that these are not the name itself, but simply the pronunciation.

=== Ateji ===
The word &quot;club&quot;, as it is borrowed from English, will typically be written in katakana as クラブ; however, the kanji 倶楽部 ''kurabu'' will also sometimes be used; this use of kanji for phonetic value is called 当て字 ''[[w:ateji|ateji]].'' Other times, typically in older texts, grammatical particles are also written in kanji, as in 東京迄行く ''Tokyo made iku'' ([I] go to Tokyo), where まで ''made'' (to/till) is written in kanji (迄) instead of hiragana.

== Numerals ==
The Arabic numerals, called Arabia sūji (アラビア数字) or san'yō sūji (算用数字) in Japanese, are used in most circumstances (e.g. telephone numbers, pricing, zip codes, speed limit signs and percentages). Kanji numerals can still be found, however, in more traditional situations (e.g. on some restaurant menus, formal invitations and tomb stones).

|}

== Vertical and horizontal writing, and page order ==
Traditionally, Japanese is written in a format called 縦書き ''tategaki'', or '''vertical writing'''. In this format, the characters are written in columns going from top to bottom. The columns are ordered from right to left, so at the bottom of each column the reader returns to the top of the next column on the left of the preceding one. This copies the column order of Chinese. 

Modern Japanese also uses another writing format, called 横書き ''yokogaki'', or '''horizontal writing'''. This writing format is identical to that of European languages such as English, with characters arranged in rows which are read from left to right, with successive rows going downwards. 

There are no set rules for when each form has to be used, but usage tends to depend on the medium, genre, and subject. Tategaki is generally used to write essays, novels, poetry, newspapers, comics, and Japanese dictionaries. Yokogaki is generally used to write e-mails, how-to books, and scientific and mathematical writing (mathematical formulas are read from left to right, as in English).

Materials written in tategaki are bound on the right, with the reader reading from right to left and thus turning the pages from left to right to progress through the material. Materials written with yokogaki are bound on the left and the pages are turned from right to left, as in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">¡Bienvenido! Espero que te quedes por aquí una temporada, a ver si entre todos conseguimos sacar adelante este proyecto :)

Veo que el Departamento ''subordinado'' que has creado no coincide en formato con como lo estamos haciendo en el [[Wikiversidad:Departamento de Química]]. El tema de escoger los nombres más adecuados, y relacionarlos entre sí de forma efectiva es complejo, será cuestión de pensarlo, encontrar la mejor manera (quizá podamos mirar cómo lo hacen en la [[Wikiversity]] y homogeneizar. En cualquier caso, no hay mucha prisa, ya que nos esperan al menos dos mudanzas: una para irnos a es.wikibooks.org (espero que en las próximas semanas como tarde) y otra, cuando nos den un dominio propio y nos independicemos de wikibooks (espero que para el 2005, si crecemos lo suficiente).

Bueno, pues ¡enhorabuena y adelante! :-D -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 20:32, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

La organización está por hacer. Cuando esté claro cuántos y quienes vais a trabajar de normal en vuestro área, ya os aclararéis con la estructura por departamento (y, entre vosotros y los de las otras áreas, buscamos una forma de organizarnos que nos satisfaga a todos). Creo que vamos por buen camino, ahora hay que seguir organizándo los departamentos, diseñando programas, recogiendo (o creando, cuando haga falta) bibliografía de la wikipedia y de wikilibros, e incluso ir proponiendo cursos. ¡Y en breve [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikilibros:Caf%C3%A9#Actividad_en_la_Wikiversidad nos mudamos a wikilibros]! -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 12:08, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</text>

== Picking back up ==
It looks like this has been mostly abandoned.  Right now, I have a couple of hours a day to dedicate.  I'm including this in my continued education of A+ Certification training, and hope to be able to pass this information to others in the future.  If anyone else wants to help, I'll greatly appreciate it.  I separated the book into parts, so if you just want to pick up a part and edit it or dump info, that would be awesome.  

Although the knowledge is encyclopedic in nature, let's try to keep a narrative throughout the book.  Also, my ideas may not be the best, so please '''&lt;u&gt;BE BOLD&lt;/u&gt;!''' [[User:SweBers|SweBers]] ([[User talk:SweBers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SweBers|contribs]]) 13:51, 21 April 2015 (UTC)

== I would, but... ==

I would help, but I found this because I need to learn all of it. I will definitely contribute some basics once I learn (and pass) the A+ test. Until then, I'll see if I can recruit others to contribute. In september, I go back to school, and I'm pretty sure I could get a teacher to help out (the one who teaches A+ certification, of course)

=I'll help=
I'm just about to pass the A+ soon, and time allowing I'll try to make a few additions to the hardware section. 

* --[[User:asm2750|asm2750]]

Well I'm now certified, I guess I'll put some of my knowledge into this book, hopefully we can get the hardware portion done by December since its a lot of info to go over.

== Perhaps I could help. ==

I've practically completed quite a few certifications and is currently writing a formal book on hardware. drop me an e-mail if you are interested. I'm also looking for some geeks out there that can truly contribute to some real techno discussions and ideas.

== Multi-Page Format ==

This monolithic page structure isn't working for this book anymore, so I propose that we start a project to break up this book into several pages, with a centralized table of contents, and maybe even a title page. Here are my ideas for the different pages that we can break this book into. In general it is a good idea to have enough material on a page to make it substantial, but not too much that the page becomes gigantic.

#What is A+?/Introduction
#Computer Hardware Basics (CPU, RAM, Sockets, Chipsets, Peripherals, etc)
#Computer Resources (IRQ, I/O Ports, Reserved Memory Ranges, etc)
#Busses (ISA, PCI, AGP, USB, ect)
#Drives: Maintenance (fdisk, checkdisk, defrag, etc)
#Drives: Hardware (IDE, SCSI, RAID)
#Printers (installation, Terminology)
#Hardware Installation/upgrading
#Troubleshooting/Preventative Maintenance
#Microsoft Windows
#OS Utilities
#Boot Process
#Basic Networking

This is just a basic outline so far, and other people should feel free to comment on it, or to edit it. Also, if the major contributors here are against such an action, say so here, and I will abandon the idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)


14. Review Questions

:I second the multipage translation, it would make additions and navigation much easier [[User:Califman831|Califman831]] 20:48, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

:I like this layout.  It reminds me of the Network+ Wikibook layout and I think ti would be much easier to follow.  I will try to contribute some time into improving this. -- Gadwil 10:30, 31 May 2011 (UTC -5)

:I also agree we should have multiple pages.  A+ certification is much too broad to keep on one page.  The problem is, the exam seems to be changing faster than the page can keep up.  My vote is to rename the book to the current exam, A+ Certification 220-801/802, and then copy over whatever is relevant to the next exam so that we do not mix irrelevant information with the core material we are attempting to provide.

:A second question is whether we can provide the exam objectives, or whether we should just link to where they can be found and structure the book around these objectives.  I like the idea of WhiteKnight's structure, but the structure is already outdated.  Each chapter could get its own page, but we could be looking at 80 chapters between both exams.  {{Not Sure}} --[[User:SweBers|SweBers]] ([[User talk:SweBers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SweBers|contribs]]) 16:22, 10 April 2015 (UTC)

I addded the split tag to the page.  Waiting for someone to approve the edit. --[[User:SweBers|SweBers]] ([[User talk:SweBers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SweBers|contribs]]) 20:34, 13 April 2015 (UTC)

In adding new content, I've determined that this should be split into numerous pages, with a hierarchical structure, and a link from one page to the next.  
*Page 1 should be an overview, page 2 should outline the Objectives, and double as a TOC for the entire book.  
*Since there are two tests, the book should be split between the two.  
*The tone should be informative and friendly.  
**Many times, the material becomes so dry that it is hard to concentrate.  
*We should describe the hardware and what is pertinent to the exam, then link to the Wikipedia page for further detail.  
**I've seen sidebars on Wikipedia stating that there is a book about a subject, so I wonder if we can't get a similar sidebar from one page to the next.[[User:SweBers|SweBers]] ([[User talk:SweBers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SweBers|contribs]]) 17:28, 20 April 2015 (UTC)

== I took the test ==


I just took the hardware test and the questions focus mainly on network connections, I/O ports, and printers.

== Rearranged page ==

This could be a very useful book, but it is just a mess of impertinent, sloppily organized information. I made a start to the organization, but it needs lots of help. [[User:J. Finkelstein|J. Finkelstein]] 01:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== I would like to help ==

I'm taking the exam next week, so I would like to help on this.  Tell you all what, if its alright with everybody, I'll work on the boot process.  If I don't get a reply from anybody, then I will go ahead and get started. Start with baby steps, work my way up.

Reply:

Right now this wiki states that the power supply is one of the components tested during the POST test. 

I believe this is inaccurate. Im pretty sure this is one of the questions on the A+ test.

There is no need to test the power supply because the post will not start until the correct voltage is registed by the power good wire. 

Anyway, good work this is a useful wiki.

== I Going To Take the Test==

I am planning to learn and take the test before the end of the year.  This is because certification process is changing in 2011 to where have to renew every three years.  I already have a Degree in Information Technology.  I realize page is not updated to new standards and objectives of the test.

 * --[[User:kimiko127|kimiko127]]

Error on my part, wrong discussion.

==Cyberman Gave Up==
I gave up on this wikibook. Blah. I would need the work of probably 20+ people to actually build this. --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 08:48, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)
:@Cyberman no disrespect intended moving your comment.  I moved this to the bottom of the page because it is a negative statement that might put somebody off helping.  I am currently working on the project, and any help is greatly appreciated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section serves both to combine the knowledge from the previous chapters and to review it. Prolog is first explained in more detail, true to its basic structure, and then a small program is presented that combines the knowledge from the previous chapters.

== Prolog ==

A Prolog program consists of a database of rules. These rules are loaded into the compiler. The user can then run queries on the database. The compiler will try to prove that the query is true.

Everything in Prolog is described in logic (Prolog logic is variant of classic predicate- or first order logic). Starting from the atoms (the smallest bits) these are the most important logical symbols that make up a Prolog program or query. 

=== constants ===
These consist of one or more lowercase characters, starting with a letter. A constant is not made up of other Prolog symbols (it's an atom) and it does not represent anything in the Prolog world except itself. A good way to think of atoms is as the objects of the prolog world. They have no meaning attached to them.
Examples of valid constants:
 foo
 cd_p0345
 a
 dirk

=== Variables ===
Variables are containers. They can represent pretty much any Prolog structure, from constants to predicates. Variables consist of one or more lower- or uppercase characters, starting with an uppercase letter. It's important to note that variables function differently in Prolog than in most programming languages. You do not assign a value to them and then use them, various values are assigned to them by Prolog when you run a query to try and make the query true.
Examples of valid variables:
 B
 Parent
 Result

=== Predicates ===
Predicates consist of a functor (one or more lowercase characters, starting with a letter), possibly followed by a number of terms between brackets, separated by commas. A predicate is either true or false, based on its terms. 
Examples of valid predicates:
 childof(Child, Father)
 predicate(dog(x), cat(Y))
 architect(a_vandelay)
 termless_predicate

=== Functions ===
A function is built up the same way as a predicate, but instead of being false or true, it can represent anything a variable can represent. For instance, the function sqrt(A), will return the square root of whatever number A represents.

=== Atomic Sentences ===
An atomic sentence is the smallest part in a prolog program that can take on the meaning true or false. All predicates are atomic sentences. Some other Prolog statements, such as unification (=) are atomic sentences as well.
Examples of atomic sentences:
 childof(george_w_b, george_b)
 A = tan(B, C) + D

=== Sentences (and connectives) ===
Sentences are Prolog constructions that can take on the meaning true or false. Atomic Sentences are of course sentences. Other sentences (i.e., non-atomic ones) are comprised of atomic sentences joined together by '''connectives'''. The most important connective in Prolog is , (the &quot;and&quot; connective). If a sentence joins two atomic sentences with a comma, the sentence will be true if (and only if) both atomic sentences are true. Most sentences in Prolog are just a number of predicates with comma's between them, indicating that all atomic sentences need to be true for this sentence to be true.
''Note: The other connectives, important though they are, will come up later.''
Examples of sentences.
 childof(a, b), male(a), female(b)
 A = B * 3, even(A)
 dog(poochie), cat(scratchy), mouse(itchy)

=== Rules ===

A rule is a special type of sentence. It has a predicate on the left, and a sentence on the right separated by '''&lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt;'''. It's concluded by a period. Sentences are the lines in a Prolog program. A rule states that the predicate is true if the sentence is true. If there are variables in the rule, then the predicate is true for any instantiation of the variables for which the sentence is true.
A rule with no sentence after the predicate (and thus, no '''&lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt;''') is called a '''fact''' and is considered true as is.
''Every sentence in a Prolog program is a rule.''

Examples of rules.
 mother(A) :- has_child(A), female(A).
 car(porsche).
 equal(X, X).

=== Terms ===

A term is any Prolog construct representing an object. Constants and functions are always terms and variables can represent terms.

Other Prolog concepts are explained in the [[Prolog/Glossary|Glossary]].

== The Prolog Compiler ==

The Prolog compiler allows users to run '''queries''' on a database of rules (a Prolog program). Queries are special types of rules, with no predicate before the '''&lt;/code&gt;:-&lt;code&gt;'''. Once a query is entered, Prolog will check if it's true, given that the rules in the database are true. If the query has variables, Prolog will attempt to find an instantiation of the variables that will make the query true.

This instantiating of variables is based on the process of unification. If Prolog is trying to verify the query '''&lt;code&gt;:- a(X).&lt;/code&gt;''' and encounters the rule '''&lt;code&gt;a(a).&lt;/code&gt;''' in the database, it will unify the variable X with the constant a. In other words, it will instantiate the variable X to the value a. Since a(a) is true, Prolog will return X = a as a solution. Unification takes two predicates and sees if one can be used to instantiate the variables of the other. The following two predicates unify:

 p(A, y)
 p(z, B)
 unification: A = z, B = y

As do these:

 q(A, [y,z,C])
 q(x, B)
 unification: A = x, B = [y,z,C]

However, these will not unify:

 q(A, A)
 q(x, y)

This is because A can be x or y, but not both.
These on the other hand:
 
 q(A, B)
 q(x, x)

will unify, because two different variables can be bound to the same constant.

If Prolog is trying to verify the query '''&lt;code&gt;:- b(X).&lt;/code&gt;''' and encounters the rule '''&lt;code&gt;b(A) :- c(A).&lt;/code&gt;''' It will unify the variable X to the variable A. Neither of the variables are instantiated yet (i.e., have values assigned to them) but they are bound to each other, they can only be instantiated to the same value. Prolog will now add '''&lt;code&gt;c(A)&lt;/code&gt;''' to its list of queries to verify. If it encounters the rule '''&lt;code&gt;c(c) :- d.&lt;/code&gt;''' in the database, it will (temporarily) instantiate A with c, and try to verify d. If d succeeds, Prolog will return '''&lt;code&gt;X = c&lt;/code&gt;''' as a solution to the original query, if Prolog can't find anything in the database that makes d true, Prolog will forget this rule and try to make '''&lt;code&gt;c(A)&lt;/code&gt;''' true some other way. This is known as '''backtracking'''.

== An example program ==

The following program checks if the sum of a list of numbers equals zero:

&lt;pre&gt;
sum_is_zero(List) :- 
	sum(List, Sum),			% Sum is the sum of the List
	Sum = 0.			% Sum needs to be 0


sum([], 0).				% the sum of an empty list is always 0 (stop predicate)

sum([FirstNumber|Tail], Sum) :-		% The list is split into its first number and its tail
	sum(Tail, TailSum),		% TailSum is the sum of the tail
	Sum is FirstNumber + TailSum.	% Add the first number to that to get the Sum of the list.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first rule in the program is pretty straightforward. It sums the list, using the sum predicate, and checks if it's equal to zero. The second two rules constitute the sum predicate. The first rule is the stop predicate. It simply states that an empty list has a sum of 0. 
The second rule first splits its list into a FirstNumber (the first number in the list, the 'head') and a Tail (the rest of the list). It calculates the sum of the tail recursively, and adds the first number to the sum of the tail.


Some queries:
&lt;pre&gt;
?- sum_is_zero([1, -1]).
Yes

?- sum_is_zero([1, 1, -2]).
Yes

?- sum([-1.5, 2.7849, 3.383724], A).
A = 4.66862 ;
No

?- sum([-1.5, 2.7849, 3.383724], 42).
No
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Examples ==

== Exercises ==

(1) Which of the following predicate pairs unify? If they do, give the instantiation of the variables, if they don't, explain why not.

 1 child_of(M, P)
   child_of(martha, doug)
 2 dog(A)
   dog(B)
 3 f(X, Y, e, Z)
   f(a, b, d, c)
 4 r(D, F)
   r(p, c(martha, D))

*3500s - The Sumerians develop ''cuneiform'' writing and the Egyptians develop ''hieroglyphic'' writing.
*1500s - The Phoenicians develop an alphabet
*600-500 - Hebrew scholars make use of simple [[../Substitution cipher/ | monoalphabetic substitution ciphers]] (such as the Atbash cipher)
* c. 400 - Spartan use of scytale (alleged)
*c. 400BCE - Herodotus reports use of steganography in reports to Greece from Persia (tatoo on shaved head)
*100-0 - Notable Roman ciphers such as the Caeser cipher.
==1 - 1799 CE ==
*ca 1000 - Frequency analysis leading to techniques for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. It was probably developed among the Arabs, and was likely motivated by textual analysis of the Koran.

*1835 - Samuel Morse develops the Morse code.
*c. 1854 - Babbage's method for [[../Breaking Vigenère cipher/ | breaking polyalphabetic cyphers]] (pub 1863 by Kasiski); the first known break of a polyaphabetic cypher. Done for the English during the Crimean War, a general attack on Vigenère's autokey cipher (the 'unbreakable cypher' of its time) as well as the much weaker cypher that is today termed &quot;the Vigenère cypher&quot;.  The advance was kept secret and was, in essence, reinvented somewhat later by the Prussian Friedrich Kasiski, after whom it is named.

* June 1942 - Battle of Midway. Partial break into Dec 41 edition of JN-25 leads to successful ambush of Japanese carriers and to the momentum killing victory.
* April 1943 - Admiral Yamamoto, architect of Pearl Harbor attack, is assassinated by U.S. forces who know his itinerary from decrypted messages
*April 1943 - Max Newman, Wynn-Williams, and their team (including Alan Turing) at the secret Government Code and Cypher School ('Station X'), Bletchley Park, Bletchley, England, complete the &quot;Heath Robinson&quot;.

*December 1943 - The Colossus was built, by Dr Thomas Flowers at The Post Office Research Laboratories in London, to crack the German Lorenz  cipher (SZ42). Colossus was used at Bletchley Park during WW II - as a successor to April's 'Robinson's. Although 10 were eventually built, unfortunately they were destroyed immediately after they had finished their work - it was so advanced that there was to be no possibility of its design falling into the wrong hands. The Colossus design was the first electronic digital computer and was somewhat programmable. A epoch in machine capability.

*1981 - Richard Feynman proposes quantum computers. The main application he had in mind was the simulation of quantum systems, but he also mentioned the possibility of solving other problems.
*1986 In the wake of an increasing number of break-ins to government and corporate computers, the US Congress passes the ''Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'', which makes it a crime to break into computer systems. The law, however, does not cover juveniles.

Unlike all previous manual encryption techniques -- except the one-time pad -- this one is resistant to automated  cryptanalysis. It is published in Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon (2000).

==2000 and beyond==
*January 14, 2000 - U.S. Government announce restrictions on export of cryptography are relaxed (although not removed). This allows many US companies to stop the long running, and rather ridiculous process of having to create US and international copies of their software.
*March 2000 - President Clinton says he doesn't use e-mail to communicate with his daughter, Chelsea Clinton, at college because he doesn't think the medium is secure.
*September 6, 2000 - RSA Security Inc. released their RSA algorithm into the public domain, a few days in advance of their US patent 4405829 expiring. Following the relaxation of the U.S. government export restrictions, this removed one of the last barriers to the world-wide distribution of much software based on cryptographic systems. It should be noted that the IDEA algorithm is still under patent and also that government restrictions still apply in some places.
*2000  - U.K. Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act requires anyone to supply their cryptographic key to a duly authorized person on request

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike an ''ideal conductor'' the real material constituting any kind of conductor, e.g. copper, contains in some amount impurities (other materials).
Own characteristic qualities to resist to the flow of charges (electrons) if a difference of potential is applied (voltage) can be measured too.
Temperature influences heavily this characteristic of resisting to the charges flow.
We can imagine that inside the conductor the atoms and electrons become exagitated because of temperature. 
Higher temperature inducts more exagitation and electrons move in all directions increasing again the resistance of the conductor. 

In other words, ''resistance'' is a phenomena which counterposes to the ordinate flow of charges in a conductor.

Resistance is measured in Ohm (Ω) (from the German scientist).

==The Indus River Valley Civilizations (ca. 2800 - 1800 BC)==
Around 2800 BC, a new civilization rose along the banks of the Indus river (just like other early civilizations, along a river) in India.  The place in which it arose was largely ideal, and was well-protected by the natural boundaries of the Hindu Kush Mountains.  Although this limited outside contact, it is known that the early Indians used the Khyber pass through this range to communicate with other civilizations.  In the future, groups would use this same pass to invade India.

Two major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered: Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.  These two cities developed at the same time as those in Egypt and Mesopotamia, but were much larger.  Together they might have contained 100,000 people and the Civilization may have been as large as 5 million.  These cities show remarkable organization, and the civilization seems to be the first to have developed urban central-planning.  There were well-organized wastewater drainage systems, trash collection systems, and possibly even public granaries and baths.  Most city-dwellers were artisans and merchants.  The civilization developed the first accurate system of standardized weights and measures, some as accurate as to 0.001 millimeters.  The Indus Valley peoples were adept at using metals as well, showing sophisticated use of bronze, tin, copper, and lead.

The Indus Valley economy was driven largely by trade.  They use bull-driven carts to carry goods across distances.  The same carts are still used throughout South Asia today.  The Indus peoples developed boats, which possibly had sails.  In addition, archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal.    

In spite of the many achievements of the Indus Valley Civilization, we know very little about them.  Their system of writing, the Indus Script, remains undecipherable.  We know next to nothing about their use of agriculture, except that they must have used the river's flood deposits and must have had a large agricultural surplus.  We have no conclusive evidence about how they were ruled, nor of kings, priests, armies, temples, or palaces.  Although the cities contained massive &quot;citadels&quot; their purpose seems largely defensive, even possibly used for floodwater diversion. Scientists do not even know what the Indus Valley peoples called themselves.  Also, we do not know what caused their sudden collapse, beginning circa 1900 BC.  What we do know is that the people of the Indus Valley Civilization did develop a massive, well-organized, and highly advanced civilization.

==The Aryan Invasion Theory (c. 1800 - 1500 BC)==
[[Image:Bulbgraph.png|20px]]  [[Spotlight: The Caste System]]

Beginning in around 1800 BC, a group of nomadic peoples known as the Aryans suddenly and swiftly overwhelmed and conquered the Indus River Valley Civilization, probably entering through the Khyber Pass.  Using horses and more advanced weapons against the peaceful Indus Valley denizens, they probably easily defeated the native peoples of northern India.

The Aryans were the opposite of the Indus River Valley Civilization, in that they left behind voluminous amounts of written and decipherable information but that there are almost no archaeological remains to examine.  Some scholars dispute that the Aryans even classify as the reason the Indus Valley Civilization fell.  In any case, a group of Indo-European nomadic peoples did migrate into northwestern India from around 1800 to 1500 BC.  The Aryans had a system of writing known as Sanskrit which is still used in India today.

The Aryans brought with them a system of polytheistic beliefs which were based in a group of writings called the ''Vedas'' and the ''Upanishads''.  Over many centuries, these beliefs would evolve into the religion known as Hinduism.  A major part of the Aryan religion, and of major consequence for the future of India to the present day, was the introduction of strict class divisions, which is known as the caste system.  Originally, the caste system was divided into three classes: the warriors on top, the priests in the middle, and the broad mass of the population, the peasants, on the bottom.  Eventually, a class of landowners and merchants was created above the peasantry, and the priests, known as ''Brahmans'' (not to be confused with Brahman, the Hindu &quot;oversoul&quot;), were elevated above the warriors.  Inter-class movement was possible in the early days of the system.  However, over time the society became more ingrained and complex, with subcastes making their way into the system.  Social mobility declined to such an extent that children were born into a caste and were obliged to remain in that caste their entire lives, and to only marry someone within their caste.  It was believed that good performance in a caste in this life could allow one to move up a caste in his or her next reincarnation.  The caste system became so influential and ingrained in Indian society that it exists to this day.

I think the original author used a somewhat unorthodox sequence of persons and cases. The more common one is:

 1st person singular  ich
 2nd person singular  du
 3rd person singular  er, sie, es, Sie
 1st person plural    wir
 2nd person plural    ihr
 3rd person plural    sie, Sie

: There is one mistake above: &quot;Sie&quot; is 2nd person: in Singular it is the polite form of &quot;du&quot;, and in plural of &quot;ihr&quot;.

 1. Nominative  der Mann
 2. Genitive    des Mannes
 3. Dativ       dem Mann
 4. Accusative  den Mann

Perhaps the corresponding chapters should be changed accordingly? (CKWG)

: Yes, I did.  Feel free to change it to your liking.  I don't know why either the cases or the pronouns are in an &quot;orthodox&quot; order, but there seems to be a typical order for some reason...

This seems a bit redundant. Why not just contribute to the existing books? I'll give you an example.  Your article on future tense is good.  Although there is yet no lesson on that subject in Level I, II, or III, we could easily prepare one using your input as the basis for it. It takes a long time to develop a &quot;complete&quot; lesson, but you have a good start there already.  I do not think we need to plan completely out where it must fall (that is, exactly what chapter it needs to be).  We simply stick it in as a chapter of, say Level II, then later, move it (actually, change the chapter number) as it becomes obvious that other lessons should proceed or follow it. When you asked about a &quot;grammar&quot; book, I assumed you were going to do just grammar rules. Level III is intended to concentrate more on grammar, which might suit you fine. It appears you would be a good contributor to advancing the book we have already started. What do you say?  - [[User:Marshman|Marshman]] 04:13, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: Then, in my eyes, I see two options. Collecting all of the Grammar notes already written and then putting them in this grammar section (perhaps summarising some areas) and also using the grammar section to write grammar help that has not found a home inside one of the lessons.
:::This seems to be what you are presently doing, although for some grammar concepts you are ahead of the &quot;homes&quot;. - [[User:Marshman|Marshman]] 
::OR

::Simple grammar reference with only the most summarised and basic information and keep the explanations of grammar in the lessons (perhaps links back and forth between the lessons and the notes). --[[User:Boit|Boit]] 23:06, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::This was basically the idea for the appendices to the book: basic grammar rules, mostly in tables.

:::If you feel comfortable proceeding with what you are presently preparing, then I'd say continue on.  But we should agree that as your lessons become redundant (or actualy, become useful to incorporate into the existing book), we simply move them (or rename the module) into the existing German book.  For example, your lesson on the alphabet is really not much  different from what exists in the [[German:Alphabet|first appendix]]. So that should simply be merged. Other stuff you are or will prepare may be advanced relative to where the book is now, and we can worry about merging it all later. Does this approach make sense? - [[User:Marshman|Marshman]] 05:31, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I think there should be a topic about &quot;Modalität&quot; (Indikativ, Konjunktiv I, Kunjunktiv II, Imperativ). Here some information if you don't know what I mean:

Indikativ: normal form (the here teached forms). No special mode.
Konjunktiv I: Form for the German &quot;reporting speach&quot;. There's no other use.
Konjunktiv II: Form der Möglichkeit (form of posibility).
Imperativ: Form for commands / Befehlsform.

Beispiele:

Indikativ: Er geht aus dem Haus.

Konjunktiv I: Er sagte, er gehe aus dem Haus. ODER Er sagte, er würde aus dem Haus gehen (Mündlich öfter genutzt, aber eigentlich nur erlaubt, wenn die Indikativform sich nicht vom Konjunktuv I unterscheidet.). (Präsens-Stamm + Personalendung).

Konjunktiv II: Wenn du aus dem Haus gingest, wäre ich glücklicher. ODER Wenn du aus dem Haus gehen würdest, wäre ich glücklicher. (Präteritumstamm + Personalendung).

Imperativ: Geh aus dem Haus! (Präsensstamm und selten + &quot;e&quot;).



Personalendungen (Konjunktiv I und II):

1. Sg. e
2. Sg. est
3. Sg. e
1. Pl. en
2. Pl. et
3. Pl. en

Bei der würden-Methode wird der Konjunktiv von werden genommen und danach der Imfinitiv des Verbs genommen.



It would be nice if someone writes a topic about that. And for the adjectives: A topic about comparison (Steigerung) is missing.

== Prepositions - sentencte unusual ==

Actually good work now, but there is a little thing (→ Preopsitions) that I as a native would on no way say so:

 Nach dem Pfarrer sei Gott gut.
 Dem Pfarrer nach sei Gott gut.

'Nach' is very unusual at this point. It could be missunderstoud as ''(Someone said that) after the priest (died), god will be good.'' -- at least the first version. It is better to use ''laut'':

 Laut Pfarrer ist Gott gut.

Also Konjunktiv I is not very common there. One example for Konjunktiv I:

 The priest said that good is good.
 Der Pfarrer sagte, Gott sei gut (/ dass Gott gut sei).

And at last an example for a usage of ''nach'':

 Nach Meier gibt es für ein solches Verhalten keinen Grund. (''let Meier be the family name of a famous, historical person'')
 According to Meier, there is no reason for such a behavior.

But also there, ''laut'' would at no way be uncommon (so if you are not sure, use ''laut''). I don't know how you think about this, but I as an English learning German learn most of all grammar better when I have some examples, not with the rules (But also, I don't know how one can use this for learning German, because of its strict grammar).&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:87.172.232.3|87.172.232.3]] ([[User talk:87.172.232.3|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/87.172.232.3|contribs]]) 23:16, 18 February 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: Thanks for your interest in the book! Unfortunately, as the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/German/Grammar?action=history edit history] shows, there hasn't really been much activity on this book since 2006. Please feel free to [[Wikibooks:be bold|be bold]] and update it to imrove this module. That's what makes the wiki great. :-D --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:36, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

::That's a good objection, but it would  be written as follows:

 Laut dem Pfarrer sei Gott gut.

=Re: =
Muchísimas gracias! Por ahora ya está la escuela estructurada por departamentos y materias y hay muchos cursos propuestos en cada departamento.

Si tienes cualquier sugerencia o propuesta, hay una discusion abierta en la misma escuela acerca del tema. 

Por otro lado te invito a comenzar algún curso que pueda ser de tu interes.

1.
:Prove that 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
::When n=1,
::L.H.S. = 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
::R.H.S. = 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1
::Therefore L.H.S. = R.H.S.
::Therefore this is true when n=1.
::Assume that this is true for some positive integer k,
::i.e. 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + k^2 &amp; = &amp; \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\ 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + k^2 + (k+1)^2 &amp; = &amp; \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} + (k+1)^2 \\ \ &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{6}(k+1) \left [ k(2k+1) + 6(k+1) \right ] \\ \ &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{6}(k+1) \left [ 2k^2 + 7k + 6 \right ] \\ \ &amp; = &amp; \frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::Therefore this is also true for k+1.
::Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, this holds for all positive integer n.

2.
:Prove that for n &amp;ge; 1,
::&lt;math&gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})^n = x_n + y_n\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
:where x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are integers.
::When n=1,
::&lt;math&gt;1 + \sqrt{5} = x_1 + y_1\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
::Therefore x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1 and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1, which are both integers.
::Therefore this is true when n=1.
::Assume that this is true for some positive integer k,

::Therefore this is true for k+1 also.
::Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, this holds for all positive integer n.

3. (The solution assume knowledge in [[HSE_Basic_counting#Binomial_expansion|binomial expansion]] and [[HSE_Summation_Sign|summation notation]])
:Note that
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^k - (i-1)^k] = n^k&lt;/math&gt;
:Prove that there exists an explicit formula for
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^m&lt;/math&gt; for all integer ''m''. E.g.
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
::It's clear that 1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... = (n+1)n/2. So the proposition is true for m=1.
::Suppose that
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^j&lt;/math&gt;
::has an explicit formula in terms of ''n'' for all ''j'' &lt; ''k'' (**), we aim to prove that
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^k&lt;/math&gt;
::also has an explicit formula.
::Starting from the property given, i.e.
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - (i-1)^{k+1}] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - \sum_{j=0}^{k+1} {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - {k+1 \choose k+1} i^{k+1} - \sum_{j=0}^k {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[\sum_{j=0}^k {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k[\sum_{i=1}^n {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k[{k+1 \choose j} \sum_{i=1}^n i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
::Since we know the formula for power sum of any power less then ''k'' (**), we can solve the above equation and find out the formula for the ''k''-th power directly.
::Hence, by the principle of strong mathematical induction, this proposition is true.

==== Additional info for question 3 ====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
The method employed in question 3 to find out the general formula for power sum is called '''the method of difference''', as shown by that we consider the sum of all difference of adjacant terms.
&lt;br&gt;

Aside from the method above, which lead to a recursive solution for finding  the general formula, there're also other methods, such as that of using generating function. Refer to the last question in the generating function project page for detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some thoughts about the organization of this text: 

Since this book is primarily about art in a visual medium, should it be retititled &quot;Visual Art&quot; or perhaps even more narrowly focused? 

Also, since the history of visual art and the techniques of visual art are each such vast subjects, should they not be split into separate books?

Is the focus to be more on &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot; art?

There are whole sections of &quot;Visual Art&quot; that are left out in the rough outline, such as engraving, woodcuts, and printmaking generally. 

Has anyone considered the image requirements such a project will really require? Most art books I have read have at least hundreds of images in them, and this one seems to require many thousands. How will so many images be sourced?

I realize that a lot of these questions might seem like splitting hairs, but I think that the scope of the project should be more clearly outlined. Additionally, I think that the present scope of this text is too wide, and might be off-putting to potential authors.

My idea is to split this book into several smaller, more easily managable topics, rather than have the single omnibus of &quot;Art&quot;.Some suggestions for splitting the single subject into more manageable chunks would be along these lines:
*A History of the Visual Arts
*The Techniques of Fine Art
*The Techniques of Graphic Art (or Commercial Art)
*Other refinements as necessary. (e.g. &quot;A History of Fine Art Techniques from the Middle Ages Through the Present&quot;)

--[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 17:56, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It seems to me that what you have here is the foundation for an &quot;Art 101&quot;.  Other people are delving in-depth into individual works.  You have the makings of a good introduction to those more in-depth works.

--[[User:203.113.235.149|203.113.235.149]] 11:16, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

a couple of thoughts: as an art appreciation teacher, I like the idea of an &quot;Art 101&quot; resource designed to introduce readers to what art is, various art media/methods, a basic overview of art history, etc.  Very useful for art history/art appreciation students &amp; people who just love art &amp; want to expand their knowledge.  Splitting the book as Chuck Hoffman suggests seems reasonable for the purposes of managability, but might not result in a single resource for people who want a very basic intro to the visual arts, art appreciation, etc.  Also, as a writer mentions later, it seems to me that it would be a bit tragic if this turned into just a manual of techniques for artists, though such a manual should certainly exist!  Anyway, I'm not sure what the solution is in terms of whether to split this work into smaller books or keep as a broad overview of the visual arts.  However, in defense of the latter, following is how I organize my art appreciation classes (I've also seen an organization like this in many art appreciation textbooks) -- it is similar to the organization you have so far, but with some key differences &amp; condensations.  Maybe useful...?
*Introduction (organization of the course(book); what is art; how art is used, enjoyed, and displayed; museums and galleries)
*The Artist (who makes art; the role of the artist in different cultures; the creative process)
*Media/Methods (basic overview of media/methods -- similar to the list that already exists, but the stuff in appendix B could easily be incorporated into a media/methods chapter)
*Elements of art (line, shape, color, texture, etc.; stylistic categories)
*Methodologies for Examining art (formal analysis, social/cultural analysis, biographical analysis, feminism, psychoanalysis, etc.)
*Art History (very basic overview -- Paleolithic/Antiquity/Medieval/Renaissance/Modern/Contemporary)
Anyway, it looks really promising &amp; I'll try to add some material to the sections that already exist as time permits.

== re: categorisation of comics ==

As you noted, comics aren't a method of drawing, they're a method of representing the flow of time via static art, and you have drawn comics, painted comics, photo comics etc.  Though AFAIK, noone's ever done it, theoretically  you could probably even have sculpture comics.

Comics are underrepresented in art texts and it would be a shame to leave that section out.  I think probably the best place for the comics section is linked from the representative art section.  I probably wouldn't leave the link on the master contents page though, unless you intend to have a number of subitems under representative art.

:In a broad but real sense much of the Disney park experience is a comic in sculpture form, as are wax museums and similar displays. :)--[[User:R Hole Jr|R Hole Jr]] 00:03, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::I'm not familiar with Disney park or wax museums in detail, but if the sculptures tell a sequential story then they could probably loosely be called comics, though we'd probably be breaking new ground in doing so...
--[[User:203.113.235.149|203.113.235.149]] 11:16, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

The concept of sculpture that portrays a linear narrative is not new, early babylonian artists worked mainly in this form. It is usually refered to as a 'tableux' in the round or a 'frieze' in relief.
Not wishing to be too much of a negative contributor I would like to say that there is far more information here if you simply be more precise in the language that you use. Comic means 'funny', most comics that we think of (graphic novels) are drawn as carcature, or as bon desiné in the form of storyboards (a technique also used for film, video, animation and even graphic design). there is a massive area of british art history that revolves around caricature and political satire by artists such as William Hogarth. As for cartoon, it simply means preliminary drawing or sketch, see Leonardo Da Vinci's Cartoon for the madona and child.
Disney's theme parks are fine examples of theatre design.

The late great Will Eisner tried to retitle the art of &quot;Comics&quot; as Sequential Art. However, comics theorist Scott McCloud in his 1990 graphic novel Understanding Comics defined the art form again as Comics: Juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer. I tend to disagree with the &quot;deliberate&quot; part as experimental Dada-esque comics such as 5 Card Nancy [http://www.scottmccloud.com/inventions/nancy/nancy.html] (invented by McCloud himself!) show that random sequencing is equally as valid. Also, comics theorist Neil Cohn and others would argue that they would rather bring respect to the word Comics than find a respected word to bring to the artform. I tend to agree. 

As for the history of comics, again I sight McCloud and UC: Comics have a history that can be traced to the pre-Columbian picture manuscript &quot;Ocelot's Claw&quot;, the Bayeux Tapestry detailing the Norman Conquest, and even some Egyptian Hieroglyphics such as the one he sights from Menna's tomb. 

As for the future of comics, I myself am building 3D comics in virtual space using the MUVE platform of Second Life. In the classroom my students are working on &quot;Site Specific Comics&quot;: installation works that bring a narrative to a place, about that place, while in effect changing it.--Anthony 19:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== re: the scope and general TOC of this text ==
I would agree that if it's only covering visual arts it should be renamed to reflect that, so that performing or audio arts texts could be added elsewhere. I'm also rather confused from the layout of the TOC whether this is primarily intended as a how-to/method guide (for artists) or a history/introduction guide (for viewers). There's use for both of course. I'm just not sure of the intent of the organizer. Any enlightenment would be appreciated, so I don't head off in an unintended direction. --[[User:R Hole Jr|R Hole Jr]] 00:03, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)



Isn't this something we just decide: what we want this book to be?  I agree that we need to make some serious decisions about what this is going to be.  I'd be most interesting in turning what we've got into a manual on techniques (Fine and Commercial are so similar when it comes to ''technique'' I hate to separate them).  Maybe an introduction to developing techniques rather than a dictionary of techniques?  In this context art history could fit in as an artistic discipline.  Then we would only be responsible for laying a groundwork for further investigation instead of actually trying to present any cohesive history of art.

--[[User:Mstults|Matt S]] 11:07, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)


Seems to me that this is already headed in the direction of an overview for an Art Appreciation class and would be best to continue in that direction. Although it certainly needs more sections, keeping them brief, with the addition of a good bib at the end of each section would also be really helpful to both the student as well as the general reader. I plan on doing some writing myself on one or two of the sections, hopefully in the next couple of days. Leigh[[User:Bdswagger|Bdswagger]] 08:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

== Fine &amp; Commercial Art? ==

I am really suprised to see people still using the old labels for art school courses '''Fine Art''' and '''Commercial Art'''.
I thought these were put to bed in the early sixties. Most people refer to them as '''Visual art''' now - it avoids that weird critic driven attempt to add expensive sounding mystique. Visual art by itself is adequate to describe contemporary art, painting, sculpture, and all the usual suspects (fashion, textiles, film, video, animation, ceramics (please dont call it pottery) even performance). 
all of the above are comercial, how else could you make a living from them? If you really need to make a distinction between the arts that are done for exhibition and those done for some commercial application (which in my experience tend to merge anyway) just call them by their names, design, product design, illustration, typography, calligraphy etc.

sorry to go off on one at my first visit, just seem to spend a lot of my time dealing with this stuff.
the wikibook is a fantastic idea and the TOC looks like a really good start. remember to try and keep creative yourself while writing it.

Oh yes i am going to change the word Sculpting to sculpture in the TOC, sculpting is a dubious present participal for sculpture and as such it doesn't work as a descriptive for the activity 'Sculpture'. 
Someone is a sculptor
they work in the discipline of sculpture
when they make something they sculpt
it can then be said to be sculpted
they could be said to be sculpting at any particular moment - but more likely would use the description that fits the activity i.e. carving or modelling

Maybe we can advertise for help in various art fourms such as conceptart.org, gfxartist.com, deviantart.com and others. I'm sure that conceptart would love to help write an &quot;everything visual arts&quot; book.




I started a book [[Art_Tutorials]] which is trying to be strictly tutorials, tips, techniques, and lessons. Someone posted in my book that it should be merged with this one. After reviewing this book, I don't think it should. This book states that it will eventually have lessons or something of the sort, but with the actual direction of the book, i don't think it should. I don't think a tutorials book needs a section on &quot;What is art&quot; nor an overview of each medium as a main point. The intro also states that this book itself is only an overview book. I think there needs to be something more indepth, which [[Art_Tutorials]] was intended to become. One final arguement... the name of this book is ART. Perhaps if it sticks to its original mission it needs a rename and to be replaced with a book that is in fact an Arts 101 course type book. I'm not seeing any lessons/tutorials yet on this book. Can we just drop that and keep it as a Arts 101 type book?

Like someone stated up above, this book seems like a great Art 101 in the making, and I think having tutorials would just clutter it up. While history is somewhat important while learning skills, the two should be separate from a text book standpoint. Perhaps this book can focus more on introductory topics, and the Art_Tutorials book can stick to tutorials. Anythoughts? Feel free to post in the Art_Tutorials discussion page too.
--[[User:Blainegarrett|Blainegarrett]] 15:20, 13 September 2005 (UTC)



A tutorial, as often seen on the internet, is a walk through of sorts. A how-to guide.
A text like this one has the potential to be a thorough Introduction to Art, like many University or College students receive in their first year (or Foundation level) of classes. It should therefore, include in-depth coverage of methods, elements and principles, critical evaluation, and contemporary issues both formal and conceptual. 

It may make sense to rename it &quot;Introduction to Visual Art&quot; unless audio, performing, film or otherwise will be covered.

I do however think these sections:
How to Make a Living 
Practical Approach for the Artist - Legalities Learning copyrights, attribution laws, contractual arrangements. - Finer points for Contemporary Fine Artists – 
Should be moved to their own chapter and not places soley under 2D.

Also, since there is an Art History Wiki Book started I think it would make more sense to point and add, when necessary, to it rather than write one here. Unless of course it would be an Intro or Survey type section (again like most Universities offer to freshman). --Anthony Fontana 19:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pendragon. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pendragon~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything.

==Creating Review one==
 Why not combine the test's from all the first 3 lesson and use it as a huge review...
 A simple past and edit. --[[User:Andrewcool|Andrewcool]] 02:36, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Look of the contents pages ==

The number of images on the contents page (especially this level) is a bit excessive. In Firefox, the castle photo squashes the text and the three bits of clipart as well as levels 1, 2 and 3 together. However, in Internet Explorer, it looks even worse with a large gap of white space. I propose losing the clipart (you never see clipart in the contents pages of textbooks)

:That's fine by me. Actually, the white space was there before I put the clipart in, and I thought that it would liven up the page (I use IE). If we reformat the page as you suggest, could we add the clipart back in? Of course, it would be nice if we could get actual photos, or a good artist... Anyway, would you happen to know if there's a way to make the castle photo some kind of background? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 00:40, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Will the book have added pages soon? --[[User:Mitchowen|Mitchowen]] 16:58, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I don't know how active this book is either, as I just started working on it myself.

== Long 'S' ==

There are several occurances of the long 's' in titles throughout this book, but always as '''|''', which to me just looks plain ugly. Why not use '''ſ''' (Unicode U+017F) instead?

This:

:1st: there isn't a &quot;|&quot; in the german language anymore. 2nd: the schaben alt font is not representative for the german language. 3rd: why should we use the schaben alt font? 4th: i did't know the | until today (I'm german) -- [[User:213.39.233.138|213.39.233.138]] 02:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

Actually the schwaben font in very representative for the german language. It was widely used in German, until hitler took over and called it &quot;jewish&quot;, and I don't want to use the long s, I want to use the normal s, use requires me useing &quot;|&quot;. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 02:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

::: &quot;Actually the schwaben font in very representative for the german language&quot;. No, it was representative until 16th century. &quot;it was replaced by the fraktur as the most-used German typeface&quot;. OK, we can use something like [http://www.gwdg.de/forschung/publikationen/gwdg-nr/GN0506/images/baier-gn200506-abb1.gif] but A Beginner| Cour|e in German is an ugly typo (except for  you) :) --[[User:213.39.233.138|213.39.233.138]] 17:07, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

Just a short info about the &quot;ſ&quot;. This letter never used to occur in the end of a syllable, hence &quot;Beginner's&quot; would always have been written with an &quot;s&quot; (indicating the end of a syllable was the point of using two kinds of &quot;s&quot; in the first place - e.g. in &quot;Häschen&quot; - not &quot;Häſchen&quot;). As for the &quot;ſ&quot; in todays German - it is non-existant. Thus, I would suggest removing it all together. After all, learning a historical version of German won't be of much help to a beginner after all. --Martin, [[User:Eichendorffschule|Eichendorffschule]] 23:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

*We shouldn't use special fonts for this purpose. It's okay in the PDF version, but here most people are just going to see &quot;A Beginner| Cour|e in German&quot;.--[[User:Aleron235|Aleron235]] 19:25, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== Where are the tests? ==

Why are there no tests present on this page? I would like to learn German using this text, but I find it most difficult without the tests. Please post them if possible.


Answer to above problem: the tests are there. you go under the test bracket on the page 
and click the drop down arrow next to the word 'problems' . this is your test.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I thought I found this book originally because it had a link on the main page, but now I can't find it anywhere (it's not even in the old revision of the Miscellaneous topics template, which is where I thought it was). It's not listed on the All books page. Shouldn't there be links here from those assorted places? [[User:Elf|Elf]] 00:42, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It's only a couple weeks old.  I haven't put it on the main page or any other list, though I did link to it from Lachatdelarue's talk page en.wikipedia.  Yes, there should be links here from bookshelf pages and such. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 15:56, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Also--do we want to include Training topics under dog care, or would that be a different book, do you think?  [[User:Elf|Elf]] 00:59, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:There should be a link there from here, but I lean towards a separate book. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 15:56, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Also (can't shut me up)--what did you have in mind with the &quot;Breeds&quot; section? [[User:Elf|Elf]] 00:59, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:It should have info on specific health problems associated with specific breeds, as well as anything useful to people trying to choose a breed (i.e. whether or not its good with kids, barks a lot, dog-aggressive or territorial, etc). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 15:56, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I'm a vet student, if you wonder about where I'm getting my information.  Do either of you have expertise in dog care, or are you just highly motivated dog owners?  I added this to the miscellaneous bookshelf, by the way. [[User:Tormod|Tormod]] 00:36, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

It's wonderful to have you here, Tormod--you can see that I hardly ever get over here to this Wiki site; most of my editing I do on [[Wikipedia]].  I've owned 5 dogs over time and lived with others; I compete in dog agility with my dogs and spend a lot of time with other competitors discussing and evaluating dog health--many competitors are also responsible breeders of working dogs or the occasional vet.  So I have spent a tremendous amount of time around many dogs and dog owners over the last 10 years.  I've got a fairly extensive dog-related library. My vet appointments go on for very long because I always ask every question I can think of. My various instructors have always been very well-educated dog care-givers, trainers, and behaviorists, and I've spent many years with a variety of dogs and owners in training classes. So I guess you could say I'm a highly motivated and fairly well educated dog owner.  I'm glad to see the heavy-handed restraining stuff taken out of the section on giving medicine but I was hesitant to remove it myself because I have heard and read that advice before (I added the material about giving it in food etc. because I've never had to restrain any of my dogs and neither has anyone else I've known when we've discussed it).  I feel that I know more about general dog care and training than 95% of the &quot;average man on the street&quot; who owns a dog--usually overweight and with obedience problems ;-) .  [[User:Elf|Elf]] 03:55, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'm not a dog owner at the moment, but I am a veterinary technician (unlicensed). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 02:06, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Merge with Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book chapter ==

It was recently suggested that this [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Dog Care and Training|chapter]] in the Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book be merged with this one.  Although I'm sure there's a lot of overlap between these two, it will totally not serve the purpose of the Adventist Youth (AY) book.

The AY book is meant to serve as a resource for Pathfinder leaders.  Pathfinders is a scouting organization operated by the Seventh-day Adventist church, and the &quot;honors&quot; that we answer there are very much like Boy Scout Merit Badges.  We are not at liberty to alter the requirements of the honor, so we must structure the answers to address the honor requirements.

Since we really cannot alter the structure of the AY book, merging would not serve our interests.  However, we would be very happy to transclude portions of this Dog Care book, and even contribute material. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

== History ==
The somewhat controversial subject of speed reading rose to public attention in 1957 with Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics program. It introduced the world to the eye-popping concept of waving one's hands in wavy patterns over printed text and &quot;absorbing&quot; every word at speeds in 'excess of 1000 words per minute' with &quot;100% comprehension&quot;. 

The reality, of course, is somewhat different.

Companies even got a testimonial from President John F. Kennedy to promote the practice. John F. Kennedy actually had Evelyn Wood's teachers come to the White House to teach him and others speed reading techniques. Nixon and Carter also used speed reading.  Jimmy Carter recently (2010) got on TV somewhat bragging that he had brought in Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics teachers in to teach 30 members of his family and staff to learn the Reading Dynamics system, and that he used Speed Reading to read an average of over 300 pages of material a day, citing how important it was for him to make distinctions as precise as choice of which preposition was used, while reading at Speed Reading rates.

What most significantly sets &quot;speed reading&quot; apart from &quot;normal speed&quot; reading is that the reader sees words and interprets them using visual thinking processes rather than simulating the speaking and hearing of words.  Most people learned to read by sounding out words in their heads without moving their mouths, and become dependent upon imagining the &quot;hearing&quot; of the sounds of words to process them.  In contrast to this, speed reading involves harnessing the visual cortex which has vastly more neurons than the audio processing parts of the brain.  The visual cortex operates at dizzying speeds, all day long. Speed reading takes advantage of visual cognitive functions that are grossly underutilized in most people while reading.  The training programs effectively teach a student to read by making him &quot;deaf&quot; to the voice of internally spoken words, causing the brain to retrain other parts of the brain to perform the same task. The visual cognitive functions slowly take over and learn to read in an entirely different way. Words are no longer pronounced as if a conversation is occurring in the reader's head, they are viewed as images, more like flipping through a picture book or watching a movie.

Virtually every speed reading system ever developed starts the student off with the same speed building exercises. The speed building phase of the training process accelerates a person's current reading speed by first eliminating reading practices such as sounding out words out loud to oneself, re-scanning over passages already read, and other common habits.  Most teach a student to read by pacing through the text with their fingers. They feature an intensive program of exercises that slowly accelerate reading speed. The training exercises dictate that a speed reader should maintain a constant high speed through reading material, not slowing down for anything. This coaxes a reader's speed from a typical 240 words per minute (300 words per minute is more typical of college readers [http://www.clt.cornell.edu/campus/learn/LSC%20Resources/readingspeed.pdf]) into the speed reading range which is generally considered between 600 and 2000 words per minute.

The more effective programs teach the students to re-learn how to read yet again once they have mastered the speed building exercises.  The ineffective speed reading programs feature only the speed building exercises, which are completely useless without sophisticated thinking habits; and tell the student that they are &quot;done&quot; with the course and can read at some fantastical number of words a minute.  In contrast, effective reading systems all encourage reading habits that adjust the speed to match the level of understanding needed, and train the reader that re-reading passages is critical to understanding.  Any reading program that spouts a &quot;words a minute&quot; claim is balderdash.

Virtually all academic studies on speed reading have shown that speed readers score relatively low on academic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension reading comprehension] tests as compared to normal readers.  These studies typically have the speed reader reading the material only once at speeds five times that of a normal reader, not allowing the speed reader to stop and retrace.  These studies often have flaws or limitations placed on the subjects which are not clearly disclosed.  They use academic standards for reading comprehension which aren't always consistent with a person's reading needs in the real world.

People who find regular uses for speed reading skills find themselves taking a completely different viewpoint of speed reading than the academics. If a person needs to read a textbook or a poem, they will rarely use speed reading. If a person has a book on a subject they are familiar with but they are looking for new insight, then speed reading is the perfect way to quickly read the book while locating the information of interest.

Despite its derision in academic circles, it is the opinion of this author and of thousands of other people who continue to practice speed reading that speed reading is a useful skill that '''complements''' normal reading. There are simply some things that the brain cannot do when skimming or scanning that do take place when speed reading. Primarily the difference in opinion about the real-world utility of speed reading stems from HOW the reader reads, and the thinking and learning patterns the speed reader applies when reading.

Effective speed reading speeds of people who actually use speed reading skills are generally between 600 and 4000 words per minute. This speed depends upon a variety of factors, primarily the nature of the material, the alertness of the reader, the mental speed of the reader, the amount of practice of the reader, innate talent for speed reading, the thinking processes he has taught himself over the years, what he had for breakfast, etc etc etc. A 600 word per minute rate is fairly common among beginning and semi experienced speed readers. Speeds over 1000 words per minute require much more experience and intense concentration. Even at 600 words per minute, which is double or triple normal rates, speed reading can be extremely beneficial.

Most people who first learn speed reading are prone to believe that because their brains seem to be aware of the information they are looking at, that they fully understand what they have just read. The reality is that just being aware of information does not mean you really understand it or are going to remember it.

Probably the biggest weakness of speed reading is that it is easy to deceive oneself about how well his or her comprehension and learning of a text is. It takes competence with learning strategy to input information meaningfully into human long term memory; there is no substitute for proper study skills if remembering what you read is your intention. Essentially, at speed reading speeds, strategies are problematical at best. And not everyone has the right kind of brain to apply highly successful speed reading strategies at speed reading speeds.

Every college study skills course ever taught teaches that simply reading a passage once over simply doesn't work to really understand and remember course material, let alone trying to read over a passage at thousands of words a minute. A typical study skills teacher will stand up in front of their class and pronounce any and all forms of &quot;speed reading&quot; to be &quot;poison for the mind&quot; and anathema to good study habits. They claim that the claims of speed reading promoters of good comprehension are dangerous to reading. The basic crux of study skills courses is that to understand and remember course material, the reader has to actively do something with the information being learned -- specifically to selectively re-organize it in a manner that shows relationships between what the student already knows and between the elements of new information the student is attempting to learn. High speed reading doesn’t really give the brain much time to perform cognitive processes to “do something” with information the brain is exposing itself to.

Speed reading basically blasts the short term memory faculties of the mind with information. It is said that it allows a speed reader to make split second decisions about the value and/or relevance of information before it disappears forever. This does not give the long term memory facilities of the brain time to grasp them, even though the speed reader felt he or she was aware of what he or she was reading. It does, however, generally allow the reader to decide to slow down when interesting or relevant passages of text are encountered. Skimming and scanning also allow the reader to locate relevant passages.

Most people who do speed reading use what could be considered &quot;passive&quot; reading skills, meaning that they simply look at the words as they fly by and hope they will stick. Ideas come at the brain like the spray from a fire hose, and some are overlooked, so quickly that before the brain can consider the relevance or use for an idea, or accurately judge how well the idea was understood, the next one is being jammed into the cognitive circuitry for processing. The rapid speed effectively squashes the brain's ability to judge whether it understood an idea or to perceive or conceive of relationships. With the total lack of feedback of passive reading habits, the speed reader typically assumes that since he was consciously aware of the ideas as he read them, that he fully understood what he read.  Speed reading tends to put the reader into a type of self-deceptive trance.

In sharp contrast to this, when reading at normal speeds, the brain has the ability to use better learning strategies and consider realistically if it understood an idea and the context around it, providing the feedback that reading researchers have measured is severely limited or non-existent in speed reading.  When skimming or scanning, the brain has the ability to monitor its effective comprehension because it is acutely aware that it is looking at keywords and acutely aware of how thorough a perusal it is doing.

Generally speaking, the only way to remember what a person is reading is to USE the information being read for some purpose.  Most people who attempt speed reading simply can not or do not think fast enough to organize information they are looking at for any purpose.  The end result is that no &quot;hooks&quot; form that link the data being read into ideas that are already known to the reader.

Speed reading courses often attempt to promote a variety of mental contortions that help to offset the problems latent in speed reading.  In practice, few of the students who attempt these contortions can actually use them with anything resembling success.  However, many of those students who can do them consider them well worth the time spent learning and practicing them.  That being said, they are still no substitute for conservative and well proven study skills.

==How to Make Speed Reading Actually Work==

To be blunt, speed reading is probably not going to work for you (this is because 95% of the people who try this end up quitting, but this does not consider you ) and the training will be a waste of time.  Whether it works for you is essentially a matter of luck.  You have to have the &quot;right kind of brain&quot;.  While virtually anyone can &quot;master&quot; the speed building exercises to become aware of the presence of words at high speeds, few can take speed reading to the next level to make it genuinely useful.  The main issue is whether a person can develop thinking habits that are at least an order of magnitude faster than the rate at which he takes in words; the only way to consistently do this is through developing habits of purely visual translations of information, of literally seeing information laid out visually in your head as if on whiteboards and &quot;photographic albums&quot; that are being used to take notes and prepare alternate versions of the reading material in the reader's head.  Only the visual cortex and visual processing hardware of the human brain is fast enough and has enough physical neurons to actually run this fast.  All forms of comprehension and memory leave the reader with only the ability to attempt to reconstruct what he actively did with information: not with what he actually saw.  So a human brain has to be able to actively mutate information he is reading into visual representations at speeds ten times the rate he takes in words.  The visual &quot;minds eye&quot; techniques are pretty much the only comprehension and analytical methods that work at speed reading rates.  For the most part, people who do not apply purely visual analytical/translational methods of what they are seeing find speed reading deceptive and useless.  Some people naturally use visual thinking methods automatically when learning speed reading, some people have to be coaxed, some people have to force themselves into habits of it and can develop a semblance of speed over time, but most people just flat out cannot do it.  At 10,000 words a minute, a brain has to process and make distinctions between typically 400 internally generated distinct visual images per second, and has to be able to juggle them in parallel.  About half of the people for whom speed reading actually works (in my experience) are on the autism spectrum (like myself) or show pronounced autistic traits.

One highly functional speed reading comprehension technique is described below in which the reader takes the mindset that he or she is giving a slide show presentation on the topic.  Essentially, the conscious focus of the brain is oriented towards preparing a speech on the topic being perused rather than trying to hope that text flying by like the spray from a fire hose will make sense and stick in the brain.  It first requires the &quot;student&quot; to learn how to speed read the &quot;old fashioned way&quot; at extremely high speeds.  Once this is &quot;achieved&quot;, the speed reader has to completely re-learn how to speed read again from scratch.  Developing &quot;traditional&quot; old fashioned speed reading habits first and getting them thoroughly ingrained allows the information input and scanning to take place at a habituated, mostly unconscious level.  In this modified version of speed reading, rather than the incoming flow of information being the focus of attention, active cognitive processes that organize information dominate the forefront of the attention, with speed reading &quot;skills&quot; serving only to provide information for the speech preparation.  All speed increases or decreases, complete stops, or regressions are at the behest of the speech making part of the brain.  When the &quot;speech&quot; maker's mental prototype of the speech he is preparing has &quot;gaps&quot; or stalls or &quot;holes&quot; in it because of a lack of understanding of the material, the mostly unconscious &quot;data input&quot; part of the reading phase immediately begins rapidly searching both backwards and forwards through the text for information to fill in the holes.  Essentially, the conscious attention of the active reader is 100% oriented towards feedback on comprehension, because he is actively paraphrasing everything that is read and actively filtering out useless ideas he doesn't want to include in his &quot;speech&quot;.  This is VERY VERY different than passive patterns of reading the text in a high speed linear fashion, which is akin to trying to force the brain to make sense out of a thousand speeding bullets whizzing by.  The brain is CONSTANTLY monitoring its own comprehension, and actively deciding which parts of information to ignore and which to utilize.  Every word that is read is read at the behest of the mental processes that are attempting to do something with information.  Not all reading material is organized in a fashion that allows this technique to be useful.

This technique, and others like it require the reader to be able to visualize information in their heads in the same manner as a whiteboard (or chalkboard), '''to think visually'''. Thinking visually is many many times faster than thinking in an audio fashion, trying to sound out words to oneself, or verbally ponder the meanings of what is being read.  This class of technique calls for the reader to picture the information they are reading in a visual representation of the material being read mixed in with the information they already know about the subject.  Not everyone can do this, but with practice between 10% and 30% of people can eventually pull this off with limited success.  Some (such as this author) think so rapidly in an inherently visual manner that they can keep up the whiteboards in their heads at speeds over 10,000 words per minute.  It takes a lot of sleep, a lot of good food, a fair dose of caffeine, an inherent ability to think visually, and the willpower to master the technique.  While it may sound like freak mental abilities are needed to do this, actually what happens is that freak mental abilities develop with practice.  What is required is translating your thinking processes into visual representations.  Huge portions of the human brain are dedicated to processing information visually, and as a result they are the fastest circuits in the brain for processing information. They simply need to be trained through practice.

By far the most effective visual thinking patterns for this purpose are modeling ones thinking after [[Wikipedia:Mind_Map|Mind Maps]].  Look up ''The Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's Untapped Potential'' by Tony Buzan (1996 version) on Amazon, and practice making them on paper.  Very quickly you will get used to the techniques of organizing information visually in your head.

Deciding whether speed reading is inadvisable as reading researchers conclude, or a great contribution to mankind as can be inferred from the testimonials of speed reading promoters is left up to the reader.  Expect to spend a considerable amount of time developing your speed reading skills and visual thinking habits.

What most people ultimately wind up with is learning how to turn the spigot of words on into their brains -- and nothing more --, which is ultimately worse than useless because it is totally deceptive in terms of what you understand and what you expect to be able to recall.  The brain, unable to process information so quickly, simply flushes the old information out before it can form any type of mental representations of it.  What most people who attempt to learn speed reading wind up with is a pattern of their brain's cognitive functions simply flushing everything they just read a few milliseconds before to make room for the material their eyes are currently looking at, with the ultimate effect of nearly nothing happening in the cognitive circuitry of the brain.  The result is very limited memory, and virtually no actual comprehension.

Below we present some classic speed reading notions and exercises to allow you to try for yourselves if you have the time and inclination to do so.

==[[/Subvocalization/]]==

Subvocalization or silent speech, is defined as the internal speech made when reading a word, thus allowing the reader to imagine the sound of the word as it is read (Carver 1990).  

For the purposes of this article, there are essentially three forms of subvocalization:
#The first form is visibly mouthing the words read aloud to oneself.
#The second form is imagining mouthing the words you read aloud to oneself without moving the lips.
#The third form is being aware that words have sounds associated with them, but not taking the time to wait for each word to be &quot;spoken&quot; before the readers' attention moves to the next word or group of words.

Subvocalizing in style 1 or 2 are essentially the same.  Both are extremely common in older readers who were trained before modern reading teaching systems were put in place.  These patterns of reading warrant remedial reading training.  They tend to place an absolute limit on reading speed in the neighborhood of 100 to 150 words per minute.  These readers wait for the sounds of words to complete before moving to the next word.  These readers will make many eye fixations upon each word, and often have a tendency to focus their attention on the sounds of the words rather than their meaning.  This habit of reading essentially clogs the cognitive faculties of the brain with the labor of saying words to oneself.  In many cases people who subvocalize using system number 2 are not identified by reading teachers, whereas those who read by mouthing the words visibly are quickly spotted.  People who read using number 2 often go through life avoiding reading and getting poor grades in school because of their poor reading ability.

The goal of speed reading is to read rapidly.  Speed reading courses generally introduce exercises to teach readers to read in a manner that suppresses type 1 and 2 subvocalizations.  Most speed reading classes, thinking, and systems date back to the 1950's and 1960's when the term &quot;subvocalization&quot; as was used in these courses was intended to refer primarily to type 2 above.

In modern academic circles, the definition of subvocalization involves primarily type 3, and sometimes type 2. No matter how slow or fast a reader reads, there is no way to eliminate type 3 subvocalization, and according to muscle detection experiments, there is no way to eliminate involuntary muscle movement in the throat that corresponds to subvocalization. Trying to do so has deleterious effects on reading. Allowing the mind to be aware of the sounds of words is a natural process when reading and helps to reduce cognitive load, and helps the mind to access meanings to enable it to comprehend and remember what is read. No matter how fast a person reads or scans, there is always some amount of being aware of the sounds associated with words. Even deaf people associate the mechanisms of making sounds with the sight of words.  Typically a person will know when they have &quot;missed&quot; a word or misread something if they find that they didn't &quot;hear&quot; a complete sentence, that they instantly realize that somehow their cognitive models of a sentence is incomplete or corrupted.  (If you are finding that you are not catching problems with language or do not find yourself getting tripped up over bad writing then you are not &quot;doing it right&quot;, and absolutely should slow down your over-eager pace.  A person who tries to &quot;read&quot; and is going so fast that he is not catching onto problems with language and etc is not &quot;reading&quot;, he is &quot;scanning&quot; which is decidedly something different than the &quot;reading&quot; of &quot;speed '''reading'''&quot;.)

==A remedial technique for curtailing the mouthing of words==

If you are mouthing words, or making any visible movements in the mouth, or throat, the best remedy is to keep a hand over that moving part of the face.  This will allow you to become aware of the moving part and make efforts to eliminate that visible movement.  This technique can also be effective when eliminating the turning of the head instead of the eyes when reading.  It is effective for normal reading and of course may also be an added benefit for those interested in testing the efficacy of speed reading.  

==Humming a tune!  OR Dumb reading - A crutch for beginners==

*First off, the readers eyes move rapidly and must focus instantaneously.  Everything within the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vision%20span vision span] must be sharply in focus.  This requires:
** An up to date [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eyeglass%20prescription eyeglass prescription].  If you are over about 35 years old, in order for your eyes to focus instantly on the printed text, you will probably need a prescription specifically for reading.  Distance vision prescriptions when applied to reading generally result in a slight delay focusing your eyes with each movement of the eyes, and there can be eye strain over time.
** Reading lights.  The eyes focus slowly under dim lights.  They are overwhelmed by bright lights such as the sun glaring off white paper.  By far the best lights for reading are combining Ott-Lite full spectrum CFL bulbs and Blue-Max full spectrum CFL bulbs, The most effective mix is 2 Ott-Lite bulbs per one Blue-Max of the same wattage...  Human eyes simply focus faster and experience higher resolution vision under this light combination as compared to incandescent or virtually any other light source possible.

*It is best to sit at a table or desk with the text held between 15 and 18 inches in front of the eyes.  The ideal reading surface is a sloped drafter's table which aims the book at the reader's face instead of at the ceiling.  Most other postures make it very awkward or difficult to use the fingers to pace with.  Any kind of physical contortion provides considerable distraction often in the form of physical discomfort as the reader tries to maintain position.  Standing up or sitting in a chair without a stable surface supporting the book ultimately results in the book flopping around, using a thumb instead of a finger as a pacer while trying to hold the book with both hands, and other contortions.  A moving book makes it very difficult for the eyes to rapidly focus.

*Eliminate distractions, noises, and anything that will compete for your attention while you do this exercise.

*The best material to start with is a large print non-fiction book.  Small print type found in paperbacks requires longer to focus upon and longer to find one's place.

*The reader traces his fingertip underneath the printed text lines starting at 3/4 of an inch from the left hand margin to 3/4 of an inch from the right hand margin at a steady even speed.  The finger, scanning beneath the text of each and every line acts as a pacer which eyes will naturally follow.  Avoiding tracing the fingers all the way to the margins prevents the eyes from spending time fixating on areas where half the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vision%20span vision span] covers no text -- which would waste time.

*Humming a familiar tune '''out loud''' occupies the speech centers of the brain.  This part of the brain can only really do one thing at a time, so this makes it impossible to mouth words or imagine mouthing words.  The end result is a very unsettling and disorienting experience for someone who learned to read by sounding out each word.  The brain is forced to recognize words in the field of vision as if it has gone &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;mute&quot;.  The brain is forced into a new way of recognizing words without taking the time to laboriously sound out each and every word, one word after another in a linear fashion.  (Alternatives to humming are making a constant stream of verbal noises such as: saying nonsense syllables over and over, counting quickly, or making careening sounds like an airplane.  All of which make you look like a nut :-) )

*Practice this tracing exercise for about 15 minutes a day - ideally early in the morning after breakfast and coffee.  After a few days the reading experience will become more natural and your speed will cease to be limited by the speed limits of spoken speech.

The habit of making noises while reading must eventually be abandoned.  Most readers eventually can read without the crutch of using their finger to pace under the text.

==Developing the &quot;speed&quot; in speed reading==

Follow the exercise instructions above, and:

*The fingers should trace under the printed text at a speed of approximately two-thirds of a second to a second and a half per line.  At this speed (typically 500 to 1200 words per minute), the reader's eyes will typically only be able to make three or four fixations along the line.  (This in contrast to a 240 word per minute subvocalizing reader who typically makes 8 to 12 eye fixations per line.)  At each fixation the reader's eyes will &quot;grab&quot; words in groups of three to five words.  At first, most students will be able to make little or no sense out of the text at the elevated speed.  In the beginning the goal is to train the brain to recognize groups of words.  With practice, over days, weeks or sometimes months, the brain will retrain itself to link groups of words captured in this new way so that it makes sense out of the words it is looking at.

*To develop speed, a commonly taught exercise is to attempt to read twice as fast as the reader can make sense out of the text for a minute or so and then slow down to the speed at which one can make sense out of the text.  This is done by moving one's finger twice as fast under the text.  This forces the brain to make as many adjustments as it can to the higher rate of speed.  The effect is similar to driving down a road at 30 miles per hour, accelerating to 60 and slowing down to 30 miles per hour again.  After slowing down, the 30 miles per hour feels very slow once the brain made adjustments to 60.  To get back to the same &quot;feeling&quot; it had when it was driving 30 miles per hour, the brain wants to go 40 miles per hour.  This usually results in the reader reading slightly faster than he did before pushing.  Repeating this exercise often allows you to develop incrementally greater speeds every day.

One of the main advantages to developing higher speed techniques such as this is that it vastly increases your working mental speed, and the reader's sense of urgency.  Then when the reader slows down to a more moderate rate around 400 to 500 WPM, that reading rate feels very slow, and a lot more quick thinking can happen.  Many people like to &quot;warm up&quot; by reading at speed reading rates before they read at a rate more conducive to comprehension. [http://www.rapidreading.co.uk/rapidreading.asp]

==&quot;Natural&quot; speed readers==

Most people who develop their own method of high speed reading use a modified version of skimming and scanning.

These people claim to &quot;see&quot; an entire paragraph in their mind's eye.

First, the reader searches for keywords in the text.  These are somewhat randomly distributed.  These randomly distributed eye
fixations as the reader searches the text create a somewhat random scatter-pattern of filled &quot;spots&quot; in the &quot;minds eye&quot; of the text.  Since the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_span vision span] of the eyes is essentially three to five words wide, and three to five words high, this scanning pattern fills in spots three to five words wide and high.  With each fixation of the eyes, the brain begins a partial decoding process of every fragment of text in view.  This partial decoding process helps to imprint the &quot;image&quot; of the text in the mind's eye.

Once the reader feels they have sufficiently searched the paragraph for clues to meaning, the eyes then fill in the rest of the mind's eye's image of the paragraph by directing the eyes to all the spaces in between the previous eye fixations in order to generate a complete &quot;image&quot; of the paragraph.

When there are enough spots filled in the image to generate 100% coverage of at least one clause - but sometimes as much as 5 lines at a time - a lightning fast mechanism &quot;linearizes&quot; the already partially decoded text.  This &quot;linearization&quot; step of already partially decoded text occurs at a pace about 10 to 20 times as fast as a reader using the finger pacing technique, but creates the illusion to the reader that the linearizable text is suddenly being read in a linear fashion by a super super fast finger pacing.

After the linearization occurs, the eyes go back over spots of the linearized text for &quot;double takes&quot; and to allow further scrutiny and consideration of ideas.  The eyes may well linger on the paragraph, going from interesting fragment in the paragraph to interesting fragment.

The pattern is: random keywords and the words in the area immediately around them, fill by scattering, linearize, re-scan interesting areas of the text.

It should be noted that incomplete filling of the image of the paragraph by attempting to depend upon peripheral vision or choosing to skip words results in '''gaps''' in the linearization steps which yield nonsensical partial sentences which would cause the brain to come to a complete halt trying to decode what one is reading.  Also, sections of the paragraph &quot;vanish&quot; because of rapid short term memory decay, leaving &quot;holes&quot;.  In all such cases, the eyes instinctively backtrack to the unfilled area(s) of the paragraph in order to fill in the gaps so that the brain perceives a linearizable text.

Most experienced &quot;natural&quot; speed readers find the notion of &quot;words per minute&quot; to be alien and rather nonsensical, as their speed radically alters from paragraph to paragraph.  The catch phrase &quot;words per minute&quot; implies a linear speed maintained on linearly traversed reading material.  &quot;Natural&quot; speed readers are extremely non-linear in their approach. They are likely to read one paragraph at an effective speed of 300 words per minute, and the next at 12,000 when recognizing the information as useless.  The notion of &quot;comprehension&quot; of useless information is equally as nonsensical.  The goal of reading in this manner is to seek out relevant information and be aware of but essentially gloss over the rest.  This is a stark contrast to &quot;classical&quot; speed reading which essentially mandates a steady even rapid pace with the fingers, and a naive expectation that the cognitive functions of the brain will magically keep up.

==Peripheral vision==

Classic speed reading techniques say that the reader should rely upon peripheral vision.  Peripheral vision is the area outside of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vision_span vision span] of the eye.  The eye has an area of about six degrees of arc in which the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macula macula] of the eye has sufficient density of cone cells to resolve printed text.  The theory is that a speed reader can reliably guess at what words are present in the &quot;fuzzy&quot; area outside the macula.  In practice, this does not work.

Research indicates that only the words that were in focus and in the vision span that the eyes actually looked at could be components of answers in comprehension tests.  Readers who attempted to take in too many words at a glance, or who tried to read so fast using finger pacing techniques that they tried to take in words using peripheral vision ultimately could not answer questions about the resulting garbled sentences involving the words not in direct line of sight.

Attempts to &quot;read&quot; that allow a reader to form garbage sentences and gloss over them not going through the mental stage of being aware of the grammatical structure of sentences, convinced the &quot;reader&quot; has understood the text, are completely dubious and have nothing to do with &quot;reading&quot;; they are a very crude, extremely self-deceptive, and ineffective form of text scanning.

Attempts to read using the &quot;natural&quot; speed reader technique are largely incompatible with attempting to rely upon peripheral vision.  This is because using peripheral vision typically cause the reader to form garbage sentences.  When using the &quot;natural&quot; method, the reader is acutely aware of the grammatical structure of sentences, which is a primary focus of the conscious concentration.  The result of perceiving a garbled sentence due to an attempt at peripheral perception is that the brain becomes confused by gaps or by &quot;nonsense&quot;, and the eyes are compelled to backtrack and fixate directly upon the areas previously captured only in peripheral vision in order to resolve the garbage into the actual message intended by the author.  This happens so much that it is a primary component to the apparently random pattern of eye movements of the “natural” speed reader.  Retracing as in the &quot;natural&quot; method is in sharp contrast to classical speed reading methods that dictate that the reader should make one single linear pass through the text material - a method of reading that is very full of problems such as depending upon peripheral vision.

==Confabulation==
Sometimes referred to as &quot;false memory syndrome&quot;, the human mind has a pathological tendency to fill in gaps of memory with vivid creativity that has nothing to do with the original events.  A speed reading person takes in a lot of information very quickly. When he tries to recall it, the brain invents its own version of the original message.  Most speed readers feel that they are acutely and vividly aware of the information in the material they are reading as they read it.  The brain, when attempting to recall it, recalls the feelings of being aware.  It recalls the feelings or what it thinks are memories of the feelings, but often not the original information.  To be consistent with the memory of the feeling, it creates memories that feel the same as the feelings he believes he is recalling from when he was speed reading the original passage.  The brain unconsciously fills in gaps with ideas it creates on the spot, or ideas that it recreates from information it read elsewhere that have the same feeling and general context as the material that was being read.  Because of this scrambling of old memories, random thoughts, and actual reading material, speed reading is often described as &quot;putting the person's memories into a blender&quot;.  Because of this memory scrambling tendency of speed reading, it requires a speed reader to realize how unreliable his memory is likely to be, and make allowances for it.

==SQ3R==

Many college reading classes stress that reading is made much more efficient by following the SQ3R system.  This means:
*Survey - Look over the text to see what it is about and how it is structured
*Question - Form questions in your mind that you want answered by looking at this text
*Read - Read over the text, keeping your questions in mind.  Take notes and/or use a highlighter to flag important points.
*Recite - Take time out from your reading to answer your own questions in your own words.  Some more fortunate readers can form the answers to their questions at high speeds without taking the time to subvocalize the answers.
*Review - Survey the text again and review your notes, questions and answers.

Common sense reading techniques such as this are not antithetical to speed reading.  Speed reading is not about blasting through text as fast as humanly possible in one pass (a misplaced myth about speed reading....), it is about efficiently wading through information.  In most cases overall speed reading speed is actually increased by first surveying the text and forming questions about it.  If you have a lot of active, pertinent questions to answer when you read something, your brain shifts from passive mode, hoping that information will stick, to a more active state in which it classifies information with specific &quot;needs&quot; for information.  Overall speed reading speed can often be dramatically increased if you are reading solely looking for answers to a specific set of questions and are comfortable dismissing or ignoring everything else.

At any time you notice confusion about the material in a segment that you feel you need to understand or might need to understand, mark it with a highlighter or (even better) flag the passage by sticking a color post-it note at that section of the page.  Come back to that section later when you have read more of the author's ideas and have more context with which to evaluate whatever it was that confused you.  It takes about a second away from your reading to grab and attach a sticky flag, and during that second you are taking some time out to let your confusion settle in.

Many people find speed reading skills to be useful for the Survey phase of this.  Using it to review can be somewhat deceptive.

==Imagine debating the author==

Some material is so biased that it is ripe for someone to debate it.  Actively try to imagine what a debater would counter the ideas in the text with.  The more aggressively you come up with counter-arguments, the more emotional you are going to be about the information in the text, and thus the more prone to remember it.  Some types of arguments are so obvious that you don't need to take any time out to think them up.  Others require a little more intensive thought which slows reading down to a crawl.  The more practice you get at &quot;debating&quot; authors of such material, the faster you can recognize and think up debatable counter points, and the faster you can read using this technique.

==A comprehension technique==

One of the biggest misconceptions of speed reading is comprehension. Many people claim there is no comprehension when speed reading, but these people themselves admit they have only practiced speed reading a short time or have not practiced at all. Comprehension is learned over time. When children first learn to read they have no comprehension. After reading for years they develop comprehension. When someone learns speed reading techniques, they must first learn the mechanics and speed, then they develop comprehension. This is no different than a child learning to read the first time. They learn to pronounce words, the mechanics, then when their brain can process this automatically, they learn comprehension. It is common for high school children to only have a 50% to 70% comprehension rate at normal reading speeds. Speed readers often report a 50% comprehension rate after a few months of practice. 

Imagine giving a [[Wikipedia:Microsoft Office PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation to a board of directors about the contents of the material.  In a PowerPoint presentation, information is organized on cards in a manner that simplifies and organizes the information according to the manner in which the reader interprets it.

Only a few items of information can fit on a PowerPoint card.  Limiting the amount of information on a card keeps the quantity of information being organized at any one moment in time within the limits of human cognitive faculties.  To get an appreciation of the reason for limiting the amount of information in a card, try pulling out a credit card from your pocket and repeat 6 random digits from it.  Odds are you can do it.  Then try repeating back 9 digits.  Odds are that you will suddenly forget the digits, maybe remembering two of them.  The brain has an information overload point somewhere between 6 and 9 elements of information it is attempting to juggle.  Any attempts to juggle more than your threshold point are doomed to failure.

Now, the reader can organize information in his mental PowerPoint cards one of two basic ways.  The first way is the traditional outline form that you see in typical PowerPoint presentations.  This is appropriate for some types of information, but generally is less effective than a technique called [[Wikipedia:Mind_Map|mindmapping]] taught by [[Wikipedia:Tony Buzan|Tony Buzan]].  Mind-Mapping is a graphical technique that uses bright colors and diagrams to show the interrelationships in information.  Mindmapping works particularly well in this context because it creates visual representations of information using the high speed image processing centers of the brain.  Somewhat obviously, mind-maps in this context cannot be as complex as a traditional mind-map because the traditional mind-map grows theoretically infinitely.  The individual &quot;cards&quot; have to contain less than 7 elements or they will overload the short term cognitive faculties of the brain just like trying to repeat back 8 or 9 digits will.

The reader makes two or three passes through the material, spending no more than 10 minutes on each pass.  The reason for limiting to 10 minutes is because most people have an effective short term memory limitation of 20 minutes for retaining new information using this technique, and the idea is to retain new information by being able to repeatedly expose yourself to information that becomes more familiar to you as to make each pass through the material.
*In the first pass, the goal is to create a crude outline of the presentation.  The reader gleans his first exposure to the information and in the process mentally configures PowerPoint cards.  The goal of reading during the first pass is to prepare a crude rough outline and crude set of cards for the &quot;presentation&quot;.
*In the second pass through the material, the original text becomes a visual cheat sheet and [[Wikipedia:mnemonic|mnemonic]] aid for the delivery of the material - a first rehearsal and fumbling presentation.  This presentation is not given by [[/Subvocalization|subvocalizing]], but rather by mentally framing exactly what should be said, as if preparing to speak.  The instant each &quot;frame&quot; has been created in the cognitive faculties, the reader moves to the next one without subvocalizing anything.  In this second pass, the original &quot;cards&quot; created in the imagination during the first pass come to mind immediately because of their associations with the sight of the original printed text.
*A third pass, if so desired, is a more polished delivery with the goal of extracting information from the reading material being completely secondary to the active mental act of giving an imagined, polished presentation.  The third pass is supposed to be a slick, practiced delivery.

Virtually every study system ever invented stresses the need to paraphrase what the reader has read in order to both reinforce and test his or her understanding.  This card system performs much the same function.  However it uses the visual centers of the brain which are literally hundreds of times faster than the audio processing centers of the brain.

Typically the reader puts together one or two &quot;cards&quot; per paragraph of reading material.  At 4000 words per minute, the reader is typically generating one new card every two seconds.  With each pass through the material, his mind generates successively finer ideas about what he is going to say about each topic on the card.  Often by the third pass, the person has had the chance to integrate the entire text and can pull in ideas from other parts of the text into his associations with each of the &quot;cards&quot;.  His familiarity with the text by this third pass makes it quite natural for his existing knowledge to figure into the picture.

This system is best mixed with the &quot;natural&quot; speed reading pattern described above, because this pattern allows enormous freedom of eye movements and attention.  This freedom is generally necessary because gaps in understanding at high speeds are very common.  These gaps are best filled by having the freedom to hunt and search the text.  Trying to put together PowerPoint cards and make sure that the reader is putting all the information that is relevant onto them is quite unworkable if one is trying to follow a steadily paced finger.  The brain has to jump around because the PowerPoint presentation cards can only very rarely be organized in the same manner as the text being read has been organized.  Generally speaking, if a reader is trying to organize his mental PowerPoint cards to follow the organization of the text he is reading, he doesn't understand the material and is trying to be a mindless parrot - which simply does not work.

As described in the introduction, reading using this system is an example of &quot;active&quot; reading.  The conscious attention is oriented 100% towards providing feedback upon what the reader actually understood.  This creates an essentially instinctive pattern of re-reading, skimming, scanning, and other strategies to compliment the parts of the text were initially partially understood.  Whereas a typical speed reader would be attempting to make one pass through a section of reading material, the person following this pattern might make as many as a dozen to insure that he understands what he is looking at.  Some parts go by fast and simple at full sprinting speed with simple cards that fly up in a quarter of a second, some parts require more careful paraphrasing.  Some parts might be very step by step and technical, material that does not lend itself at all to the mental processes of speed reading but rather requires 150WPM or less plodding.  If the reader is reading against an unrealistic deadline, he may well simply decide that material that demands a slow careful reading is too much to handle at high speeds and skip it altogether (flagging the page with a physical post it note, for example), not kidding himself that he has any chance of understanding it because he can't even put the basic ideas up on a &quot;card&quot;.

Most people who read using this method report that it seems to induce a bizarre kind of trance that leaves the mind running at an extremely high speed with a feeling of euphoria. This indicates the very high speed reading, 1500 words per minute or more, that requires truly deep concentration and focus.

==Varying speed==

Reading should be an extremely active mental process.  Mental activity ranges in speed from slow and ponderous to instantaneous.  Reading speed should necessarily ''reflect the speeds of the inner mental processes''.  Experienced visually oriented readers who read for understanding typically vary their speed through text.

Good speed reading systems do not teach a fixed reading pace and instead encourage readers to vary their reading speed to fit the material. Some material requires more comprehension and thought, while most material can be read at higher speeds. Bad speed reading systems try to force readers to read at their maximum speed no matter what the material is.

==Regression==

Regression is going back and re-reading a section of text that you feel compelled to for whatever reason.  Most speed reading classes/systems assert that regression is anathema to their reading system.  In practice, avoiding regression is only advisable while you are doing exercises to develop your skills, not for actual material that you need to understand.  Common sense tells you that if you are reading to understand something and there is something that you didn't understand, there is merit in going back and reading something again.

The eye movement patterns of &quot;natural&quot; 10,000 WPM speed readers usually appear to be completely random as they look over a page.  Their eyes move both forwards and backwards in order to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; that they did not &quot;capture&quot; or &quot;understand&quot;.  They can often be seen flipping pages backwards to look back at a previous page they already read.  Developing a habit of becoming aware of something you did not completely understand and going back to read it with scrutiny is a critical habit to develop for comprehension rather than pushing ever forward in the pursuit of speed.

On the other hand, keep in mind that repeatedly re-reading a text can slow you down.  Quite a bit.  Typically you stall for a moment of confusion deciding what to do about your moment of confusion, and then make a decision as to whether to go back and re-read or to continue on forward.  If you are reading material that has been half-way decently prepared, your point of confusion that leads to the impulse for regressing has been predicted by the author and will be explained in a subsequent sentence or paragraph.  As a general rule, WAIT and keep reading forward before regressing.  If you still find yourself to be confused, then go back.

==Long Term Memory==

Speed reading in all forms is essentially incompatible with long term memory.  You cannot speed read your textbooks and expect the information to stick no matter how well you understand the material in short term memory or how aggressive your comprehension techniques are.  Quality speed reading systems will explain this. Speed reading can be used to go through reviews of past chapters and parts that do not require deep comprehension. Slower reading skills are used on new material that requires thought and reflection.

The bottom line is that you have to repeatedly use information in short term memory within about 20 minutes of reading it, or else it has no chance of making into long term memory.  With the amount of information a speed reader tries to tackle, finding uses for it all within 20 minutes is improbable. Speed reading is however a visual intake of information which can be, though loosely, compared to viewing a movie. After viewing a movie, you can remember individual scenes for years afterward even though you may have only seen them for a fraction of a second. 

Nothing can substitute for sane, normal study skills taught at your local community college. [http://www.chemistrycoach.com/lbe5.htm]  Committing information to long term memory simply requires a very different approach.  It simply takes time and effort to commit things to long term memory. Speed reading is another tool in your study toolbox which you can pull out and use when the time is appropriate, like for quick reviews, to find information, for research and other appropriate times.

==Remember to breathe==

Any form of intellectual activity uses brain cells.  Brain cells need both sugar (glucose) and oxygen in order to fire.  If you don’t eat, or don't breathe, your brain won't go.  Generally speaking a person undertaking any type of study should develop the habit of breathing deeply from the diaphragm.  Most college study skills teachers recommend breathing deep once every six seconds in a manner that causes your stomach to protrude rather than your chest lifting.  If you don't do this, the odds of success at speed reading or any other form of intellectual activity are considerably reduced.

==Speed reading fiction==

&quot;Speed reading&quot; fiction at high speeds does not work very well.  This is because fiction focuses upon the '''emotional''' experiences.  The human brain is simply not fast enough processing emotions to push the envelope.  At best, a speed reader of fiction remembers an account of events, but does not have the experience that the author had in mind for the reader. Novels are best read in 'real time' to experience the moment. 

Nevertheless speed reading can improve the fiction experience. Speed reading involves adjusting the reading speed to suit the material. Novels often have long descriptions and backstorys which can be read using speed reading methods. This allows the reader to zip through the slow sections and return to the 'juicy' parts more quickly which are then read at the readers normal pace.

==Reading computer screens==

Many people report that it is next to impossible to &quot;speed read&quot; a CRT computer screen at speeds over about 1000 words a minute.  A speed reader's eyes move VERY rapidly, settling only for very short periods of time.  The [[w:computer screen|computer screen]], being redrawn electronically 60 to 100 times a second (called the [[w:refresh rate|refresh rate]]) creates multiple frozen images in the eyes of the reader as his eyes move between each group of words.  To get an idea of the effect, wave your hand in front of a CRT screen as you read this text.  You will see multiple &quot;frozen&quot; images of your hand rather than a blur.  Essentially, this creates about 5 copies of the text superimposed upon each other as the eyes move between fixations on the text because of the slow decay of visual images in the human eye.  The human eye has to stop long enough to get a good visual image in order to physically see what it is looking at.  When there are multiple superimposed &quot;ghosts&quot; from successive screen redraws, the eye/brain combination gets very confused about what it is looking at.  This &quot;ghosting&quot; effect is more exaggerated with smaller text on the screen.

Note that this effect is generally not present with newer LCD based display screens such as those in laptop computers and the LCD desktop &quot;flat panel&quot; displays.  The pixels on those screens generally &quot;stay-on&quot; during the screen refreshing, and should be similar to printed material for speed reading purposes.  However, many LCD and LED monitors today have adopted a pattern of pulsing the lights rapidly to create a &quot;dimmer light&quot;, counting on your eyes to blend the on and off lights into a steady blur of what seems to be a dimmer light.  In other words, the backlights flicker, creating severe ghosting effects when a speed reader moves his eyes over the monitor.  If you have one of these monitors, your only recourse is to turn the brightness on the monitor all the way up to stop or minimize the flickering - or buy a new monitor that doesn't do that.

==Speed Reading Software==

There are two different camps when it comes to speed reading software.  One camp says it is the scourge of the earth and forces the student into &quot;inorganic&quot; reading methods that do not work (this author is in that camp).  Real world reading material requires the reader to dynamically adapt to the material he or she is reading, and speed reading software forces a rigid pace on the reader.  People who learn to speed read with software usually become dependent upon the software and have to unlearn everything they learned from the software and re-learn how to speed read all over again.

Real reading is an organic process that defies some machine trying to control your brain.

Other experienced speed readers swear by it as in this quotation from an earlier draft of this wikibook:
:''Software is commonly used to re-train the brain for speed reading techniques. Speed reading can be learned without software but software has many benefits including speed testing, and guided reading exercises. It can be much more difficult to read a regular printed page without falling into old subvocalization habits. This is because it forces the brain into a linear pattern of eye movements.  This promotes the exercise of peripheral vision also.  Speed comes first, which is the purpose of the training software, then comprehension is developed over time.  At &quot;normal&quot; reading rates of 200 to 300 words per minute, the brain has time to restructure information that has been recently viewed into non-linear structure. However, many people find this normal rate to be slow and their brain loses focus on the reading material as they begin to daydream or think about other activities. When speed reading in a linear fashion as promoted by speed reading programs, the brain is forced into absorbing information more rapidly, thereby keeping the brain occupied. This may reduce comprehension some when compared to normal reading but the reader can also re-read the material much faster. The speed reading software re-trains the brain to view words as images which allows for a much faster intake of information.''

:''The ability to read in the 'normal' fashion or in the speed reading image method is also dependent on a person's upbringing. Speed reading is very common in Asian cultures that use character languages. The children in these cultures are never taught to pronounce words one letter at a time. As a result, many of these children are not limited by the normal subvocalization reading methods. When these children learn to read other languages, like English, they carry over this reading method and then become natural speed readers. This is not to say all Asians are speed readers. Many still rely on subvocalization either because it is more comfortable for them or this is how they were taught English. It does explain the high number of natural Asian speed readers who come from countries where their first language was a character based language.''

==A success story==

:''When I was 17 years old, I took Advanced Placement Biology at the local high school - the class they give you a year of college credit for at Harvard if you can pass the A.P. exam at the end of the year.  At one point during the year I had been out sick for several weeks.  The day I came back I walked into the Biology classroom 20 minutes early.''

:''Someone asked me if I was &quot;ready for the test.&quot;''

:''It was a midterm exam in Organic Biochemistry.  I hadn't studied any of it at all.''

:''I picked up the textbook and declared &quot;Now I get to put my speed reading skills to the ultimate test.&quot;''

:''There were chuckles and guffaws around the room.  Several people decided they were going to distract me.''

:''I used the &quot;natural&quot; speed reader technique described above and the PowerPoint comprehension system.  At 12,000 words a minute, careening through 105 pages of text averaging 1500 words a page and many detailed diagrams, I made it through one and a half passes through the textbook sections the exam was on.  Because I had accumulated all those &quot;PowerPoint&quot; cards in short term memory, and the essay exam was on a topic I was staring at the moment the teacher took my book away, I managed to write a two page detailed essay on the chemical processes in DNA replication, did quite well on the multiple choice part of the test and got the second highest score in the class.''

:''I walked out of the classroom and could not recall anything from the exam.  Not a single thing.  Gone.  It was all in short term memory.''

:''I still have that test.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Debarking&quot; a dog requires a veterinarian to enter the dog's trachea and modify its vocal cords. The procedure requires the use of a general anesthesia and involves punching or notching the dog's vocal chords to soften or significantly reduce his ability to bark.  No procedure is without risk and debarking risks scarring and narrowing of the tracheal opening following the surgery, causing the dog difficulty in breathing.  After the surgery, the dog sounds hoarse whenever it tries to bark, and it can not generate loud barks. Sometimes the bark will return to some extent due to a build up of scar on the vocal chord but the bark will never be as loud as before.

Debarking is a contentious issue within the dog community, even among experts and veterinarians. Some advocate debarking as a helpful last-resort for incessant barkers while others maintain the process is cruel and unnecessary. This surgery is considered unethical by some veterinarians who believe that the risk does not justify the benefit while others perform this surgery routinely for certain breeds.  

It would be best for a potential dog owner to consider whether a loud animal is acceptable before adopting the dog, as some breeds are less likely to bark than others are. Most dogs can be trained to bark less in situations where it is inappropriate. Should debarking be considered after training has failed, locating a veterinarian that has extensive experience with the procedure is desirable to minimise the risks.

Dogs will be dogs and all dogs bark to some extent. On the other hand, neutered cats rarely make noises loud enough to disturb neighbors, and may be a better choice of pet if noise is unacceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Member Functions ===
Member functions can (and should) be used to interact with data contained within user defined types. User defined types provide flexibility in the ''&quot;[[w:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]]&quot;'' scheme in program writing. In other words, one programmer can write a user defined type and guarantee an interface. Another programmer can write the main program with that expected interface. The two pieces are put together and compiled for usage. User defined types provide ''encapsulation'' defined in the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.

Within classes, to protect the data members, the programmer can define functions to perform the operations on those data members. Member functions and functions are names used interchangeably in reference to classes. Function prototypes are declared within the class definition. These prototypes can take the form of non-class functions as well as class suitable prototypes. Functions can be declared and defined within the class definition. However, most functions can have very large definitions and make the class very unreadable.  Therefore it is possible to define the function outside of the class definition using the scope resolution operator &quot;'''::'''&quot;. This scope resolution operator allows a programmer to define the functions somewhere else.  This can allow the programmer to provide a header file ''.h'' defining the class and a ''.obj'' file built from the compiled ''.cpp'' file which contains the function definitions. This can hide the implementation and prevent tampering. The user would have to define every function again to change the implementation.  Functions within classes can access and modify (unless the function is constant) data members without declaring them, because the data members are already declared in the class.

Simple example:

'''file:''' Foo.h
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// the header file named the same as the class helps locate classes within a project
// one class per header file makes it easier to keep the 
// header file readable (some classes can become large)
// each programmer should determine what style works for them or what programming standards their
// teacher/professor/employer has
 
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H
 
class Foo{
public:
  Foo();                  // function called the default constructor
  Foo( int a, int b );    // function called the overloaded constructor
  int Manipulate( int g, int h );
 
private:
  int x;
  int y;
};
 
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

'''file:''' Foo.cpp
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &quot;Foo.h&quot;
 
/* these constructors should really show use of initialization lists
Foo::Foo() : x(5), y(10)
{
}
Foo::Foo(int a, int b) : x(a), y(b)
{
}
*/
Foo::Foo(){
  x = 5;
  y = 10;
}
Foo::Foo( int a, int b ){
  x = a;
  y = b;
}

int Foo::Manipulate( int g, int h ){
  x = h + g*x;
  y = g + h*y;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Overloading ====
Member functions can be overloaded. This means that multiple member functions can exist with the same name on the same scope, but must have different signatures. A member function's signature is comprised of the member function's name and the type and order of the member function's parameters.

Due to name hiding, if a member in the derived class shares the same name with members of the base class, they will be hidden to the compiler. To make those members visible, one can use declarations to introduce them from base class scopes.

Constructors and other class member functions, except the Destructor, can be overloaded.

==== Constructors ====
A constructor is a special member function that is called whenever a new instance of a class is created.  The compiler calls the constructor after the new object has been allocated in memory, and converts that &quot;raw&quot; memory into a proper, typed object. The constructor is declared much like a normal member function but it will share the name of the class and it has no return value.

Constructors are responsible for almost all of the run-time setup necessary for the class operation. Its main purpose becomes in general defining the data members upon object instantiation (when an object is declared), they can also have arguments, if the programmer so chooses. If a constructor has arguments, then they should also be added to the declaration of any other object of that class when using the '''new''' operator. Constructors can also be overloaded.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Foo myTest;                 // essentially what happens is:  Foo myTest = Foo();
Foo myTest( 3, 54 );        // accessing the overloaded constructor
Foo myTest = Foo( 20, 45 ); // although a new object is created, there are some extra function calls involved
                            // with more complex classes, an assignment operator should
                            // be defined to ensure a proper copy (includes ''deep copy'')
                            // myTest would be constructed with the default constructor, and then the
                            // assignment operator copies the unnamed Foo( 20, 45 ) object to myTest
&lt;/source&gt;

using '''new''' with a constructor

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Foo* myTest = new Foo();           // this defines a pointer to a dynamically allocated object
Foo* myTest = new Foo( 40, 34 );   // constructed with Foo( 40, 34 )
// be sure to use delete to avoid memory leaks
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

{{NOTE|
While there is no risk in using '''new''' to create an object, it is often best to avoid using memory allocation functions within objects' constructors. Specifically, using new to create an array of objects, each of which also uses new to allocate memory during its construction, often results in runtime errors. If a class or structure contains members that must be pointed at dynamically created objects, it is best to sequentially initialize these arrays of the parent object, rather than leaving the task to their constructors.&lt;br&gt;
This is especially important when writing code with exceptions (in [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]), if an exception is thrown before a constructor is completed, the associated destructor will not be called for that object.
}}

A constructor can't delegate to another.  It is also considered desirable to reduce the use of default arguments, if a maintainer has to write and maintain multiple constructors it can result in code duplication, which reduces maintainability because of the potential for introducing inconsistencies and even lead to code bloat.

;'''Default Constructors'''

A default constructor is one which can be called with no arguments.  Most commonly, a default constructor is declared without any parameters, but it is also possible for a constructor with parameters to be a default constructor if all of those parameters are given default values.

In order to create an array of objects of a class type, the class must have an accessible default constructor; C++ has no syntax to specify constructor arguments for array elements.

===== Overloaded Constructors =====
When an object of a class is instantiated, the class writer can provide various constructors each with a different purpose.  A large class would have many data members, some of which may or may not be defined when an object is instantiated.  Anyway, each project will vary, so a programmer should investigate various possibilities when providing constructors.  

These are all constructors for a class myFoo.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; 
myFoo(); // default constructor, the user has no control over initial values
         // overloaded constructors

myFoo( int a, int b=0 ); // allows construction with a certain 'a' value, but accepts 'b' as 0
                         // or allows the user to provide both 'a' and 'b' values
 // or
 
myFoo( int a, int b ); // overloaded constructor, the user must specify both values

class myFoo {
private:
  int Useful1;
  int Useful2;

public:
  myFoo(){                     // default constructor
           Useful1 = 5;
           Useful2 = 10;  
          };

  myFoo( int a, int b = 0 ) { // two possible cases when invoked
         Useful1 = a;
         Useful2 = b;
  };

};
 
myFoo Find;           // default constructor, private member values Useful1 = 5, Useful2 = 10
myFoo Find( 8 );      // overloaded constructor case 1, private member values Useful1 = 8, Useful2 = 0
myFoo Find( 8, 256 ); // overloaded constructor case 2, private member values Useful1 = 8, Useful2 = 256
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Constructor initialization lists =====
Constructor initialization lists (or member initialization list) are the only way to initialize data members and base classes with a non-default constructor. Constructors for the members are included between the argument list and the body of the constructor (separated from the argument list by a colon). Using the initialization lists is not only better in terms of efficiency but also the simplest way to guarantee that all initialization of data members are done before entering the body of constructors.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Using the initialization list for myComplexMember_ 
MyClass::MyClass(int mySimpleMember, MyComplexClass myComplexMember)
: myComplexMember_(myComplexMember) // only 1 call, to the copy constructor
{
 mySimpleMember_=mySimpleMember; // uses 2 calls, one for the constructor of the mySimpleMember class
                                 // and a second for the assignment operator of the MyComplexClass class
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is more efficient than assigning value to the complex data member inside the body of the constructor because in that case the variable is initialized with its corresponding constructor.



Note that the arguments provided to the constructors of the members do not need to be arguments to the constructor of the class; they can also be constants.  Therefore you can create a default constructor for a class containing a member with no default constructor.

Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
MyClass::MyClass() : myComplexMember(0)_ { }
&lt;/source&gt;

It is useful to initialize your members in the constructor using this initialization lists. This makes it obvious for the reader that the constructor does not execute logic. The order the initialization is done should be the same as you defined your base-classes and members. Otherwise you can get warnings at compile-time. Once you start initializing your members make sure to keep all in the constructor(s) to avoid confusion and possible 0xbaadfood.

It is safe to use constructor parameters that are named like members.

Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class MyClass : public MyBaseClassA, public MyBaseClassB {
  private:
    int c;
    void *pointerMember;
  public:
    MyClass(int,int,int);
};
/*...*/
MyClass::MyClass(int a, int b, int c):
 MyBaseClassA(a)
,MyBaseClassB(b)
,c(c)
,pointerMember(NULL)
,referenceMember()
{
 //logic
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this technique was also possible for normal functions but it is now obsoleted and is classified as an error in such case.

{{NOTE|It is a common misunderstanding that initialization of data members can be done within the body of constructors. All such kind of so-called &quot;initialization&quot; are actually assignments. The C++ standard defines that all initialization of data members are done before entering the body of constructors. This is the reason why certain types (const types and references) cannot be assigned to and must be initialized in the constructor initialization list.

One should also keep in mind that class members are initialized in the order they are declared, not the order they appear in the initializer list.  One way of avoiding [[w:Chicken or the egg|chicken and egg paradoxes]] is to always add the members to the initializer list in the same order they're declared.}}

==== Destructors ====
Destructors like the Constructors are declared as any normal member functions but will share the same name as the Class, what distinguishes them is that the Destructor's name is preceded with a &quot;~&quot;, it can not have arguments and can't be overloaded.
 
Destructors are called whenever an Object of the Class is destroyed. Destructors are crucial in avoiding resource leaks (by deallocating memory), and in implementing the RAII idiom. Resources which are allocated in a Constructor of a Class are usually released in the Destructor of that Class as to return the system to some known or stable state after the Class ceases to exist.

The Destructor is invoked when Objects are destroyed, after the function they were declared in returns, when the '''delete''' operator is used or when the program is over.  If an object of a derived type is destructed, first the Destructor of the most derived object is executed. Then member objects and base class subjects are destructed recursively, in the reverse order their corresponding Constructors completed. As with structs the compiler implicitly declares a Destructor as an inline public member of its class if the class doesn’t have a user-declared Destructor. 

The [[w:dynamic type|dynamic type]] of the object will change from the most derived type as Destructors run, symmetrically to how it changes as Constructors execute.  This affects the functions called by virtual calls during construction and destruction, and leads to the common (and reasonable) advice to avoid calling virtual functions of an object either directly or indirectly from its Constructors or Destructors.

==== {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} ====
Sharing most of the concepts we have seen before on the introduction to [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#Inline|inline functions]], when dealing with member function those concepts are extended, with a few additional considerations.

If the member functions definition is included inside the declaration of the class, that function is by default made implicitly inline. Compiler options may override this behavior.

Calls to virtual functions cannot be inlined if the object's type is not known at compile-time, because we don't know which function to inline.

==== {{C++ Programming/kw|static}} ====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/static}}
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/static/Member Function}}
==== const ====
This type of member function cannot modify the member variables of a class. It's a hint both to the programmer and the compiler that a given member function doesn't change the internal state of a class; however, any variables declared as &lt;tt&gt;mutable&lt;/tt&gt; can still be modified. 

Take for example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class Foo
 {
  public:
    int value() const
    {
      return m_value;
    }
 
    void setValue( int i )
    {
      m_value = i;
    }
 
  private:
    int m_value;
 };

&lt;/source&gt;

Here &lt;tt&gt;value()&lt;/tt&gt; clearly does not change m_value and as such can and should be const. However &lt;tt&gt;setValue()&lt;/tt&gt; does modify m_value and as such cannot be const.

Another subtlety often missed is a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; member function cannot call a non-const member function (and the compiler will complain if you try).
The &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; member function cannot change member variables and a non-const member functions can change member variables.  Since we assume non-const member functions do change member variables, &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; member functions are assumed to never change member variables and can't call functions that do change member variables.

The following code example explains what &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; can do depending on where it is placed.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class Foo
 {
 public:
    /*
     * Modifies m_widget and the user
     * may modify the returned widget.
     */
    Widget *widget();
 
    /*
     * Does not modify m_widget but the
     * user may modify the returned widget.
     */
    Widget *widget() const;
 
    /*
     * Modifies m_widget, but the user
     * may not modify the returned widget.
     */
    const Widget *cWidget();
 
    /*
     * Does not modify m_widget and the user
     * may not modify the returned widget.
     */
    const Widget *cWidget() const;
 
 private:
    Widget *m_widget;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Accessors and Modifiers (Setter/Getter) ====
;'''What is an accessor?''':An accessor is a member function that does not modify the state of an object. The accessor functions should be declared as [[C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions#const|const]].

:'''Getter''' is another common definition of an accessor due to the naming ( &lt;tt&gt;GetSize()&lt;tt&gt; ) of that type of member functions.

;'''What is a modifier?''':A modifier, also called a modifying function, is a member function that changes the value of at least one data member. In other words, an operation that modifies the state of an object. Modifiers are also known as ‘mutators’.

:'''Setter''' is another common definition of a modifier due to the naming ( &lt;tt&gt;SetSize( int a_Size )&lt;/tt&gt; ) of that type of member functions.

{{NOTE|These are commonly used reference labels (not defined on the standard language).}}
{{:C++ Programming/Classes/Polymorphism}}
[[Category:C++ Programming|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]

==== Law of three ====
The &quot;law of three&quot; is not really a law, but rather a guideline: if a class needs an explicitly declared copy constructor, copy assignment operator, or destructor, then it usually needs all three.

There are exceptions to this rule (or, to look at it another way, refinements).  For example, sometimes a destructor is explicitly declared just in order to make it &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;; in that case there's not necessarily a need to declare or implement the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.

Most classes should not declare any of the &quot;big three&quot; operations; classes that manage resources generally need all three.</text>

I don't think Japanese use &quot;こはい&quot; or &quot;後輩&quot;. 先輩 can be an affix, but not 後輩. 

Regarding the polite forms of 食べる, I think 食べませ is not used. Native speakers would say 食べてください, or 食べなさい, for example. So I think it should be noted with the asterisk mark. [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 11:41, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FrenchToC}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The subjunctive in French is used to express doubt, desire, surprise, judgment, necessity, possibility, opinions, and emotions. It usually follows the word &quot;que.&quot; The conjugations for the subjunctive mood for regular verbs are as follows:

Take the ''ils'' form of the verb, at the present time tense drop the ''-ent'' and add the following:

je - e

tu - es

il - e

nous - use the &quot;imparfait&quot; time tense

vous - use the &quot;imparfait&quot; time tense

ils - ent

Some irregular verb conjugations:


&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;infinitive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;que je/j'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;que tu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;qu'il&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;que nous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;que vous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;qu'ils&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;avoir&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;aie&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;aies&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ait&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ayons&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ayez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;aient&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;être&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sois&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sois&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;soit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;soyons&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;soyez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;soient&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Welcome to the World History Project's Contributor's Corner.  Contributor's corner is a place for contributors to discuss plans, ideas, and discuss development resources.  There's no need to use the discussion page here-- just dig right in with comments!

==Planning==

==Ideas==

===General Comments===
Okay, I am not sure if this is the right place where I can say this, but I think you are doing a great job. This page is just what I needed. Please, go on with your work. Lissa
el toro bravo español
en españa desde tiempos muy remotos se leha adorado al toro(un ejemplo esta en las cuevas de altamira).despues los iberos siguieron adorando y lo adoptaron como un dios ,al ver la devocion que estos pueblos tenian al toro los griegos llamaron a esa zona la region de los tauros,y se cree que por hay habia minotauros.mas tarde esta devocion con la llegada de los romanos se combirtio en un espectaculo.
mastarde,esto se perdio,pro en el siglo XVII algunos nobles empezaron a torear con el caballo(esta tecnica se llama rejoneo),luego la gente mas pobre lo imtaron a pie combiriendolo en el toreo.actualmente es un espectaculo muy completo extendiendose por mexico,españa, portugal,y al sur de francia.pero la verdadera alma del toro se encuentra en españa y si no se cuida se perdera.

==Helpful Hints==
Please use the term &quot;Allied Powers&quot; when referring to the US/UK/France in WWI and the &quot;Allies&quot; when referencing WWII. I always find that it helps to keep things clarified.


The page should be set so that when people write &quot;World War Two&quot; they are directed to this place, because it did not happen to me when I typed it. I had to type &quot;World War II&quot; to come here.

It would be better if the chapters are arranged according to themes (as specified in the AP Exam Course) rather than on the basis of regions. The regional subdivisions may be maintained as a part of the larger thematic chapter. For e.g. Instead of a chapter on each of the Classical Civilization, it would be better if all are treated under one large unit with comparing and contrasting each with the other in their respective subdivisions.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The country as envisioned by [[w:George Washington|George Washington]] was to have no political parties. The good of the country on the whole was to be the total and unselfish goal of all. Even the electoral college was idealistically set up to elect the best man with the most votes as president and the second best, runner-up was to be vice-president. This did not allow for the current party system, with a &quot;political ticket&quot; running together as president/vice president.

This ideal quickly dissolved. During the term of [[w:John  Adams|John  Adams]] a law called the [[w:sedition act|sedition act]] came to be which was to limit dissent about the government itself. This desire has followed us into the 21st Century. During the rule of Adams, who also successfully defended the soldiers who, in a state of panic, opened fire on rioters during the [[w:Boston Massacre|Boston Massacre]], several writers and others were thrown into jail. (The Boston Massacre was an event of the 1700s in which British troops opened fire on colonial civilians and caused several deaths and injuries. John Adams successfully defended British troops in court, because he did not want anyone to go without legal counsel.)

The Washingtonian ideal was dead when, in the election of 1800, [[w:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] ran against John Adams. Jefferson beat Adams, but tied with his vice-presidential candidate [[w:Aaron Burr|Aaron Burr]]. This led to the electoral college being unable to reach a decision on the winner and the election was forced into the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives balloted 36 times before deciding on Thomas Jefferson as president, which was the clear will of the people. As a result of this election party politics was actively in motion, and the constitution was changed to separately elect the office of Vice President and President.

==Third Parties==
There are many third parties in American politics. The [[w:Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] and [[w:Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] are parties that cross countries. These parties exist both in U.S. politics and world politics. While their beliefs are the same, the Green and Libertarian parties in the United States are separate from the parties of the same name in other countries. This same distinction is true of these parties in other countries.

The Greens are [[w:Progressivism|progressive]]. Ecology is only one part of their platform. They also believe in racial diversity, a living wage, and laws and policies expressed in a humanitarian manner, locally, nationally, and globally.

Libertarians believe that citizens should have complete control over their actions as long as their actions do not interfere with the actions of others. In other words, you have your rights as long as they don't interfere with other people’s rights. Libertarians also believe in decentralized government, where the power lies with the States themselves.

===Third Party History===

Third Parties have been around since the founding of the United States.

The U.S. Constitution makes no mention of political parties. This was a smart move; it would be anti-Constitutional to show any preference to any political party.

The first two political parties were the Federalists and the Democrat-Republicans. The Federalists believed in a strong central government and the Democrat-Republicans believed in strong states’ rights.

Issues, disagreements, and beliefs are the reasons for the major political parties and the third parties. Some past third parties include: Anti-Masonic Party, Free Soil Party, Union Party (merged with another third party - the Republicans), Whigs, the Know-Nothing Party (also known as the American Party), Dixiecrats (also known as the States' Rights Democrats), the Progressive Party, and the Bull Moose Party.

What did these third parties believe in? What were their causes and goals?

The first third party was the Anti-Masonic party (1831). They were also the first party to hold a national convention.

They didn't like the secrecy of the Masons. They believed this group to be un-American.

William Wirt (Anti-Masonic) ran against Andrew Jackson in the 1832 election. He didn't win but he carried Vermont. This election featured 3 candidates: Andrew Jackson (Democrat), Henry Clay (National Republican), and William Wirt (Anti-Masonic).

Abraham Lincoln (originally a member of the Whig Party) won the presidency as a Republican; a third party that was against slavery in the territories but upheld slavery in the South. Lincoln was also a member of the Union Party whose goal was &quot;the Constitution as it is and the Union as it is&quot;. Members of the Whig Party and the Know-Nothing Party formed this party.

This election featured 4 candidates: Abraham Lincoln (Republican), Stephen Douglas (Democrat), John C. Breckinridge (Southern Democrat), and John Bell (Constitutional Unionist). Lincoln won and Douglas came in last behind the Southern Democrat and Constitutional Unionist candidates.

The Free Soil Party (1846-1854) as the name suggests, was anti-slavery. They opposed the expansion of slavery into the new states (the western territories), as they became part of the Union.

Martin Van Buren, the eighth U.S. president and a Democrat, served one term from 1837-1841. He ran as a Free Soil candidate in the 1848 presidential election and lost.

This election featured 3 candidates: Zachary Taylor (Whig), Martin Van Buren (Free Soil), and Lewis Cass (Democrat). Taylor won the election with Van Buren finishing second.

The Know-Nothing Party (also known as the American Party) was popular during the 1850s. They believed in setting limits to immigration and naturalized citizenship. They received their moniker by adhering to a simple rule - if people asked them about the party, they were told to say that they know nothing.

The party dissolved in 1856. The pro-slavery members joined the Democrats and the anti-slavery members joined the Republicans.

The Whig Party was formed in opposition to President Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson was very popular, had a strong personality, and was not afraid to use it.

His opponents interpreted his strong personality negatively and saw him as a king. They also believed in a strong national bank; Jackson didn't believe in a central bank. He favored state banks.

Andrew Jackson was a popular and strong candidate. His presidency was the beginning of the modern Democratic Party.

The Whig Party dissolved over the issue of slavery. The Northern Whigs (anti-slavery) joined the Republicans and the Know-Nothing Party and the Southern Whigs (pro-slavery) joined the Democrats.

The Republican Party incorporated a variety of different political parties. These parties included: the Free Soil Party, some of the Know-Nothing Party, and some of the Whigs (the Northern Whigs).

Theodore Roosevelt served nearly 2 full terms as a Republican president from 1901-1909. In 1912, he accepted the nomination of the Bull Moose Party. This party believed in progressive politics. The party consisted of a group of liberal Republicans who were against the conservative policies of the Republican president William Taft.

The 1912 election was a 4-person race. It included the Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, the Republican, William Taft, the Bull Moose, Theodore Roosevelt, and the Socialist, Eugene Debs.

Roosevelt lost, but received 25% of the vote. Woodrow Wilson won the election with Roosevelt finishing second.

Strom Thurmond ran as a Dixiecrat (also known as the States' Rights Democrats) in the 1948 presidential election. The Dixiecrats were an extremely conservative faction of the Democrat Party. They opposed the Democrats' civil rights program. They were alarmed at the changes being wrought by the Truman Administration, which included desegregation of the Armed Forces in 1950.

The 1948 election featured 4 candidates: Harry Truman (Democrat), Thomas Dewey (Republican), Strom Thurmond (Dixiecrat), and Henry Wallace (Progressive Party). Truman won the election but Strom Thurmond received over 1 million votes, carried 4 states, and won 39 electoral votes. Henry Wallace was once a friend of Truman's but had become radical, and in some quarters, was considered a Communist. Truman's great fear was with the Democrat Party effectively splitting into three factions, one moderate, one right of center, and one left of center, the Republicans would have a cake walk. In fact one newspaper called for Dewey before all the results were in, so convinced were they Truman had lost. This is an important reason why Third Parties can be instrumental in the incumbent President losing the election. Truman won and was able to continue his plan of following New Deal principles laid down by former President Roosevelt.

Third parties are essential ingredients for our political process. They draw attention to issues and causes that the major parties ignore. They invigorate and introduce people to the political process. They are a perfect example of free speech.

Many citizens join third parties because they believe both the Democrats and the Republicans don't represent them. If it weren't for third parties, they wouldn't be part of the political process.

Third parties also spotlight the question - Can a two party system represent the interests of all Americans? Most countries have a parliamentary form of government. Parliaments have many parties representing both diverse and minority points of view. While there will be no parliament in the United States, maybe there needs to be more parties to represent the diversity of the United States. James Madison had always maintained, however, that majority rule was against the principles laid down by the Founding Fathers. With majority rule, one party and then the other, may achieve an unassailable majority to enact controversial legislation. Madison believed people should stand for a time as representative of their community, and in turn elect senior law makers and governors who would quorum to enact legislation. Once these people had served, they returned to lives in the local community, thus making them reflect the interests of their constituents rather than some spurious political ideology compelled on them from above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Gujarati language''' is an Indo-European language spoken in [[/Gujarat/]], a state in Western India, and in many countries where Indians have emigrated. It is written from left to right with a specific alphabet similar to Devanagari, which is used to write Hindi and Sanskrit. This alphabet is in fact an abugida of 47 characters. Gujarati is a phonetic language with very few exceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gujarati}}

Gujarati has its own writing system, distinct but related to several other Indian languages' writing systems, such as the one used to write Hindi. Strictly speaking, the Gujarati writing system is what is called an ''abugida'' (and not an ''alphabet''), because the consonant characters all contain an inherent vowel, and other vowels are written as accents added on to the consonant characters. There are also symbols for stand-alone vowels.

== Combinations: consonants and vowels ==

As an example, the following are the possible combinations of the consonant &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક&lt;/font&gt; (''ka'') with the vowel symbols. The dash seen under the first ક of each example (the difference between ક and ક્) marks the ક as not having the inherent vowel (અ ''a''), but this is not used in normal writing (and the presence of the inherent vowel is left ambiguous).

:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્&lt;/font&gt; ''k'' + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;અ&lt;/font&gt; ''a'' = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક&lt;/font&gt; ''ka''
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્&lt;/font&gt; ''k'' + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;આ&lt;/font&gt; ''aa'' = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કા&lt;/font&gt; ''kaa''

===Example: all possible combinations for ક ''k''===
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;અ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;આ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કા&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઇ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કિ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઈ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કી&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઉ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કુ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઊ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કૂ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઋ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કૃ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;એ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કે&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઐ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કૈ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઓ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કો&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ક્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઔ&lt;/font&gt; = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;કૌ&lt;/font&gt;

===Special cases===
When the consonant ર ''r'' is followed by the vowels ઉ ''u'' or  ''uu'', the combined character looks different than the normal pattern:
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ર્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઉ&lt;/font&gt;  = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;રુ&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ર્ &lt;/font&gt; + &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ઊ&lt;/font&gt;  = &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;રૂ&lt;/font&gt;

== Alphabet ==

Here is the Gujarati writing system in the &quot;alphabetic&quot; order. The vowels come first, followed by consonants. Unless otherwise stated, the pronunciation is roughly the same as in English.

:Not only that, but the page itself is way too long, I think it needs to be broken up into chapters etc. Anyone up for the job? [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:31, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I just spliced away half this book into mere bucket-sized chunks(was 374ish KB, now 189 KB).  Will do the rest. &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 19:31, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

:Is done :) &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 19:50, 19 August 2005 (UTC)


:Humm I think all books should have a monolithic version for easy print &amp; portability... see [[:Programming:C_-/-_-/-]] --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:52, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

::I think it should be merged with [[Programming:Java]] instead.  This book is basically a dump of a GFDL Java textbook.  This also happens to be at least 20x larger. &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 18:27, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

==Java is not a language?==
The cleanup tag here says: '''&quot;Java is not a language, its a vm and this entire thing is on how to use it.&quot;'''
[[w:Java]] says java is both, so I removed the tag. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 23:01, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Add Java to the title ==

Because this is a book about Java, I think it might be better to add Java to the title. (Rename to Java - The Way of the Program) or you could give it a funky name like The Way of the Java.

[[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] ([[User talk:Markhobley|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markhobley|contribs]]) 03:42, 2 May 2011 (UTC)

I find this situation humorous.

The first public version of this book *did* have Java in its title --
back when it was
&quot;Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot;[http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/]
by Allen B. Downey.
(Including &quot;Chapter 1  The way of the program&quot; [http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/html/thinkjava003.html] ).
Later, some people claimed this book &quot;isn't really about Java&quot; -- see
[[Talk:Java Programming#merge]].
Apparently someone who agreed with them took &quot;Java&quot; out of the title of this book (apparently before it showed up at Wikibooks).
Now the well-meaning Markhobley wants to put &quot;Java&quot; back in the title.

What do you think about restoring the original title,
&quot;Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; ?

Application:

Although I have not contributed much to the world of the Wikibooks themselves, with the exception of [[German]] and a few notes on [[PHP]], I am responsible for the famous square blobs, whose created was prompted by the need for small, clear indicaters usable by colourblind or visually impared users ([[Image:00%.png]], [[Image:25%.png]], [[Image:50%.png]], [[Image:75%.png]] &amp; [[Image:100%.png]]) used not only in English Wikibooks but also in many of the foreign language versions of Wikibooks (Including: Spanish, Estonian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Finnish, Tamil and Traditional Chinese).

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Article titles that cannot be named correctly due to software limitations may be set using the {{tlx|Displaytitle}} template.

== Excluded characters ==
The following characters are not allowed in page titles:
 # + &lt; &gt; [ ] | { }

The forwared slash, &quot;&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is allowed, but not as the first character. Slashes in page titles, delimit sub-pages. Should the page &quot;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&quot; exist, then the page &quot;&lt;code&gt;A/B&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will be a sub-page of &quot;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with the title &quot;&lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

== Lowercase first letter ==
The first character of book titles is forced to lower case. Sub-pages may begin with either case. This may be fixed in the future.

== Namespaces ==

A book name cannot coincide with a namespace (such as &quot;Wikibooks:&quot;, or &quot;Help:&quot;).</text>

=FAQ=

==What is it?==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid green;&quot;&gt; 
NO Rights was created by the need of yet another attempt to reach the final step on the P2P evolution, it's not meant to be a file-sharing application only.
It will not only permit the sharing of files but any other content or resources across a distributed network with focus on being a platform for abstraction to any other open-system like NNTP (Newsgroups), IRC (Internet Relay Chat), Email etc...


&lt;/div&gt;
----
==Why am I having problems using this software ? (Windows XP only)==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid green;&quot;&gt; 
Since P2P (and P2P related technologies) started to pop up, security of the user OS started to be placed above the user freedoms, probably because most people are, (hum how can I state this...) technologically challenged, so other people are free to think for the masses in place of just try to push the information out. If you are one of those few that only now found about this, I'm sorry to be the one to open your eyes to a not so happy world, a funny thing seems that after this security enhancements are done they tend to be hidden so not to cause any brain damage or confusion to the users.

Well not all is lost, it seems that some people can't seem to be made to comply with this state of things and some information can be found and actions reversed.

==Epidemiology==
*Childhood HD occurs at age 4-14 years
**Male predominance 4:1
**Associated with decreasing socio-economic status and increasing family size
*Young adult HD occurs at age 15-30 years
**Equal male/female incidence
**Associated with increasing socio-economic status and decreasing family size


==Pathology==
*Clonal expansion of a single transformed B-cell
*Two separate phenotypes:
**&lt;u&gt;Classical HD&lt;/u&gt;: has Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells; [[w:CD30|CD30]]+, [[w:J-chain|J chain]]-
**&lt;u&gt;Lymphocyte predominant&lt;/u&gt;: has Lymphocytic and Histiocytic (L&amp;H) cells; [[w:CD30|CD30]]-, [[w:J-chain|J chain]]+, [[w:CD20|CD20]]+, [[w:CD15|CD15]]-
*Strong association with EBV, particularly in young children and developing countries
*Association with congenital ([[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Ataxia-Telangiectasia|AT]]) and acquired (HIV) immunodeficiency


==Staging==
*Uses standard [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin/Overview#Staging|Ann Arbor system]]
*Location
**80% cervical lymphadenopathy
**75% mediastinal involvement in &gt;10 year olds but 33% mediastinal involvement in &lt;10 year olds
**Isolated infradiaphragmatic disease is rare (&lt;5%)
*Stage I-II 60%, Stage III-IV 40%
*B-symptoms: &lt;10 year olds 20%, &gt;10 year olds ~30%


==Treatment==
*Goal of risk-adapted therapy is to define least amount of therapy with the fewest long-term complications; controversy remains about the minimal required therapy:
**Prevent impairment of skeletal and soft tissue growth after high dose EFRT
**Decrease risk of AML and infertility after high doses of alkylating agents (MOPP)
**Decrease risk of CAD after treatment after thoracic RT and anthracyclines
**Decrease risk of pulmonary fibrosis after thoracic RT and bleomycin
**Eliminate life-threatening consequences of splenectomy from surgical staging
**Decrease risk of breast cancer and secondary solid tumors after IFRT
*Initial treatment in 1960's was high-dose RT alone to 40 Gy EFRT modeled after adult treatment; 5-year DFS was 60-80% in pathologically staged children with early-stage disease
*Concerns about skeletal and soft tissue dysfunction, and resulting growth impairment, led to evaluation of multiple cycles of chemotherapy replacing a portion of RT. Addition of MOPP allowed Stanford investigators to lower RT dose to 15-25 Gy in 1970's, with OS and EFS at 10 years ~90% for the entire cohort
*ABVD was tried to mitigate some of MOPP toxicity, particularly reducing risk of sterility and second malignancy. 
*Reports showed that MOPP + ABVD and ABVD + RT were better than MOPP alone or MOPP + RT
*As a result, CCG 521 was undertaken, and demonstrated that ABVD x 6 cycles + low-dose 21 Gy EFRT is comparable to ABVD/MOPP x12 cycles. MOPP (and its toxicity) could be eliminated from first line therapy
*Meanwhile, another Stanford series demonstrated good outcomes in patients with bulky disease with dose intensified MOPP/ABVE (Stanford V) and 36 Gy RT. However, there are concerns about combining alkylating agents and high-dose RT for delayed toxicity of treatment
*Pediatric Oncology Group developed a series of trials around ABVD. In POG 9425, patients with advanced disease were treated on risk-adapted ABVE-PC protocol with IFRT 21 Gy. In POG 9426, patients were treated on DBVE with IFRT. Both studies are maturing. 
*POG and CCG also performed trials attempting to eliminate RT altogether. POG 8725 compared MOPP/ABVD x8 cycles with and without low dose TNI/sub-TNI in advanced patients. There was no benefit for RT. However, the chemo regimen used included significant doses, and which are concerning for long-term toxicity (gonadal, cardiac, secondary leukemias)
*CCG 5942 attempted to eliminate RT in patients who had complete response to 4 cycles of COPP/ABV. The study was closed early, after demonstrating benefit of RT in all patients subgroups. However, the benefit is likely to be smaller compared to toxicity in low risk patients, and higher compared to toxicity in high risk patients
*Similarly, a European trial GPOH-HD 95 showed that elimination of RT is not advisable for intermediate and advanced stages, but is possible in patients with early stage and good response to chemotherapy. 
*The conclusions thus far appear to be 1) low-dose RT may be omitted, but appears to require excessive chemotherapy to compensate, and 2) patient subgroups for whom RT may be safely omitted with reasonable chemotherapy have not yet been well defined. Low disease burden and early response to treatment may be prognostic factors, which may allow elimination of RT
*to be continued ...


===Low Risk===
*Typically Stage I-IIA, non-bulky, no extranodal disease, &lt;3 sites
*10-year EFS ~90%, OS 96%


*'''COG AHOD-0431''' (Ongoing) - &quot;A Phase III Study for the Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Newly Diagnosed Low Risk Hodgkin Disease&quot;
**Prospective single arm. Children with low risk disease (IA-IIA, nonbulky, non-B). Treated with response directed therapy. Initially [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#AVPC|AVPC]] x 3 cycles. If CR, then no RT and salvage as per protocol. If PR, then IFRT 21/14 to disease involved at presentation. For mediastinum, modified mantle.


*'''POG 9426''' (Completed 10/2004)
**Prospective. Children with low risk disease (IA, IIA, IIIA1 (spleen, celiac, portal nodes), nonbulky, non-B). Treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#DBVE|DBVE]] x2 cycles. If CR, then IFRT 25.5/17. If PR, then DBVE x2 more courses, followed by IFRT 25.5/17. RT to disease involved at presentation.

*'''Stanford, 2007''' PMID 17235049 -- &quot;Final results of a prospective clinical trial with VAMP and low-dose involved-field radiation for children with low-risk Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Donaldson SS, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 20;25(3):332-7.)
**Prospective. 110 children, low risk (Stage I-II, mediastinal mass &lt;1/3 diameter, no extranodal disease, peripheral LN &lt;6cm). Treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#VAMP|VAMP]] x4 cycles and low-dose IFRT (15 Gy if CR, 25.5 Gy if PR). Median F/U 9.6 years
**10-year outcome: OS 96%, EFS 89%; Favorable factors: early CR, absence of B-symptoms, lymphocyte predominant, &lt;3 initial sites of disease
**Toxicity: correctable hypothyroidism 42%, 1 patient cardiac dysfunction, 2 malignant tumors (1 thyroid CA within RT field, 1 Ewings outside RT field). 17 healty babies born to 106 survivors
**Conclusion: Risk-adapted strategy effective and well tolerated, without alkylating agents, bleomycin, etoposide, or high-dose EFRT. Children expected to retain normal fertility, organ function, and low risk of second tumors

===Unfavorable===
*Typically: 
**Stage I-II with bulky disease, or extranodal, or with B-symptoms
**Stage III-IV disease
*5-year EFS 70-90%, OS ~85%


*'''COG AHOD0031''' (Ongoing)
**Intermediate disease (I-II bulky or extranodal or B-symptoms, all III, IVA, IVAE). [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#ABVE-PC|ABVE-PC]] x2 cycles, followed by response evaluation. Early responders with CR randomized to +/- IFRT, if PR receive IFRT. Late responders randomized to ABVE-PC x2 cycles + IFRT 21/14 (standard arm) vs. [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#DECA|DECA]] + ABVE x2 cycles + IFRT 21/14 (augmented arm). Goal of the study is to see if some patient (early CR) may not need IFRT, and if some patients (late CR) may benefit from additional chemo dose escalation and IRFT.


*'''POG 9425'''
**216 patients. Intermediate (IIA/IIIA, bulky) or high stage (IIB, IIIB, IV). [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#DBVE-PC|DBVE-PC]] and using early response to limit cumulative therapy. Everyone IFRT 21/14 (Stage II: mantle only, Stage III-IV subtotal/total NI). Randomized to +/- dexrazoxane for cardiopulmonary protection
**'''2002''' [http://www.asco.org/portal/site/ASCO/menuitem.34d60f5624ba07fd506fe310ee37a01d/?vgnextoid=76f8201eb61a7010VgnVCM100000ed730ad1RCRD&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=16&amp;abstractID=1555 ASCO Abstract] - &quot;POG 9425: response-based, intensively timed therapy for intermediate/high stage (IS/HS) pediatric Hodgkin's disease&quot; (Schwartz CL, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 21: 2002 (abstr 1555) 
***2-year outcomes: EFS 88% (IS 86%, HS 89%)
***Conclusion: Thus far, 63% required only 9 weeks of chemo, followed by RT. This may reduce long-term toxicity
**'''Dexrazoxane, 2007''' PMID 17290056 -- &quot;Dexrazoxane-associated risk for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome and other secondary malignancies in pediatric Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Tebbi CK, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 10;25(5):493-500.)
***Studies POG 9425 and POG 9426 randomized patients to DRZ (n=239) or no DRZ (n=239) concomitant with chemo as a cardiopulmonary protectant
***4-year second malignancies: DRZ 3.4% vs. no DRZ 0.8% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: DRZ is a Topo-II inhibitor; adding it may have increased incidence of 2nd malignancy and AML/myelodysplasia

*'''US Multi-institutional''' (1993-2000)
**Prospective. 4 institutions (St. Jude's, Stanford, DFCI, Maine). 159 children with unfavorable HD (52% Stage III-IV, or 48% Stage I-II with bulky disease or with B-symptoms). Treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|VAMP/COP]] x6 cycles, followed by IFRT (15/10 Gy if CR, 25.5/17 Gy if PR after 2 cycles). RT given to standardized treatment volumes. 
**''Closed early after 5-year EFS was below expected''
**'''2004''' PMID 15542805 -- &quot;Risk-adapted, combined-modality therapy with VAMP/COP and response-based, involved-field radiation for unfavorable pediatric Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Hudson MM, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Nov 15;22(22):4541-50.) Median F/U 5.8 years
***5-year outcomes: EFS 76%, OS 93%
***Conclusion: Risk-adapted VAMP/COP and response-based IFRT unsatisfactory

*'''POG 8725''' (1987-1992)
**Randomized. 183 patients protocol, 161 in CR randomized. Stage IIB-IV. 77% NS, 50% bulky mediastinum, 37% Stage IV. [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MOPP|MOPP]]/[[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#ABVD|ABVD]] x8 cycles +/- 21 Gy in 1.5 Gy/fx. 
**RT 9/80 patients major protocol violation. If pelvic disease, TNI; if no disease below aortic bifurcation, sub-TNI (mantle, spleen, PA). Lymphoid tissue 21 Gy, nonlymphoid tissue 10.5 Gy 
**'''1997''' PMID 9256118 - &quot;Randomized study of intensive MOPP-ABVD with or without low-dose total-nodal radiation therapy in the treatment of stages IIB, IIIA2, IIIB, and IV Hodgkin's disease in pediatric patients: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.&quot;  (Weiner MA, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):2769-79.)

***Quality assurance review
***Outcome: 5-year RFS chemo alone 85% vs RT with deviations in volume 86% vs RT appropriate volume 96%
***Conclusion: RT delivered according to protocol showed 10% relapse-free survival advantage, while RT delivered with deviations was no better than chemo alone

*'''CCG 521''' (1986-1990)
**Randomized. 111 patients, Stage III-IV. Treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MOPP|MOPP]]/[[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#ABVD|ABVD]] x12 cycles vs. [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#ABVD|ABVD]] x6 cycles + EFRT 21 Gy in 1.75 Gy/fx. If lung, used 10.5 Gy with 50% transmission blocks. If residual disease, boost 14 Gy for total 35 Gy
**'''1998''' PMID 9508171 -- &quot;MOPP or radiation in addition to ABVD in the treatment of pathologically staged advanced Hodgkin's disease in children: results of the Children's Cancer Group Phase III Trial.&quot; (Hutchinson RJ, J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):897-906.)
***4-year outcomes: EFS: MOPP/ABVD 77% vs. ABVD/EFRT 87% (p=0.09), OS 84% vs. 90% (NS)
***Outcomes by stage: Stage III 11% relapsed, Stage IV 27% relapsed
***Toxicity: acute mostly hematopoietic, pulmonary/cardiac modest (8 patients Grade 3-4 pulmonary toxicity, all on chemo and likely due to bleomycin)
***Conclusion: Equivalent, MOPP can be eliminated from front-line therapy

*'''NCI, 1997''' PMID 9363863 -- &quot;Alternating MOPP and ABVD chemotherapy plus mantle-field radiation therapy in patients with massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Longo DL, J Clin Oncol. 1997 Nov;15(11):3338-46.)
**Prospective. 80 patients with bulky mediastinum. Treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MOPP|MOPP]]/[[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#ABVD|ABVD]] x 6 cycles + 10 Gy mantle followed by 25-35 Gy to residual disease. Median F/U 10 years
**15-year outcomes: Overall CR 89%; DFS of CR 78%, OS of CR 75% 
**By Stage: I-II: DFS 76% OS 79%; III-IV DFS 82%, OS 64%
**Toxicity: pneumonitis 16% (1 fatal). 2 patients solid tumors within RT fields. Fertility preserved more with MOPP/ABVD than MOPP alone; less cardiopulmonary toxicity than ABVD
**Conclusion: MOPP/ABVD followed by mantle RT effective for bulky mediastinum

*'''Stanford, 1996''' (1989-1995) PMID 8836420 -- &quot;Brief chemotherapy (Stanford V) and adjuvant radiotherapy for bulky or advanced Hodgkin's disease: an update.&quot; (Horning SJ, Ann Oncol. 1996;7 Suppl 4:105-8.)

**Retrospective. 111 consecutive surgically-staged IA/IIA patients. RT 36-44 Gy mantle + PA/splenic regions. Median F/U 4.7 years
**Outcome: 14 patients (13%) relapsed, 3 (3%) died of treatment-related causes (MI x2, pneumonitis x1). Bulky mediastinum significant risk for relapse: 65% (9/18) vs. 5% (5/93) (SS)
**Conclusion: recommend addition of MOPP to RT

===All risk groups===
*'''GPOH-HD 95 Multi-national''' (1995-2001)
**Prospective. 1018 children. Risk-adapted chemo OPPA/OEPA (Stage I-IIA 2 cycles, Stage IIEA, IIB, IIIA 4 cycles, Stage IIEB, IIIAE, IIIB, IV 6 cycles). If CR, no RT (22%); otherwise RT to involved sites if &gt;75% PR received 20 Gy; if &lt;75% PR received 30 Gy; if &gt;50ml residual received 35 Gy)

***Advanced (IIEA-IV): DFS better with RT 91% vs. 79%. No difference in OS
**Conclusion: Reduction in RT to 20 Gy possible with good response. Omission of RT possible only for early stage (TG1); intermediate/advanced stage needs RT for better DFS

*'''CCG 5942''' (1995-1998)
**829 patients enrolled, 501 patients with CR randomized to +/- IFRT 21 Gy. Risk-adapted chemotherapy (26% Stage I-II low risk, 47% Stage I-II high risk/Stage III, 17% Stage IV). RT given 21 Gy in 12 fxs to IF, if pulmonary involvement 10.5 Gy in 12 fxs to whole lung

*Scandinavian second malignancy


*Musculoskeletal: height reduction in prepubertal children after full dose
*Cardiovascular: 45X excess mortality due to MI after full dose, concern about anthracyclines and low-dose
*Pulmonary: pneumonitis concerns in conjuction with bleomycin (ABVD/ABVE)
*Thyroid: hypothyroidism in 17% kids given &lt;26 Gy vs. 78% given &gt;26 Gy mantle
*Gonads: pelvic radiation typically leads to infertility

== Formation of the present tense ==

The present tense in Gujarati is for most verbs formed by removing the infinitive ending વું vũ, placing a grammatical person marker in its place, and placing the appropriate present-tense form of the verb ''to be'' afterwards.

The formula thus follows the lines of:
:[verb stem + personal marker] [form of ''to be'']
For example, for the first person:
:[kar + ũ] [chhũ]
Or in full,
:Hũ e karũ   chhũ. (હું એ કરું છું.)
:I it doing am. (&quot;I am doing it.&quot;)

=== The verb to be (હોવું hovũ) ===
The verb હોવું is irregular both in its stem (છ chh as opposed to હો ho) and in that it does not take an auxiliary (as it is itself the auxiliary used by all other verbs). Because it is used to conjugate all other verbs, it is essential to know all the following forms.

The forms shown below are the &quot;forms of ''to be''&quot; mentioned above that are used to form the present tense.

{|
!Pronoun (En)
!Pronoun (Guj)
!Verb form
|-
| I || હું hũ || છું chhũ
|-
|you|| તું tũ || છે chhe
|-
|he/she/it|| એ e ||છે chhe
|-
|we|| અમે ame ||છીએ chhiie
|-
|you ||તમે tame||છો chho
|-
|they ||એ e || છે chhe
|}

=== Present tense endings ===
These are the &quot;personal markers&quot; mentioned above that are used to form the present tense.

{|
!Pronoun
!Personal marker
|-
|હું hũ ||ઉં ũ
|-
| તું tũ ||એ e
|-
|એ e ||એ e
|-
|અમે ame ||ઈએ iie
|-
|તમે tame||ઓ o
|-
|એ e || એ e
|}

=== Example: a regular verb, કરવું karvũ ===
The verb stem is derived by removing -vũ:
:કરવું karvũ → કર kar

{|
!Pronoun
!Verb form
!Form of ''to be''
|-
| હું hũ || કરું karũ || છું chhũ
|-
|તું tũ || કરે kare || છે chhe
|-
|એ e || કરે kare || છે chhe
|-
|અમે ame || કરીએ kariie || છીએ chhiie
|-
|તમે tame|| કરો karo || છો chho
|-
|એ e || કરે kare || છે chhe
|}

Thus we can make such sentences as:
:Hũ (e) karu chhũ. ''I am doing (it).''
:Apņe (kaam) kariie chhiie. ''We are doing (work).''
:Tũ (shũ) kare chhe ? ''(What) are you doing?''

==Negative present tense==
The negative present tense is formed completely differently from the positive present tense. It follows the pattern:
:[negative marker] [verb stem + form of ''tũ'']

Note:
*The negative marker can be any one of the following: નથી nathii, ન na, નહિ nahi.
*The form of the suffix તું tũ must agree in ''gender and number'' with the agent of the verb (thing performing the action).

For example, if Mayur (a man's name) says, &quot;I am not doing work,&quot; this is:
:[nathii] [kar + to]
:Hũ (kaam) nathii karto. ''I am not doing (work).''

===Forms of તું tũ===
The various gender forms of તું tũ are:
{|
!
!Singular
!Plural
|-
|''Neuter'' || તું tũ || તાં tãã
|-
|''Masculine'' || તો to || તા taa
|-
|''Feminine'' || તી tii || તી tii
|}

== Dividing numbers ==

When first teaching young children to divide, you may like to try getting a small group together and sharing out a number of objects evenly between them. This will ensure that the students get a clear understanding of the concept of division before moving on to the written process of short and long division.

The process of division should be taught as the reverse of multiplication, again the times tables are needed.  The links between addition and subtraction and multiplication and division become important later when the 'opposite' or inverse operation will be needed to solve algebraic problems.  Primary teachers can help with later learning by emphasising that division is the undoing of multiplication, as well as pointing children in the right direction for actually doing division.

The simplest division is where the multiplication is known:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{2} = 5&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that I will write division as fractions - the formating is easier - the two are the same thing, children need to know this; I have met GCSE students, 15 and 16 years old, who were confused about this.  The usual line with dots above and below (÷) is normally used for these simple problems.)

Harder are problems where the inverse is not known:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{98}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

As 98 is greater than 10×2, children are unlikely to know the answer.  This is where we introduce long division, which we write like this:
   __
 2/98

The first step is then to divide 9 by 2, however 2 does not go into 9.  We find the highest number less than 9 into which 2 does go (8) and divide it by 2.  The remainder (9-8=1) we add to the units as a ten (we have taken 10 away from 90 to get 80, we then add the 10 to the 8 to get 18).  Having done this we divide 18 by 2 to get 9.  This is often set out like this (more often it is set out as a crossed out 9 with a little 1 squished in by the 8, however this setting out is clearer and much better for harder problems):

   &lt;u&gt;49&lt;/u&gt;
 2/98
  -&lt;u&gt;80&lt;/u&gt;
   18
  -&lt;u&gt;18&lt;/u&gt; 
    0

The 8 under the 9 is 4×2 and is the lowest multiple of 2 less than 9. As the 9 is in the 10s column it is 90 and the 8 is 80.  We then subtract the 80 from the original 98 and divide the resulting 18 by 2.

In a longer example we do the same thing more than once:

   &lt;u&gt; 78487&lt;/u&gt;
 2/156974
  -&lt;u&gt;140000&lt;/u&gt;  (2 does not go into 1 or 15, but 2×7 is 14)
    16974  
   -&lt;u&gt;16000&lt;/u&gt;  (2 does go into 16, 8 times)
      974
     -&lt;u&gt;800&lt;/u&gt;  (2 does not go into 9 but it does 8) 
      174
     -&lt;u&gt;160&lt;/u&gt;  (not 17 but 16)
       14
      -&lt;u&gt;14&lt;/u&gt;  (and finally 7×2=14)
        0 

This method extends directly to division by larger numbers.  For numbers larger than 12 writting out the multiples of the number to the side can be useful - only go up to what is required, calculating more as you need them.  It also extends to decimals - just continue after the decimal point, allthough if the number you are dividing by is a decimal you need to multiply both it and the number you are dividing it by by 10 or 100 or 1000 etc. in order to make it an integer (whole number).

== A Verse From the Gospel of St. Luke ==

Respondens Simon dixit: &quot;Aestimo quia is, cui plus donavit&quot;. At ille dixit ei: &quot;Recte iudicasti&quot;. Et conversus ad mulierem, dixit Simoni: &quot;Vides hanc mulierem? Intravi in domum tuam: aquam pedibus meis non dedisti; haec autem lacrimis rigavit pedes meos et capillis suis tersit. Osculum mihi non dedisti haec autem, ex quo intravi non cessavit osculari pedes meos. Oleo caput meum non unxisti; haec autem unguento unxit pedes meos. Propter quod dico tibi: Remissa sunt peccata eius multa, quoniam dilexit multrum: cui autem minus dimittitur, minus diligit.&quot; Dixit autem ad illam: &quot;Remissa sunt peccata tua&quot;. Et coeperunt, qui simul accumbebant, dicere intra se: &quot;quis est hic, qui etiam peccata dimittit?&quot;. Dixit autem ad mulierem: Fides tua te salvam fecit; vade in pace!&quot;.

Tables are used for presenting tabular data and abused for laying out pages. They can be inserted anywhere on the page, even within other tables. We will be looking at creating a basic table and then adding lots of tags to it so we can see just what the outcome will be. Experimentation is the name of the game here. The tags most useful when creating tables are &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;table&gt; - table, &lt;tr&gt; - table row, &lt;td&gt; - table data, and &lt;th&gt; - table heading.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Minimal tables==

First let us have a look at quick example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1.40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Every table begins with a &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; tag and ends with a &amp;lt;/table&amp;gt; tag. In the table tag, you can define the attributes of the table, as you will see later.

The table contains rows, each begins with the &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; table row tag and optionally ends with the &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; tag. Rows must be inside tables.

The rows contain cells, each begins with the &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; table data tag and optionally ends with the &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; tag. Cells must be inside rows.

If you put a table cell outside a row, or if you forget to close a cell, or row, or table it will have unpredictable results. Text intended to be in the table may appear at an unexpected position, outside the table. At worst, the entire contents of the table will not be displayed.

For example, in IE and Firefox:
*A cell outside a row is treated as in a separate row at the vertical position concerned
*All content outside cells, whether in a row or not, is put before the whole table, in the order in which it occurs; IE puts each item on a new line; Firefox does not, but puts in some cases a blank space between items.

If the optional &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/td&gt; and &lt;/tr&gt; are not put, the above refers to content before the first row, and in rows before the first element only. Note that &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is required; if it is forgotten all following content is considered part of the last cell of the last row, even further tables.

'''Task - Create a table'''

# Open your default.htm and save it as table.htm in the appropriate folder
# Create this HTML code in the body of the document
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1.40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
# Save the file and view it in the browser.

The result is:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1.40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It doesn't look too much like a table yet, but we'll add more soon.

Note: This table is made up of two rows (check out the two &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; tags) and within each row there are two data entries (the two &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; tags)

You might compare a table with a spreadsheet. This one has two rows and two columns making 4 cells containing data. ( 2 rows x 2 columns = 4 cells )

==Caption and headings==

Let us start with a quick example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Formulas and Results&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Formula&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Result&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 + 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 * 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Captions''' are useful for defining or describing the content of the table. They are optional.

To add a caption to a table, enter the &lt;tt&gt;caption&lt;/tt&gt; element after the opening &lt;tt&gt;table&lt;/tt&gt; tag, with the text of the caption inside the element, as shown in the following.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Formulas and Results&lt;/caption&gt;
...
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Captions are usually displayed outside the border of the table, at the top. The exact appearance and placement of captions is subject to CSS styling.

Table '''headings''' are a way of defining the contents of the table columns. They are usually only used in the first &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;, table row.

Instead of using a &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; for the cell, we use a &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;.

By default the text in table headings is displayed bold and centered.

The Syntax is: &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;

'''Task - Table Caption and Headings'''

# Open your table.htm file
# Add your own caption to the table
# View the result
# Add the table headings ITEMS and $ PRICE for the table
# View the result

==Borders==

A border around a table is optional: sometimes they help to define the table, and sometimes the table looks better without them.

However having borders turned on while you are creating the table is a very good idea since it makes tables much easier to work with. You can get rid of the border once the table is completed.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
The border of this table is 1 pixel wide. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;table border=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
The border on this table is 5 pixels wide. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The default value is 0 (i.e. borderless).

Border is an attribute of the table tag. The syntax is:

&amp;lt;table border=X&amp;gt; where X is the border size in pixels.

You can also specify a border colour, although this is an Internet Explorer tag only. The syntax is:

&amp;lt;table bordercolor=&quot;#000000&quot;&amp;gt;

Note that it is not recommended to specify the border colour using HTML - it is much better to use [[CSS Programming|CSS]] for this purpose.

'''Task - Create a border around a table'''

# Open your table.htm file.
# In the &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; tag, add border=2&lt;br&gt;i.e. &amp;lt;table border=2&amp;gt;.
# Save the file and view it.
# Change the size of the border (i.e., try 0, 10, and try a crazy number).
# View the results as you go.

Did you spot that only the outside border gets bigger?

==Height and Width==

A table, by default, will be as large as the data that is entered into it.

We can change the overall height and width of the table to get it the size we want.

It is possible to give the size in absolute pixels, or as a relative percentage of the screen size.

The syntax is:
&amp;lt;table height=??? width=???&amp;gt;
where ??? is the size in pixels or percentage.

It is also possible to control the dimensions of individual table cells or rows.

e.g.
&amp;lt;tr height=80&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&amp;gt;

It is possible to mix absolute and relative heights and widths.

Note that you can do the same thing with CSS by changing the padding.

'''Task - Define the size of a table'''

# Open your table.htm file.
# In the &amp;lt;table border=2&amp;gt; tag, we will add the height and width&lt;br&gt;e.g. &amp;lt;table border=2 height=200 width=300&amp;gt;
# Save the file and then view it. Resize the browser window, and watch what happens - the table size stays the same.
# Experiment changing the measurements and view the file again.
# Now replace the pixels measurements with percentages&lt;br&gt;e.g. &amp;lt;table border=2 height=&quot;40%&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&amp;gt;
# Save the file and then view it. Resize the browser window, and watch what happens - this time the table changes size as the window size changes.

==Cell Spacing and Cell Padding==

[[Image:ProgrammingHTML-tables-cellpadding.gif|right|the difference between cellpadding and cellspacing]]

Cell Spacing is the number of pixels between the table cells.

Cell Padding is the pixel space inside the cells. i.e. the distance between the information and the sides of the table cells.

Both these options are attributes of the &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; tag

e.g. &amp;lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0&amp;gt;

Note: The default for both is 2

'''Task - Cell Spacing and Padding'''

# Open your table.htm file. Make sure that your table has a large height and width set (e.g. 300x200) - if not then you won't be able to see the effect of cellpadding and cellspacing.
# Experiment with changing the size of the table border, cellspacing and cellpadding. Try different combinations of 0, 1, 5, 10,etc.
# View the result each time

==Alignment of table cells==

The default alignment of the contents of table cells is left and vertically centered. 

If you want to change the alignment of cells, it has to be done individually for each cell. The align command is included in the &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; tag. You can also change the alignment of an entire row by specifying the alignment in the &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; tag
 

'''Horizontal alignment'''&lt;br&gt;
Syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;td align=&quot;position&quot;&amp;gt; where position is left, center, or right &lt;br&gt;
or&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;tr align=&quot;position&quot;&amp;gt; where position is left, center, or right

'''Vertical alignment'''&lt;br&gt;
Syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;td valign=&quot;position&quot;&amp;gt; where position is top, middle or bottom&lt;br&gt;
or&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;tr valign=&quot;position&quot;&amp;gt; where position is top, middle or bottom

You can also include align and valign commands in the table row tag and in the table tag.

Note: Including &lt;code&gt;align=&quot;left&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;align=&quot;right&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; tag does NOT align the contents of the table. Instead it aligns the whole table on the page. i.e., it makes the text outside the table wrap around the table.


'''Task - Alignment of table cells'''

# Open your table.htm file
# Change the alignment of the table cells so that they look like:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 width=223 height=138 bordercolor=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr height=69&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;bread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=right valign=top&gt;$2.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr height=69&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom align=right&gt;$1.40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50 align=center&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bordercolor=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; 
&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 width=223 height=138 bordercolor=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr height=69&gt;&lt;td align=right valign=bottom&gt;bread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom&gt;$2.99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr height=69&gt;&lt;td valign=top align=right&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;$1.40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

# Experiment with other vertical and horizontal alignments.
# View the result each time

==Row span and column span==

Every row must have the same number of table datas, occasionally table datas have to span more than one column or row. In this case the tags colspan and/or rowspan are used - where they are set to a number.
{| width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:none;font-variant:small-caps&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:black&quot; width=&quot;5%&quot;|&lt;br/&gt;

| border=&quot;none&quot;|&lt;-- ''This row has three'' '''table datas'''
|-

Syntax:
*&amp;lt;td colspan=X&amp;gt; where X is the number of columns that the cell spans across.
*&amp;lt;td rowspan=X&amp;gt; where X is the number of rows that the cell spans across.

'''Task - Row span and column span'''

# Open your table.htm file.
# Experiment with making one table cell span across multiple rows.
# Experiment with making one table cell span across multiple columns.
# View the result each time.

==Background colour and images==

It is possible to give each table cell, (or row, or table) a different background colour.

&lt;table width=&quot;50%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;23&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#FF9A9C&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCFF&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#996666&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#996666&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#996666&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#990033&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
where colour is a colour name or hexadecimal code.

Note: table background colours only display in version 3 browsers and above, and they may not print correctly.

Note: it is not recommended to specify background colours using HTML - it is much better to use [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for this purpose.

A '''background image''' is another modification of the appearance of a cell, row, or a complete table. Again these only display in version 3 browsers and above, and they may not print correctly.

Syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;td background=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr background=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;
&lt;table background=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
where filename is the path and filename of the background image.

Note: it is not recommended to specify background images using HTML - it is much better to use [[CSS Programming|CSS]] for this purpose.

'''Task - Background colour and images'''

# Open your table.htm file.
# Experiment with changing the background colour of a table cell, a table row, and the table itself.
# Add a background image to a table cell, a table row, and the table itself.
# View the result each time.

== Column groups ==

To specify a given format for a table column, you can use the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;col&gt; and &lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. These tags are located at the top of the table, and specify the default format for the given column. 

With the &amp;lt;col&amp;gt; tag, the first instance indicates the formatting for the first column, the second for the second column, and so on.  &amp;lt;colgroup&amp;gt; works similarly, but also includes the span tag to cover multiple columns.

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Project Completion&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;colgroup&gt;
  &lt;col span=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color:red&quot;&gt;
  &lt;col style=&quot;background-color:yellow&quot;&gt;
  &lt;col span=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:green&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/colgroup&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Jan&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Feb&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mar&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Apr&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;May&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Jun&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;55%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;86%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

{{NOTE|Chrome, Firefox, and Safari only supports the span and width elements of these tags.}}

==Summary==

In this module you learn how to:

* Create and customise HTML tables,
* Control their dimensions and appearance,
* Add a caption to a table,
* Control the alignment of the table contents,
* Various attributes of the table tags.

'''Porridge''' (also known in American English as '''hot cereal'''), is a simple dish made by boiling [[Cookbook:Grain|grain]] (normally [[Cookbook:Rolled Oats|rolled oats]]) in water or milk.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (45&amp;nbsp;[[Cookbook:gram|g]]) rolled oats or other grain
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) water
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
#Mix oats and water, then bring to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] covered with a lid.
#Once bubbling, stir and reduce temperature to the lowest possible to maintain [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]]. Replace lid and watch carefully to prevent boiling over.
#Stir every minute or so. After five minutes, remove lid, stir thoroughly and add milk.
#Mix through, and keep stirring until fully mixed.
#Serve and add [[cookbook:raisin|raisins]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], a pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or inverted sugar syrup to taste.

==Tips and Variations==

Soak whole grains over night and change water. Soaking softens the grains and reduces cooking time, although whole oats still require 45 - 60 minutes simmering. Rinsing also reduces starch and pesticide residue. Steel cut oats should simmer for 20-30 minutes, or to the desired texture. Let the water boil out for a chewier, rice like flavor with whole oats or leave some water in as is common with rolled oats and instant oats.

Porridge can be made using only water, only milk, or a whichever mixing of the two depending on taste. Other ingredients may include butter, dates, bananas, apples and cinnamon. Add apples and cinnamon during the cooking process to infuse the flavor. If you want to avoid milk products, it is also possible to use [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] instead of cow's milk. Corn oil also works well with honey and figs, out of the vegetable oils. Honey itself combines well with apples and cinnamon while raisins, dates and bananas are popular with dairy ingredients. Winter squash can be added to finer grains like wheat and millet.

Porridge was traditionally cooked over a wooden fire and in a cast iron pot which prevents burning and doesn't interfere with the flavor. In modern times, any pot will do as long as it is thick enough to distribute the heat. Instant oats are the easiest and fastest to cook as they only need boiling water and as this may be also done with a microwave oven.

== Introduction to using Celestia ==

To start Celestia, you should double-click on its icon.
As it starts, it first shows the Sun, and then takes your viewpoint to the sunlit side of the Earth. When you get there, you can tell Celestia to show you other interesting sights.

Initially, Celestia opens in a window on your screen. For a more immersive experience, you can tell Celestia to take over the entire display. Open Celestia's menu Render/Select Display Mode and choose an appropriate screen resolution. When it's in full-screen mode, if you move the cursor up to the top of the screen, you should see Celestia's menu bar again, where you can choose to go back to windowed mode.

Some may think Celestia is a game. In a way it is but it is much more than that.  Like most programs (with graphics and objects) of today the mouse is the primary way of getting around.  Celestia does use the mouse to rotate/panned the observers POV with a combination of left and right mouse click and drag functions.  However to truly get the most out of Celestia the keyboard shortcut letters bring the full power and beauty of the program into play.  People who are more game enthusiasts may find the interface of Celestia boring after a few minutes if they only use the mouse.  So, start learning and memorizing the keyboard shortcuts.  You can find a quick look of the keyboard shortcut commands in the Help/Control pulldown while the program is running.  You can also find them in the [http://www.shatters.net/celestia/documentation.html  Celestia User's Guide].

Below are some introductory events and places you can explore in Celestia, using the keyboard and mouse.  You will notice below some letters and words are in '''bold face'''.  These are the keyboard shortcuts that can be typed to control Celestia.

== Earth's rotation and the pole star ==


This needs a fairly wide field of view – use the comma (,) and dot (.) keys to adjust the window to around 60°. If you don't have the Earth on the screen, press the three keys '''H3G''' to go there. Then back away a little with the End key or your mouse's wheel. Adjust the number of stars with the [ and ] keys, setting a limiting magnitude of around 5.

Adjust the rate of time to 1000 times faster ('''LLL''') so the Earth can be seen slowly turning. The Earth spinning is what gives us day and night. Type a &quot;y&quot; to hover over one point on the Earth and see it enter light and shadow (day and night) as the Earth turns. Use the arrow keys '''Shift-←''' and '''Shift-→''' to move round the Earth and see where night and day start and end. You can put the mouse cursor over a piece of land and just watch that point as day and night pass over it. This is best done with the clouds turned off ('''I'''). To turn the &quot;sync orbit&quot; off again, you can press '''F''' to return to &quot;follow&quot; mode.

With the synchronous orbit on, back away from the Earth a little using the '''End''' key (or the rotary wheel of your mouse if it has one) so you can see more stars. You can press the '''Home''' key to move closer again. As you watch the stars go past, you might see distinctive patterns of stars go by. People used to imagine people and animals in the patterns in the stars. Press '''/''' to turn on the constellation lines, and '''=''' to turn on their names. You can use the space-bar to pause time and take a longer look at any interesting shapes. 

With the mouse, right-click and drag upwards to turn to look more Northwards. By the time you are looking squarely at the South pole of the Earth, the pole star Polaris should be visible. It's the star that's at the end of the tail of Ursa Minor, the &quot;Small Bear&quot;, often called &quot;the Little Dipper&quot;. If you watch for a while, you will see that all stars seem to revolve around that point while Polaris itself doesn't move much at all. 

Keeping this view, zoom closer to the Earth ('''Home''') and notice the way day and night look on Earth from this view. Depending on the time of year, the Antarctic ice-cap might be on permanent daylight or permanent shadow. This can be easier to see if you speed up to 10000x ('''L'''). You can briefly speed up even more (use '''K''' to slow down again) to hop between seasons.

== Other Planets ==

Start Celestia. You are looking at the Earth from the direction of the Sun. We want to look at the Earth from the other side. Back away from the Earth using the '''End''' key until the Earth is about the size of a pea, and then use '''Shift-←''' and '''Shift-→''' to rotate around the Earth until the Sun is visible in the background. The Earth might be easier to see if you turn up the background illumination with the '''}''' key, although this is not realistic as it makes planets glow in the dark (only stars really do that). Now turn the time rate up to a million times faster by typing '''LLLLLL'''.

You should notice the Moon whizzing round the Earth. Move closer or further away ('''Home'''/'''End''') until the moon uses the whole width of the screen. The Moon takes about 28 days to go round the Earth. If you slow down time a bit by pressing '''K''', you should be able to count the number of days (turns of the Earth) it takes for the Moon to go round once. You can turn the Moon's name on and off by pressing '''M'''. If you see a giant mass of names appear, all together, it's probably the names of all Jupiter's moons in the distance – Jupiter has a lot of moons. Speed back up to a million times again.

You will notice that every year as the Sun goes past, it is accompanied by a collection of small bright dots. These are other planets. You can turn their names on and off with '''P'''. It's time to leave the Earth. Type '''HFC''' to follow and centre the Sun. Leave planet names on ('''P'''). Back away from the Sun a little and you will be able to see Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars moving from side to side as they orbit the Sun. If you back away further you will be able to see 9 planets. The outer ones don't seem to be moving much, so press '''L''' speed things up a little. Time is passing at about a year every 4 seconds now.

Let's turn on the planet's orbit lines – press '''O'''. They're not very clear seen edge on, so use the right mouse button to drag downwards until the orbits look circular, seen from above. You can't see all the orbit lines at once – if you move far enough away to get Pluto's orbit in, then the inner planet's orbits disappear. Move in to see the inner planet's orbits and the outer orbits are off the screen. By right-dragging, you can get a good edge-on view that shows that all the orbits are in almost exactly the same plane except for Pluto.

You may notice as Jupiter goes past that it has a huge mass of orbit lines for  its many moons. Four of them are big enough to be seen from the Earth by using binoculars.

Time for a quick tour. This is possible best done with the orbit lines switched on. First, to about 1000x time rate ('''K''','''L'''). Then we can visit the 9 planets by typing '''1G''', '''2G''' etc. Each of the number keys corresponds to a planet. Use '''Home''' and '''End''' (or the mouse scroll wheel) to zoom in and out, and right-drag to change the viewpoint and get a good look at each planet. 

While visiting the outer planets, it is worth looking from above to see just how much like a little solar-system their moons make. You may occasionally see a black spot move across the sunlit surface of Jupiter – this is the shadow of one of the moons as it passes between Jupiter and the Sun.

== Other Stars ==

Not all stars are like the Sun. Some stars are hotter than the sun, some cooler, bigger, smaller, brighter and dimmer, redder, bluer. Actually the blue ones are hotter, and the red ones cooler. 

You cannot tell how far away stars are by just looking at them. So when people invented the constellations, they drew lines using stars that might be nearby, or far away. A good demonstration of this is to see how distorted familiar constellations would look if seen from a different angle – from a different place.

Turn on the constellation lines ('''/''') and use '''dot''' and '''comma''' to set the field of view to around 60°. Centre a star in the constellation of the plough (Ursa Major, also called the Big Dipper) by pressing the Enter ('''↵''')key, typing the name megrez and enter again. Then type '''CF''' to centre and follow the star. Now hold down the right mouse key and drag around the screen. Your viewpoint is now many light years away from the Earth, orbiting around the distant star Megrez. Try both with and without the constellation lines. You can plainly see the 3D pattern of the stars. If you move right round the back of the Plough (or Big Dipper), you can see that all the constellation lines seem to point roughly in the same direction – the direction of Earth. 

It is interesting to return to the Sun while maintaining your view on Megrez – press '''T''' to track Megrez (keep it centred), then '''HG''' to go home. You can see the constellations return to their familiar shapes as we get back to the Sun. Press '''T''' again (or '''Esc''') to stop tracking Megrez.

Another good star to do this with is Arcturus in the constellation of Boötes. 

The constellations are all drawn with stars that are visible from the Earth, and are therefore the nearest stars to us. Turn the constellation lines on and then back a long way away (hold '''End'''), until all the lines are visible on the screen. Turn on more stars by holding the ''']''' key and raise the limiting magnitude to about 10. Back away a little more until the whole of the galaxy is visible on the screen. Then right-drag so the galaxy is seen edge-on. You can see that the stars in the Celestia program form a sphere round the Sun. This is because we don't know the distances of all the other stars in the galaxy well enough to put their positions in the program – so the rest of the galaxy is just shown as a 'mist' of stars. 

Reduce the limiting magnitude to 10 or less again with the '''[''' key. 

==Other Galaxies==

You can fly to another galaxy much like our own by pressing '''↵m 31↵g'''. You can always go home again by typing the keys '''H3G'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parallel Lines in a Plane==
Two coplanar lines are said to be parallel if they never intersect.  For any given point on the first line, its distance to the second line is equal to the distance between any other point on the first line and the second line.  The common notation for parallel lines is &quot;||&quot; (a double pipe); it is not unusual to see &quot;//&quot; as well.  If line ''m'' is parallel to line ''n'', we write &quot;m || n&quot;.  Lines in a plane either coincide, intersect in a point, or are parallel.  Controversies surrounding the Parallel Postulate lead to the development of non-Euclidean geometries.

==Parallel Lines and Special Pairs of Angles==
When two (or more) parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the following angle relationships hold:
*corresponding angles are congruent
*alternate exterior angles are congruent
*same-side interior angles are supplementary

==Theorems Involving Parallel Lines==
*If a line in a plane is perpendicular to one of two parallel lines, it is perpendicular to the other line as well.
*If a line in a plane is parallel to one of two parallel lines, it is parallel to both parallel lines.
*If three or more parallel lines are intersected by two or more transversals, then they divide the transversals proportionally.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Total internal reflection is a phenomenon that occurs when light travels from a more optically dense medium (or a medium with higher refractive index &lt;math&gt;{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;) to a less optically dense one (lower index &lt;math&gt;{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;), such as glass to air or water to air.  When light travels from an optically dense medium to a less optically dense medium, the light refracts away from the normal.  If the angle of incidence is gradually increased, one will notice that at a certain point, the refracted ray deviates so far away from the normal that it reflects rather than refracts.  This results whenever the refracted angle predicted by Snell's Law becomes greater than 90 degrees.  
[[Image:Total internal reflection.jpg|thumb|250px|When light travels from any medium to another less optically dense medium, total internal reflection will occur at a certain angle of incidence.  In this case, a ray of light is travelling from plexiglass to air.]]

The critical angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_c&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the angle of incidence (inside the higher-index material) for which Snell's Law predicts a 90-degree angle of refraction -- this would mean the light follows the surface rather than entering the low-index material.   

One can calculate the critical angle using Snell's Law:

&lt;!-- The \,\! is to keep the formula rendered as PNG instead of HTML. Please don't remove it.--&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin \theta_1 = n_2\sin \theta_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin \theta_c = n_2\sin 90^\circ = n_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta_c = \sin^{-1} \left ( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Total internal reflection will occur for any incident angle greater than θ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  

Because the reflected ray never leaves the higher-index material, Snell's Law for total internal reflection becomes 
&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin \theta_1 = n_1\sin \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, in other words &lt;math&gt; \theta_1 = \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the law of reflection.  

There is always a fraction of the energy reflected at a boundary between materials of different refractive index, but it is usually quite small (typically a few percent).  In the case of total internal reflection, however, 100% of the beam energy reflects (hence the name &quot;total&quot;).  

You can easily observe total internal reflection for yourself next time you are in a swimming pool.  If you are under water looking up, you see the sky.  As you turn your head to look closer to horizontal, you see a reflection of the bottom (or side) of the pool.  These rays from the pool bottom hit the water-to-air boundary at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, so they are reflected to you.   

'''How do I know that the reflected ray isn't just the refracted ray?''' The second law of reflection states that &quot;the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal are coplanar.&quot; Therefore, the refracted ray ''must'' be in the second medium.  If it is in the same medium that it originated from, then it is the reflected ray.  The reflected angle is also the same as the incident angle, which agrees with the first law of reflection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sine Formulas==

The addition formula for sines is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

This is an important tool that allows us to relate the sines and cosines of angles of different sizes.  

There is a related formula for cosines, discussed in the next section:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos (\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Worked Example: Sine of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 75^\circ&lt;/math&gt;}}

* You are told that:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(45^\circ)\approx 0.7071&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(45^\circ)\approx 0.7071&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(30^\circ)= 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(30^\circ)\approx 0.866&lt;/math&gt;

* Use the sine addition formula to calculate &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(75^\circ)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer:'''
Using the first formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(45^\circ+30^\circ) = \sin 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \cos 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(45^\circ+30^\circ) \approx 0.7071\times 0.866 + 0.7071\times 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(75^\circ) \approx 0.6123 + 0.3536 \approx 0.966&lt;/math&gt;

The addition formulas are very useful.

Here is a geometric proof of the sine addition formula.  The proof also shows how someone could have discovered it.

==Proof==

We want to prove:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;


===About the Diagram===
First, a word about the diagram used in the proof.  How on earth would you come up with a diagram like that?  

Well, 

*We need a diagram with right triangles and we need to show an angle of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(\alpha+\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, so having &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; is a must.  
* We want to express the lengths in this triangle in terms of lengths of two right triangles, one with angle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and one with angle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so adding points like &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F&lt;/math&gt; is essential.  
* Having got that far we could start trying to solve the problem, and we'd find we ran into a problem when calculating the distance &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;.  That's why we split &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{DC}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can calculate the distance &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{DC}&lt;/math&gt;.  It is the same length as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.  Also &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt; is a length we can calculate using [[Trigonometry/Soh-Cah-Toa|Soh-Cah-Toa]].


Be aware that there is nothing really special about the diagram we chose.  It's possible, for example, to calculate  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta)&lt;/math&gt; using a diagram where the right triangle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \triangle ABE&lt;/math&gt; has its right angle at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle B&lt;/math&gt; rather than at &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E&lt;/math&gt;.  You might like to try that.  


We've chosen this digram and this lettering because it is exactly the same as used in the '''Khan Academy''' video on proving addition formula for sine so if you have trouble with the proof presented here, you can follow it on video instead.

===Video Link===

There is a video of the proof which may be easier to follow at the Khan Academy.
* [http://www.khanacademy.org/video/proof--sin-a-b------cos-a--sin-b-----sin-a--cos-b?playlist=Trigonometry Proof: sin(a+b) = (cos a)(sin b) + (sin a)(cos b)]

===The Proof===
[[File:Trig-addition-laws.svg|thumb|300px]]

First check that the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \angle DBE&lt;/math&gt; really is the same as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \angle FAE&lt;/math&gt;.  That's going to be important to the proof.  We're just using the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 to make that check, noting that we know the 90 degree angles.

Now an expression for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here we're using Soh-Cah-Toa.  We're going to be using Soh-Cah-Toa a lot.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\overline{BC}}{\overline{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;

Looking at the diagram we can replace &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\overline{BD} + \overline{DC} &lt;/math&gt; and we also have &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\overline{DC}=\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\overline{BD}+\overline{DC}}{\overline{AB}}=\frac{\overline{BD}+\overline{EF}}{\overline{AB}}= \frac{\overline{BD}}{\overline{AB}} + \frac{\overline{EF}}{\overline{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's work out another way to express &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and another way to express &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.  You'll need to look at the diagram to see which triangles we are using.
{{clear}}

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

{| style=&quot;width:100%&quot;

An expression for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}=\overline{BE}\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BE}=\overline{AB}\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt;

so 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{BD}=\overline{AB}\sin\beta\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

|

An expression for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{EF}=\overline{AE}\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AE}=\overline{AB}\cos\beta&lt;/math&gt;

so 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{EF}=\overline{AB}\cos\beta\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

|}

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

===Putting it all Together===
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\overline{BD}}{\overline{AB}} + \frac{\overline{EF}}{\overline{AB}} = \frac{\overline{AB}\sin\beta\cos\alpha}{\overline{AB}} + \frac{\overline{AB}\cos\beta\sin\alpha}{\overline{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;'s cancel.

&lt;!--Spacer--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin\beta\cos\alpha + \cos\beta\sin\alpha = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta&lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

We're done!

==Exercises==

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Make one of the sides 'one'}}
When we drew the diagram we said nothing about its size.  That means we could still choose to make one of the sides be of whatever length we like.  We can do this for just one edge.  Once we've done that all the other sides lengths are determined.  Fixing one length to be a nice value can shorten the proof.

So, let us decide that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AB&lt;/math&gt; is 1 km.  Actually we'll not worry about the units whether km, m or cm and just write '1'.  

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \triangle ABE&lt;/math&gt; is a right triangle and:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AE} = \overline{AB} \cos\beta = \cos\beta&lt;/math&gt;

Your task is to simplify the entire proof of the addition formula by replacing the lengths like &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \overline{AE} &lt;/math&gt; with the actual values assuming that we've set &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AB=1&lt;/math&gt;.  You're effectively removing &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AB&lt;/math&gt; and multiplication and division by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AB&lt;/math&gt; from the proof.  It should become a lot shorter and clearer.  You should also mark up the lengths on the diagram, assuming &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AB=1&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Use a different diagram}}
Read the description '''About the Diagram''' of how the diagram was constructed again.  Make your own diagram that is different to the one shown, with right angles in different places to the diagram shown, and do the proof using it instead.  
* Tip: If you find yourself adding lots of lines and lots of extra points then you are probably making the proof a lot harder than you need to.  You want to add only enough lines to be able to 'chase' lengths from one place to another.  Once you've got the three basic triangles, one extra line should be enough.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
'''Tex-Mex cuisine''' could be considered as being a type or style of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican cuisine]], of the type or style practiced with gusto in [[wikipedia:Texas|Texas]].  In addition to the ancient roots of many of its ingredients and types of food items, Tex-Mex cuisine is a vibrant cuisine which is becoming increasingly known and ably practiced throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps the very most fundamental recipes of Tex-Mex cuisine to learn and attempt to master are [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]] (including an appropriate main filling), [[Cookbook:Pinto Beans Recipe from South Texas|pinto beans]] (including refried beans), enchiladas, and fajitas.  [[Cookbook:Tortilla|Tortillas]] are a very fundamental part of Tex-Mex cuisine, although, in modern times, tortillas are often purchased, rather than being made by exclusively by hand, a primary emphasis being on freshness.&lt;br /&gt;

Tex-Mex cuisine is distinguishable from [[Cookbook:Texas cuisine|Texas cuisine]] in that the foundations of Texas cuisine seem to relate more to a cuisine developed by settlers who immigrated to Texas from the U.S. in the 1800’s (with substantial contributions from other cuisines of the time), although there are overlaps, similarities, and borrowing between the two. 

==Recipes==
For a list of recipes see the [[:Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Tex-Mex recipes category]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Present Indicative==
The Present Indicative is the most basic (though not the easiest) and essential tense in Spanish.  There are more than few dozen irregular verbs with varying degrees of irregularities.  It should be noted that all the second person informal conjugations end with s.

===Regular Verbs===
====-AR Verbs====

-AR verbs are conjugated by removing the &quot;-ar&quot; from the infinitive and adding the endings.

 Yo              -o     Nosotros                  -amos
 Tú             -as    Vosotros                 -áis
 Usted,él,ella   -a     Ustedes,ellos,ellas       -an

=====Hablar (to speak)=====

 hablo   hablamos
 hablas  habláis
 habla   hablan

====-ER Verbs====

Like the -AR verbs, -ER verbs are conjugated by removing the infinitive ending &quot;-er&quot; and adding the endings.

 -o     -emos
 -es    -éis
 -e     -en

=====Beber (to drink)=====
 bebo   bebemos
 bebes  bebéis
 bebe   beben

=====Hacer (to make)=====
 hago   hacemos
 haces  haceis
 hace   hacen

====-IR Verbs====

-IR verbs are conjugated by removing the infinitive ending &quot;-ir&quot; and adding the endings.

 -o     -imos
 -es    -ís
 -e     -en

=====Vivir (to live)=====
 vivo   vivimos
 vives  vivís
 vive   viven

===Irregular Verbs===
====Complete Irregularity====
=====Ser (to be)=====
 soy    somos
 eres   sois
 es     son

=====Estar (to be)=====
 estoy  estamos
 estás  estáis
 está   están

=====Ir (to go)=====
 voy    vamos
 vas    vais
 va     van

=====Haber (to have)=====
 he     hemos
 has    habéis
 ha/hay han/hay

====First Person Singular Irregularity====
Some verbs only have irregularity in the first person singular forms.

Verbs with a -cir and -cer endings also replace the c in -cir and -cer with 'zc' in the first person singular form.
* conocer (to know) - conozco
* traducir (to translate) - traduzco
* conducir (to drive) - conduzco

Some verbs end in -go instead of the regular -o for the first person singular form, these are completely irregular.
* poner (to put) - pongo
* salir (to leave) - salgo

Also, some verbs end in -jo instead of -o for the first person singular.
* escoger (to choose) - escojo
* corregir (to correct) - correjo

Four verbs are uniquely irregular only in the first person singular forms:
* saber (to know) - sé
* caber (to fit) - quepo
* dar (to give) - doy
* ver (to see) - veo

====Stem Changes====
Some verbs change their stems when conjugated in these forms: yo, tú, él, ella, usted, ellos, ellas, and ustedes.  There are four stem changes in the present tense o to ue, u to ue, e to ie, and e to i.  The e to i change only occurs in -IR verbs.  The easy way to memorize the change in which forms is called &quot;The Boot.&quot;  It must be pointed out, however, that using memory techniques to learn a language can prevent one from ever learning the language fluently. Children don't use &quot;tricks&quot; to learn a language (did you?). The way to learn a language is to socially interact with those who speak the language you wish to learn. And remember, never, ever, translate, as it will irreparably impair your ability to learn a new language.
=====O to Ue - Dormir (to sleep)=====
 '''duermo'''    dormimos
 '''duermes'''   dormís
 '''duerme'''    '''duermen'''

=====U to Ue - Jugar (to play)=====
 '''juego'''     jugamos
 '''juegas'''    jugáis
 '''juega'''     '''juegan'''

=====E to Ie - Empezar (to begin)=====
 '''empiezo'''   empezamos
 '''empiezas'''  empezáis
 '''empieza'''   '''empiezan'''

=====E to I - Pedir (to ask/TO ORDER)=====
 '''pido'''      pedimos
 '''pides'''     pedís
 '''pide'''      '''piden'''

==Imperfect==
The Imperfect is the easiest tense to learn in Spanish because the conjugations are almost completely regular: there are 3 irregular verbs! In all conjugations of the Imperfect, the first person singular forms (yo) and the third person singular/second person polite forms are same.  For example, &quot;caminaba&quot; can mean &quot;he used to walk&quot; or &quot;I was walking.&quot;

===Regular Verbs===
====-AR Verbs====

-AR verbs are conjugated by removing the &quot;-ar&quot; and adding the following endings (note accent on nosotros form!):

 -aba    -ábamos
 -abas   -abais
 -aba    -aban

=====Estudiar (to study)=====
 estudiaba    estudiábamos
 estudiabas   estudiabais
 estudiaba    estudiaban

====-ER Verbs====

-ER and -IR Verbs are conjugated identically by removing the &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot; and adding the following endings (note accents on all forms!):

 -ía    -íamos
 -ías   -íais
 -ía    -ían

=====Beber (to drink)=====
 bebía    bebíamos
 bebías   bebíais
 bebía    bebían

=====Salir (to leave)=====
 salía   salíamos
 salías   salíais
 salía    salían

===Irregular Verbs===
There are only 3 irregular verbs in the Imperfect tense: '''Ser, Ir, and Ver'''.

====Ser (to be)====
 era    éramos
 eras   erais
 era    eran

====Ir (to go)====
 iba    íbamos
 ibas   ibais
 iba    iban

====Ver (to see)====
 veía    veíamos
 veías   veíais
 veía    veían

==Preterite==

===Regular Verbs===
====-AR Verbs====
-AR verbs are conjugated by removing the &quot;-ar&quot; from the infinitive and adding the endings.

 -é     -amos
 -aste    -asteis
 -ó     -aron

===== Comprar (to buy)=====
 compr''é''     compr''amos''
 compr''aste''  compr''asteis''
 compr''ó''     compr''aron''

====-ER &amp; IR Verbs====

Like the -AR verbs, -ER &amp; -IR verbs are conjugated by removing the infinitive ending &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot; and adding the endings.

 -í     -imos
 -iste    -isteis
 -ió     -ieron

=====Comer (to eat)=====
 com''í''       com''imos''
 com''iste''    com''isteis''
 com''ió''     com''ieron''

=====Vivir (to live)=====
 viv''í''   viv''imos''
 viv''iste''  viv''isteis''
 viv''ío''   viv''ieron''

===Irregular Verbs===
Note: Ir and Ser are identical in the Preterite
====Ir (to go) '''and''' Ser (to be) ====
 fui   fuimos
 fuiste   fuisteis
 fue  fueron

====Tener (to have)====
 tuve   tuvimos
 tuviste   tuvisteis
 tuvo   tuvieron

====Haber (to have ''auxilliary'')====
 hube   hubimos
 hubiste   hubisteis
 hubo   hubieron

==Future==
In Spanish, especially in Latin American countries, it is more usual to utilise the '''ir + infinitive verb''' form (like going to) than the future conjugation.

=====Example=====

 Yo &quot;Voy a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comeré&quot;
 Tu &quot;Vas a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comerás&quot;
 El &quot;Va a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comerá&quot;
 Nosotros &quot;Vamos a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comeremos&quot;
 Vosotros &quot;Vais a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comeréis&quot;
 Ellos &quot;Van a comer&quot; instead of &quot;Comerán&quot;


Still it is easy: Remember the present tense of verb &quot;Haber&quot; minus &quot;h&quot; and add to the infinitive form of the verb

The verb &quot;Haber&quot;: he, has, ha, hemos, habéis, han

 For future = '''é, ás, á, emos, éis, án'''

=====Example:Amar=====

 Yo amar'''é'''
 Tu amar'''ás'''
 El amar'''á'''
 Nosotros amar'''emos'''
 Vosotros amar'''éis'''
 Ellos amar'''án'''

=====Temer=====

 Yo temer'''é'''
 Tú temer'''ás'''
 Él temer'''á'''
 Nosotros temer'''emos'''
 Vosotros temer'''éis'''
 Ellos temer'''án'''

=====Partir===== 
Yo partiré .. partirás, partirá, partiremos, partiréis, partirán

An so on in many many verbs. There are exeptions but easy ones

'''Salir''' (exeption it changes to saldr)
Yo saldré, saldrás, saldrá, saldremos, saldréis, saldrán

'''Venir''' (exeption it changes to vendr)
Yo vendré, vendrás, vendrá, vendremos, vendréis, vendrán

==Conditional==

In this tense, the action is conditioned to something to happen. Use conditional for asking in polite form like in English with '''would'''. Or use it to form conditional expresions.

 ¿Vendrías a casa? = Would you like to come home?
 ¿Tomarías café? = Would you like to drink coffe?
 Comería si tubiera hambre = I would eat if I was hungry.

===-ar, -er and -ir verbs===

 ía   iamos
 ías  íais
 ía   ían

'''Amar'''
 amar'''ía'''  amar'''íamos'''
 amar'''ías''' amar'''íais'''
 amar'''ía'''  amar'''ían'''

'''Temer'''
 temería  temeríamos
 temerías temeríais
 temería  temerían

'''Partir'''
 partiría  partiríamos
 partirías partiríais
 partiría  partirían

These changes in the conditional tense '''apply''' even to the verbs '''Ser''', '''Estar''' and '''Ir'''!

Exceptions

 Tener (changes to tendr): tendría, tendrías, tendríamos, tendríais, tendrían
 Salir (changes to sald): saldría, saldrías, saldríamos, saldríais, saldrían
 and so on

==Present Subjunctive==

==Imperfect Subjunctive==

==Pluperfect==
==Preterite Perfect==

The meaning is not the same as in English: Something that has been done in the past but still important in the present or continue by the moment. 

'''Format'''
 '''Haber''' verb + '''past participle''' of the verb

'''Examples''' that home (and still living today)
 Viví en esa casa = I lived in that home (not now)
 '''He tomado''' mucho = I had drunk a lot (now I'm  full)
 Tomé mucho = I drank a lot (may be yesterday)
 Viví mucho tiempo = wrong tense unless it was a ghost talking
 
Well usually in Latin America they almost never use this tense and mix the past perfect and simple past you have to adapt the meaning. Usually people from Spain use the tense properly but in Latin American to use this tense could show some fancy - elevated studies language that is not the normal rule or can be comic to some one from there.

'''Amar''' (to love)
 he amado  hemos amado
 has amado habéis amado
 ha amado  han amado

'''Tomar''' (to drink)
 he tomado  hemos tomado
 has tomado habéis tomado
 ha tomado  han tomado

and so on. There are no exceptions.

==Future Perfect==

==Conditional Perfect==
&lt;sup&gt;same as formal commands&lt;/sup&gt;

==Perfect Subjunctive==

==Commands==
Commands are one of the easiest tenses to learn in Spanish because it has only few irregularities and there are only four forms (''tú'', ''usted'', ''vosotros'', and ''ustedes'') instead of the regular six and relies on other conjugated forms.

===Regular Verbs (tú and vosotros forms)===

====-AR, -ER, and -IR verbs====
For any type of verb, simply change the form of the verb to the él/ella/Ud. form. For vosotros commands, add a &quot;d&quot;.

=====Cerrar (to close)=====

 cierra  cerrad

=====Traer (to bring)=====

 trae  traed

====Irregular Tú Commands====
There are eight irregular commands. They are as follows:

 Ir (to go) - ve                        Venir (to come) - ven  
 Ser (to be) - sé                       Tener (to have) - ten
 Hacer (to do/make) - haz               Decir (to say/tell) - di  
 Poner (to put/place) - pon             Salir (to get out) - sal

===Regular Verbs (Ud. and Uds. forms)===
====-AR verbs====
For the -AR verbs, take the first person singular form (yo) and take off the -o and add the command endings to the stem.

 -e    -en

=====Nadar (to swim)=====

I swim - Nado //
You swim - Nades //
He/she swims - Nade //
we swim - nademos //
they swim - naden //

====-ER &amp; -IR verbs====
For the -ER and -IR verbs, take the first person singular form (yo) and take off the -o and add the command endings to the stem.

 -a    -an

=====caber (to fit) - ''Irregular yo form quepo''=====

 quepa quepan

=====pedir (to ask for) - ''Stem change ''e'' to'' i=====

 pida  pidan

===Double Changes===
Verbs that end in -car, -gar, and -zar which changes their endings to -que, -gue, and -ce, respectively

=====secar (to dry)=====
 Seque  Sequen

=====jugar (to play) - ''Stem change ''u'' to'' ue=====
 Juegue Jueguen

===Irregular Verbs===

=====Ser (to be)=====
 Sea    Sean

=====Estar (to be)=====
 Esté   Estén

=====Ir (to go)=====
 Vaya  Vayan

=====Dar (to give)=====
 Dé     Den

=====Saber (to know)=====
 Sepa   Sepan

The Interfaces package helps in interfacing with other programming languages. Ada is one of the few languages where interfacing with other languages is part of the language standard. The language standard defines the interfaces for [[C Programming|C]], [[COBOL|Cobol]] and [[Programming:Fortran|Fortran]]. Of course any implementation might define further interfaces &amp;mdash; [[Ada Programming/GNAT|GNAT]] for example defines an interface to [[C++ Programming|C++]].

Interfacing with other languages is actually provided by {{Ada/pragma|Export}}, {{Ada/pragma|Import}} and {{Ada/pragma|Convention}}

The '''Ada''' package is only an anchor or namespace for Ada's standard library. Most compilers will not allow you to add new packages to the Ada hierarchy and even if your compiler allows it you should not do so since all package names starting with ''Ada.'' are reserved for future extensions. 

== List of language defined child units ==

The following library units (packages and generic subprograms) are descendents of the package Ada.

== List of implementation defined child units ==

The Reference Manual allows compiler vendors to add extensions to the Standard Libraries. However, these extensions cannot be directly childs of the package Ada, only grandchilds -- for example {{Ada/package|Ada.Characters.Latin_9}}.

Currently, only the implementation defined library units of the [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] compiler are listed here. You can help Wikibooks by [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada&amp;action=edit adding] implementation dependent packages of other compilers:

; GNAT : Extended package [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_rm/The-GNAT-Library.html implemented by GNAT].
; ObjectAda :  Extended package implemented by ObjectAda.
; APEX :  Extended package implemented by IBM/Rational APEX.

The GNAT package hierarchy defines several units for general purpose programming provided by the GNAT compiler. It is distributed along with the compiler and uses the same license.

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnat4oa GNAT-4-ObjectAda] is a project for porting the GNAT library to the ObjectAda compiler.

== Description ==

The '''System''' package is a standard library package provided with each Ada implementation. It includes implementation and system configuration-dependent definitions. The System package contains a standard set of language-defined (but implementation-dependent) types and named numbers.

=== Types ===

* Name
* Address
* Priority (also Interrupt_Priority and Any_Priority since Ada&amp;nbsp;95)
* Bit_Order (since Ada&amp;nbsp;95)

=== Constants ===

The following named numbers may be set by pragmas. These pragmas may only be used at the start of compilation:
* System_Name
* Storage_Unit
* Memory_Size

The following named numbers are set by the implementation:

* Null_Address (since Ada&amp;nbsp;95)
* Default_Priority (since Ada&amp;nbsp;95)
* Default_Bit_Order (since Ada&amp;nbsp;95)
* MIN_INT &amp;mdash; the smallest value of all predefined integer types (negative).
* MAX_INT &amp;mdash; the largest value of all predefined integer types (positive).
* MAX_BINARY_MODULUS &amp;mdash; the largest power of allowed as the modulus for modular types.
* MAX_NONBINARY_MODULUS &amp;mdash; the largest value allowed as the modulus for modular types. 
* MAX_BASE_DIGITS &amp;mdash; the largest number of significant decimal digits in a floating point declaration.
* MAX_DIGITS &amp;mdash; the largest number of significant decimal digits in a floating point declaration without a range specification. This value is at most as large as the previous one.
* MAX_MANTISSA &amp;mdash; the largest possible number of binary digits in the mantissa of fixed point values.
* FINE_DELTA &amp;mdash; The smallest delta allowed in a fixed point value (given a range constraint of -1.0 to 1.0).
* TICK &amp;mdash; the clock period (in seconds).

== Child packages ==

=== Standard System packages ===

The following six System packages are from the [[w:ISO 8652|ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E)]] standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

'''Crytography''' is the science of secure communication in the presence of third parties (sometimes called &quot;adversaries&quot;).

Modern cryptographers and cryptanalysts work in many areas including
* data confidentiality
* data integrity
* authentication
* forward secrecy
* end-to-end auditable voting systems
* digital currency

Classical cryptography focused on &quot;data confidentiality&quot; -- keeping pieces of [[wikt:information|information]] [[wikt:secret|secret]],
i.e. of designing technical systems such that an observer can infer as few as possible - optimally none - information from observing the system.
The motivation for this is that the owner of the system wants to prevent the observer from taking advantage (e.g. monetary, influential, emotional) of the possible intelligence.

This secrecy or hiding is achieved by removing contextual information from the system's observable state and/or behaviour, without which the observer cannot gain [[wikt:intelligence|intelligence]] about the system.

==Examples==

The term is very often used in conjunction in the context of message exchange between two entities, but of course not restricted to this case.

===Hiding System State Alone===

It may be advantageous for an ATM machine to hide the information as to how much cash is still available in the machine.
It may e.g. only disclose the information that no more bank notes are available from it to the holder of a valid debit card.

===Hiding Communication Content===

Two companies doing business with each other may not wish to disclose the information on pricing of their products to third parties tapping into their communications.

===Hiding the Fact of Communicating===

Well known entities with well known fields of activity may wish to hide the fact that they are communicating at all since an observer aware of their fields of activity may already from the fact of some communication happening, be able to infer information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''symmetric key cipher''' (also called a '''secret-key cipher''', or a '''one-key cipher''', or a '''private-key cipher''', or a '''shared-key cipher''') is one that uses the same (necessarily secret) key to encrypt messages as it does to decrypt messages. 

Until the invention of asymmetric key cryptography (commonly termed &quot;public key / private key&quot; crypto) in the 1970s, all ciphers were symmetric.  Each party to the communication needed a key to encrypt a messages; and a recipient needed a copy of the same key to decrypt the message. This presented a significant problem, as it required all parties to have a secure communication system (e.g. face-to-face meeting or secure courier) in order to distribute the required keys. The number of secure transfers required rises impossibly, and wholly impractically, quickly with the number of participants.

=== Formal Definition ===
Any cryptosystem based on a symmetric key cipher conforms to the following definition:
* M : message to be enciphered
* K : a secret key
* E : enciphering function
* D : deciphering function
* C : enciphered message.  C := E(M, K)
* For all M, C, and K, M = D(C,K) = D(E(M,K),K)

=== Reciprocal Ciphers ===
Some shared-key ciphers are also &quot;reciprocal ciphers.&quot;  A reciprocal cipher applies the same transformation to decrypt a message as the one used to encrypt it.  In the language of the formal definition above, E = D for a reciprocal cipher.

An example of a reciprocal cipher is [[w:Rot 13|Rot 13]], in which the same alphabetic shift is used in both cases.

{{recipe}}
__NOTOC__
This is a family recipe, so it may not be accurate. It is still delicious, though. 

== Ingredients ==
*½ pound (225g) of [[Cookbook:Noodle|rice noodles]]
*¼ cup (60mL) [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]]
*¼ cup and 1 Tablespoon (75mL) [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white vinegar]] (or [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|rice vinegar]])
*¼ cup and 1 Tablespoon (75mL) [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]]
*¼ cup and 1 Tablespoon (75mL) palm sugar (or [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]])
*4 Tablespoons (60mL) [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (chopped)
*2 Tablespoons (30mL) dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red chili pepper flakes]] (or to taste)
*½ pound (225g) of [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]], or [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (or a combination of the above)
*assorted vegetables (e.g., shredded [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Onion|white onions]], red or green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]])
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*4 chopped [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]]
*¾ pound (340g) of [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]]
*¾ cup (175mL) chopped unroasted [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]

===Optional===
* wedge of [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] (garnish)
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander) leaves (garnish)

== Procedure ==
# Soak the noodles in warm water for about 20 minutes and strain. (Time saver: pour boiling water over the noodles and let them sit for 7 minutes.)
# Mix the fish sauce with the vinegar, sugar and tamarind (optional: lime juice) together in a small bowl.
# Heat the vegetable oil in the wok on high, brown the chopped garlic and chili peppers for a minute.
# Cook the meats/tofu in oil, until they are browned (6-8 minutes).
# Add assorted veggies and cook until tender
# Add noodles. Crack the eggs over the noodles, allow them to cook, and then mix them up.
# Add the fish sauce mix into the wok, mix it all up and turn the heat down to medium.
# Add the chopped green onions and bean sprouts, then stir fry for 2 more minutes.
# Serve on a large plate or bowl. Garnish with chopped peanuts and optionally, chopped cilantro or coriander and a wedge of lime.

== Variations ==
{{Wikipedia|Pad Thai}}
*A squirt of [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] can be used instead of tamarind for a quick-and-easy variation.
*Chop cilantro/coriander and mix it with the noodles and other ingredients at the last minute. (Take care not to overcook it, or it will become slimy.)

* Which Tamil

[Someone needs to make it clear on whether this is Tamil from Tamil Nadu in India, or Tamil from Sri Lanka. There are of course similarities, but enough of a difference to confuse readers who don't know which one they are dealing with here.]
:I don't think there are several Tamil languages. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 07:28, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::Response: My mother-in-law is Sri Lankan Tamil. I tried to learn some basics, but didn't realise the Tamil books I bought were from Tamil Nadu - and were quite different from the Tamil she speaks.

* Tamil! National Language of India?

Tamil is not the national language of India, as I know. --[[User:Sanat|sanat]] 07:02, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

In India, Hindi is the national language, and Tamil is one of the 15 recognised official languages.
In Sri Lanka, Sinhala and Tamil are the 2 national/official languages.
-- [[User:Atif.Hussain|Atif.Hussain]]

* Hindi is not the national language. It is a candidate for national language according to the constitution. The trial period has always been extended.

* 3500 years?

The Tamil article on Wikipedia says the oldest known works in Tamil are from 300BC, which suggests 2300 years rather than 3500. -- [[User:Dannyyee|Dannyyee]] 11:50, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Some of the oldest scriptures dates back to 300 BC. But it not neccessarliy mean that Tamil did not exist prior to that. So &quot;Tamil has been around for about 3500 years&quot;, is not an exaggeration. -- [User : Prathip S A.  19:47, 25th May 2005 (IST)

== Only one Tamil ==

Friends,

There is nothing like Tamil from India and Tamil from Sri lanka. Orgin of Tamil is from Tamil Nadu, A south east state of India. Few thousands of Tamil people were migrated to Srilanka from Tamilnadu about 200 years back to work in the tea estates. 

jp, jp@tamil.in

== Indian &amp; Sri Lankan Tamils ==

To jp, jp@tamil.in, 

you are very confused, you are refering to the indian tamils in the sri lankan estates, they are conpletly different from sri lankan tamils who in sri lanka for more then 200 years. 

please get your facts correct first

bye : KR

* why don't you guys quit bitching in public. Tamil is a great language that is thousands of years old. Variations are quite understandable. Take pride in it

== npov removal ==

is there any reason for this to be here?? I cannot find anything npov about this ?? so can i remove it?? - suren
