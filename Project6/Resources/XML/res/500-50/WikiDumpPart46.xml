      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we can understand what crime and deviance are, it is necessary to know that crime and deviance are changeable in nature. John Hagan in his book ''Crime And Disrepute'' states two theories of describing crime before presenting the most commonly used approach.

==Thorsten Sellin==
Thorstein Sellin proposes a cross-cultural approach which defines crime on the deviation from two types of rules which are &quot;conduct norms&quot; and &quot;universal categories.&quot; Conduct norms are norms (rules enforced by the society) that change from group to group. Therefore, different societies enforce different conduct norms. There are also universal categories, which transcend the differences among societies and apply to everyone based on the inherent values that come with the construction of a society. However, Sellin's argument about universal categories is weak because it cannot clearly define what a universal category might be. Murder is an obvious example, but murder is defined differently across cultures. For example, soldiers killing an enemy during wartime is legal and allowed by the state, so this cannot be considered murder from the point of view of law.

==Leslie Wilkins==
Leslie Wilkins rejected Sellin's theory and came up with a new way to explain activities. The theory argues that for any given society, there is a bell-shaped curve that explains the frequency and type of activity. In the center, where the frequency is highest are the normal acts. Going horizontally to the right (where the activities become more and more &quot;good&quot;), the frequency decreases and these &quot;saintly acts&quot; rarely occur, becoming outliers. Conversely, going horizontally to the left (where the activities get &quot;worse&quot;), the frequency of the specific activity decreases and the activities start to pass the boundaries of &quot;sinful acts,&quot; &quot;illegal acts,&quot; &quot;illegal acts worth notifying the police,&quot; and &quot;serious crimes.&quot; The worst crimes, just as the most saintly of acts, are both outliers and occur infrequently.

==The Crime Continuum==
In modern theories, both Sellin and Wilkins have inadequate descriptions of crime. Whereas Sellin cannot clearly describe the universal categories, Wilkins relies too heavily on a one-dimensional factor (which is that of morality). Deviance and crime are affected by three variables, which are agreement about the norm, the severity of social response, and the evaluation of social harm.

===Variables In The Definition Of Crime And Deviance===
* Social Agreement: This factor contributes to how the public views the crime, whether or not they believe that the norm is beneficial for society. If different people cannot agree on the rules of the norm or how strongly it should be enforced, then a law with weak social agreement will be weak. Abortion is an example of a right that is hotly contested today, and would be considered having low social agreement.
* Social Response: This factor determines how serious the crime is by the seriousness of the punishments meted out. This is an indication of how serious an offense the society views a specific deviance or crime. In the early 20th century, the use of cocaine was very popular with upper-class women for pain relief. Therefore, it was viewed as an acceptable activity. However, in recent times, the trafficking and use of cocaine has become very stigmatized, with these activities bringing severe penalties. This is an example of an act that used to have a low social response but has changed to arousing severe social responses.
* Social Harm: This evaluation indicates the level of harm that a particular crime puts on the society. Some crimes are &quot;victimless&quot; since they harm only the criminal, but some crimes hurt others or social institutions themselves. Drug usage would be considered low in social harm, while an act such as serial murder would be considered high in social harm.

These three factors generally tend to converge when a crime becomes more and more severe, but they are not necessarily linked. For example many corporate crimes cause more monetary damage than small-time theft, but the social response is minimal.

===Crime Categories===
A few different categories of crimes can be described using these four factors:
* Consensus Crimes: These crimes are generally agreed to be serious by most members of a society. They are characterized by high social agreement, response, and/or harm. 
* Conflict Crimes: These are crimes that have low social agreement, varied social response, and varied social harm. Some individuals believe that particular conflict crimes are very serious while others may believe that these crimes are not serious at all. The social agreement on conflict crimes tend to be split by social groups. In other words, specific groups in society have particular biases towards the social agreement of seriousness of these conflict crimes.
* Social Deviations: Social deviation generally has low social agreement on seriousness and the social response to deviation is often varied, with either formal or informal institutions enforcing the adherence to norms. People with more resources generally tend to be able to avoid social response better than those without these resources.
* Social Diversions: Acts that fall under the category of diversions are those that are considered by the society to be acceptable variations in lifestyle. Social deviations can become social diversions when many people take part in the deviation and make it fashionable. Note that other societies may regard these social diversions as unacceptable within their collection of norms.

{{main|Wikipedia:Utilitarianism}}
{{main|Wikipedia:Cesare Beccaria}}
Early on, thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham believed that criminals committed crimes because in the utilitarian calculation of utility, the criminals regarded the cost of their crimes as smaller than the benefits that they reaped. Therefore, in order to prevent deviance, the society must impose strict sanctions upon the offender in order to increase the costs of deviance, causing the utility of crime to be far less beneficial for people.

* Cesare Beccaria

==Biological Theories==
[[Image:Cesare Lombroso.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Cesare Lombroso]]
{{main|Wikipedia:Italian school of criminology}}
{{main|Wikipedia:Biological determinism}}
Cesare Lombrosos and his Italian School of criminology argued against the utlitarian school by assuming that deviants and criminals break social norms and laws due to atavistic traits. In other words, they believed that these people are not as highly advanced in the evolutionary process as normally functioning members of society. The Italian School also believed that these atavistic traits are indicated by physical, biological indicators of a person such as body type or the shape of the face. These theorists believed that deviants are not flexible individuals; criminal tendencies stem from biological factors, and thus they believed that punishment would not work since biological determinants on crime would be more or less fate. Therefore, if punishment would not work, then neutralization of the deviant was necessary. The theorists in the Italian School believed that institutions such as mental hospitals, lifetime imprisonment, or the death sentence would neutralize the deviant and thus make the society fit for the normal people to live safely.

[[Image:Criminal brains.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A 1920s display comparing brain types to criminality.]]
Ever since sociology has been used as a tool to describe and analyze deviance, however, the biological theories such as those found in the Italian School has fallen into unpopularity. Biological theories of deviance have been seen as racist, since ideas such as eugenics have been justified with these theories. US schools are currently the only schools that consider biological theories of deviance in any detail. Foreign schools only mention these ideas briefly and refute them with sociological studies in social deviance courses. This is due to the availability and interest of the study of DNA in the US. However, these &quot;biosocial&quot; theories are generally not accepted by the mainstream sociological community because of the tenuous (at best) link between biology and behavior, as well as the strong evidence that these biosocial theories base their ideas on flawed research, confounded variables, and confusion about causality ([[Wikipedia:Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)|correlation does not imply causation]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{main|Wikipedia:Structural functionalism}}
The structural-functionalist school of sociology is concerned with macro-level explanations. Therefore, this school is interested primarily in how norms and institutions fit in the study of deviance.

==Norms==
{{main|Wikipedia:Norm (sociology)}}
In a society, a norm is a sort of rule that is enforced by the society. They are generally unwritten and most people take them for granted, not realizing the powerful force of norm enforcement until they have deviated from a norm. Society may punish deviants in three different levels:
* Legal sanctions.
* Stigmatization by the society as a deviant.
* The preference of one action over another.

==Anomie==
Anomie, in contemporary English, means a condition or malaise in individuals, characterized by an absence or diminution of standards or values. When applied to a government or society, anomie implies a social unrest or chaos.

**'''Etymology'''
The word comes from Greek, namely the prefix a- “without”, and nomos “law”. The Greeks distinguished between nomos (νόμος, “law”), and arché (αρχή, “starting rule, axiom, principle”). For example, a monarch is a single ruler but he or she might still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. nomos.

In the original city state democracy, the majority rule was an aspect of arché because it was a rule-based, customary system which might or might not make laws, i.e. nomos. Thus, the original meaning of anomie defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word anomie can accept greater flexibility in the word “norm”, and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of anarchy. But, as used by Émile Durkheim and later theorists, anomie is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory social controls of society, and is a completely separate concept from anarchy which is an absence of effective rulers or leaders.

**'''Anomie as individual disorder'''
The nineteenth century French pioneer sociologist Emile Durkheim borrowed the word from the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau and used it in his book Suicide (1897), outlining the causes of suicide to describe a condition or malaise in individuals, characterized by an absence or diminution of standards or values (referred to as normlessness), and an associated feeling of alienation and purposelessness. He believed that anomie is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for good or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This is contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent depression.

In Durkheim’s view, traditional religions often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the division of labor that had been prevalent in economic life since the Industrial Revolution led individuals to pursue egoistic ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community.

Robert King Merton also adopted the idea of anomie to develop Strain Theory, defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the structural limitations in society. As a result the individual would exhibit deviant behavior. Friedrich Hayek notably uses the word anomie with this meaning.

Anomie as a social disorder is not to be confused with anarchy. Anarchy denotes lack of rulers, hierarchy, and command, whereas anomie denotes lack of rules, structure, and organization. Many proponents of anarchism claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness (see e.g. the Law of Eristic Escalation).

As an older variant, the Webster 1913 dictionary reports use of the word anomie as meaning “disregard or violation of the law”.

==Durkheim==

[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|Emile Durkheim]]

Emil Durkheim is the founder of the structural functionalist perspective. This is essentially the view that everything in society has a given function that it must perform within that society in order for it to continue to survive. There are two main types of functions that a particular social phenomena can perform. They are Manifest and Latent functions. The former are those functions in society that are intended and direct. An example of this would be the function of a police force to prevent crime and enforce criminal law. Latent functions on the other hand are those things which come about indirectly and, while still being a necessary function, are less straight forward. Another example using a police force would be its latent function of maintaining the belief in the general population that society is operating smoothly (or that it isn't running so smoothly, depending on regional variations).











==Merton==

[[Image:Mertons social strain theory.svg|thumb|right|250 px|Merton's structural-functional idea of deviance and anomie.]]
Robert King Merton expanded on the idea that anomie is the alienation of the self from society due to conflicting norms and interests by describing 5 different types of actions that occur when personal goals and legitimate means come into conflict with each other. Instead of social integration and social regulation, Merton focused on the two variables of goals and legitimate means.
These two dimensions determine the adaptation to society according to the cultural goals, which are the society's perceptions about the ideal life, and to the institutionalized means, which are the legitimate means through which an individual may aspire to the cultural goals.
There are 5 possible combinations of adaptation. When an individual accepts the goals and means together, he is working under conformity. (Example: White collar employee who holds a job to support a family.) When an individual accepts the goals but uses illegitimate means in order to achieve them, he commits crimes in order to emulate the values of those who conform; in other words, they must use innovation in order to achieve cultural goals. (Example: Drug dealer who sells drugs to support a family.) An individual may lose faith in cultural goals but still feel obligated to work under the routines of legitimate daily life. This person is practicing ritualism. (Example: A white collar employee who holds a job, but has become completely discontent with the American Dream.) Individuals may also reject both goals and means and fall under retreatism, when they ignore the goals and the means of the society. (Example: Drug addicts who have stopped caring about the social goals and use drugs as a way to escape reality.) Finally, there is a fifth type of adaptation which is that of rebellion, where the individual rejects the cultural goals and the institutionalized means, but seeks to redefine new values for society. (Example: Radicals who want to repair or even destroy the capitalist system in order to build a new social structure.)
** Merton states that anomie is the state in which social goals and the legitimate means to achieve them do not correspond.
** 5 ways of adaptation to society according to Culture Goals (A) and Institutionalized Means (B)
*** Conformity: A+B+
*** Innovations: A+B-
*** Ritualism: A-B+
*** Retreatism: A-B-
*** Rebellion: A(Change)B(Change)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sociologists and philosophers who take on the power-conflict perspective believe that structural-functionalists and symbolic interactionists do not adequately take into account the use (or abuse) of power within societies. Many thinkers of this school tend to base their explanations of crime from the division of classes and the inequal distribution of power among different groups within the context of the larger group of the society.

==Marx==
[[Image:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Karl Marx]]

==Foucault==
[[Image:Michel-foucault.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Michel Foucault]]
Michel Foucault's works in the field of Sociology covers a wide range of topics, but his book ''Discipline and Punish'' is a work concerning the study of crime, punishment, and discipline in the modern society.

Torture was the mode of punishment in the middle ages in Europe because in those times, crimes were perceived to be injuries upon the power of the sovereign himself. Therefore, the sovereign felt a need to use his power to inflict pain upon the criminal. Thus, torture was widespread during this time.

As the power shifted over from the sovereign to the individual, the view of crime and punishment changed entirely. The sovereign was no longer the most important figure of the state; rather, the various states in Europe started to represent the i like pizza individuals within it more fully. Therefore, crimes became to be seen as deviation from the norms and the values of the state rather than injury to the power of an individual or groups of individuals. Since crimes were no longer viewed as providing injury, it was also unnecessary for the state to punish in a vengeful way.

Another shift in power relations made torture unnecessary in the modern world. In the middle ages, catching criminals and subsequently punishing them was not an easy task. States were very weak and power was unevenly distributed. Therefore, it was necessary to make punishment public. The various methods of torture and execution were made public so that everyone could see it. This was used to show off the power of the state and was used as a warning to future criminals. However, as states gained more power and as they stabilized, it was easier to enforce civil laws. Because the states no longer had to rely on extremely powerful sovereigns to control a feudal bas icecream cattleed society due to the modern city making it easier to control the new liberal society, power could be more evenly diffused throughout society. The individual gained power along with the state, which also gained stability. Therefore, a strong show of violence became unnecessary to facilitate order.

These two factors helped to provide the punishment of the modern era, which is that of imprisonment, or the revoking of freedom. Because individuals became more important, and there was no longer any need to punish in a vengeful or public way, punishment became more of a hidden phenomenon. Prisons are places which control the actions of the individual, implicitly prescribing and proscribing certain actions. In order to control action, prisons instill a sense of discipline. Discipline is the control of individuals in a certain institution.

Even though punishment is now hidden, discipline became one of the most important and visible uses of power in the modern times. In the modern society where individuals supposedly are the most important, something is required to keep the institutions running. Discipline comes down from the institutions in order to regulate the society. The prison therefore is the template for modern institutions because the prison (or panopticon) is the institution with the best use of discipline. Therefore, schools, militaries, bureacracies are all built with discipline in mind. These institutions all observe the individual (with or without the individual's knowledge) with the threat of punishment lurking by in order to control these individuals. In the modern age, not only are individuals closely watched but their physical actions are now controlled as well. Soldiers in a military move in unison, to a prescribed pattern set by the institution. Students are controlled by the bureacracy of the school and learn according to the wishes of the society, under the watchful eye of the teacher or the professor.

In other words, institutions have come to dominate the society instead of the individual as some think. It is the institutions, norms, and values that guide the individual, instilling discipline into the group. Foucault believes that humans no longer have a right to their own fates because it is institutions that govern the society.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Radio transmitter design''' is a complex topic which can be broken down into a series of smaller topics.

==Frequency synthesis and frequency multiplication==
===Synthesis===
====Fixed frequency systems====

For a fixed frequency transmitter one commonly used method is to use a resonant quartz crystal in a Crystal oscillator to fix the frequency. For transmitter where the frequency has to be able to be varied then several options can be used.

====Variable frequency systems====

* An array of crystals—This approach uses several oscillators, each tuned to a different fixed frequency.
* Variable frequency oscillator (VFO)
* Phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer

===Multiplication===

It is often the case for VHF transmitters that it is not possible to operate the crystal controlled or variable frequency oscillator at the frequency of the final output. Also, for reasons including frequency stability, it is better to multiply the frequency of the free running oscillator up to the final frequency which is required.

If the output of a amplifier stage is tuned to a multiple of the frequency which the stage is driven with, the stage is optimised to give a larger harmonic output than that found in a linear amplifier. In a push-push stage, the output will only contain the even harmonics. This is because the currents which would generate the fundamental and the odd harmonics in this circuit (if one valve was removed) are canceled out by the second valve. Note that in these diagrams that the bias supplies and the neutralization have been omitted for clarity. In a real system it is likely that tetrodes would be used as plate to grid capacitance in a tetrode is lower so making the stage less likely to be unstable.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Freqdoublermade using triodes.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Here in the push-pull stage the output will only contain the odd harmonics because of the canceling effect.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Freqtripliermade of triodes.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Frequency mixing and Modulation==

The task of many transmitters is to transmit some form of information using a carrier wave.  This process is called modulation.  There are many types of RF modulation, and the choice of modulation often depends on the type of information being transmitted.

For instance, audio information is continuous in time and value, and scaling by a constant (i.e. signal inversion, volume control) is  acceptable, so AM and FM transmission work.  But for digital communications, the signal is discrete in time and discrete in value, and inversion of the signal is unacceptable, so AM and FM are not (on their own) satisfactory.  For digital communications, a modulation such as frequency shift keying (FSK) or on-off keying (OOK) over FM would be better.

===AM modes===

In many cases the carrier wave is mixed with another electrical signal to impose upon it the information. This occurs in Amplitude modulation (AM).

==== Low level and High level ====
===== Low level =====

Here a small audio stage is used to modulate a low power stage, the output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier.

* Advantages

The advantage of using a linear RF amplifier is that the smaller early stages can be modulated, which only requires a small audio amplifier to drive the modulator. 

* Disadvantages

The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because it has to be linear to preserve the modulation. Hence class C amplifiers cannot be employed.

An approach which marries the advantages of low-level modulation with the efficiency of a Class C power amplifier chain is to arrange a feedback system to compensate for the substantial distortion of the AM envelope. A simple detector at the transmitter output (which can be little more than a loosely coupled diode) recovers the audio signal, and this is used as negative feedback to the audio modulator stage. The overall chain then acts as a linear amplifier as far as the actual modulation is concerned, though the RF amplifier itself still retains the Class C efficiency. This approach is widely used in practical medium power transmitters, such as AM radiotelephones.

===== High level =====

* Advantages

One advantage of using class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter is that only the final stage needs to be modulated, and that all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. These class C stages will be able to generate the drive for the final stage for a smaller DC power input. However in many designs in order to obtain better quality AM the penultimate RF stages will need to be subject to modulation as well as the final stage.

* Disadvantages

A large audio amplifier will be needed for the modulation stage, at least equal to the power of the transmitter output itself. Traditionally the modulation is applied using an audio transformer, and this can be bulky. Direct coupling from the audio amplifier is also possible (known as a cascode arrangement), though this usually requires quite a high DC supply voltage (say 30V or more), which is not suitable for mobile units.

====Types of AM modulators====

A wide range of different circuits have been used for AM. While it is perfectly possible to create good designs using solid-state electronics, valved (tube) circuits are shown here. In general, valves are able to easily yield RF powers far in excess of what can be achieved using solid state. Most high-power broadcast stations still use valves.

=====Plate AM modulators=====

In plate modulation systems the voltage delivered to the stage is changed. As the power output available is a function of the supply voltage, the output power is modulated. This can be done using a transformer to alter the anode (plate) voltage. The advantage of the transformer method is that the audio power can be supplied to the RF stage and converted into RF power.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ammodstage.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Anode modulation using a transformer.  The tetrode is supplied with an anode supply (and screen grid supply) which is modulated via the transformer. The resistor R1 sets the grid bias, both the input and outputs are tuned LC circuits which are tapped into by inductive coupling.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:seriesmod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

An example of a series modulated amplitude modulation stage.  The tetrode is supplied with an anode supply (and screen grid supply) which is modulated by the modulator valve. The resistor VR1 sets the grid bias for the modulator valve, both the RF input (tuned grid) and outputs are tuned LC circuits which are tapped into by inductive coupling.

When the valve at the top conducts more than the potential difference between the anode and cathode of the lower valve (RF valve) will increase. The two valves can be thought of as two resistors in a potentiometer.

=====Screen AM modulators=====

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Screenmodulator.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Under steady state conditions (no audio driven) the stage will be a simple RF amplifier where the [[grid]] bias is set by the cathode current. When the stage is modulated the screen potential changes and so alters the gain of the stage.

===Other modes which are related to AM===

Several derivatives of AM are in common use. These are

====Single-sideband modulation====

(SSB, or SSB-AM single-sideband full carrier modulation), very similar to [[w:Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband suppressed carrier modulation]] (SSB-SC)

=====Filter method=====

Using a balanced mixer a double side band signal is generated, this is then passed through a very narrow bandpass filter to leave only one side-band. By convention it is normal to use the upper sideband (USB) in communication systems, except for HAM radio when the carrier frequency is below 10&amp;nbsp;MHz here the lower side band (LSB) is normally used.

=====Phasing method=====

The phasing method is another way to generate of single sideband signals. One of the weaknesses of this method is the need for a network which imposes a constant 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; phase shift on audio signals throughout the entire audio spectrum. By reducing the audio bandwidth the task of designing the phaseshift network can be made more easy.

Imagine that the audio is a single sine wave E = E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sine (ωt)

The audio signal is passed through the phase shift network to give two identical signals which differ by 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

So as the audio input is a single sine wave the outputs will be

E = E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sine (ωt)

and

E = E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; cosine (ωt)

These audio outputs are mixed in non linear mixers with a carrier, the carrier drive for one of these mixers is shifted by 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. The output of these mixers is combined in a linear circuit to give the SSB signal.

====Vestigial-sideband modulation====

[[w:Vestigial-sideband modulation]] (VSB, or VSB-AM) is a type of modulation system commonly used in TV systems, it is normal AM which has been passed through a filter which removes one of the sidebands.

====Morse====

Strictly speaking the commonly used 'AM' is double-sideband full carrier. Morse is often sent using on-off keying of an unmodulated carrier(Continuous wave), this can be thought of as an AM mode.

===FM modes===
====Direct FM====

Direct FM (true Frequency modulation) is where the frequency of an oscillator is altered to impose the modulation upon the carrier wave. This can be done by using a voltage controlled capacitor (Varicap diode) in a crystal controlled oscillator. The frequency of the oscillator is then multiplied up using a frequency multiplier stage, or is translated upwards using a mixing stage to the output frequency of the transmitter.

====Indirect FM====

Indirect FM employs varicap diode to impose a phase shift (which is voltage controlled) in a tuned circuit which is fed with a plain carrier. This is termed Phase modulation, the modulated signal from a phase modulated stage can be understood with a FM receiver but for good audio quality the audio applied to the phase modulation stage.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Indirectfmmodulator.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

This is a solid state circuit, on the right a RF drive is applied to the base of the transistor, the tank circuit (LC) connected to the collector via a capacitor contains a pair of varicap diodes. As the voltage applied to the varicaps is changed the phase shift of the output will change.

*[[w:Sigma-delta modulation]] (∑Δ)

==RF power amplifiers==
===Valves===

For high power systems it is normal to use valves, please see Valved RF amplifiers for details of how valved RF power stages work.

====Advantages of valves====

* Good for high power systems
* Electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads for minutes which would destroy bipolar transistor systems in milliseconds

====Disadvantages of valves====

* Heater supplies are required for the cathodes
* High voltages (''Threat of death'') are required for the anodes
* Valves have a shorter working life than solid state parts because the heaters tend to fail

===Solid state===

For low and medium power it is often the case that solid state power stages are used. Sadly for high power systems these cost more per [[Watt]] of output power &lt;small&gt;than a valved system.
&lt;/small&gt;

==Linking the transmitter to the aerial==

The vast majority of modern equipment is designed to operate with a resistive load driven via coaxial cable of one particular impedance, often 50 ohms. To connect the aerial to this coaxial cable transmission line a matching network and/or a balun may be required. Commonly a SWR meter and/or a Antenna analyzer are used to check the goodness of the match between the aerial system and the transmission line (feeder).

See [[w:Antenna tuner]] and [[w:balun]] for details of matching networks and baluns respectively.

==EMC matters==
{{wikiversity|EMI-EMC}}
While this section was written from the point of view of a radio ham with relation to Television interference (radio transmitter interference) it applies to the construction and use of all radio transmitters, and other electronic devices which generate high RF powers with no intention of radiating these. For instance a dielectric heater might contain a 2000 Watt 27&amp;nbsp;MHz source within it, if the machine operates as intended then none of this RF power will leak out. However if the device is subject to a fault then when it operates RF will leak out and it will be now a transmitter. Also computers are RF devices, if the cases is poorly made then the computer will radiate at VHF. For example if you attempt to tune into a weak ''FM'' radio station (88 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz, band II) at your desk you may lose reception when you switch on your PC. Equipment which is not intended to generate RF, but does so through for example sparking at switch contacts is not considered here, for a consideration of such matters please see Television interference (electrical interference) for further details.

===RF leakage (defective RF shielding)===

All equipment using RF electronics should be inside a screened metal box, all connections in or out of the metal box should be filtered to avoid the ingress or egress of radio signals. A common and effective method of doing so for wires carrying DC supplies, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz AC connections, audio and control signals is to use a feedthrough capacitor. This is a capacitor which is mounted in a hole in the shield, one terminal of the capacitor is its metal body which touches the shielding of the box while the other two terminal of the capacitor are the on either side of the shield. The feed through capacitor can be thought of as a metal rod which has a dielectric sheath which in turn has a metal coating.

In addition to the feed through capacitor, either a resistor or RF choke can be used to increase the filtering on the lead. In transmitters it is vital to prevent RF from entering the transmitter through any lead such as a power, microphone or control connection. If RF does enter a transmitter in this way then an instability known as motorboating can occur. Motorboating is an example of a self inflicted EMC problem.

If a transmitter is suspected of being responsible for a television interference problem then it should be run into a dummy load, this is a resistor in a screened box or can which will allow the transmitter to generate radio signals without sending them to the antenna. If the transmitter does not cause interference during this test then it is safe to assume that a signal has to be radiated from the antenna antenna to cause a problem. If the transmitter does cause interference during this test then a path exists by which RF power is leaking out of the equipment, this can be due to bad shielding. This is a rare but insidious problem and it is vital that it is tested for.

** You are most likely to see this leakage on homemade equipment or equipment which has been modified. It is also possible to observe RF leaking out of microwave cookers.

===Spurious emissions===

* Early in the development of radio technology it was recognized that the signals emitted by transmitters had to be 'pure'. For instance Spark-gap transmitters were quickly outlawed as they give an output which is so wide in terms of frequency. In modern equipment there are three main types of spurious emissions.

* The term Spurious emissions refers to any signal which comes out of a transmitter other than the wanted signal. The spurious emissions include harmonics, out of band mixer products which are not fully suppressed and leakage from the local oscillator and other systems within the transmitter.

====Harmonics====

These are multiples of the operation frequency of the transmitter, they can be generated in a stage of the transmitter even if it is driven with a perfect sine wave because no real life amplifier is perfectly linear. It is best if these harmonics are designed out at an early stage. For instance a push-pull amplifier consisting of two tetrode valves attached to an anode tank resonant LC circuit which has a coil which is connected to the high voltage DC supply at the centre (Which is also RF ground) will only give a signal for the fundamental and the odd harmonics. 

[[Image:goodpoweramp.jpg|centre|Note that B+ is the anode supply, C- is the grid bias. While the circuit shown here uses tetrode valves (for example 2 x 4CX250B) many designs have used solid state semiconductor parts (such as MOSFETS). Note that NC is a neutralization capacitor]]

Here is a slightly worse design which only has one tetrode, while perfectly good designs have been made using this circuit it does have more potential shortcomings than the above circuit.

[[Image:badpoweramp.jpg|centre|Note that B+ is the anode supply, C- is the grid bias. While the circuit shown here uses a tetrode valve (for example the 4CX250B) many designs have used solid state semiconductor parts (such as MOSFETS)]]

In addition to the good design of the amplifier stages, the transmitter's output should be filtered with a low pass filter to reduce the level of the harmonics.

The harmonics can be tested for using a RF spectrum analyser (expensive) or with an absorption wavemeter (cheap). If a harmonic is found which is at the same frequency as the frequency of the signal wanted at the receiver then this spurious emission can prevent the wanted signal from be received.

====Local oscillators and unwanted mixing products====

Imagine a transmitter, which has an intermediate frequency (IF) of 144&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is mixed with 94&amp;nbsp;MHz to create a signal at 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is then amplified and transmitted. If the local oscillator signal was to enter the power amplifier and not be adequately suppressed then it could be radiated. It would then have the potential to interfere with radio signals at 94&amp;nbsp;MHz in the FM audio (band II) broadcast band. Also the unwanted mixing product at 238&amp;nbsp;MHz could in a poorly designed system be radiated. Normally with good choice of the intermediate and local oscillator frequencies this type of trouble can be avoided, but one potentially bad situation is in the construction of a 144 to 70&amp;nbsp;MHz converted, here the local oscillator is at 74&amp;nbsp;MHz which is very close to the wanted output. Good well made units have been made which use this conversion but their design and construction has been challenging. This problem can be thought of as being related to the Image response problem which exists in receivers. 

One method of reducing the potential for this transmitter defect is the use of balance and double balanced mixers. For example here is a simple but poor mixer

[[Image:badmixer.jpg|centre|]]

If the equation is assumed to be

E = E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

and is driven by two simple sine waves, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; then the output will be a mixture of four frequencies

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

If the simple mixer is replaced with a balanced mixer then the number of possible products is reduced. Imagine that two mixers which have the equation {I = E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} are wired up so that the current outputs are wired to the two ends of a coil (the centre of this coil is wired to ground) then the total current flowing through the coil is the difference between the output of the two mixer stages. If the f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; drive for one of the mixers is phase shifted by 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; then the overall system will be a balanced mixer.

[[Image:goodmixer.jpg|centre|Note that while this hypothetical design uses tetrodes many designs have used solid state semiconductor parts (such as MOSFETS).]]

E = K . E&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt; . ΔE&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; 

So the output will now have only three frequencies

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Now as the frequency mixer has fewer outputs the task of making sure that the final output is ''clean'' will be simpler.

====Instability and parasitic oscillations====

If a stage in a transmitter is unstable and is able to oscillate then it can start to generate RF at either a frequency close to the operating frequency or at a very different frequency. One good sign that it is occurring is if a RF stage has a power output even without being driven by an exciting stage. Another sign is if the output power suddenly increases wildly when the input power is increased slightly, it is noteworthy that in a class C stage that this behaviour can be seen under normal conditions. The best defence against this transmitter defect is a good design, also it is important to pay good attention to the neutralization of the valves or transistors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Shift From Torture To Prison==
===Power And Structural Theories===
===Foucault===
Michel Foucault was a French philosopher who died in 1984.  His work which relates most closely to the theme of social control was Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison.  In this work, Foucault traces the history of punishment from the middle of the 18th century to the present.  Although the book starts with a vivid image of harsh corporeal punishment, Foucault's main purpose in this work is to discuss not merely how we have become a &quot;nicer&quot; society, but how punishment has changed.  For Foucault, the change that occurred in our treatment of criminals moved the target of our punishment from the body to the &quot;soul&quot;, or the psyche.

===Economic Theories===
Sometimes norms are informally enforced.  Foreign cars are not popular in Detroit (and Michigan as a whole) because they are a threat to the local economy.  Those cars tend to be vandalized (especially keyed).  Since most people do not want to have their cars damaged they will buy an American one.  Those who still drive foreign cars in Michigan do so at their own risk.  In Atlanta (and most of Georgia) drinking Coca-Cola is a social norm.  This is enforced by the lack of Pepsi products at restaurants and stores.

==Scrubs Theories==
*Placing your gum in the trash is a social norm.  Chris Turk violated this norm when he spit his gum on the floor.  The Janitor enforced this norm when he used gum to write &quot;Gum goes in the trash&quot; on the windshield of Turk's car (the Janitor violated a social norm).

*Not farting is a social norm.  The Todd violated this norm when he farted in the OR.  Dr. Wen made him leave (he enforced the norm).

*Respecting others' property is a social norm.  Dr. Cox violated this norm when he increased the speed on Dr. Kelso's treadmill (which resulted in him being thrown against the wall).  Dr. Kelso enforced this norm when he spoiled the Heat-Lakers game for Dr. Cox.

==The Current Prison System==
===Law Enforcement===


A local law enforcement ensures or at least tries to ensure that deviant behaviour can be controlled.

===Jails===

===Prosecution===
===Hyperincarceration In The US Since The 1970s===

Like others, I have really used this WikiBook extensively, directing my staff to this site as a great resource.  Now I need help on a companion (not Companion) project.  I am working on a WikiBook for the new Investiture Achievement Awards and need all the help I can get.  It's at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Investiture_Achievement_Awards - thanks in advance for your help! [[User:Soupmix|Soupmix]] ([[User talk:Soupmix|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Soupmix|contribs]]) 13:43, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

==Thank You!==

Thank you for making this available!!!!!.  When I ask someone to teach an honor it is great to be able to give them this resource and not just the honor requirements to go by. Now I can't figure out how to send this message.

:Just save it, and I will see it here.  Thanks for your kind words.  I really enjoy working on this project, and it's even better when someone like you comes along with a friendly thanks. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
This is a fantastic resource - seriously saves time researching. Thanks to all contributers, and I'm trying to fill some of the few remaining gaps [[User:JadeDragon|JadeDragon]] ([[User talk:JadeDragon|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JadeDragon|contribs]]) 06:18, 11 February 2013 (UTC)

==Talk to Us==
If you have used these answer books to teach an honor, we would love to hear from you.  This is a volunteer effort, so the only payment we get is in the form of user feedback.  If you liked what you found here, please let us know.  If you didn't like what you found here, we need to know that too.  Just click the edit link on this page (upper right) and leave a note.  It can be anonymous if you like, but we'd sure like to chat with you.

===Dutch Oven Cooking===
That was a great article on the cooking with Dutch Oven. I would like to see more info on how to care for Dutch Oven in the wilderness where one might not have access to newspaper or anti stick cooking spray.  Also, if oven should get rancid, can it be saved by turning upside down over campfire?

: Thanks.  I assume that you meant &quot;paper towel&quot; rather than &quot;newspaper&quot;.  A clean cloth will work just as well for that.  As for cooking spray, and kind of high-quality cooking oil will do, it's just that cooking spray is more convenient.  Also, I'm going to assume that by &quot;wilderness&quot; you mean something more along the lines of a log cabin in Alaska rather than a backpacking trip along the Appalachian Trail.  Dutch ovens are not practical for trekking because they weigh so much. They are good for canoe trips though, and I imagine they would be alright for dog sleds too.  But you would quickly regret stuffing one into a backpack that you intend to carry more than a couple hundred yards.

:If the oven should get rancid, you certainly can turn it upside-down over a campfire.  Indeed, that's the only way I know of to fix the problem.  Once you do that though, you have to re-season the oven.  Dutch ovens are practically indestructable.  

:Thanks again for your comments! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:40, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

==Cheating?==
Why isn't this a form of Cheating?--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 00:14, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

:Hi Beamer.  I don't think this is a form of cheating because the requirements are not a test.  They are the things a Pathfinder must demonstrate knowledge of before the honor is earned.  It is not enough to just read the answers - they must be learned.  Furthermore, many of the requirements are for the Pathfinder to ''do'' something, and having instruction on how to do it is certainly not cheating, and the instruction does not get the requirement done.  I hope that answers your question.  If not, we can bring it up on the Pathfinder forum at http://www.pathfindersonline.org/forumbb3/index.php --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:10, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

Ok, I am not sure I understand fully, but it seems as though you have given this subject some thought. That is good enough for me. Thanks.--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 04:46, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

== Question ==

I was wondering if the Honors for Pottery &amp; Photography are still taught? 
I saw the link for Digital Photography, but I'm refering to the original photography (darkroom &amp; film).
--[[User:Dreamweaver3959|Dreamweaver3959]] ([[User talk:Dreamweaver3959|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dreamweaver3959|contribs]]) 22:48, 31 August 2011 (UTC)
:Yes, they are.  Both patches are still available at AdventSource.  I bought an old kiln a couple years ago thinking our club might work on Pottery - but it needs repair, so that project is still pending.

== teaching honors... ==

i was told there are honors for teaching honors...if so how do i find them and which ones are available...most sites are antiquated and clumsy so it makes it hard to find exactly what one is looking for any help on this would be appreciated
:There is insignia for teaching an honor, and that would be a silver diamond that goes on the honor patch (AdventSource catalog number 002100).  These diamonds can be placed on the patch for any honor you have taught. There is also a [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Teaching|Teaching]] honor, but it is related to teaching in general, and not to teaching honors. The only other thing I can think of is the Pathfinder Instructors Award, which can be earned by a Master Guide.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 01:27, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
AdventSource says to contact local conf office for the diamonds[[User:JadeDragon|JadeDragon]] ([[User talk:JadeDragon|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JadeDragon|contribs]]) 06:16, 11 February 2013 (UTC)
::Some items at AdventSource (such as all &quot;earned&quot; insignia) require a password before they appear in the catalog.  If you have the password (given to you by your conference) then you can order the diamonds (and other insignia) directly from AdventSource.  Otherwise, you have to go through your conference to buy it.  This is to protect the integrity of the insignia.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 14:34, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;center&gt;''An Additional point of view. (Check history page, 19.29, December 25, 2005, for details.)&lt;/center&gt;'''



''So, how could the details of this religion be determined, or better, where would the tenets of this religion be found?  Clearly, the best fit would be characteristics of this religion that would most resemble the actual reality for humans, and that leaves the question of whether or not a significant amount of this actual reality, outside of the obvious aspects that all can see, can be identified.
One writer suggests that evidence for that reality of mankind that seems to be most consistent and arguably logical is the information that has been derived from what is now known as the near death experience, or NDE.  Since a Gallup Poll found that about 3% of Americans were determined to have had an experience that could be classified as an NDE, and subsequent studies from other parts of the world have supported this possibly surprising percentage, what is left to determine is whether the depth and consistency of the accounts of these NDE's seem sufficient to build a a working hypothesis from which a kind of trustworthy religion or philosophy can be built.
It occurred to this same writer that such information could possibly influence peoples and cultures of the world that have religious tenets that are not in harmony with the peaceful expression of social behavior, possibly even influential enough to reduce terrorism, crime, and even more mild antisocial behaviors.  To that end, the following proposal was written to determine the amount of interest and the realistic chances for success that could accrue.
PROPOSAL:
The following comprises notes intended for personal use in discussing the concept of using NDE information to foster positive intercultural relations among the various religious communities and create a means of approaching religious-terrorist factions with NDE information drawn from significant numbers of experiencers within their own broader-religions communities.

I assert that the use of Near Death Experience information can achieve an understanding between all, but especially the Muslim and Christian communities due to its inherently unifying influence as a spiritual experience that is similar for people of all cultures and all religions.  The result of such experiences is awareness of the human family and the artificial divisions that are imposed upon it.  Experiencers can be said to learn ‘whom they are’ in the &quot;real reality&quot;, or what many may take to be the apparent &quot;real plan of God&quot;.

Sufficient numbers of experiencers from the world’s major religions testifying to these truths and communicating them to others within their own communities could prove a substantial means for dissolving intercultural barriers.  These experiencers from the various religious communities would likely be willing to join together as a linking network for interfaith communication and ecumenism.
 
Reasons for considering this idea as a counter to terrorism:
Terrorism is greatly affecting society by (1) harming the world economy and depleting global financial resources, (2) increasing the gulf between various cultures and religions, and (3) reducing public safety resulting in ever-increasing limitations on personal freedom.

Causes of terrorism apparently include, (among others):
1.	Anger toward countries perceived as allies of enemies
2.	Anger toward countries perceived as natural-resource thieves
3.	Religious ignorance, especially within factions devoted to eliminating infidels out of (1) a sense of duty, and/or (2) belief that such acts constitute a pathway to heaven

The Hypothesis:
Terrorism can be reduced by educating perpetrators with facts ‘proving’ their error.
The best source of such evidence is those followers of Islam that have had verifiable near death experiences (such as the well-known blind experiencers verifiably “seeing” despite their physical limitations) since polls indicate that near death experiencers (NDEers) almost universally adopt the following beliefs:
a.	A spiritual force (God) exists and cares equally for human of both sexes, all races, and all nationalities, and
b.	Religion should foster caring and respectful human relationships that are not divisive or harmful

Method of testing the hypothesis:
Re-educate religion-driven fanatics using these steps:
•	Acquire and package this compelling “evidence”; include scientific reports and peoples’ proofs for the validity of their experiences
•	Communicate this packaged evidence to the centers that teach fanaticism and cross-cultural hatred
•	Continue this process with ever-new sources of this evidence

Possible steps to achieve these ends:
1.	Poll religious gatherings to identify experiencers and request participation in a research study.
2.	Convene an assembly of the experiencers to verify the universality of their experiences.
3.	If substantiated, publicize the findings using groups of credible representatives from each religion with the goal of defusing aggressive intentions and hostile attitudes within their worldwide affiliates.
4.	Appeal to additional researchers to participate in validating these experiences and their implications, assemble the evidence, and work toward its dissemination and achievement of this goal.
5.	Package the evidence at appropriate stages and disseminate the results to news media.
6.	Expand the program with continued studies and regularly communicate the project’s accomplishments through the media.
 
A Note about this proposal:
To many people, this idea may seem absurd.  One can counter that by asserting that there seems to be no better solution to the problem caused by modern terrorism.  With inherent ramifications for religious beliefs some might judge this to be too delicate, while others might dismiss it as a ‘long-shot’ and not worth a trial.  But, it could be argued, what is there to lose by its trial?  The concept behind this proposal is simple: No matter whether one believes there is validity in accounts of near death experiencers, learning about this evidence could cause many terrorists to reevaluate their roles in ‘the big-picture’.

Worth mentioning are other possible benefits from publicizing these facts since they are philosophically challenging to all humans.  Such benefits could include an improvement in the world’s economy, increase in worldwide spiritual consciousness, and a decrease in crime (just to name a few; others exist, but they are beyond the scope of this proposal).

Please note that the evidence of NDE verification is voluminous.  One sample is in an article from The Lancet; (http://www.zarqon.co.uk/Lancet.pdf).  Others are available from the International Association for Near Death Studies, (http://www.IANDS.org).  Accounts of well-known experiencers are also found in the press.  Examples include those for Senator Bob Kerrey and King Hussein (found in Vanity Fair, Jan. 1992 page 98, Bob Kerrey’s Odyssey by Peter J. Boyer, and, The New York Times, Apr. 22, 1984, Section 6, page 24, King Hussein’s Delicate Balance, by Judith Miller, Cairo bureau chief, respectively).

Several well-known NDE researchers would certainly be available for consultation.  People agreeing that such a proposal could be attempted and that the degree of success could at least be meaningful, could contact this writer at eriess@cinci.rr.com.

== puzzle bits ==

I am pleased to find somebody working on a project such as this.
It reminds me of a project I started on belief.net and abandoned due
to overwhelming political noise.

My project was called &quot;puzzle bits&quot;. The primary axioms were these.

1. All of the world religions have been politicized and emptied of useful content. 

2. All of the world religions could in theory support a spiritual
life, but this is generally not the case for any of them.

3. All of the worlds religions have good and bad within them, and it is possible using modern logic and personal experiences to determine
the difference.

4. The truth within any given religion is not exclusive. Gods assorted attempts to relate to human beings were never meant to
exclude as real Gods other assorted attempts to relate to human beings. All of the religions which have exclusionary ethnocentric
predjudice are wrong on that count. All religions were somebodies
attempt to have a spiritual life.

5. The most meaningful task ahead of us then, is to extricate the
good from the bad, in all of the religions of the world, and then
to put the peices of the puzzle that is obviously generated by that process together.

6. This requires us to make a very large database of the beliefs and axioms of the assorted world religions (allready being done for us)
and then to begin sorting the gems from the trash. (Not done yet very well by anybody as far as I have seen.)

7. The nature of God is also revealed in other paradigms aside from religious ones; Quantum Mechanics has now proven the existence of
Information and Consciousness as operational forces in their own right in the universe, for example.

8. God does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, sex,
age, sexual preference, country of residence, or anything else.
God is an equal opportunity God.

9. Spiritual Paradigms that function operate to connect the human animal to altered states of consciousness. The best and most functional reality models in existence for this purpose come to us
from Psychology and Self Hypnosis.

10. Once in an altered state of consciousness, Spiritual life means
connected and relating as well as communicating with the forces of Nature, The web of life, non-local information, The mind of God, The Ashkashic Records, And Angelic Intelligences.

11. The result of Spiritual experiences that are real are opening into greater levels of compassion, love, and stronger senses of moral
and social responsibility.

12. Spiritual Paradigms that are politicized function to limit us from obtaining altered states of consciousness, in order to control
people and thus in order for the &quot;rulers&quot; to stay in power.

13. God promotes A Democratic, Meritocratic, Free Enterprise, Socialist form of government, which is Utopian in nature.

14. God is beyond human conception and thus definition, no archetype,
personification, or characterization will ever be sufficient to define God.

* Hello Prometheuspan:

Sorry for the delay in responding: we have been on vacation.

Some interesting ideas!

But, how do you know that, for instance, your “bits” numbered 8 and 13 are correct?
---------------
I don't try to number the bits, i examine them piecemeal. Its called
axiomatic and syllogistic analysis, and its the labor of applying
conversational logic. Putting the puzzle together happens after.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
--------------

And how do you sort the “gems from the trash”? How do you decide which is which?
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
Cognitive, rational, logical discussion pro and con, each axiom,
its attendant syllogisms, and its history and propaganda attachments.

Hello Prometheuspan:

I asked &quot;how do you sort the “gems from the trash”?&quot; because making any decision requires having a &quot;goal&quot; one seeks. (See the extract from Ch 3 Summary, below.) So, I am asking, &quot;what goal do you seek&quot; when you state, 'this is a gem, but this is trash.' ?
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:34, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
Truth as it is rendered given logical cogency and validity.
Or, a reasonable facsimile thereof.

* [[Thinking And Moral Problems/3. Making Decisions/Summary|Chapter Three. Summary]]

* Before moving to Part Two, it may be helpful to summarize a few of the points that have been made in the past three chapters. The following are important.

*  The universe’s causal construction dictates that inhabitants who think and act rationally have a greater chance of surviving, procreating and succeeding, than those who do not. This, in turn, has favoured the genetic continuation of mutations which help minds to work in this manner.

*  Practical problem solving and decision making entails consulting external environments to find the criteria that acceptable solutions must meet, then consulting the mind’s internal environment to find what personal purpose [i.e., gaol] is sought.

*  Moral problem solving and decision making entails consulting the mind’s own environment to find both the criteria for acceptable solutions, and the purpose being sought. Mental environments are always invented ones (composed, as we saw in Chapter One, Thinking, from linked memories of perceived events, experiences and learnings, all tinged by the choice of words used when envisioning them consciously), and have no reality outside the minds of those who subscribe to them.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:34, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
right, well, thats a good cut and paste. Moral problem solving
is a problematic thing for logic, because many moral issues are not
translatable into logical terms. Still, it can be done, and as soon
as i get around to deciding that wikibooks is ready for it and that
I'm ready for wikibooks, I'll start two different books, one on
Eclectic Integrative Comparative World Religions, and one on Ethics.
I can't do any worse than has allready been done.

It is safe to say however that with enough perspective and actual information, many of these things approach a rational aproximation of
truth value. For instance, assorted justifications for genocide in the Bible are trash. Throwing them out is eventually made easier when
one realizes that most of them were spliced in by the Cathars in the first place. Stoning children is trash. Its safe to say that even the
jews figured that out a long time ago. The list goes on and on. In each case, history, logic, and a lucid mind for unveiling propaganda
are the most important tools.

== NDEs ==

The reason why NDEs aresuch an effective means of telling us about the nature of reality is that once we are dead, we begin to travel up the tree of life. (Qaballah) Visiting the other side gives special
dispensation to understanding what the other side is.

However, I am not sure that NDEs will ever be sufficient for generating a whole religion, for a variety of reasons.

1. NDEs confirm the tiferet problem; People do tend to experience
what they expected to experience as a lens.

2. NDE travelers generally don't make it any higher on the tree than
Tiferet, in fact, most experiences sound like they don't even get
any further than Yesod. 

3. NDE travelers aren't generally motivated to become missionaries
as much as to make changes in their own lives...theres an aspect to
journeys that are inherantly deeply personal in the same sense as say for instance, sex.


For these and other reasons, I think that NDEs will be one of several
invaluable resources, but will not ultimately proove useful outside
of defining the nature of the lower third of the Tree.

:)

er, duh, sorry about the accidental anonymity, i am a TOTAL newbie...

==Developing more content for the book==
The following is some draft writing that can be edited and included in an appropriate spot, or not.

----
There can only be one real universal religion. Well, that is not exactly accurate. Unless the truth is that there is no one truth and that there are multiple truths, but then that would be the ultimate truth. (note) Ultimately there is one truth. There could be no God, in theory. There could be no supreme deity. There could be a supreme deity. This deity could be a male or female in theory, or it could be no gender. The nature of God could be comprehended or it could not be. How could anything be comprehended if there is nothing to comprehend? What if it is all just materialism? What if it is all just atoms and molecules that allow for some people to be deluded that they are perceiving some spiritual feelings? 

How could any person know what they cannot see with their eyes? How could a universal religion be developed if none of this could be seen? What if Buddhism is the one true religion? What if they got ''everything'' right? Then everything else must be wrong.

What if Christianity is the one true religion? Then why develop a new universal religion? 

Yet, within Christianity, there are many different denominations. Which one is &quot;right&quot;? Could they all be right? Could they all be equally true? Could they all be united into one? 

What if the quantum physicists are right? What about the many worlds interpretation? &lt;!--who knows more about this? I imagine there is a bunch of suitable material at Wikipedia, if my memory serves me--&gt;

...

So then what senses could be used to determine what should be included in the one universal religion? Do we not want this religion to correspond with the truth? If it is going to be dogmatic, don't we want this dogma to be right? Must it be dogmatic? 

Perhaps certain principles should be used to determine what is the true religion, and therefore could be applied ''with ease'' universally. 

Hypothetically, what if the followers experienced bliss, well being, and health all the time? This may or may not be realistic. But if this occured, would it be fair to say this is closer to the truth than a religion whose followers and adherents experience constant suffering, pain and misery? 

----
That is that. --[[User:Emesee|Emesee]] ([[User talk:Emesee|talk]]) 00:23, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

note - but then how could it be there there are multiple truths? What are the dynamics of this? 
 more... 
----
Are there certain things that are unknowable? Could it be that the ultimate truth is unknowable? Would that just be something we would have to accept. Or could it be unknowable if it is unknowable? 

People do seem to claim to know. People take an oaths to partake in poverty and abstain from sex. Based on what they think they know, or at least have faith in.

----
Determining - 
Notes . . . to be formulated more clearly later, perhaps...

Religion is not just one thing - belief in a supreme being or obedience to a legal code, rather, it is a culture of many things, particularly preferences and habits that have helped this or that tribe/nation/state to prevail over its neighbours, and thus survive conquest, wars, disease, and famines that afflicted the ancient world.

Religion hitherto has been intricately divisive - 'the good' versus 'the rest' or 'us' versus 'them'. The Universal declaration of Human Rights which was signed in 1948 is close to the ideal of a universal religion, but then too is the idea of democracy, free markets and much else that corrupt governments and dictators abhor. 

The idea of a supreme being or World leader leads to deeply flawed people like Hitler assuming the mantle of ultimate ruler and making poor decisions because they go unchallenged. Before Hitler it was divine rights of kings and much other so-called religious mumbo jumbo that kept despots in power. 

Any modern religion would have to balance personal rights with collective needs, not the aspirations of some latter-day 'God' such as 'democracy', 'free trade', or 'human rights'. Life is a messy business.

Where in Europe people used to live some 40 years or so, most now can expect twice that lifespan. Elsewhere in the world life expectation is actually falling below 40 years. In some countries obesity and eating disorders are as common as famine elsewhere. These are today's survival challenges. No man is an island, complete unto himself...</text>

Comments:
* While this work is probably within policy, I don't think 5 modules of less than 1000 words each consitutes a &quot;Book of the month&quot;. Additionally, this book is in the format of a mini-wikipedia right now, and I don't think that makes it &quot;book worthy&quot; material. 
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, i think it is too premature of a book to vote for Book of the Month. Maybe in a few months, this would be a good book, but currently, I don't see it worth of the title. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
*&quot;Every day is an exercise in tolerance.&quot; I cried when I saw this part of the book. I am sure it will be a great practical and theoretical help for many - it is based on sound humanist principles and very helpful. I would like to see the body part of the book better developed, even though the trauma and depression part is again based on sound principles. I don't know about having people think that trauma and depression are part of growing up... --[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 02:18, 12 January 2006 (UTC).

I would like to see this book finished however, and perhaps it would be better as the collaboration of the month instead. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

There has been an incredible amount of work that has been done on this Wikijunior book over the past month or so, and it has made some huge progress toward being one of the outstanding Wikibooks that we can all be proud of here.  This is certainly as worthy if not more so than many of the previous Wikibooks that have made book of the month recently.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:08, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.

Comments:
There are countless disorganized free and open resources to help study for the USMLEs. So many that only a group of people --working together could integrate them together into one area. With just a little bit more work this could end up as an invaluable resource for everyone in medical school and for everyone interested in medicine. The best thing about the USMLE Step 1 is that it covers every medical disease and problem that effects people. Thus in creating a unified database with all the different free resources, this guide could be used by anyone in the medical field.

Comments:

Medicine is one of the most important subjects of our time, plays a prominent role in all of our lives, and should have a much more comprehensive book than the one currently available.

This book is already very well organized but currently the book and it's various chapters cover a very small percentage of the information that would be found in any standard medical text book.

Expanding this book can be done very easily as there are numerous public domains and other free sources of medical information. With multiple people searching out such domains and free sources that may be freely copied, the content of the book can increase very rapidly.

Comments:

This book is in need of a great deal more work as it fails to cover even a small percentage of the major philosophers, philosophic arguments, or philosophic principles

Awesome idea, but needs more work. I'd like to see this one get more attention though, and hopefully more content as a result.

I think this is general enough that many people could participate.

{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. It's more important to be understood than to be precisely accurate on every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.  Whenever you have to use a word, list it in the glossary of basic terms, and define it.  Either that, or note it needs to be defined in the glossary page.  Giving definitions when such words are used is generally a good idea as well.

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so.  Many sections are in need of cleanup and complete rewrites.

''Tyrannosaurus rex'', or ''T. rex'' for short, was a dinosaur that lived on Earth about 65 to 70 million years ago, during the [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|Cretaceous]] period. ''T. rex'' is one of the largest [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|carnivorous]] (meat-eating) dinosaurs ever discovered.  It is also quite likely the best-known dinosaur of all.

===What was their body shape?===
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
[[Image:Trex skelleton 2.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''T. rex'' skeleton from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]]
''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was up to 13 meters (42 feet) long and 5 meters (16 feet) tall, and weighed 4 to 6 tons (8,820 lb to 13,220 lb) – longer than a bus, and heavier than an elephant.  It had a forward tilt, deep jaws, huge teeth, a long tail, and tiny arms (also known as [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|forelimbs]]). 

''T. rex'''s jaw alone was about 1.3 meters long and had fifty to sixty bone-crunching teeth that were up to 10 centimeters or 6 inches long. Its arms were very stubby, no longer than an average person's. They were very strong, able to lift up to two hundred kilograms, but were not long enough to touch each other! ''T. rex'' stood on two powerful hind legs, each ending with a three-toed foot, resembling a bird's foot, only much larger.

=== What did they eat? ===
[[Image:Palais de la Decouverte Tyrannosaurus rex p1050042.jpg|thumb|right|''T. rex'' skull from the ''Palais de la Découverte'' in Paris]]
''T. rex'' was a very big meat-eating dinosaur, also called a carnivore. It would have been at the top of the food chain. It is known to have fed on other large dinosaurs, such as ''[[../Edmontosaurus/]]'', ''[[../Anatosaurus/]]'', and ''[[../Triceratops/]]'', and probably could have swallowed smaller dinosaurs in a single bite.

One scientist believes that ''T. rex'' was a [[../Glossary of Basic Terms|scavenger]] (an animal that eats already dead animals). He argues that it might not have been fast enough to catch prey. Other scientists believe that ''T. rex'' probably scavenged and hunted, like most living meat-eaters (such as tigers and lions). ''T. rex'' bite marks found on the bones of ''Edmontosaurus'' and ''Triceratops'' that have healed show that ''Tyrannosaurus'' did hunt at least some of the time – and also that its prey was sometimes lucky enough to escape.

One thing that ''T. rex'' did not eat was people.  People didn't appear on Earth until over 60 million years later, much too late for anyone ever to be afraid of being hunted down by a ''T. rex''.


=== When did they live? ===
''Tyrannosaurus'' lived about 65 to 70 million years ago, in the late Cretaceous Period.  ''T. rex'' was among the last of the big dinosaurs. Like all non-bird dinosaurs, ''T. rex'' lived in the Mesozoic era.

=== What was their habitat? ===
''Tyrannosaurus'' is believed to have lived in forests, near rivers, and in areas that were open and full of prey.  Mild seasons would have been most favorable to it. ''Tyrannosaurus'' fossils have been found in western North America and possibly Asia.

[[Image:Trex footprint.jpg|left|thumb|160px|''T. rex'' footprint at a museum]]

=== How were they discovered? ===
The famous fossil hunter Barnum Brown found the first ''Tyrannosaurus'' fossil in 1905. ''Tyrannosaurus'' was not the dinosaur's name until 1905, when it was given that name by Henry Fairfield Osborn.  About 3,000 ''Tyrannosaurus'' fossils have been found, from pieces of teeth to nearly complete skeletons. Only one possible ''Tyrannosaurus'' footprint has been found.

=== What do we need to learn? ===
*The color of their skin. One thing we cannot tell from fossils is color!
*Whether ''T. rex'' was feathered, scaly, or both. Some of its cousins had feathers like birds, while others had scales.
*Whether ''T. rex'' was just a scavenger or a scavenger and a hunter. There are very few hunting animals that will not scavenge, and very few scavengers which never hunt.
*If ''T. rex'' had the ability to run.
*Was it really the largest [[../Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|predator]]?  In 1995, parts of a predator that seems even larger than ''T. rex'' were found in Argentina!  It was called ''Giganotosaurus'' and was about 45 ft long (about a meter [yard] longer than ''T. rex''). Since then, parts of even larger carnivorous dinosaurs, such as ''Spinosaurus'' and ''[[w:Carcharodontosaurus|Carcharodontosaurus]]'', have been found.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: there are some simplifications in the explanations below.  Don't take anything too literally.''

Most programming languages have the concept of a ''statement''.  A statement is a command that the programmer gives to the computer.  For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 WriteLn('Hi there!');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This command has a verb (&quot;WriteLn&quot;) and other details (what to print).  In this case, the command &lt;code&gt;&quot;WriteLn&quot;&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;show on the screen,&quot; not &quot;print on the printer.&quot;  The programmer either gives the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program), or creates a text file with the command in it.  You could create a file called &quot;hi.txt&quot;, put the above command in it, and give the file to the computer.

If you have more than one command in the file, each will be performed in order, top to bottom.  So the file could contain:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 WriteLn('Hi there!');
 WriteLn('Strange things are afoot...');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The computer will perform each of these commands sequentially.  It's invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming.  Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot;  If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect code.  Stop and check the manual for the programming language you're using.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it's a &lt;code&gt;WriteLn&lt;/code&gt; statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen.  It'll look like this:

 Hi there!

Note that the quotation marks aren't there.  Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose.  The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

 Hi there!
 Strange things are afoot...

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used. For example, there could be a &lt;code&gt;beep&lt;/code&gt; statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language.  These differences are fairly superficial.  The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's ''syntax''.  The set of verbs is called its ''library''.

== Overview ==

'''''Marvolo Gaunt''''', patriarch of the remnants of the once-proud [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/House of Gaunt|House of Gaunt]], is a descendant of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], and grandfather of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom's]] memory, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 13|replayed by the diary]], the sixteen year old Tom Marvolo Riddle reveals to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Armando Dippet|Professor Dippet]] (who was headmaster at the time) that he was named Tom after his father and Marvolo after his grandfather. (Tom did not write his full name in the diary, apparently only marking it with &quot;T. M. Riddle&quot;.)

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Marvolo is first seen when appears to restrain his son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]], who has just assaulted a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]]. He is described as being oddly proportioned, with wide shoulders and overlong arms.

When Ogden explains that Morfin is being summoned to a hearing for having Jinxed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], Marvolo seems unconcerned; after all, it was only a Muggle, so no harm done. When told that Morfin has broken Wizarding law, he shows Ogden the ancestral ring of the Peverells, and the locket of Salazar Slytherin, as proof he can trace his ancestry back to the earliest and purest Wizarding families. Ogden's protests that blood does not outweigh law fall on deaf ears. Meanwhile, Marvolo is bullying his daughter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope]], becoming enraged when it appears she fancies a Muggle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]], the same one Morfin Jinxed. Marvolo attacks Merope; Ogden defends her, but has to flee Morfin.

When the Ministry return to arrest Morfin, Marvolo resists, and is arrested, tried, and sentenced to six months in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. When he returns from prison, he finds his daughter has run off with the Muggle; he never again speaks her name, and dies before Morfin gets out of prison.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Marvolo is menacing to strangers, and never wants to associate with others in his area. He is even cruel to his family, particularly his daughter Merope, whom he berates because of her comparatively weak magical talent. He barely even talks to his son Morfin; the thing he values the most, above his children, are the family heirlooms. He is full of immense pride for his heritage as a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, and because of this, holds himself in high regard, even though he and his family are impoverished.

The Gaunt family represent the worst aspects of Wizard Pride and pure-blood mania.  Although descended from Salazar Slytherin, generations of in-breeding, bigotry, laziness and feelings of superiority have ruined the Slytherin line.  Their wealth had been squandered generations ago and the Gaunts now live in isolated squalor, hating everyone who are not pure-blood wizards.  Marvolo considers himself a wizarding aristocrat, but in fact is a violent, bad tempered, ignorant tramp.  Marvolo is a useless man with no ambitions, no respect for others (including his own children) and no social consciousness. 

The folly of both pure-blood pride and &quot;Wizards First&quot; arrogance is a recurring theme throughout the series.  The Gaunts and their last descendant, Voldemort, represent the dangers (and foolishness) of racial superiority, intolerance and aristocratic entitlement that is still widespread in the Real World.

== Overview ==

'''''Morfin Gaunt''''', one of the last heirs of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/House of Gaunt|house of Gaunt]], is the son of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] and uncle of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. He is rather stunningly deformed and appears to have some mental problems, possibly due to excessive inbreeding, and shares the Gaunt belief in entitlement through ancestry.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Morfin enters our story by swinging down out of a tree and telling a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], that he is not welcome. Ogden does not understand, as Morfin has chosen to speak in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. He is described as having hair so thickly matted with dirt that it could be any color, very few teeth, and small, dark eyes that pointed in different directions. When Ogden says he has business with the Gaunts, Morfin assaults him magically. His father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]], then steps out of the shack and orders Morfin to go indoors.

Inside, Morfin initially takes little part in the proceedings, spending his time playing with and talking to a snake that he is holding. When Ogden explains that Morfin is being summoned to a hearing for having Jinxed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], Marvolo seems unconcerned; after all, it was only a Muggle, so no harm done. When told that Morfin has broken Wizarding law, Marvolo falls back on the pride of his ancestry. Their discussion is interrupted by the sound of horses approaching; it turns out that one of the horses is ridden by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]], the Muggle that Morfin had jinxed when he found out that his sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope]] was sweet on him, leaning out the window hoping for a glimpse of him. This revelation sparks an angry outburst from Marvolo, who attacks Merope; Ogden leaps to her defence but then has to run from Morfin.

When Ministry wizards return to arrest Morfin, he resists, and is arrested both for the use of magic on a Muggle, and for resisting Ministry wizards, tried, and sentenced to three years in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. When he returns from prison, he finds the house empty; Merope had run off with her Muggle and subsequently died in London, and Marvolo had died shortly after leaving Azkaban.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], Merope's son by Tom Riddle, visits the shack some twelve years later. Morfin initially thinks he is the Muggle Tom Riddle. Tom gets details of the family history from Morfin, then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] him, steals the ring of the Peverells, which had been one of Marvolo's prized possessions, and uses Morfin's wand to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|murder]] the muggle Tom Riddle, his father. He then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|modifies Morfin's memory]] so he remembers actually killing Tom Riddle. Morfin was sent to Azkaban for the murder of the Riddles and died there shortly afterwards.

== Strengths ==

Despite his mental instability, Morfin seems to be reasonably skilled with jinxes and hexes.

== Weaknesses ==

Morfin is not a stable person; apparently as a result of in-breeding, he does not have the mental capacity to manage leading a normal life, and spends it all nailing snakes to his door and wallowing in his hatred for Muggles (non-magical people). He does assist his father in his on-going abuse of his sister Merope.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Morfin Gaunt is here depicted in such a way as to make explicit one of the major problems with the &quot;blood purity&quot; argument: limiting the gene pool causes reinforcement of unhealthy genetic traits. We gather that Morfin is not intelligent, though he may be sly. There is a real deficiency in his interactions with others, though we can't tell whether that is innate, or whether it is a natural result of his not being allowed to form any sort of relationship with a &quot;mudblood&quot; non-wizard. The lack of understanding of the way the broader world works is likely also due to the forced isolation of the family. The author has managed to suggest also that Morfin may be on the autism spectrum, with his refusal to speak in anything other than Parseltongue and his playing with snakes while visitors are present. Handled differently, this episode could have suggested disdain alone for the outside world, but as it is written it suggests also some sort of mental issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Making sense of the results is crucial. The first test is that your results give you the information you need to analyse the client problem.

Then you need to play with the model to test the effect of different inputs, to get a feel for the sensitivity to change. Ideally, you want results which are robust (i.e. they are not too sensitive to your inputs).

== Testing the effect of uncertainty ==

All financial modelling is uncertain, because we can’t predict the future, and things may not go according to our assumptions. 

The power of models is that they are dynamic (this was seen as a key advantage of the first spreadsheet, Visicalc). You can change an assumption and see the effect immediately.

Read this paper[http://www.actuaries.asn.au/PublicSite/%20pdf/fsfpaper2004-jasminandlee.pdf] on project financing, especially section 3.2, for more on sensitivity testing.

== Base case ==

You will usually start with a “base case” set of assumptions and inputs. These are your best estimates, and you would use these to produce a set of expected results. 

== Scenario testing ==

It is common to set up alternative scenarios, e.g. pessimistic, expected and optimistic, and run them through a model. Each scenario will consist of a set of assumptions and inputs chosen by the user. Importantly, the assumptions need to be consistent, so for example, if you assume inflation is only 2%, salary growth is likely to be low as well.

[[Image:Tbl1.GIF]]

This approach is very useful for business planning and risk management, because it shows the impact of different conditions. 

Scenario testing is quick and it is easy to present the results to management, to show them best &amp; worst case extremes. On the other hand, it can’t tell you how likely it is that each scenario will occur, or whether there are other important scenarios that need to be tested. You are relying entirely on the skill and experience of whoever sets up the scenarios, and hoping they thought of everything.

To summarise, this approach 
* lets us see the effect of a worst case and best case alternative to our expected result, 
* is simple to set up in a spreadsheet, &amp;
* makes it simple to present alternatives to clients.

The weakness is that
* you don’t know how likely each scenario is,
* you can’t give an estimate of the average result, taking into account the full range of alternatives, and
* you can’t estimate the range of likely results or produce percentiles.

''Note: Excel has a “scenarios” feature which lets you store values for a number of inputs under a scenario name. The problem is that the scenario details are hidden. It is better to set up all the scenarios in a table (like the example above) so they can be compared easily.'

== Stress testing ==

Stress testing is linked to scenario testing. Suppose you have built a model of an insurer’s financial position into the future.  You would “stress test” the insurer by setting up various catastrophe scenarios and then modelling the financial position in each case. Ideally, the insurer will survive each one.

Stress tests can be based on actual past events, or on imagined events.

Like stochastic testing (below), it can be difficult to set the assumptions, as this extract of a US report on one of their housing agencies shows: 
''With basic model development complete, we are now well into sensitivity testing; that is, running complete sets of actual Enterprise data through the model to evaluate the appropriateness of various &quot;settings&quot; of its components for the stress test.'' 
''
For example, we must determine the appropriate specification governing the shape of the Treasury yield curve, the relationship between Treasury rates and Enterprise borrowing rates, and the relationship between house prices and interest rates. These full-fledged simulation runs help us evaluate stress test options, and also provide the additional benefit of helping to identify possible model anomalies or program bugs that we need to address.'' 

''This is standard in a model development project of this type.''

== Sensitivity testing ==

A model can also be used to show the impact of changing one assumption, or perhaps a few linked assumptions. This sensitivity testing can show which inputs have the greatest effect on results.

[[Image:Tbl2.gif]]

Sensitivity testing can also test if the model is realistic, because users will generally have some idea of what to expect when they make a change.

Sensitivity testing can also help show whether a model is accurate enough. Suppose, for example, a company has a budget model, and it needs a model to be accurate to within $2 million. Sensitivity testing might show that the assumption with most impact is the investment rate, and that a change of just 0.5% in that rate has an impact of $2 million. This means that the user has to choose an investment assumption that is no more than 0.5% different from the actual rate (which we don’t know yet, because it is in the future). If the user can’t be sure of being this accurate, then the model can’t deliver the accuracy that the company wants.

Sensitivity testing is a powerful way of spotlighting parts of the model. It deepens your understanding of how the model reacts to change, and you should use it to gain familiarity with new models that you have not worked with before.

Sensitivity testing has its limitations. You have to be careful how much you change each assumption, and how you compare the sensitivity of one assumption against that of another.

Because it focuses on changing one (or maybe a few) elements at once, to see the effect, you can’t get a feeling for worst or best cases, nor for the probability of good or bad results. So it should be used together with other tests, and not on its own.

== Probabilistic stochastic testing ==

Stochastic testing uses random numbers to simulate a large number of alternative scenarios that might happen in real life. We can then calculate percentiles to get some idea of the probability of different financial outcomes.

Example: an actuary wants to assess the likelihood that a fund will be insolvent in the future because of poor investment returns. She uses an investment model to produce (say) 1,000 separate sets of simulated investment returns, which might look something like this….

 [[Image:Tbl3.GIF]]

Each set of rates is put into the model, so there will be 1,000 sets of results. These can be sorted to find (say) the 10% and 90% percentiles, which gives the actuary a feel for how well – or badly – things could go in future.
 
Stochastic testing has the great benefit that it gives you a much better feel for the possible range of experience, either high or low.

Unfortunately, it is also the most complex to build, and it requires more complex assumptions, e.g. a statistical distribution for interest rates, and another for salary growth – and you have to consider whether there is a correlation between them that needs to be accounted for, so perhaps the distributions are connected.

It is very difficult to build a stochastic model of investment markets because of all these issues. It is much easier to model mortality stochastically.

== Stochastic testing as a search tool ==

There is another way to use stochastic testing in your analysis. If you have a number of inputs, and each of them can vary in a range, then that is a very large number of combinations of inputs that may need to be tested in case they are important.

A simple way of approximating this is to create a large number of sets of inputs stochastically, i.e. choose each input randomly within the range you have set for it.

Below is an example….

[[Image:Tbl4.GIF]]

etc.

Each of these sets can be run through the model, and the results sorted to see if there is any pattern, e.g. what inputs always give a high result, for example?

This is a quick and dirty way of trying most combinations of inputs.

== Dynamic analysis ==

Some models need to include a feedback loop because the assumptions and inputs would not stay fixed over time, in the real world.

For example, if you are modelling a pension fund, and the assets fall below liabilities, the employer would most probably make extra payments to remove the shortfall. Your model may need to allow for this by including an algorithm that models the employer response to the financial position.

If you are modelling a banking nor financing institution and , somehow debit transactions sums up to be more than credit transactions , than we do need have to loop around  to read the transactions again.

'''Steamed Pork With Mustard Greens''' (梅菜扣肉, pinyin: Méicàikòuròu) or '''Mei Cai Kou Rou''' is a Chinese dish from the Hakka people. It is very popular and tasty but contains a lot of saturated fat.

==Ingredients==
* About 10.5 ounces [[Cookbook:Mustard Greens|mustard greens]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:cornstarch|cornstarch]] combined with 1 teaspoon cold water
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 2 teaspoons light [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1 teaspoon rice wine or water
* 3/4 pound [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] tenderloin
* 2 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 Tablespoons black bean and garlic sauce
* About 2 tablespoons water
* Freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Wash greens and discard tough stems. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add greens and time 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Drain again, then cut greens into long diagonal strips.
# In a medium bowl, combine cornstarch and water. Stir in sugar, soy sauce and rice wine. Cut pork into thin slices and add to the mixture. Marinate about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
# Heat oil in a preheated wok or large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add black bean sauce and stir-fry 1 minute, then add pork and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add mustard greens and water. Mix well and simmer gently about 4 to 5 minutes, until pork is cooked through and greens are tender. Season with pepper and serve.

''Pukul berapa?'' -What time is it? (formal)

''Jam berapa?'' - What time is it? (informal)

''Tepat waktu'' - on time.

Indonesia uses 24-hour time format, so use ''pukul 20'' instead of 8 pm.
Because Indonesia is so large there are three time zones: West: Sumatra, Java and surroundings (''Waktu Indonesia Barat'' &lt;''WIB''&gt;); Central: Bali and surroundings (''Waktu Indonesia Tengah''&lt;''WIT''&gt;); and East: Papua and surroundings (''Waktu Indonesia Timur'' &lt;''WITA''&gt;). Each zone differs from the next by 1 hour. In spoken indonesian, 12 hour format is prefer to use and adding the time indicator after it.

{| class=wikitable
|-
! ''Kata'' (Word)
! ''Arti'' (Meaning)
! ''Waktu / Kondisi''
(Time / Condition)
|-
| Pagi || morning
| Sun is already risen, but before 10am.
|-
| Siang || noon || Around noon. Usually 10am-2pm.
|-
| Sore || afternoon || Sun is still up, but after 2pm.
|-
| Malam || night || Sun must have set.
|-
| Dini hari || midnight
| Rare to use, usually occur in movie or TV schedule
|-
| Subuh || dawn
| around 3-5 am. Rare, usually to express &quot;it is too early&quot;
|}

Examples:

6.00 am = 6:00 pagi

11.00 am = 11:00 siang

6.00 pm = 6:00 sore

11.00 pm = 11:00 malam

'&quot;Jam&quot;'' ('&quot;lit. clock&quot;'') or ''&quot;at time&quot;'', often added before the time (e.g &quot;pukul 6 pagi&quot; means at 6 am)
In written Indonesian, the 24-hour format is used.

==Minutes==

To say minute. first, you say ''&quot;the hours&quot;'' then ''&quot;kurang/lebih&quot;'' (lit. less/more) then ''&quot;the minutes&quot;''.
examples:

6.11 = enam ''lebih'' sebelas (lit. six more eleven &lt;minutes&gt;)

11.54 = duabelas ''kurang'' enam (lit. twelve less six &lt;minutes&gt;)

use only if the minutes not more or less than 15 minutes, see below.

use the word ''&quot;setengah&quot;'' to say half-hour

examples:

6.30 = setengah tujuh (lit. half seven)

11.30 = setengah dua belas (lit. half twelve)

2.31 = setengah tiga lebih satu (lit. half three more one &lt;minute&gt;)

4.25 = setengah lima kurang lima (lit. half five less five &lt;minutes&gt;)

6.16 = setengah tujuh kurang empat belas (lit. half seven less fourteen &lt;minutes&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note: Some values in the table are given in forms that include a radical in the denominator — this is done both to simplify recognition of reciprocal pairs and because the form given in the table is simpler in some sense. Note also that all absolute values of trigonometric functions for remarkable points that are listed in this table are contained in the first quadrant (from 0 to 90° or &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; radians, inclusive); all others are deduced by simple symmetries with the horizontal or vertical axis, or by swapping axes (on the trigonometric circle) so that one trigonometric function is also swapped with its co-function.

Notice that for certain values of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions are undefined. This is because these functions are defined as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac1{\cos x}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac1{\sin x}\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Since an expression is undefined if it contains division by zero, the functions are therefore undefined at angle measures where the denominator (the sine or cosine of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the trigonometric function) is equal to zero. For example, the tangent function for 90º (&lt;math&gt;\pi/2\,&lt;/math&gt; radians) is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin(\pi/2)}{\cos(\pi/2)}\,&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\frac10\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is an undefined value.

Dinosaur extinction was a consequence of the KT mass extinction event - surely they can be dealt with in the same article? [[User:Weebs|Weebs]] 11:40, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'm just trying to get something going for now.  Yes, they can be dealt with in the same article.  '''Nothing is sacred''' at this stage right now.  All that has happened is that a new Wikijunior book has been started with basically some of the ideas that were expressed in the proposal.  What we really need to do is to set up a '''''model article''''' that would set the tone for the rest of this book.  Now that Wikijunior is fairly well established, this isn't as critical, but it would still be useful in general.  I started the T-Rex article just to get something going at all, but are there any other ideas on where to start?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:11, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
::Hi, Mr Horning. Would you please check the K-T event and the extinction articles for me, please? I have put in all the simple facts which I know about them, having read about them in Wikipedia proper. What about other sources we can use about these events? I think we need to explain the general concept of extinction (and especially that the K-T event was not first nor worst) and then this specific one how it fits into all extinctions and geological history of the Earth. --[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 08:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC).

== Title page + Shooting for completion ==

1. I would like to creat a title page and move everything currently on at the front to a table of contents or something like that.  I really think that would make the book appear more professional.  Just a thought, if anyone has any comments or doesn't like this idea, please say so.  If a resonable period of time goes by however, say a week, and no one objects I will create the table of contents and move it.  

2. I want to shoot for completion of this book by the end of March.  I realize what strain that will cause, and in fact it may not get done by that date.  I just realize the quality of other Wikijunior books should not be insulted by having a perpetually unfinished book in their number.

: Would that be March 2006?! :-) I'm going to change your old discussion heading from the vague &quot;Ideas&quot; to something more descriptive.
: The entry page here does need some attention I agree. Currently there's a heading &quot;Main Articles&quot; here. Should that say &quot;contents&quot;?  I don't know what the standard format is. I'm not sure if it needs to be on a separate page from the title page, but certainly this entry page should be spruced up a bit. The main thing is... there should be a picture of a dinosaur on it! (and ideally it should be a picture which makes kids go &quot;woah! Cool!&quot;)
: -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Harry Wood|contribs]]) 17:34, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

:: {{ping|Harry Wood}} Several Wikijunior books divide up their pages into several types; here atm it's &quot;main&quot; and &quot;other&quot;.  The arrangement doesn't seem very clear to me; imho we should at least look for different names for those two groups of pages.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:35, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

== Spelling Errors ==
We really need someone to check the spelling. I can understand that it is a bit frustrating to be criticized for the work you all have done so far, but we need a full-time spelling-checker sort of person. Unfortunately, I don't really spend much time on Wikibooks, so I'm not the ideal person we're looking for, but I'm just making a suggestion.
--[[User:69.22.41.140|69.22.41.140]] 22:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
:Agreed, I'm doing what I can, but there is only so much I can do.  Any help is as always greatly apreciated. If anyone out there would be willing to shift through the written work and check spelling, Bless you, and may the power of the edit keep you. [[User:pampaeditor|Pampaeditor]]


== Thoughts from a mother with two young children ==

I am unsure what age you are writing for - my kids love pictures - suggest more pictures and simple words if you are aiming for children who are much younger.

:As far as I recall the Beck Foundation's grant (i.e. to get these books printed) was for ages 8-12, so that is the age bracket we are exclusively aiming to write within. Certainly more pictures will be added as time goes by, but the problem is finding ones released under a free license... [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
:: Have any books been published under that grant yet? [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]

These pages seem to be pitched at a lower age range than 8-12, I'd say this was more 5-8. [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] 19:55, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Format ==
The When did they live/What did they eat/What more do we need to learn/etc. is a good starting point, but combined with the fact that extraordinary depth in some of these areas is inappropriate for younger audiences, it makes for a very stilted text.  For example, on the T. Rex page, the When did they live category contains only one sentence (and should not contain much more than that considering the targeted reader).  However, this fact could much more easily be included in the introduction or as an aside in any of the other sections.  The present structure is a good reference for measuring how complete a topic is from a contributing standpoint, but will result in a very dull read for a child.  The text should be more narrative, incorporating all of the relevant information in a more liquid manner.  The current format might better serve as a fact box to the side of the text for readers who already understand some of the general concepts and are simply referring back for information for a school project or personal interest. [[User:N Vale|N Vale]] 19:40, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:When people were voting on this as the collaboration of the quarter for Wikijunior, I wish they would have refined this part of the proposal as well.  I agree that the basic questions are not well thought out, but it is a starting point.  One of the things to point out is that a considerable amount of creative licensing has gone into what Dinosaurs have done in the past, especially in movies like ''Jurassic Park'' or ''The Land Before Time''.  Unfortunately Wikijunior has to stick to the facts and not dive too much into this speculation even though it makes for some really cool fiction.  Some guesses based on if the dinosaurs have molars or canine teeth can indicate a sort of diet, as well as the size of the bones and some physical similarities to current animals that may have lived in a similar sort of habitat.  Plants are also sometimes fossilized in the same strata as the dinosaur remains, so some additional information about the sort of climate the animal lived in might be inferred as well.

:I've seen some cool dinosaur books, so I guess that really needs to be the starting point on where to go with this project:  Compare and synthesize from some of the better dinosaur references books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:20, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

==Images for Wikijunior Dinosaurs==
Thanks to [[User:Danny|Danny]], we now have illustrations for this module. Danny put me in contact with his friend Demitrios Vidal, a great illustrator who is also quite knowledgable about dinosaurs. He is willing to let us use his artwork (found [http://dino.lm.com/artists/display.php?name=DemetriosMVital here]. He is also willing to create new artwork, and to contribute the projct as well! If you have any suggestions as to what drawings you'd like to see in Dinosaurs, please post them here.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 21:27, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is an outstanding development.  As you can't simply go and take some random photographs of these critters except in a museum (with all of the museum copyright headaches that seem real silly), and even that is mainly bones, this is a wonderful opportunity.  Thanks for trying to get content of this nature, and I hope that you put it into Wikicommons in a Dinosaur category as well.  I would like to see some sort of e-mail or some other note to say where the copyright permission was granted, but that is trivial in comparison.&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you need help moving the content over, drop me a note on my user talk page.  With 2300 high resolution images, it is going to be a huge task to move that sheer quantity of content over.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:55, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

:Wow. Just... wow. As for what I'd like to see, hm, well we do need to think about the cover. Maybe with like it divided into four sections with each quarter showing that era's dinosaurs (rather than them all being in the same scene, which wouldn't be very accurate). Changing plant life etc. could also be depicted. Also it would be nice if something matching could be made for the back cover, so the book is simply crawling with dinosaurs, rather than having a basically blank back page with the mandatory sales blurb. Or perhaps the four scenes could be on the whole cover, so when you fold the book open and look at the back you see one teeming mass. Yeah, as a child I thought books made like that were cool. If this isn't clear enough I can always bung together something in Paint. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:01, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
::That was 2006. Just noting that today this book still doesn't have a cover image. That certainly leapt out as something missing to me. -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Harry Wood|contribs]]) 17:42, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

While I can appreciate a few week delay in response here, I havn't seen any formal reply about this list of illustrations.  I even went to the website and asked more directly myself if he was willing to release GFDL rights for these images, as the copyright disclaimer on the website is clearly &quot;All rights reserved&quot; and no general license is offered for reproducing the images... even non-commercial use only.  In addition, this seems to be a collection of images from many different contributors, and it doesn't appear as though the site owner is obtaining explicit copyright clearance for these images, but rather assuming copyright permission due to the fact that somebody explictly uploaded the content and gave it to him.

I think for now (unfortunately), we are going to have to consider these images to be under propritary copyright restrictions and illegal for us to use them on this Wikibook.  I hope that content from this website hasn't been used here already.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

==Great place to get factual info from==

== Brontosaurus  rename (?) ==

''Brontosaurus'' is the popular name for ''Apatasaurus'', though technically it is wrong.  Maybe we should rename [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Brontosaurus]] to something like ''Apatasaurus (Brontosaurus)'' &lt;u&gt;or ''Brontosaurus (Apatasaurus)''&lt;/u&gt;.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 04:39, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

:I thought there really was a Brontosaurus, but there were many related species that go under a variety of names and are commonly displayed under the presumed name of Brontosaurus, because of popular movie culture.  This is a subject that I need to do some considerable more research on, and I wouldn't necessarily trust the [[w:Brontosaurus|Wikipedia entry on the topic either]] but it does have some good points.  If you read http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-class/bronto/ (''Why is Brontosaurus now called Apatosaurus?'') the author of that web page contends that Brontosaurus and Apatasaurus are still used and merely the names of two different species, although very closely related.  The Brontosaurus also suffers from the debunking due to some of the body parts having been either manufactured by the palentologist who discovered a partial skeleton, and mixing up some of the bones that came from other animals.  Given that palentology was still a very new science when the Brontosaurus was discovered, this is a forgivable mistake, but the bones of the traditional Brontosaurus skeleton have been fully identified as well now.  

:This might be a good section to show to kids that scientists don't always get thing right, and can sometimes screw up in a big way that takes decades to correct errors.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:51, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
::Not to mention that many children's books from not all that long ago proudly display amphibious Brachiosaurs... so yes, this would be good to cover. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Collecting References ==

It's probably a good idea to start reference and resource lists on the talk pages so when final cleanup comes around later the lists will be already compiled, and by the original authors.

Ive started lists in

== Animations ==

I found an animated GIF which could work well on the [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Pangea|Pangea]] page: [[w:Image:Pangea_animation_03.gif]].  Are animations such as these acceptable?  Though it does mean that the animation will be on the online version only (for obvious reasons).--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 02:50, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:Since there is considerable discussion about having print versions of this content, you should consider aninimated content carefully.  Still, this is something to look at in terms of improving the look of a page, and I don't see a reason not to include images of this nature.  The big drawback I see is that it seems to take a long time to download, and you have to be very careful about page load times when you have quite a bit of multi-media content.

:Something to consider perhaps for the print version is to &quot;break up&quot; animated sequences like this and simply have a series of thumbnails instead.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:38, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

== Jumping In ==

I have introduced my self over on the T-rex page talk, but wanted to do so here too. As a homeschool mom to 9 and 4 yo boys, I see this project (all of Wikijunior) as having great potential. I have been reading through the discussion pages and it seems that some fresh enthusiasm coul be needed. I am going to do my best to jump right in as an active participant. 

As I also mentioned on the T-rex page, my 9yo son has volunteered to be a test reader. While he is a gifted reader (and gifted child academically in general) he is still good at identifying what will appeal to the average 9yo. I will pass his comments along.

:It would be great if there would be more dinos here.  The current list is not meant to be a definitive restricted list I think, feel free to add to it.  I wrote quite a lot of the current ones, but I personally don't really have the time to do any more right now, and all the other editors seem to have also disappeared from this.  Be aware though that you may stumble upon some problems with the images - when I was writing this half a year ago Wikipedia and Wikicommons had a severe lack of dino images, I had to dig up most of them myself (hopefully the image situation is better now though).--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 01:59, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

Good. But Betasuchus isn't really well-known, is it? And isn't &quot;cynodont&quot; speaking quite broadly? [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 10:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

: My 7 year old knows Betasuchus. (From Walking with Dinosaurs and two kids Dinosaur books.) They can't be that obscure. Cynodont is  quite broad, but I couldn't figure out a better way to talk about the Jurassic pre-mammals. Spinosaurus was the largest carnivorus dinosaur.

Uhh, thee was no Betasuchus in Walking With Dinosaurs. I suppose we could use Thrinaxodon for &quot;cynodont&quot;. I know Sppinosaurus (who doesn't that likes prehistoric animals?). [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 11:07, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

:After looking into it I see Betasuchus is pretty obscure. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 12:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

How 'bout these?
*[[Deinosuchus]]
*[[Troodon]]
[[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 10:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

==Mistakes and also Prehistoric Mammals==
how 'bout a &quot;Mistakes&quot; article? Including &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;the rhinoceros-horned Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Oviraptor the egg thief&quot; and &quot;aquatic sauropods&quot;, among others. [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 14:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

: Sounds like a good idea to me, the current Brontosaurus page lacks content. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 03:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure if prehistoric mammals is a good idea, since this is a book about dinosaurs. They could earn a whole book to themselves, anyway. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 02:20, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

: I think prehistoric mammals should be in a different book. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 03:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

OK. What do you think about the dinosaurs and the &quot;Mistakes&quot; page? [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 09:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

But there are pterosaurs and plesiosaurs here, and they're not dinosaurs either! [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 09:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

Good point, but many people include Pterosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dimetrodon, and even animals such as Sarcosuchus and various other non-dinosaurs for a simple reason, and that is they are reptilian. Maybe it's because a book titled &quot;Prehistoric Non-Dinosaur Reptiles&quot; might not seem as attractive for a kid to read. A mistakes page might be nice, but if they can be dealt with on the corresponding page of the dinosaur in question, it may be unnecessary. I do think we should mention Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon, though. Iguanodon especially as it is one of the oldest species discovered. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 14:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

OK. Anyways, the pterosaurs and plesiosaurs are defined as non-dinosaurs on their own pages. Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon pages have already been made, and I'm thinking about the other diinosaurs I mentioned. [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 13:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== Organization of articles ==

In my opinion, the order of the dinosaurs when in the book should be in order of what time period they lived, and T Rex gets to be last, of course. We can cut out the section about when the dinosaurs lived. My idea is that each page will have a timeline of the Mesozoic Era, with the corresponding time that the dinosaur lived in colored in. The timeline can be on the top or on the bottom of each page, sort of like a header or footer. It would give about the same information in a picture form. 

On the other hand, if we get more in depth, we may be able to group dinosaurs by their type (ex. Duck-Billed Dinosaurs), but at the current state we're not at that point.[[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 14:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

== Use of Dinosaur Images ==

I just got a reply today (October 2nd) from the editor of the Dinosaurcon regarding the use of images in this book from that website (copying the e-mail to here):

I can't speak for all of the images on the Dinosauricon; you'd have to
ask each artist individually. I might be willing to consider releasing
some of mine (http://dino.lm.com/artists/display.php?name=keesey) if
you can tell me which ones you'd want.

Your pages need some cleanup--I did a revision on the _T. rex_ (never
T. Rex or T-Rex) page.

Frankly, I consider this to be good news, and there are some very good images that we can try to use here from this website.  This is an opportunity we should not miss out from.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

== Pterosaurs vs Pterodactyl ==

The article will be very different depending on what we're talking about. The article title is Pterosaurs, but from then on the article talks more about the specific species Pterodactyl and a few other Pterosaurs. We should decide which we are talking about, either change the title and restrict the material or change and broaden all of the material. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 01:58, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, Pterodactyl is like a nickname for Pterodactylus, but pterosaur is flying reptiles in general... [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 10:25, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

:I am not so certain on this, there seems to be a lot of confusing regarding this in the sources that I used.

:I am by no means an expert in this area, but as I understand it &quot;Plesiosaur&quot; is the more general family, while &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; is a more specific reptile in that family.  When I was writing that page I had the general &quot;Plesiosaur&quot; in mind as I remember.  I have replaced &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; with &quot;Plesiosaur&quot;.  The picture on the page is definitely that of a Plesiosaur''us'' specifically.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 07:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

==Images==

Hey, I have come from wikipedia and really like the idea of wikijunior.  I recon, haveing some experience with children, you really need more pictures.

== move protection ==

the page is move-protected, but should now be moved to [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs]] // [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[:meta:user talk:tsca|[re]]] 20:16, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

==Name change required==

In the panel headed &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; on the right-hand side of each article, &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; needs to be changed to &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, i.e. with no initial capital for the specific name. Shouldn't the names of the dinosaurs in that panel be italicized as in the text? [[User:Old Father Time|Old Father Time]] ([[User talk:Old Father Time|talk]]) 22:13, 22 December 2009 (UTC)

:You're right, the School is still in the fase of creation, but you can attend some courses. You can also help us. Maybe you can be the Ritual Magic teacher, I can't find one anywhere, and that's one of the most important subjects. You know, it's about the rituals and spells, how to practically use them.

So... Would you like to attend your first courses now, or would you like to wait for the School to be set up totally. If you want to start with your classes some time soon, let me know which of the optional subjects you would like to study (four of the subjects are [[School of Magic:Required Subjects|required]]). --[[User:Ђорђе Д.

Excellent! I shall just start one or two courses within the School's Ritual Magic section, and you can continue.

To see how to use a wiki, check out the [[Help]] page. When you are writing a message to someone, you can sign yourself automatically by typing four tildes (like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;). That will provide your user name and current time. On the [[Special:Preferences]] page you can set up some relevant things about using the wiki. In the field ''Nickname'', write your signature just like you wrote it on my talk page, and mark the option ''raw signature''. Also, make sure to provide your e-mail address. It is very important because we shall send you tests and diplomas by e-mail. Nobody can see your e-mail address, so do I. When I am e-mailling you, or you're e-mailling me, we can't see each other's addresses. When you write your name for signature and your e-mail address, click on ''Save preferences'' at the bottom of page.

You'll get your first class by the end of this week. I shall inform you in due time and I'll give you the link to the page with your first lesson. Good luck! ;) --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|George D. Bozovic]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Black Dagger. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Black Dagger~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== S-Registers ==

=== S0: Ring to Answer After ===
Defines the number of ring bursts before the modem automatically answers an incoming call. When set to zero, auto-answer is disabled.

=== S1: Ring Count ===
(Read only) Counts the number of ring bursts received. Reset to zero after 8 seconds of no ring.

=== S2: Escape Sequence Character ===
Specifies the ASCII value of the character used in the escape code. (The escape code is the escape character entered three times in succession.) When the modem is in connect state and it receives the escape code, the modem enters command state. Setting register S2 to 128 or above disables the escape code character.

=== S3: Carriage Return Character ===
Specifies the ASCII value of the carriage return (CR) character. The carriage return terminates command lines and result codes.

=== S4: Line Feed Character ===
Specifies the ASCII value for the line feed (LF) character. The line feed character follows a carriage return at the end of long-form result codes. Short-form result codes are sent without line feeds.

=== S5: Backspace Character ===
Specifies the ASCII value for the backspace (BS) character that you can use to edit the command line.

=== S6: Wait Before Blind Dialing ===
Specifies the time the modem waits after going off-hook before it dials. This is a minimum of 2 seconds, even if register S6 is set to a value less than 2. Register S6 is used only when the X0, X1, or X3 command (Extended Result Codes) is set.

=== S7: Wait for Carrier after Dialing ===
Specifies the time that the modem waits for one of the following before hanging up:

•Carrier from the remote modem when this modem is in originate or answer mode

•Ringback, only when this modem is in originate mode, and only if X3 or X4 (Extended Result Codes) is set

Register S7 is linked to register S37 so that the two registers share a single value. Changing the value of S7 changes the value of S37, and changing S37 changes S7.

=== S8: Duration of Delay for Comma Dial Modifier ===
This register contains the pause time of the (,) dial modifier used in the dial string. Consecutive commas will invalidate the modem's approval if the total pause period exceeds 12 seconds.

=== S9: Carrier Detect Response Time ===
This register contains the time period that a received carrier signal must be present for the modem to recognise it and turn on the DCD signal.

=== S10: Delay Between Lost Carrier and Hang Up ===
Specifies the time the modem waits before hanging up after loss of carrier. This waiting period allows the modem to recover from a temporary loss of carrier without breaking the connection. Modems at both ends of the connection should have the same values set. If the S10 values of the two modems are unequal, disconnection occurs when the lower value is reached. When register S10 is set to 255, the modem functions as if carrier were always present; it never hangs up due to loss of carrier. After disconnecting in originate mode, the modem waits a minimum of 5 seconds before going off-hook.

=== S11: DTMF Multi-Frequency Tone Duration ===
This register contains the time period of the duration and inter-digital pause of the DTMF dialling tones.

=== S12: Escape Sequence Guard Time ===
=== S18: Modem Test Timer ===
=== S25: DTR Detection ===
=== S26: RTS to CTS Interval ===

== General ==

=== Prerequisites ===

This page assumes the reader is familiar with the TCP/IP protocol suite and IP communication in general.

=== A Note on Terminology ===

This module uses the normal TCP/IP terminology, where the terms indicate the following:

; TCP : The TCP protocol as such, at the transport layer.
; IP : The IP protocol as such, at the internetworking layer.
; TCP/IP : The complete internet protocol suite, encompassing many more protocols than just TCP or IP.

Also, this module uses the TCP/IP notation of protocol layers, not the OSI model, unless stated otherwise:
 
 +--------------------+
 | Application Layer  |  e.g. SMTP
 +--------------------+
 | Transport Layer    |  e.g. TCP
 +--------------------+
 | Internetwork Layer |  e.g. IP
 +--------------------+
 | Link Layer         |  e.g. SLIP or PPP
 +--------------------+

== The Problem ==
=== General ===
Transmitting IP data over a serial (RS-232) line is haunted by several problems, among them:

# lack of framing
# lack of flow control
# lack of session management

Of which lack of framing is the most serious one. All mentioned problems are explained as it follows.

=== Lack of Framing ===

Different layers have different tasks in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Higher layers expect particular services from their lower layers. One of the services the IP protocol expects from the link layer is the framing, deframing of IP packets. This means, the link layer is, among other tasks, responsible for properly separating each packet and identifying an IP packet's start and end when it moves the packet over some communication link. The link layer is supposed to do this, so when packets are placed in some data stream they can be properly extracted from the stream.

In cases where a 'naked' serial connection is used as the link layer, this creates a problem, because a simple serial connection does not provide any framing facilities. Instead, the data is just a stream. The receiving side would not be able to explicitly identify the start and end of a packet. 

In a 100% reliable serial connection this would be tolerable, because length information in the IP packets could be used to separate packets from the serial data stream. However, a connection is usually not 100% reliable, particularly not if it is in fact done via a modem over a public telephone line. If a packet would be corrupted, partly lost, etc. the receiver would run out of sync, and the transmission completely garbled. In case a broken IP packet could be reliably identified, a higher layer protocol like TCP can handle the problem and initiate a retransmission. Therefore, proper identification, and thus framing/deframing of IP packets is essential.

=== Lack of Flow Control ===

Due to the nature of serial connections it is desirable to exercise flow control over the serial connection hop. However, IP does not provide any facility for controlling the flow on the link layer, and a protocol like TCP uses a much different way for end-to-end flow control, and does not deal with a single hop at all.

=== Lack of Session Management ===

It is typically necessary to do some additional 'housekeeping' when running IP over a serial line, particularly when that serial line is backed up by a modem connection. This includes setting up such a modem connection (dialing into some remote site), and authenticating oneself at that remote site. IP as such does not support these tasks.

== Solutions ==
=== General ===

The solution to the above mentioned problems is to introduce an additional protocol at the link layer. That protocol in fact represents the link layer for the higher layer protocols and uses the serial connection internally.

Two such protocols are in common usage. A very simple one, called SLIP, and a more complex, but much more powerful one, called PPP. New services typically use PPP, while SLIP can still some times be found with older services.

=== SLIP ===

SLIP fixes the most serious problem for sending IP datagrams over a serial line: Lack of framing. Flow control handling is left to the modem transmission protocols and higher layer TCP/IP protocols. Session management is supposed to be handled outside of SLIP, e.g. set up (&quot;dial-in&quot;) of a modem connection is not done by SLIP. SLIP assumes the serial connection has already been established.

SLIP is standardized in RFC 1055, ''A Nonstandard for transmission of IP datagrams over serial lines: SLIP''. The term ''Nonstandard'' in the title is there because of historical reasons. SLIP wasn't even described for a long time, and when it was finally described in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 1055&lt;/nowiki&gt; that description was only intended as an informal summary of the current practice. Only later it was decided to give that RFC the status of an official IETF standard - but one which should not be the first choice - because of SLIP's limitations.

SLIP is so simple, it is almost embarrassing. It requires a serial port configuration of 8 data bits, no parity, and either  hardware flow control, or CLOCAL mode (3-wire null-modem). It defines only four special 8-bit sequences (characters) and little functionality over the standard serial line protocol.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Hex value !! Abbreviation !! Description
|-
| 0xC0 || END || Frame End
|-
| 0xDB || ESC || Frame Escape
|-
| 0xDC || ESC_END || Transposed Frame End
|-
| 0xDD || ESC_ESC || Transposed Frame Escape
|}

When the SLIP driver receives an IP packet from the interworking layer, it simply copies it octet by octet (with a slight exception, see below) and appends an additional octet with the value 0xC0 (hex). This additional octet marks the end of an IP packet, and is therefore called the ''END'' character.

To avoid random line noise being interpreted as the beginning of a packet, it is customary to prepend the ''END'' character to an IP packet if packets are not continuously and with full speed send over the line and transmission is resumed. This way possible random noise is itself framed as a packet, and the higher layers (particularly the IP layer) will discard such 'packets', because they will be identified as illegal (wrong checksum, wrong size, below minimum size).

'''Frames when sending continuous'''
 +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
 | IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| ...
 +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

'''Frames when sending with delay between packages''', prepending additional END characters to exclude line noise
 +-----------------+            +----+-----------------+            +----+-----------------+
 | IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| line noise |&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt; | IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| line noise |&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt; | IP datagram |&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;| ...
 +-----------------+            +----+-----------------+            +----+-----------------+

The &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt; characters marked in red in the above figure are END characters prepended to the IP datagrams which follow them. But they effectively act as end marks for the preceding line noise, separating potential random line noise from real data.

The framing with the 0xC0 ''END'' character creates a slight problem. If the character itself appears in an IP packet, SLIP would wrongly interpret this as the end of the packet. This is fixed by introducing another special character, the ''ESC'' character with the value 0xDB (hex). This is used to build two escape sequences:

; 0xDB 0xDC : Replacement for 0xC0 values within an IP datagram&lt;br&gt;This ensures there will never be an ''END'' character in the transmitted datagram
; 0xDB 0xDD : Replacement for 0xDB values within an IP datagram&lt;br&gt;This is the 'escape of the escape' character.

SLIP inserts these escape sequences into the IP datagrams it receives for transmission from the interworking layer, and it replaces the escape sequences with the original values when forwarding a received datagram to the interworking layer. 

That's all that SLIP does. There is no error detection, compression or device (modem) control. There is also no support for host configuration, security, session management, and other control functions. Therefore SLIP on its own is not satisfactory over an error-prone dial-up connection, although it operates reliably over MNP4 (or higher) error correction modem links.

=== PPP ===
{{sectstub}}

PPP, the ''Point-to-Point Protocol'', provides a standard method for transporting datagrams over point-to-point links, including standard serial lines. The specification of PPP defines the following three main components:
# A method for encapsulating datagrams in PPP frames. It supports IP datagrams as well as datagrams of other networking protocols.
# A Link Control Protocol (LCP). This protocol defines procedures for establishing, configuring, and testing the datalink connection.
# A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.

PPP is a rather complex protocol, consisting of mandatory and optional parts, as well as extensions. A likely incomplete list of PPP-related RFC standards is given below:

* RFC 1661 - The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
* RFC 1332 - The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)
* RFC 1334 - PPP Authentication Protocols
* RFC 1377 - The PPP OSI Network Layer Control Protocol (OSINLCP)
* RFC 1378 - The PPP AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP)
* RFC 1552 - The PPP Interworking Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP)
* RFC 1570 - PPP LCP Extensions
* RFC 1618 - PPP over ISDN
* RFC 1662 - PPP in HDLC-like Framing
* RFC 1962 - The PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)
* RFC 1968 - The PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP)
* RFC 1973 - PPP in Frame Relay
* RFC 1989 - PPP Link Quality Monitoring
* RFC 1990 - The PPP Multilink Protocol (ML)
* RFC 1994 - PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
* RFC 2043 - The PPP SNA Control Protocol (SNACP)
* RFC 2097 - The PPP NetBIOS Frames Control Protocol (NBFCP)
* RFC 2125 - The PPP Bandwith Allocation Protocol (BAP) / The PPP Bandwith Allocation Control Protocol (BACP)
* RFC 2290 - Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option for PPP IPCP
* RFC 2364 - PPP over AAL5
* RFC 2472 - IP Version 6 over PPP
* RFC 2516 - A Method for Transmitting PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)
* RFC 2615 - PPP over SONET / SDH
{{TODO|Somehow mark the RFCs which are relevant for serial line communication. Possibly don't mention the others at all.}}

In short, implementing PPP is not for the faint of heart. It is a serious job, requiring solid programming, protocol and telecommunication knowledge - even if only the parts relevant for serial line communication are taken into account. Programmers wishing to implement PPP should already reserve weeks to study the relevant standards. It is also a good idea to define clear requirements which optional PPP parts need to be implemented. It should also be considered obtaining a compatibility test suite to verify standards compliance of the own implementation. Simple trial-and-error with some existing consumer implementation of the protocol usually doesn't cut it. This can only 'guarantee' to a certain extent  that the PPP implementation is compatible with that particular other implementation in a particular configuration. It does not guarantee that the implementation is compatible with a wide range of existing PPP implementations.

If it is a viable option to buy a PPP implementation for a particular platform instead of doing an own implementation, then that option should seriously be considered.

=== HDLC ===
{{sectstub}}

HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) is another Layer 2 protocol which can be used to carry IP traffic over serial (and other) connections. HDLC predates PPP and is a generic Layer 2 protocol. It can be found in industrial applications and is also popular for serial point-to-point links between [[wikipedia:Router|IP routers]]. It is less common in end-user applications, like dialup connections to an ISP. The [[wikipedia:High-Level Data Link Control|Wikipedia article about HDLC]] provides a good overview about HDLC, and provides references to the relevant standards.

HDLC is mainly concerned with framing, and provides a few additional control messages (''procedures''). It is relatively easy to implement over serial lines.

Umar was appointed not elected/partially democratically.  Abu Bakr appointed him according to my studies in Islamic History and my Islamic studies professors.  If there's a claim made that Umar was not designated then there should be proof shown.
The wikipedia entry on this also supports my position on Umar's designation by Abu Bakr.

'''''Figure 7: A cube primitive has been added to the workspace.'''''


After starting Wings3D you will obtain the Wings3D program window with an empty workspace.
 
Right click anywhere in the empty workspace and the '''Primitives''' context sensitive menu will be displayed.&lt;br&gt;
Move your mouse over the '''Cube''' menu item. It will become highlighted in blue.&lt;br&gt; 
Left click on the word '''Cube''' and a cube primitive will be added to your workspace, so it should then be similar to Fig.7.

Now we'll just try out some of the basic functions to become more familiar with the interface before going on to one of the tutorials that follow.&lt;br&gt;

Remember that switching to vertex, edge, face or body selection mode can be done by either clicking on the appropriate icon on the Icon Bar (the middle four) or by pressing the keyboard hotkeys '''V''', '''E''', '''F''' or '''B'''.&lt;br&gt; 
Right clicking with any element(s) selected will display the appropriate context sensitive menu whereas right clicking with no selection displays the '''Primitives''' menu.&lt;br&gt;
The Space Bar (and clicking on the 2 blank areas between the icons on the icon bar) will deselect everything.

Note that L,M and R on the lower information line refer to the relevant mouse buttons and that keyboard commands are denoted here by having square brackets around them. eg ['''Q'''].&lt;br&gt;
Keyboard commands are NOT case sensitive - when modifiers such as Shift / Alt / Cntrl are required, such info will be explicitly stated.




[[Image:Fig8.gif|none]]
'''''Figure 8: Basic Wings navigation.'''''

Fig.8 - What's happening:

a) We've changed to '''Vertex Selection Mode''', either click on the Vertex Icon or hit '''V'''. You should
now see your vertices at each corner of the cube. Note that the Vertex selection mode icon now has a white frame around it to show that it's the mode in use.
 
b) Wings needs to know what you want to modify - so click on the two upper left vertices and note that they change colour (and size). (Both selected vertex size and the selection colour have been slightly adjusted for reasons of clarity - see Edit | Preferences)&lt;br&gt;
Details of your selection are additionally being displayed, in this case, which verts, the direct distance between them and also the distances between these verts along the x,y,z axes (useful when verts aren't parallel to a main axis).

c) Now right click in workspace. The '''Vertex Operations''' menu is displayed. It presents you with vertex
specific commands only, thus limiting the amount of confusion possible. This context sensitive
method of working is considered one of the strong points of Wings3D and leads to very short
learning curve. Click, or hover, on '''Move'''. Note that a side bar menu of '''Move''' specific options
comes up (Figure 8.d). Click on ''Normal'' and move the mouse around a little to see what happens.
Then move it to the right until the distance moved is 1.0 as indicated on the '''Status Bar''' at the
bottom of the Wings window. Left click to end the '''Move''' command. Your cube should now look
like figure 8.e. Hit the Tab key to see a '''Smooth Shaded''' view of the modified cube (Figure 8.f). Hit
the Tab Key again to go back to '''Shaded Wireframe''' mode.

'''''Figure 9: Working with the Wings interface.'''''


If you did not hit the Space Bar, the two vertices should still be selected. In fact you should have
noticed they were still selected even when we were in '''Smooth Shaded''' mode. So now switch to
'''Edge Selection Mode''' (hit the '''E''' key). Notice that all the edges that were adjacent to the selected
vertices are now automatically selected (Figure 9.a). Because Wings3D uses winged-edge
topology it can keep track of what elements are associated with what. So Wings can carry
forward selections from mode to mode, which can greatly speed up your modeling.

Now right click in the workspace to bring up the '''Edge Operations''' menu (Figure 9.b). Choose
Bevel from the menu and move the mouse to the right until the '''Status Bar''' reads 0.50 then left
click to end the command (Figure 9.c). Note a couple of things here. '''Bevel''' ended and put us into
'''Face Selection Mode''' automatically. See the faces are already highlighted and the active icon is
now the '''Face Icon'''. Wings attempts to end commands by making the elements that it just created
active on the assumption that since you just made them, you will want to do something with them.
Not always true, but it's a pretty valid assumption most of the time and can help speed up your
modeling.


Since we are in '''Face Mode''', lets right click again and bring up the '''Face Operations''' menu (9.d).
'''Extrude Normal''' by 0.25 (Figure 9.e). Now Switch to '''Body Mode''' (hit the '''B''' key or click the Icon).
The whole object becomes highlighted. Right click to bring up the '''Body Operations''' menu and
choose '''Smooth'''. Your object should like like that in Figure 9.f. Hit the Space Bar to deselect it
then hit the Tab Key to see it smoothed. Now hit the U key to watch it rotate (Left click to stop
the rotation). Well, quite by accident we made a fairly reasonable facsimile of a tooth! But the idea
here was not to build a meaningful model, but to get you used to the Wings3D user interface. You
should be fairly comfortable with it now and ready to go on to the Dog House Tutorial.


'''Quick Tip: The Nature of Normals'''
Assuming the reader may be new to 3D modeling as well as to Wings3D, it may be useful to
explain what a normal is and why they are useful in commands such as Move | Normal. Simply
put, a Normal is a vector that extends outward perpendicular to a graphic element. Faces, edges
and vertices all have normals. So, when we move a face along its normal we will move it out along
a line that extends from its center outward, like a flag pole sticking up from the ground.

== &lt;a&gt; = /æ/? ==
The current module says that the letter &lt;a&gt; is pronounced as the &lt;a&gt; in &lt;mat&gt;. I pronounce that &lt;a&gt; as an /æ/. [[:en:Ido]] says /a/. We could remove these comparisons, which become invalid due to the fact that the English language has no standard dialect, and just add IPA, but not everyone understands that. What should be done? [[User:Mga|Mga]] 18:28, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

== &lt;r&gt; issue ==
I'm new to Ido, so I'm probably wrong, but the &quot;r&quot; we're referring to here is not the &quot;r&quot; in &quot;ratón&quot; (which is a &quot;strong&quot; one), but the one in &quot;cara&quot; (face) or &quot;premio&quot; (prize), which is &quot;softer&quot;. At least, from what I understood, this is the case in Esperanto. As a native spanish speaker, I think the sound of &quot;t&quot; when you pronounce &quot;whatever&quot; really fast (American English) is what better resembles this &quot;r&quot;, and would make much more sense to an english speaker. Sorry for my english, by the way.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The General Assembly is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations. It is the only one of these six in which all Member nations are given the opportunity for representation.

=== Purpose and scope ===
The GA serves as a forum where all Member States have a voice since all member states are represented. Member nations can launch initiatives regarding international questions of peace, economic progress, and human rights. The GA can initiate studies; make recommendations; develop and codify international law; promote human rights; and further international economic, social, cultural, and educational programs.

In the event that the Security Council cannot meet, or cannot concur unanimously for a resolution on a specific matter, the GA may have the opportunity to hold special &quot;emergency sessions&quot;. Within the GA, it is ''arguably'' much more feasible to successfully pass a resolution, given that a big five nation (one of the five major Allied victors of World War II) in the SC vetoes a resolution. The GA mandates that all Member nations are offered representation, as opposed to merely 15 total Members in the Security Council. It is important to note, however, that the reason why the Security Council has relatively fewer nations than the GA is so that it can act quickly. Again, the single veto of a big five nation can impede progress.

Resolutions passed in the GA are '''nonbinding''', meaning that the resolutions the GA passes do not need to be followed by nations, as opposed to the Security Council, which passes '''binding''' resolutions, in which nations are required to follow by the terms of SC resolutions if specified to do so.

Veto power is absent within the GA.

=== The 6 Sub-Committees ===
* '''First Committee:''' The First Committee is formally known as the Committee on Disarmament and International Security, sometimes abbreviated as DISEC. The role of First Committee is to discuss threats to international public safety, such as anti-personnel land mines and weapons of mass destruction. The First Committee has discussed nuclear arms/weapons proliferation since the conceiving of the first nuclear weapons in the 1950's by the United States of America. Because the Committee has dealt with nuclear proliferation for such a long time, many people or scholars who study the United Nations generally recognize First Committee as the 'sideline' nuclear proliferation committee within the UN. (The main UN committee that deals with nuclear proliferation is the IAEA, or ''International Atomic Energy Agency'')

* '''Second Committee:''' The Second Committee is formally known as the Economic and Financial Committee . ECOSOC, or ''Economic and Social Council'', deals with similar matters that the Second Committee discusses sometimes.

* '''Third Committee:''' The Third Committee is formally known as the Social, Political, Humanitarian Committee, SOCHUM for short. Some issues of common discussion and debate are religious intolerance in troubled areas around the world, basic human rights violations, and humanitarian violations. Some additional UN organs that usually have more of a part than Third Committee include the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, among others.

* '''Fourth Committee:''' Otherwise known as the Committee for Special Political and Decolonization, or SPECPOL, the Fourth Committee attempts to ameliorate situations in which a territory once occupied through imperialistic forces can enter a state of self-sovereignty.

* '''Fifth Committee:''' The Administrative and Budgetary Committee deals with administration within the UN and finances that the UN finds necessary in order to function.

* '''Sixth Committee:''' Known notoriously as the Legal Committee, Sixth Committee deals with the legal aspect of UN issues. The Legal Committee sometimes refers issues to the ICJ, or International Court of Justice.

=== GA Plenary ===
After a GA sub-committee has met and agrees on a resolution, the sub-committee submits their resolution to the main GA body for a special '''plenary session''', in which all members of the GA are given the opportunity to vote on that sub-committee's resolution.

[[Image:Two prius.jpg|right|thumb|Classic Prius (2000-2003 model) - blue, and a current (2004-2006) Prius - silver.]]
The '''Toyota Prius''' is one of the world's first commercially mass-produced and marketed hybrid automobiles. Manufactured by Toyota, the Prius first went on sale in Japan in 1997, and was introduced to the worldwide market in 2000.  By the end of 2003, nearly 160,000 units had been produced for sale in Japan, Europe, and North America.  In Latin, ''prius'' means &quot;before&quot; or &quot;first&quot;. The Prius (2000 to 2003 model years) is certified as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). With the 2004 model, the Prius was redesigned as a midsize hatchback, and certified as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (AT-PZEV).  

==Versions==

The first Prius model, NHW10, was sold only in Japan though grey personal imports have been made to the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.&amp;nbsp; Subsequent versions have seen wider sales, increased power and reduced battery weight.  Production of the Prius for the China market began in December 2006 by Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor, a joint venture with First Automobile Works.

==Aftermarket upgrades == 
Various upgrades for the Prius include extra batteries, chargers, stealth mode and solar panels.

===Stealth Mode===

When the vehicle is turned-on with the &quot;start&quot; button, it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor, while electric pumps warm the engine with previously saved hot engine coolant, before the internal combustion engine is started. The delay between starting the car and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds. The Asian and European versions of this vehicle provide a button labeled &quot;EV&quot; that maintains Electric Vehicle mode after startup, under most low-load driving conditions. The North American model does not have the &quot;EV&quot; button, although the &quot;EV&quot; mode is still supported internally by the Prius high-voltage management computer. While some have speculated that EV mode was not included on North American models in the interest of retaining the warranted battery life of 100,000 miles (160,000 km) in the US—150,000 miles (240,000 km) in California and several other states—engineers note that EV mode is automatically overridden when the battery requires recharging from the internal combustion engine. The Prius is designed to protect the battery from extreme discharge as well as over-charge and will utilize the engine as-necessary to maintain the optimum conditions for a long battery life. In addition to information at online discussion groups, the [http://www.priusplus.org PRIUS+ Project] offers instructions for do-it-yourselfers who wish to enable the button, and after-market components provider [http://www.coastaletech.com/ Coastal Electronic Technologies] offers a kit.  Several aftermarket vendors are suppling [http://sigmaauto.com/jdm/prius/prius0405.php OEM EV buttons] for 04+ Prius.

===Extra batteries===

Evolving from the button project, [http://www.calcars.org The California Cars Initiative] (CalCars) converted a Prius in 2004, adding larger batteries, and private companies [http://www.edrivesystems.com/ EDrive Systems] in the United States and [http://www.plugin-hybrid.com Amberjac Projects] in the United Kingdom announced plans to sell conversion kits in 2006. The most recent versions use a new, patented advanced safe-format Lithium Battery from [http://www.valence.com Valence] Technology (VLNC, NASDAQ) called Saphion. The energy density and far more efficient utilization of these batteries provide around 20x the available power of the standard NiMH battery pack but at only double the weight. Tests show it capable of achieving &gt;30 miles in all electric mode at speeds below 34mph. The internal combustion engine starts only at higher speeds or when extra acceleration is needed.   Fuel economy (as demonstrated for several journalists) is improved to 100-160mpg [http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article355531.ece source article] depending on driving conditions. City driving may be possible without using the gas engine at all, eliminating the use of almost all liquid fuel in exchange for electrical energy.

===Chargers===

CalCars initiated efforts to promote the idea of [[w:plug-in hybrid electric vehicle|plug-in hybrids]] to be built by automakers, and documented the emissions benefits of plug-in hybrids not only on California's clean power grid but also on the national (50% coal-fueled) power grid. This addition would be relatively ineffective without additional battery capacity or reprogramming to more completely discharge the batteries (which would be detrimental to their service life.

Recently Toyota has announced that it intends to build a plug in hybrid vehicle at an unspecified future time. [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HYBRID_CARS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2006-07-18-20-27-20] [http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0720/p02s01-ussc.html]

===Solar Panels===

Solar panels provide additional energy to the batteries while the vehicle is in motion or otherwise away from the grid. Solar panels are also useful when the Prius is parked for extended periods of time in a sunny location if it doesn't have a charger or is not connected to a power outlet. Some drivers have claimed up to 10% mileage improvements with the addition of their solar panels, while final results are dependent on the size and efficiency of the solar panels as well as weather conditions. Drivers in Australia and the southwestern states for instance, see the most mileage improvements on their Prius. One advantage of solar panels is that they do not wear out or depreciate like ICE components. [http://www.solatecllc.com/products.htm]

__NOTOC__
Efficient Prius driving entails avoiding inefficient modes, like using &quot;B&quot; or running the internal combustion engine (ICE) or excessive braking and speed, and maximizing efficient modes such as using electric vehicle (EV) modes. When possible, route planning allows both of these to be achieved, often with little or no change in elapsed time.

Above all, it's important to understand that a casual Prius driver needs to understand NONE of the tricks described below.  &quot;Just drive it and enjoy!&quot;  

Use &quot;pulse and glide&quot; driving technique for maximum efficiency.

===Using &quot;B&quot; Shift Position===
The Prius uses an electronic transmission mode selector, similar to a gear shift on a conventional car.  Unlike a conventional vehicle with modes P R N D 2 1 (park, reverse, neutral, drive, 2nd gear, 1st gear) the Prius has a power button, a park button, and a selector for modes R N D and B (reverse, neutral, drive, and engine-Braking).

In the course of normal driving, the driver NEVER needs to use 'B' mode (engine Brake mode).  The techniques below are optional.  'B' mode is appropriate when descending long grades (i.e. descending down a mountain road), where if the driver uses the brake pedal to control the vehicle's speed, the vehicle's brake pads will overheat and fail.  

In a normal vehicle, the driver handles that condition by slowing to an appropriate speed and shifting to a lower gear (2nd or 1st).  This forces the vehicle to spin the engine faster than needed, &quot;wasting&quot; energy through vacuum losses but helping maintain a safe vehicle speed without overheating the brake pads.  

In a Prius, the driver handles that condition by selecting &quot;B&quot; mode.  This tells the Prius to attempt to emulate &quot;engine braking&quot; in a conventional vehicle.  Depending on the vehicle's speed and the battery SOC (state of charge), the Prius will do this using regenerative braking and/or high-RPM zero-fuel-flow engine braking.

Engine braking is inefficient because it uses the engine as an air pump, converting kinetic energy into heat.  Unnecessary regenerative braking is also inefficient because of energy conversion losses.  (Regenerative braking is good when it replaces friction braking, but it's not as efficient as coasting at a constant speed.)  Because of this, &quot;B&quot; mode will not recharge your batteries more efficiently than just braking and is not recommended for general driving. Just as you might downshift into 2nd gear when going down a long, steep hill to prevent brake damage, you can &quot;downshift&quot; into &quot;B&quot; mode on a Prius.  &quot;Shifting&quot; is all electronic, so the system won't let you shift in a harmful way.  (Even if you try to shift into reverse when moving quickly forward, you'll just end up in neutral.)

However, in the case of the Prius &quot;Plug-in&quot; model (which provides an EV drive mode,) the &quot;B&quot; mode can be used to extend the range of the EV battery. If in hybrid mode, it is necessary to switch to EV mode and then engage &quot;B&quot;. This is effective when approaching junctions as it is not then necessary to apply the brakes until actually arriving at the junction. Typically the range of the EV mode is extended by .1 - .2 miles each time this technique is used.

===Unnecessary Engine Idling===

Often you will pull up at a stop light that has just changed. In some suburban areas this may entail a wait of several minutes, as the lights cycle through various simultaneous or sequential left turns, cross traffic, pedestrians, etc. If the gasoline engine is running when you approached the stop it will take the better part of a minute before the computer recognizes the situation and shuts off the engine. There is a trick to getting the engine to shut off promptly. If you approached the stop in '''B''' (engine assist braking), you may then when stopped with the brake on, command '''D''' (drive) - the engine will stop immediately - at least in 2004 US versions. 

'''&quot;EV&quot; Mode''' 

Note: there is a consensus that extensive EV use decreases efficiency and puts strain on hybrid components. In the US one could install an [http://www.seattleeva.org/wiki/User:Rjf/Prius_Modifications#Enabling_EV-mode_Button_.22H14_.2327_to_ground.22 EV-Mode Button] which is a standard button on the dashboard in EU and JP Priuses, but uses the cruise control stalk when installed aftermarket.  It allows the driver to force the engine to shut off (or not start) when driving below 35mph.  The switch will not work above that speed or if the battery is lower than four bars, or if you are accelerating or during the first 60 sec of operation after a cold start (unless turned on prior to starting). It can run a battery to zero in a very short time, but saves anywhere from 1 to 5mpg depending on circumstances and expertise of use. EV mode is available as an aftermarket self-installed kit for ~$60 from Coastal Electronics, Inc. www.coastaletech.com/electric_only_mode.htm 

===Off throttle shift to electric mode===
(Transmission mode in '''D''', cruising speed up to 45 mph (70 km/h), road level.)

When reaching cruising speed it is often possible to briefly go &quot;off throttle&quot;, allowing the system to switch to electric only mode. If the road is nearly level a ''gentle'' re-application of throttle to just enough to maintain cruising speed in electric mode may enable electric cruising (depending upon road grade, wind conditions, and battery state).

===Accelerate from stop to 35 to 45 mph (60 to 70 km/h) ===
(Transmission mode in '''D''', cruising speed up to 45 mph (70 km/h), road level.)

When running in traffic, a brisk (but not full throttle) acceleration, followed by an off throttle attempt (see previous) will be much more effective than gentle acceleration. This is a general technique applicable to non-hybrid cars. A gasoline ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) is more efficient (in terms of power produced/fuel consumption) when operating at higher effort due to smaller throttle losses.

===Accelerate with no traffic to 25 mph (40 km/h) ===
Transmission mode in '''D''', cruising speed up to 25 mph (40 km/h), road level.

With substantial patience it is possible to accelerate to cruising speed using only electric power. Owing to the slow acceleration this should not be attempted with following traffic present.
Although this will temporarily reduce fuel consumption since you're driving in electric mode, it will not improve the long term fuel consumption, since you have to recharge the battery at some point later (and the generation and use of electricity involve energy conversion losses). Though if the route contains descents the regeneration could reduce the losses. But as pointed out above, it is better to accelerate at a moderate pace.

===Long uphill followed by long downhill===
(Transmission mode in '''D''', cruising speed uphill to 65 mph (105 km/h), road uphill, followed by downhill at or below 50 mph (80 km/h) with transmission mode in '''B'''.)

The controller is blind to the future; it cannot tell that it would make sense to run the battery down on a long upgrade knowing that it can be quickly recharged on a subsequent downgrade. Nor is it possible for the driver to inform the system that this condition is coming. What happens is that the system will use the engine power when going uphill to charge the battery to normal state. Then, running down hill (with &quot;'''B'''&quot; selected) the battery is quickly charged to the maximum before the bottom of the hill. This full charge (battery state shown in green) will then cause the system to use the motor for compressive braking. It would be far more efficient to be able to use the battery capability to assist the motor (rather than taking charge from the motor). A run up the hill at sufficient throttle to demand electric motor assist (within speed limits, both statutory and by road and traffic conditions) ''may'' improve overall efficiency in this particular circumstance.

===Downhill run===
When using &quot;B&quot; on a long (1 to 2 km) downhill (e.g. over 60 mph, 100 km/h) you may find at higher speeds that the motor is used for braking in addition to the power recovery from the generator. Unless the battery is fully charged (showing green on the monitor), this is wasting excess energy which could be stored. By briefly braking to a somewhat slower speed, say 45 to 50 mph (70 to 80 km/h), the motor will not be used to retard the vehicle, all subsequent retarding energy will go to the battery, and ''a longer time will be spent recovering energy'', and so more energy will be recovered. This is less useful on a long mountain downgrade where the battery will become fully charged regardless of the technique used.

===Gentle rise and descent===
When driving up and down short hills do not use cruise control downhill.  Using cruise control going downhill forces regenerative braking unnecessarily.  Unless the final valley speed will be too great, shift to neutral.  Regenerative braking does NOT recover anywhere near 100% of the energy going into the brakes.  Switching to neutral for going down short hills is far more efficient ...unless you have an accident or get a ticket at the bottom of the hill!  

===Slow and Steady===
When traveling on relatively flat surfaces at approx 0 to 25 km/h (15 mph), sometimes the engine will run seemingly unnecessarily.  By applying the brakes it tells the car to regenerate and is usually enough to shut it down.  Sometimes it is necessary to come to a complete stop.  At speeds that low, there is no real need for the gas engine.  Alternatively, if you have an EV switch, you can turn it once you are below 35mph.(See also &quot;Engine Stopping&quot; above)  

===Use slow speed to warm-up===
On the first trip of the day, both the NHW20, 04-current, models and earlier NHW11 will have relatively higher fuel consumption as the ICE and transmission warm-up. Driving the first mile or so at a low speed does little if anything to improve gas mileage and today's lubricants are designed to provide the necessary lubrication at their full range of operating temperature.  The only exception where a more &quot;gentle&quot; operation would be in order is if you live in very cold climates, e.g., overnight temperature is below 32F.  Then a short distance of easier acceleration and braking makes sense.  You will save nothing during this time of fuel usage because the ICE controller is doing what is necessary to get the pollution control devices up to operating temperature as quickly as possible. Drive normally, let the computer do the work it's suppose to do.

In colder climates, our Japanese Prius owners report saving 100 ml of fuel from use of an engine block heater. They also report an additional 100 ml of fuel savings from warming the transaxle. ICE block heater savings have been widely reported.

===42 mph (67 km/h) transition point===
Below 42 mph (67 km/h), the ICE and electric system will maintain speed cycling between EV and ICE-recharge power. But above 42 mph (67 km/h), the ICE must spin all of the time even if power is not needed. As a general rule of thumb, try to stay comfortably below 42 mph (67 km/h), say 38 mph (61 km/h), or above 42 mph (67 km/h), 45 mph (72 km/h) or higher to minimize having the ICE turn on and off unnecessarily.

===Lubricants===
Over filling the ICE oil level appears to drop mileage by about 3-5 MPG. Many Prius owners shoot for 3/4th full. Also, Toyota recently announced using 0W-20 as a recommended engine oil as an alternative to 5W-30. Since oil 'thins' in normal use, changing it more frequently is less likely to have a beneficial effect but keeping it clean with a new filter is highly recommended.

The new model NHW20 （2004-current） uses an advanced transaxle oil, Type WS, that oil testing reveals to be lasting well up to the 60,000 mile life. However, the NHW11 model （2001-2003） uses a thicker Type T-IV that appears to have less than half of the 60,000 mile recommended life. Based upon transaxle oil testing, older Prius should have their oil changed within 15,000-30,000 miles, more frequently in dusty areas. With the older model, be sure to have the pan dropped and all exposed parts wiped clean to remove any grit or dirt. The newer Prius does not have a transaxle pan that can be dropped.

== '''Approaching home:  what is the optimal battery level to leave for the next trip?''' ==

Some of the energy stored in the batteries overnight is wasted since all batteries will inevitably discharge to some extent even when not in use.  If you have an EV switch (see &quot;Unnecessary Engine Idling&quot; above), it may be beneficial to run the batteries down when approaching home or when the vehicle is about to experience an extended rest, however, if batteries are left below 4 bars and you have to stop prior to one minute of driving the next trip, you will be unable to override the computer to stop the engine from idling at the first stop sign or stoplight.  

When a Prius starts up the ICE will not start up if you stay below 21 mph, unless it is very cold or you have the aircon/heating on or the battery is below 3 bar.  Once you go beyond that limit the ICE will start up and as part of its function it will charge the battery.  Bearing in mind that most journeys will start and go above 21mph fairly quickly it does not make sense to leave a large charge in the battery at the end of a journey.
So when you approach the end of a journey if possible go into manual override EV mode and run the battery down.

{{stub}}

The '''Recent Changes Patrol''' consists of examining recent edits to the wiki for test edits, blanking of pages, vandalism, and other negative changes. Each wiki has a [[Special:Recentchanges]] page; most wikis have a link to &quot;Recent changes&quot; at the left. Any user can use this page and help revert vandalism. However, only sysops can block users and delete bad pages. Thus it is important for sysops to sometimes inspect recent changes and stop persistent spammers and vandals.

Every recent edit appears in Recent Changes. Thus, if a page is edited twice, both the top edit and previous edit appear. Thus, it is not possible to hide an edit by making another edit.

Some wikis let users mark edits in recent changes as ''patrolled edit''. The idea is to mark every edit that does not harm the wiki. Some wikis let any user mark patrolled edits, but at Wikimedia, the wikis restrict it to sysops.  On some Wikimedia sites, like Wikipedia, this feature is disabled. 

=== Type of bad edits ===
* ''Creation of new speedy deletion candidates''. Many wikis have a deletion policy, such as Wikibooks [[Project:deletion policy|deletion policy]]. Sysops are in position to delete obvious junk pages that some users create.
* ''Creation of pages with bad names.'' Many Wikimedia wikis have naming conventions, such as Wikibooks [[Project:naming policy|naming policy]]. A sysop can move the page to a better name (if the page is not useless), then delete the redirect. For example, a page titled with ALL UPPERCASE LETTERS is probably bad. 
* ''Spam''. Some users like to add [[MeatBall:WikiSpam|WikiSpam]] to wikis, adding lots of links to their own web sites so that their search-engine rankings increase. This tactic is more effective on more popular wikis, and Wikimedia hosts most of the largest and most popular wikis. Thus Wikimedia wikis are favorite targets of Spam. A common tactic of Spammers is to use CSS to hide spam so that readers do not see it, but search engines do. However, such spam becomes obvious when editing a page or viewing a diff.
* ''Blanking''. Bots or vandals that delete chunks of pages, apparently at random.

{{TODO|todonote=other types|MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook}}

=== Type of users ===
There are generally five kinds of users that make edits.
* ''Frequent contributors'' make the most edits. Often, these users are most recognisable by users who patrol the recent changes. Thus, it is least likely that any user will check these edits. A user that does try to check edits is likely to only pick a few edits at random, and not examine the others.
* ''Blue-shirt contributors'' have names that appear in blue, meaning that they have user pages. A user is more likely to check red-shirt contributors than these.
* ''Red-shirt contributors'' have names that appear in red, because they have no user page. Many of these contributors are new users with good intentions. However, vandals and [[wikt:sockpuppet|sockpuppets]] who want to hide their IP address or use the [[WB:MOVE|page-move feature]] often become &quot;anonymous redshirts&quot;. [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-December/005435.html]
* ''IP addresses'' edit the wiki without creating an account. These users like to fix errors in pages. However, spammers tend not to create accounts. Thus users tend to check these edits most carefully and often. IP addresses cause so much trouble that sysops block them more often than other users. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block]
* ''Brand new contributors'' are people who have their account creation very close to often a large number of contributions.  These deserve some special attention because even when they are not doing vandalism, they are not likely to be familiar with policies on the project or do quite a bit of experimentation.  Be extra careful with these people as they are more likely to become the regular contributors of the future and are the source of new help for the project.  Still, watch carefully for vandalism from these editors or for [[wikt:sockpuppet|sockpuppeting]], especially if they create a user page as one of their first edits.

=== Mass reversions ===
Some users are so bad that sysops block the user, then revert all edits made by that user without checking them.

'''Differentiation technique'''

f(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{(1-z)^2} \\
f'(z) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{((1-z)^2)'}{((1-z)^2)^2} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{-2(1-z)}{(1-z)^4} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{2}{(1-z)^3} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the result of the differentation of f(z)=(1-z)^n (f'(z) = -n(1-z)&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;)

2.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{(1-z)^3} \\
f'(z) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{((1-z)^3)\prime}{((1-z)^3)^2} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{-3(1-z)^2}{(1-z)^6} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{3}{(1-z)^4} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{(1+z)^3} \\
f'(z) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{((1+z)^3)'}{((1+z)^3)^2} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{3(1+z)^2}{(1+z)^6} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{-3}{(1+z)^4} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the result of exercise 3 of the previous section f(z)= (1+z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; f'(z)=3(1+z)^2

4.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{(1-z)^n} \\
f'(z) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{((1-z)^n)'}{((1-z)^n)^2} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{-n(1-z)^{n-1}}{(1-z)^{2n}} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{-n}{(1-z)^{2n-(n-1)}} \\
 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{-n}{(1-z)^{2n-n+1}} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{n}{(1-z)^{n+1}} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the result of the differentation of f(z)=(1-z)^n (f'(z) = -n(1-z)&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;)</text>

{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Schema-sm.png]].

== Deletion of Pages ==

Please don't blank pages that you want to delete.  It causes us no end of grief here and with other Wikimedia projects.  If you can, please use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' markup template on the page if you want to delete something from here.  We will find the page sooner and be able to deal with the deletion without having to fight through other pages first.

Thank you, though, for trying to help make Wikibooks a better place.  We do appreciate people like you trying to help find stuff that really doesn't belong.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:27, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

== De-Adminship vote. ==

A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Eclecticology_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:51, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]].

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:CHN-1941-0103-10.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:CHN-1941-0103-10.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]]. Thank you. 

There are a couple other new ones too... please add the licensing info when you upload! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

== Template on [[WB:VFD]] ==

Hi Eclecticology,

I reverted your edit on [[WB:VFD]] turning the link to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/IPOD NANO]] back to an inclusion. It has been discussed on the talk page that VfDs should be archived on sub-pages of [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] rather than in numbered archives as was the practice. Let me know if you have any questions about this.

I don't quite understand your edit summary: &quot;''Seems as though this should not be a template since it causes it to be fixed in position on top of everything else!''&quot;. My browser renders the inclusion perfectly. What do you mean by &quot;fixed&quot;? Fixed as in [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#choose-position the CSS specs]? Could you be more specific about how this is rendered by your browser? Which browser do you use?

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:32, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the note.  The rendering seems to be OK now.  Your reference to what s meant by &quot;fixed&quot; seems to be what I had in mind.  That block of text, with &quot;Mumfum&quot; appearing at the top was staying in one place even as I scrolled through the page to get to the completely unrelated matter that interested me.  But for this I would never have touched it.  It could very well be that the problem arose from the vandalism which was reversed, but had not yet had the linkages in the servers caught up.  No real harm done. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 06:11, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

:: You're welcome. Good that the rendering is fixed and everything is back to normal. I guess you're right about it being results of vandalism. I haven't looked closely, but it is a typical cause. Thanks for your efforts. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Welcome back ==

I noticed you editing on the recent changes log again. Welcome back. How was your Holiday break? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
:Thanks for the welcome back.  I've been around but often I spend so much time with the mailing lists that it detracts from doing any useful work. :-(  I see that you tried to restore a few stamp images for Latvia without success.  (Copyright issues are a little different with stamps.)  Are you planning to do more with that country?  I am trying to develop a scheme for cataloguing stamps, though I still regard a lot of it as experimental.  I tend to adapt as the problems arise.  One point that seems as though it would be a good one to make would be to have our catalog numbers for stamp match-up with image names.  Keep in touch on this. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 01:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
::The images were deleted as they were un- or improperly-tagged and/or -sourced. One of the lovely things that happened while you were gone is that many images started being deleted (which is fair, appropriate, and legally necessary) and the dead links removed (which then makes is difficult to find replacements). I came across those dead image links and restored them so that we could keep track of which stamps we had but do not have know and indeed need.
:::The peculiar copyright situation aside, I plan to create a lot of dead links, mostly as a part of developing an image naming strategy for stamps.
::To be honest, I have very few stamps myself. I love the idea of collecting just about anything (as I was, in a former life, a packrat ;)). I may sooner or later inherit a very large collection and would then be able to contribute.
:::My own collection of stamps is unreasonably large, but I find it a pain to work with scanning and getting the colours right.  I also have a substantial collection of philatelic literature with a specialty in periodicals.
::As to catalogue numbers, I like the ISO country code format that you are using; where to go from there, however, I am unsure. I would love to brainstorm sometime. Just start a page with your ideas and I'll comment and add on.
:::See [[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]].  It could still stand more development, and I am adjusting as I go along.  I'm sure I would find your suggestions interesting.
::Oh, out of curiosity, what mailing lists have you been on?
::Best wishes, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
:::I'm on the Wikipedia, Wikien and Foundation lists.  I've been receiving the Wikitech list in digest form, but I don't understand half the stuff that happens there.

Hello Eclecticology, how are you? It's been a long time since you've contributed here, it's good to have you back. I don't think anything significant has change since you were last around, no new policies or anything like that. 

Anyway, I dont want to waste too much of your time. It's good to have you back! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:39, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

== How to upload images in the section  ==
== Hello ==
Hi Electicology,
Still I can not find a way to upload image into the section of India-stamps what I have 
created. Text I can format as well as enter. Reason for asking is I have  a full collection
of Stamps of India from 1947 onwards. I have scanned stamps Images on my computer and also
published in to Photobucket. Is it possible that I can upload those Images here.
If it is than how I can do it. I need some guidance.

The original idea of the Absolute Necessities in a small Testament of John was evidently the minumum necessities in the minumum words. Something was missing. The anonymous entries [[User:71.56.173.142|71.56.173.142]] were thought provoking and stimulus for the seventh necessity. Salvation was already mentioned, so the Matthew reference was superfluous, but realizing the Holy Spirit and the name of Jesus were lacking, the righteousness entry was the solution. Another verse with the same but expanded message was chosen where righteousness was achieved before God by Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. Result, the magnificent seven, in a slightly different order. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:40, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Katie Bell''''' is a member of Gryffindor House. She is one year ahead of Harry, and plays Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team take to the air for their first match, against Slytherin in November, it turns out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]] is the announcer. He identifies the Chasers on both teams who are holding the Quaffle. This is the first time we hear Katie Bell's name, although presumably she has been practicing with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the other members of the Quidditch team since Harry was made Seeker in mid-September.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Katie plays Quidditch with the Gryffindor team alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]]. The season is abbreviated, so we don't see much of her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Katie again plays Quidditch as Chaser for Gryffindor alongside Angelina and Alicia.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

With Quidditch being suspended for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], we don't see much of Katie at all.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

In the warmup before the first practice of the year, Ron passes the Quaffle to Katie too enthusiastically, and it catches her in the nose. Fred Weasley gives her something small and purple from his robe pocket, saying that it will clear up immediately. It does not, however. When Angelina tells her to do something about it, Fred examines what he has in his robe pocket and appears horrified by what he sees. Shortly afterwards, Angelina stops the practice; Alicia points Harry at Katie, who is being attended by Fred, George, and Angelina. Fred says that she had likely been given a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood Blisterpod|Blood Blisterpod]] by mistake, and that he and George would take her to the Hospital Wing.

Katie is one of the students who attends the first meeting of what becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]].

A short while later, horrible weather keeps the students in at break. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] is floating overhead in the room, flicking ink balls at the students when Angelina arrives to tell Harry and Ron that the Quidditch team has been re-formed. Peeves manages to hit Katie Bell with an ink ball, and she starts throwing things at him. As the bell rings, Peeves dumps an entire bottle of ink over Katie's head.

Katie plays in the match with Slytherin, a match which ultimately Gryffindor wins, despite Ron's poor Keeping, as Harry catches the Snitch for a final score of 160 to 40. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie then hold Fred back from attacking Draco Malfoy, who is taunting the entire Weasley family, while Harry holds George. When Draco starts insulting Harry's family as well, Harry is unable to restrain himself, and he and George attack Draco, while Fred remains restrained by the three Chasers.

As Harry has been unwillingly reduced to the role of spectator at Quidditch, he no longer interacts with Katie on the pitch. While we can assume that she continues to work with Dumbledore's Army, her work is not singled out on the rest of the story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Katie Bell again makes the Gryffindor Quidditch team, after pointing out to Harry that she should try out like everyone else; if there is someone better at Chasing than she is, that person should have her spot, friendship shouldn't automatically control team selection.

On a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]], she is apparently given a package to give to someone at Hogwarts. The contents of the package turn out to be a necklace that was seen earlier at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]], which carries a curse. Katie is injured and spends significant time in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. On her return, she tells Harry that she does not remember anything after walking into the ladies room at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|The Three Broomsticks]], from which Harry concludes that she was put under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As she had graduated at the end of the previous year, we would not expect to see Katie return to Hogwarts. She does, however, return for the final battle against the Death Eaters; Harry sees her when he returns to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] after visiting Ravenclaw Tower. We don't hear much of how she acquits herself in battle, though.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

While Katie does not obsess about Quidditch to the same extent that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], or later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], does, she still seems to be quite caught up in it. We seldom see her when she is not playing or practicing Quidditch. It would seem that Katie has good relationships with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]] and Angelina Johnson, with whom she played Quidditch for most of her time at Hogwarts, and is generally seen with the two in most of her appearances throughout the series. Another of her good friends is Leanne, who isn't mentioned until the sixth book. Also, there are times that we see her sitting in a corner of the Gryffindor's common room, but generally there is no indication as to who she is sitting with, or what they are doing. 

Although Katie Bell has a relatively minor role in the books, she has become a fairly popular character on the internet. In particular, a large amount of fan fiction has been written that pairs her with Oliver Wood. There is nothing in the books that would suggest this, or in fact any, romantic relationship.

== Overview ==

'''''Angelina Johnson''''' is a member of Gryffindor House. She is a tall black girl with long black hair, which she wears in plaits, and brown eyes. She is two years ahead of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and plays Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team. The author has said that her birthday is 24 October, making her one of the older students in her class year.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Angelina presumably has been practicing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] since he was made Seeker in mid-September, but is first mentioned by name in the changing room where the team is getting ready for their first match, against Slytherin. Angelina, identified as a Chaser, here corrects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver]], who has just started his speech by saying &quot;Men...&quot; Once the team take to the air, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], the announcer, mentions her when the Quaffle is in her possession, commenting as an aside that he is disappointed that she won't go out with him. Angelina scores several goals in this first match, against Slytherin.

We later hear that she has a penalty called against her in the match against Hufflepuff when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] is officiating.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Angelina plays Quidditch for Gryffindor house as Chaser alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alicia Spinnet|Alicia Spinnet]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]]. The season is abbreviated, so we don't see much of her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Angelina plays as Chaser with the Gryffindor house Quidditch team, alongside Katie and Alicia.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

With Quidditch being suspended for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], we don't see as much of Angelina as we would expect.

Angelina is the first Gryffindor to successfully place her name in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]; it does not, however, select her as a Champion.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] offhandedly asks Angelina to accompany him to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]; Angelina considers briefly, then as offhandedly accepts, returning to her interrupted conversation with Alicia Spinnet. We see the two of them in the Entrance Hall before the Ball, and we later see them dancing &quot;so exuberantly that people were backing away for fear of injury.&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Angelina meets up with Harry at breakfast on the first day of classes, saying that with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] having graduated, she has been made Captain, and the house [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team will need a new Keeper. She says that there will be tryouts on Friday evening, and orders Harry to attend, saying that she wants the entire team to be present so that they can be sure that the new Keeper will fit in with the whole team. Harry is pleased at her being Captain; he believes that there will be much less talking with Angelina in charge.

When Harry gets detention from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Angelina is furious at him, deciding that it is his fault that he got detention, and orders him to do whatever he can to get out of detention and be there for practice. After she has gone, Ron comments that they should check with Puddlemere United and see if Oliver Wood is still alive, as Angelina seems to be channeling his spirit.

Finding that Harry was not able to convince Umbridge to change his Friday detention, Angelina angrily suggests that people who want to stay on the team will find a way to make it to practices.

Friday evening, after the try-outs, Angelina apologizes to Harry for her earlier curtness, and says that she may have been too hard on Wood; managing is a bit stressful. She goes on to say that Ron had not been the best Keeper she tried out, but of the two better, one was not willing to commit the time to practice and the other was a bit of a whiner, and Angelina is hoping that Ron, being from a family with excellent Quidditch players, will develop over time. She then says that there will be a practice Saturday at two, and asks Harry to please be there and to help Ron out a bit.

Before the practice starts, Angelina mentions that there are some people in the stands, and that the team should just ignore them. Harry suspects that these will be Slytherins, present to jeer, and so it turns out. In the warm-up before the practice, Ron passes the Quaffle to Katie too enthusiastically, and it catches her in the nose. Fred Weasley gives her something small and purple from his robe pocket, saying that it will clear up immediately. It does not, however. When Angelina tells her to do something about it, Fred examines what he has in his robe pocket and appears horrified by what he sees. Shortly afterwards, Angelina stops the practice; Alicia points Harry at Katie, who is being attended by Fred, George, and Angelina. Fred says that she had likely been given a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood Blisterpod|Blood Blisterpod]] by mistake, and that he and George would take her to the Hospital Wing. Angelina says that with no Beaters and only two Chasers, there is no point continuing the practice, and dismisses them.

The following Monday, Harry mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] happened to have Lord Voldemort stuck to the back of his head, and gets another week's detention from Professor Umbridge. On Tuesday morning, Angelina shouts at Harry loud enough that Professor McGonagall comes to see what is going on. She penalizes Harry five House points, in addition to his detention, because detention does not seem to work, and warns Angelina to confine her shouting to the Quidditch pitch.

Angelina is one of the students who attends the first meeting of what becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. 

When Educational Decree Number Twenty Four appears the next day, it is Angelina who tells Harry and Ron that it also means that the Gryffindor Quidditch Team has been disbanded. That night, Angelina tells them that there is no Quidditch practice, as Umbridge needs &quot;time to consider;&quot; but the Slytherin Quidditch team is already re-formed. The following day, Angelina comes to Harry and Ron at break, telling them that she has appealed to McGonagall and gotten the team re-formed. She tells Harry and Ron that practice will be at 7 that evening. Ron is dismayed, as the weather is simply appalling.

The weather has not improved by 7, and even though Angelina recalls that Hermione had used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Impervius|Impervius charm]] earlier to give him at least some vision in similar circumstances, and has Harry teach that charm to the rest of the team, still very little is actually accomplished as nobody can see what is going on.

Harry is relieved a couple of days later when Angelina tells him that Quidditch practice is canceled, not only because the weather is still foul, but also because he has been told how to get into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], and so has scheduled the first meeting of the Defence Against the Dark Arts group for that evening. He asks Angelina to pass the word to Alicia and Katie Bell. Angelina is a bit taken aback, but it seems she does tell the others.

Angelina schedules more Quidditch practice as the first game of the year, against Slytherin, approaches. As a result, there are fewer meetings of Dumbledore's Army.

Angelina leads the team into the match with Slytherin, a match which ultimately Gryffindor wins, despite Ron's poor Keeping, as Harry catches the Snitch for a final score of 160 to 40. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie then hold Fred back from attacking Draco Malfoy, who is taunting the entire Weasley family, while Harry holds George. When Draco starts insulting Harry's family as well, Harry is unable to restrain himself, and he and George attack Draco, while Fred remains restrained by the three Chasers.

Angelina is, of course, dismayed when she finds out that her Seeker and both of her Beaters have received lifetime bans, and goes off disconsolately to the girls dorms, saying that she is hoping that she will wake up in the morning and find this is all a bad dream.

At the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army before the Christmas break, Angelina tells Harry that she has finally managed to find new Beaters and a Seeker for the Quidditch team. The Seeker is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who is surprisingly good, though not a patch on Harry. It is Alicia who tells Harry the names of the new Beaters: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andrew Kirke|Andrew Kirke]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jack Sloper|Jack Sloper]].

While Angelina continues to lead the Quidditch team, Harry, being unwillingly reduced to a mere spectator, no longer interacts with her particularly on the pitch. In Dumbledore's Army, we assume that she still attends and performs to a reasonable standard, but we do not see anything in particular of her there either.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Summoned by the enchanted Galleon that was given to her by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] as a way to announce meetings of Dumbledore's Army, Angelina returns to Hogwarts in time to take part in the battle for the school.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

In the books she is shown to have a close relationship with fellow chasers Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet. She's known and liked by Harry, Ron and Hermione. Starting from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|the fourth book]], we see tiny hints of a possible relationship between her and Fred Weasley. The two of them attend the Yule Ball in the fourth book, and Fred seems to have a bit of a crush on her.

For the final year of writing the seventh and final book, the author was followed by a camera team from the British TV network ITV. After completing the seventh book, the author drew up a chart of the Weasley family tree, which showed that George had married one Angelina, quite possibly Angelina Johnson, and had two children with her, named Roxanne and Fred. This does not seem to have completely pleased members of the fan community. A significant amount of fan fiction has emerged which revises the final Battle of Hogwarts to allow for Fred's survival, followed by his marriage to Angelina, leaving George free to hook up with Alicia Spinnet.

== Overview ==

'''''Alicia Spinnet''''' is a member of Gryffindor House. She is two years ahead of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. She plays Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team take to the air for their first match, against Slytherin in November, it turns out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]] is the announcer. He identifies the Chasers on both teams who are holding the Quaffle. This is the first time we hear Alicia Spinnet's name, although presumably she has been practicing with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the other members of the Quidditch team since Harry was made Seeker in mid-September. Lee mentions in passing that Spinnet had been a reserve player the previous year, which would have been her second year. When Harry is fouled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]], it is Alicia who puts in the penalty shot.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We see her in the Gryffindor Quidditch team, playing Chaser alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]]. The Quidditch season is abbreviated, so we see relatively little of her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

She again plays Quidditch for Gryffindor as chaser alongside Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

There is no Quidditch in this year because of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], so we see very little of Alicia. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] off-handedly invites Angelina to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]; she briefly breaks off her conversation with Alicia to accept, equally lightly.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

The first time we see Alicia Spinnet is at the first Quidditch practice of the year. While she has been active in the practice, the first real interaction with Harry is when Angelina stops the practice. Harry asks why the practice has been stopped, and Alicia points at Katie Bell, who is suffering from blood loss. When Fred and George take Katie to the hospital wing, Angelina dismisses the other team members from practice.

We hear from Fred and George that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], in her new role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, had been examining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s class. In the process, she had asked Alicia some questions about the class, which she had answered positively.

Alicia is one of the students who attends the first meeting of what becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. She also attends meetings regularly.

As the first Quidditch game of the year approaches, Alicia is sent to the Hospital Wing as her eyebrows are growing so quickly that they are obscuring her vision. It seems [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Miles Bletchley|Miles Bletchley]], the Slytherin Keeper, had jinxed her from behind in the library.

Alicia plays in the match with Slytherin, a match which ultimately Gryffindor wins, despite Ron's poor Keeping, as Harry catches the Snitch for a final score of 160 to 40. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie then hold Fred back from attacking Draco Malfoy, who is taunting the entire Weasley family, while Harry holds George. When Draco starts insulting Harry's family as well, Harry is unable to restrain himself, and he and George attack Draco, while Fred remains restrained by the three Chasers.

At the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army before the Christmas break, Angelina tells Harry that she has finally managed to find new Beaters and a Seeker for the Quidditch team. The Seeker is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who is surprisingly good, though not a patch on Harry. It is Alicia who tells Harry the names of the new Beaters: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andrew Kirke|Andrew Kirke]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jack Sloper|Jack Sloper]]. She adds that they are not brilliant, but compared to the other idiots who showed up&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Harry's interaction with Alicia on the Quidditch pitch has largely ended with the lifetime ban he has received, and though we can safely assume that she continues to attend meetings of Dumbledore's Army, her work there is not singled out, so we see very little of her in the remainder of the book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Alicia has graduated, and plays no role in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] uses the linked Galleons to recall the members of Dumbledore's Army when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] arrives at Hogwarts. Alicia is one of the ones who responds to the call. We see her later with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] guarding one of the entrances to the secret passages into Hogwarts.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Although there is never any mention, direct or otherwise, in any of the books, there was much speculation in the fan community that Alicia would get together with George. Fred's death in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the seventh book apparently resulted in Angelina and George marrying, according to a family tree produced by the author; this does not seem to sit well with the fan community, who have produced fan fiction with alternate outcomes for the Battle of Hogwarts in which Fred survived, apparently solely so that George would be free to marry Alicia.

Alicia also seems to have a close relationship with most of the Quidditch team, especially with her two fellow chasers Angelina and Katie Bell.

== Overview ==

'''''Oliver Wood''''' is a member of Gryffindor House. He is described as &quot;burly&quot; and is fanatical about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]]. He captained the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, while playing Keeper, for Harry's first three years. After he graduated from Hogwarts, he signed with Puddlemere United Reserve Team.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] flying on his broomstick without permission, and making a truly spectacular catch, she takes him out of the courtyard. Looking in classrooms, she eventually finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick's]] room, and asks Professor Flitwick if she could borrow &quot;Wood&quot;. Harry is relieved to find out that Wood is not a wooden implement for punishment, but is in fact '''Oliver Wood''', who turns out to be captain of the Quidditch team. She tells Wood that she has found him a Seeker, and they discuss Harry's natural flying abilities and the fact that they need to get him a new broom.

Wood, later, takes Harry down to the Quidditch pitch, explains the rules, demonstrates the Bludgers, and checks Harry's flight abilities by having him catch golf balls. Once Wood is satisfied that Harry is capable, he has Harry join the regular practices.

Wood does not play a large part in the story after this; he is there in the Quidditch practices and in the various Quidditch matches. He is Keeper for the Gryffindor team, and as such is responsible for some particularly spectacular saves.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Oliver is Quidditch Captain in Harry's second year. Much to his chagrin, the season is cut short when the Monster in the Chamber cannot be controlled.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

With Quidditch having been interrupted in the previous year, and Oliver now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, he sees this as his only chance at winning the Quidditch Cup. As such, Oliver is driving the team hard, with new tactics, frequent practices, and innumerable strategy sessions.

In Harry's first game, against Hufflepuff, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] flood the pitch and Harry loses consciousness, allowing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] to catch the Snitch and win the match. When Harry regains consciousness, he is in the Hospital Wing; with the exception of Oliver, the entire Quidditch team is present. They tell him that Oliver is still in the showers, and that Cedric had offered to void the game because of the Dementor attack, and had been turned down both by Oliver and by the teachers.

Harry's prized [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Nimbus 2000]] is destroyed in that accident, and Oliver pressures harry to select and purchase a new broom before the next match, loaning him a copy of ''Which Broomstick?'' over the Christmas break. He is overjoyed to learn that Harry has received a Firebolt for Christmas, then downcast when he learns that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] are examining it for hidden jinxes before allowing Harry to use it.

At one point, Oliver reports that he had asked Professor McGonagall to return the broom, telling her that he didn't mind if it did throw Harry off, if Harry only caught the Snitch first. He doesn't seem to understand why Professor McGonagall thought his request insensitive. We don't hear Harry's reaction, but believe that Harry is unsurprised by Oliver's priorities, though almost certainly preferring McGonagall's.

Oliver does have to remind Madam Hooch that they need to get some practice in, when Harry gets the Firebolt back; she has apparently spent some time rhapsodizing over its excellent styling and flying qualities.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We see Oliver in passing in the campground before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], where we learn that he is playing for the Puddlemere United Quidditch team.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry thinks to himself that with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]] as team Captain, pep talks are not likely to be as long as they were when Oliver Wood had been Captain.

When Harry gets detention from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Angelina is furious at him, deciding that it is his fault that he got detention, and orders him to do whatever he can to get out of detention and be there for practice. After she has gone, Ron comments that they should check with Puddlemere United and see if Oliver Wood is still alive, as Angelina seems to be channeling his spirit.

Angelina comments to Harry later that she knows now how Wood had felt as team captain, and why he had been as rough on them as he had.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is poisoned, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] wonders if someone might be trying to kill off the Gryffindor Quidditch team: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], one of the Chasers, had touched a cursed necklace and was now in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], and Ron was Keeper. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|George]], who is there at the time, feels this is unlikely, but Fred suggests that Wood might have done that to the Slytherin team if he felt he could get away with it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Oliver comes to Hogwarts to fight in the final battle. He is present in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when Harry returns from Ravenclaw tower. When Harry is on his way out to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], after viewing the Prince's memories, Harry sees Oliver and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] carrying the body of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]] back into the school from the grounds; Oliver tells Neville that he can handle it himself, Neville should head back out for another.

== Strengths ==

Oliver is a good Quidditch Goal Keeper and he is extremely committed to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He puts in a lot of time and effort to the team.

== Weaknesses ==

Oliver is often blinded by his love of Quidditch and cannot see how anything else is more important.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Not much is known about Oliver's close friends from the books. In the fan fiction world, he is a widely popular character who is close with all his Gryffindor House team mates, especially Katie Bell. There is a large amount of fan fiction which pairs these two together, though there is nothing in the series to support this, and in fact it seems unlikely with Oliver being three years older than Katie.

== Overview ==

'''''Filius Flitwick''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] professor at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He is also Head of Ravenclaw House. He is described as a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. Despite appearances, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=95 the author has stated] that Flitwick is a very short human, possibly with some goblin ancestry. The author has also said that Filius Flitwick's birthday is on October 17.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Professor Flitwick has to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. When he is calling the roll on the first day of classes, he is so excited when he finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s name on the list that he falls off his pile of books.

It is on Hallowe'en that Flitwick's class is first allowed to actually perform magic. After some initial coaching, Flitwick gives all the class members feathers that they are to lift with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is partnered with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and gives him some pointers when he can't make it work; when Ron resists, Hermione performs the spell, and Flitwick announces her success to the class. It is this initial victory of hers that leads Ron to later say that she is insufferable and that's probably why she has no friends. Hermione overhears this comment and spends the rest of the day in the girls washroom, crying. She is still there when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|mountain troll]] is prowling the halls.

At Christmas, we see Flitwick levitating ornaments onto the twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall.

We learn that Professor Flitwick has provided one of the guardian barriers to the chamber in which the Philosopher's Stone is protected. That barrier is a door, with a large number of keys charmed to have wings and fly. To open the door, one must use the provided brooms to hunt for, and catch, the one flying key that will open the door.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Although Professor Flitwick is still teaching Charms, we see little of him in this book. He is one of the teachers who responds when Harry discovers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] Petrified, and is one of the two (the other being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Sinistra|Professor Sinistra]]) who carry Justin to the Hospital Wing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry, by means of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], goes to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] just before Christmas, meeting up there with Ron and Hermione. In The Three Broomsticks, they eavesdrop on a conversation involving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], Professor Flitwick, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]]. When Rosmerta complains the Dementors are affecting her business, Fudge explains they are necessary because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is so dangerous. Rosmerta mentions that Sirius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] were great friends once, always in the Three Broomsticks together. This surprises Harry. Fudge says that not only was Sirius James' best friend, but also best man at his wedding and Harry's godfather. As the conversation continues, it is learned that James and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] knew [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] was hunting them and went into hiding. They used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]] to conceal themselves and appointed Sirius their Secret-Keeper. Flitwick describes the operation of the Fidelius Charm. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], aware someone close to them was leaking secrets, offered to be their Secret-Keeper, but they declined. Barely a week later, Voldemort killed James and Lily, although he met his own demise in baby Harry. Obviously Black, tired of playing double agent, had thrown his lot in with Voldemort but, after his defeat, had to flee for his life. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], another Potter friend, caught up to Black the next day and accused him of betraying James and Lily. Black killed him and twelve Muggle bystanders with a single curse. Only Pettigrew's bloodstained robes and a severed finger were left. Black was sentenced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], where he remained until his escape. It is believed he is now trying to reunite with Voldemort, perhaps after killing Harry to prove his loyalty.

When Harry receives a Firebolt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] as a Christmas gift, Professor McGonagall confiscates it. As they don't know who sent it, she says that Professor Flitwick and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] will examine it to see if there are any malicious spells buried in it.

Just before Easter break, Hermione gets confused in her class attendance and sleeps through one of Professor Flitwick's classes, the one covering Cheering Charms. Though she does go to him to apologize, apparently she doesn't fully learn Cheering Charms, because she is bemoaning the fact later that they appeared on the final exam.

When Sirius Black is captured, we find that he is being held in Professor Flitwick's office. Professor Dumbledore tells Harry and Hermione where the window to his office is so that they can rescue Sirius by air.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

It is mentioned that Professor Flitwick has assigned three books worth of reading before starting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning Charms]], shortly before Hallowe'en.

We later see Professor Flitwick teaching the class [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Banishing Charm|Banishing Charms]]. We start to understand that Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel that Charms class is a good place for discussions that they don't want overheard, because of all the frenetic activity among their classmates practicing charms.

Along with many other teachers, Professor Flitwick eases off in the week before Christmas break and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Instead, he spends the time discussing the Summoning Charm that Harry had used in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].

Professor Flitwick is one of the four marshals patrolling the outside of the maze for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third task]] of the Tournament.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] mention that Flitwick was unperturbed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s inspection of the class, treating her as he would any student.

Later, Umbridge becomes Headmaster in name, though the Headmaster's office will not open to her. On her first day in office, Fred and George set off a collection of fireworks, and Umbridge spends the entire day chasing them down and extinguishing them. At the end of the day, we see Flitwick telling Umbridge that he could have eliminated the sparklers himself, but that he wasn't sure he had the authority.

Just after Easter break, Fred and George turn one corridor of the school into a swamp. After they depart from the school, Umbridge is unable to change it back. After Umbridge is removed from the school, Flitwick does remove the swamp, but he leaves one small corner of it, as he says it was really very good magic.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In addition to the spells that Harry has learned from the Half-Blood Prince's Potions book, there is mention again that Charms class, because of the noise level, is a good place for private conversations. We see one class in which the object of the class is to change vinegar into wine. Professor Flitwick approaches to see how they are doing; Hermione is successful immediately, but Harry's vinegar turns to ice, and Ron's explodes. Professor Flitwick assigns the charm as homework.

When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle at the Astronomy Tower]] starts, Professor McGonagall sends Professor Flitwick to summon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Snape knocks Flitwick out, then, seeing Hermione and Luna outside his office, tells them to tend to Professor Flitwick, who had fallen.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry is in the Ravenclaw common room with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]] summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], Luna [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] her. Shortly after this, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] tries to gain entrance into the common room, but without being able to answer the question posed by the guardian, is unable to enter. When Professor McGonagall appears, drawn by the noise, Amycus demands that she summon Flitwick, then that she open the door to the common room.

After the Carrows are both out of action, Professor McGonagall heads towards the Gryffindor common room to get the students out of bed and into the Great Hall. On the way, she sends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronuses]] to summon Flitwick, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Pomona Sprout]], the other heads of house. Flitwick is just arriving as McGonagall duels with Snape, and then is involved in casting protective charms around the school. He takes some part in the battle for the school that then follows.

== Strengths ==

As he is the Charms teacher, we can expect that he has significantly more skill at Charms than the average wizard. He apparently was a dueling champion in the past and still demonstrates his skills when fighting Death Eaters.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Flitwick is said to be Hermione's favorite teacher, due to the fact that he teaches one of her best subjects.

== Overview ==

'''''Rolanda Hooch''''' is the flying instructor and one of the inter-house Quidditch referees at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her teaching is stern and regimental.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Madam Hooch first appears preparing a class of first-years including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] for their first flying lesson. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] breaks his wrist falling off his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]], she leaves the scene to take him to the Hospital Wing. Following her departure, Harry flies on his broom to recover a stolen item, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] witnesses his flying talent. As a direct result, McGonagall subsequently employs him as the new Gryffindor Quidditch team Seeker. Madam Hooch doesn't appear teaching Harry again, which leads the reader to the conclusion that Harry is beyond the help of such lessons. Given [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s evident lack of skill with the broom, it is unlikely that flying lessons were discontinued thereafter.

Madam Hooch referees the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin; that duty is taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] for the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. We do not see the match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw as Harry is in the Hospital Wing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

The next school year, Madam Hooch refereed the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match, during which Harry Potter, the Gryffindor Seeker, was attacked by a jinxed Bludger. The mystery was how the Bludger was jinxed, since it had been kept safe and locked in Madam Hooch's office. She was forced to stop the game momentarily for the Gryffindors while they deliberated over the rogue Bludger, but they ultimately decided to continue playing, as otherwise they would have had to forfeit the match.

The Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match followed later on in the year, but was cancelled by Professor McGonagall shortly after Madam Hooch had released the balls and began the game. The reason for the cancellation was that Hermione Granger and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]] had been found Petrified near the library.

Near the end of the year, Madam Hooch and the rest of the staff were called to the staffroom by Professor McGonagall, who had become temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts in Professor Dumbledore's absence. McGonagall told the professors that a student had been kidnapped by the monster and taken into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]. After this revelation, Madam Hooch sank weak-kneed into a chair and asked who had been taken; Professor McGonagall said that it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Madam Hooch referees the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, which takes place despite severe weather conditions and poor visibility.

After an attack on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] details Madam Hooch to &quot;keep an eye&quot; on Harry during Quidditch practices for the purpose of his safety. Furthermore, McGonagall confiscates Harry's newly received racing broom, a Firebolt, so that Madam Hooch can search it for any Dark magic. When Harry receives the broom with its clean bill of health, Madam Hooch is quite taken with it, and rhapsodizes over it for some time before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] can remind her that they are there to practice. She then falls asleep in the stands while practice is going on.

Madam Hooch referees the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, and again at the final between Gryffindor and Slytherin. The final is a violent match, and Madam Hooch several times comments that she has never seen such flagrant fouls committed.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Madam Hooch referees the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and again it is a very dirty match. It is noted at the end that Madam Hooch does not notice the Bludger hit on Harry after the final whistle, as she is then scolding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] for having fouled Harry just before the match ended. She then noticed Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George Weasley]] apparently attacking Draco Malfoy. She uses an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Impedimenta|Impediment Jinx]] on Harry to break up the fight, then sends Harry and George to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall's]] office for discipline.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===
 
Madam Hooch referees the match between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams. Shortly after the game started, Slytherin Seeker Harper deliberately collided with Harry Potter in the hopes of steering him in the wrong direction. As this was a foul (Blurting), the Gryffindor crowd screamed at Hooch to award a penalty to their team, but her back was turned and she did not see the foul. The game concluded with Harry Potter's capture of the Golden Snitch.

== Overview ==

'''''Minerva McGonagall''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] professor at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She is also Head of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor House]] and Deputy Headmistress. McGonagall also has the distinction of being one of the seven licensed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]] of the 20th Century, being able to transform at will into a tabby cat (with distinctive markings around its eyes, similar to the square-shaped spectacles she wears).

Professor McGonagall is described as being tall, severe-looking, and has dark hair usually tied up in a bun. 

It is never mentioned in the series if McGonagall ever married or had children, but her entry on the Pottermore website has more information. She was raised in Scotland, the eldest of three children born to a witch mother and a Muggle father, a Presbyterian minister. Being Scottish, she often wears tartan. 

McGonagall attended Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor House. She was an exceptional student, particularly in Transfiguration, studying under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Albus Dumbledore]]. After graduation, she worked for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] for several years, then declined a big promotion to instead teach at Hogwarts, staying there for the remainder of her career. According to the author, Minerva McGonagall's birthday is 4 October, and she is about seventy years old when the series begins.

McGonagall's wand is fir and dragon heartstring.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Minerva McGonagall, who we first see in her cat shape, meets with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] as baby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4, Privet Drive]]. As they discuss the recent events that have brought Harry there, McGonagall unsuccessfully argues against Dumbledore leaving the infant with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|aunt]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|uncle]], calling them, &quot;the very worst sort of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]].&quot; McGonagall also suggests that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] might not have been the best choice to carry the infant Harry from his now-destroyed home in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]].

Ten years later, McGonagall greets the first-years at the school's entrance and escorts them into the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony. Harry quickly realizes she is the wrong person to ever cross. However, he nearly does just that when he is almost late to his first Transfiguration lesson.

At breakfast in the Great Hall some days later, McGonagall stops a confrontation that would have pitted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and his cronies against Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]. 

During Harry's first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|flying lesson]], McGonagall spots him flying &quot;like a natural&quot; and recruits him for the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team, even though first-years are normally ineligible. Against school policy, she provides him a new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] – a Nimbus 2000.

At Hallowe'en, Harry and Ron defeat a mountain troll that was about to attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] in the girls' bathroom. To cover for them, Hermione tells McGonagall that she intended to tackle it herself, but that Harry and Ron came to her aid; McGonagall penalizes Hermione five House points while rewarding Harry and Ron five points each&amp;mdash;for sheer dumb luck.

When Harry is caught wandering the halls after hours and for &quot;making up some cock-and-bull story about a dragon,&quot; it is McGonagall who metes out punishment. She penalizes her own house 50 points each for the three involved students, Harry, Hermione, and Neville&lt;!-- reminder to editors: at this point Ron is in the hospital wing suffering from a dragon bite--&gt; – 150 points – as well as assigning detention. She similarly penalized Draco Malfoy for wandering the halls.

Harry startles McGonagall when he reveals he knows about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], but when he presses to see Professor Dumbledore, she says he was summoned to London. This results in Harry, Ron, and Hermione deciding to go through the trap door to protect the Stone.

McGonagall's part in guarding the Philosopher's Stone was to create a giant enchanted chess set, that forces Ron to play a game through, before it will allow Harry and Hermione to pass on to the next barrier.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry and Ron crash into the Whomping Willow with the flying car, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] sends for Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore. After hearing their story, Dumbledore leaves Professor McGonagall, their House Head, to determine their punishment. She gives both boys detentions but does not dock any House points. The detention she issues them, some few days later, is for Ron, under the supervision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], to polish all the trophies in the Hogwarts trophy cases, while Harry has to assist [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] answer his fan mail. Harry appeals to her to switch their assigned detentions, but Professor McGonagall says Professor Lockhart had specifically requested Harry.

Harry, following a voice that apparently only he can hear, finds himself in the second floor hallway. Words are scrawled on a wall and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]], Filch's cat, is hung off a torch bracket. In Professor Lockhart's office, Professor Dumbledore examines Mrs. Norris and determines she is only petrified, not dead. When Filch demands that someone be punished, Snape says that he believes Harry knows more than he is telling and suggests suspending him from Quidditch. McGonagall refuses to accept such severe punishment, and Dumbledore reminds Snape that Harry is innocent until proven guilty.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] are found petrified, Professor McGonagall escorts Harry to Professor Dumbledore's office, then leaves, allowing Harry and Dumbledore to speak privately.

When Professor Dumbledore is suspended as Headmaster, McGonagall becomes the interim Headmistress.

Professor McGonagall cancels a Quidditch match after Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]] are found petrified. She takes Harry and Ron to see Hermione in the hospital wing, and asks if they know anything about what has been happening; they are unable to answer. She informs the Gryffindors that security restrictions have been enacted.

Ignoring the restrictions, Harry and Ron sneak off to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle's]] bathroom where they suspect the Chamber of Secret's entrance is hidden. When they encounter McGonagall along the way, Harry claims they were going to visit Hermione in the infirmary. Touched by this apparent concern for their friend, McGonagall allows them to continue, only now they must actually visit Hermione. In her petrified hand, they discover a clue revealing the Chamber's secret. While waiting in the staff room to tell McGonagall what they have found, an announcement orders all students to their Common room. As the teachers enter the staff room, Harry and Ron hide in a closet. McGonagall tells the other teachers that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] has been abducted. McGonagall assists in goading Lockhart into entering the Chamber to find the Monster and rescue Ginny, as he has claimed to know where it is and what the monster is. Once he leaves &quot;to prepare,&quot; she details plans for closing the school.

In Professor McGonagall's office after their return from the Chamber, Harry and Ron describe what happened in the Chamber and the events leading up to it. Dumbledore sends McGonagall to arrange a celebratory feast. Later, to the now-revived Hermione's dismay, Professor McGonagall announces that all final exams have been canceled.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Following Harry's unpleasant encounter with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] on the Hogwarts Express, Professor McGonagall takes him and Hermione into her office. She summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], who is glad that they now have a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]]) who actually knows some medical remedies (chocolate being the antidote to the after-effects of Dementors). Professor McGonagall suggests he rest, but Harry insists he is fine and requests permission to attend the Welcome Feast. McGonagall consents but asks to speak privately with Hermione. Harry does not discover why until later.

During Transfiguration class, McGonagall lectures about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]] and is surprised that students fail to react when she transforms herself into a cat. When told that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] had predicted a student will die soon, she seems to have to restrain herself from criticizing another teacher or subject, but she reassures them by saying that Trelawney predicts a student's death every year and none have yet died.

When Harry asks McGonagall if he can go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] for the weekend outing, despite lacking written permission from Uncle Vernon, McGonagall refuses. She will not stretch the rules that far.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]] give Harry a magical parchment called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] that shows secret passageways in and out of Hogwarts. Harry follows a tunnel into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], meeting up with Hermione and Ron. Together they visit the Three Broomsticks, where they eavesdrop on a conversation between Professor McGonagall, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], Hagrid, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]]. Harry learns that his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], is believed responsible for revealing his parents' secret whereabouts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]&amp;mdash;information that led to their murders. He also learns the circumstances surrounding Black's arrest and later conviction.

When Hermione informs McGonagall that Harry received an expensive Firebolt broom from an unknown person for Christmas, McGonagall confiscates it, saying that Professor Flitwick and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] will inspect it for any concealed Dark Magic.

After several months, and much nagging by Gryffindor Quidditch captain [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], Professor McGonagall returns the Firebolt, saying it is believed to be clean. Harry flies a marvelous match on it. The match is marred only by apparent Dementors arriving on the pitch, though Harry is able to defend himself from them by use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]] that he has learned. The Dementors turn out to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]], the Slytherin team captain. McGonagall gives all four of them detentions and penalizes Slytherin 50 House points.

Following the Quidditch victory celebration, the House is awoken during the night by Ron's screams&amp;mdash;Sirius Black was in his dorm. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], the guardian of the Gryffindor tower, tells McGonagall that he granted access to someone who had a password list. McGonagall is furious to discover it is Neville Longbottoms's list, cancels his Hogsmeade weekends, and forbids him from having the password. Other students must now let him into the Gryffindor common room. After Black's break-in, Professor McGonagall tells Harry what he already knows: Black is trying to get to him.

Harry learns that Professor McGonagall gave Hermione a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turner]] at the beginning of the year so she could attend extra classes (taught at the same time). Harry and Hermione use it go back in time to save [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] from being destroyed and to free Sirius Black, who Harry has learned is innocent. Exhausted from the heavy workload, Hermione drops her extra courses and resumes a normal class schedule. She returns the Time-Turner to Professor McGonagall.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

As the returning students enter the entrance hall, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] welcomes them with water balloons. Professor McGonagall orders him out. At the Arrival Feast, when Dumbledore announces that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] is being revived, Fred Weasley is heard to exclaim, &quot;You're joking!&quot; This apparently prompts Dumbledore into telling a (perhaps inappropriate) joke, which Professor McGonagall interrupts by pointedly clearing her throat.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] attempts to Curse Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] Transfigures him into a white ferret, bouncing him in the air a few times, much to Harry's and Ron's amusement. Professor McGonagall, arriving on the scene, forcefully warns Moody that transfiguration is never used as punishment, and transforms Draco back. McGonagall then tells Moody that he must instead talk to Professor Snape, head of Slytherin. Moody heads off to the dungeons with Draco.

Transfiguration class seems to have more homework than the previous year; Professor McGonagall explains that the increased homework the fourth-year students are being assigned is to prepare them for next year's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.]] exams.

Shortly before the competing school representatives are to arrive, Professor McGonagall is heard exhorting her House to be on its best behaviour. In particular, she requests that Neville Longbottom conceal that he is unable to master even a simple Switching Spell.

When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] unexpectedly chooses Harry as a fourth Triwizard Champion, he and the other three Champions meet with the competition judges: Professor Dumbledore, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Professor Karkaroff]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Professor McGonagall is present, as are Professor Snape and Professor Moody. McGonagall's contribution is limited; when it is suggested that Professor Dumbledore had drawn the age line incorrectly, allowing an underage Harry to enter his own name, McGonagall declares loyally that Dumbledore could not have made a mistake.

McGonagall, appearing tense and somewhat on edge, escorts Harry to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] enclosure for the first task, leaving him there with the other Champions.

During Transfiguration class shortly after the First Task, Professor McGonagall announces that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] is part of the Triwizard Tournament. Fourth-year and above will be allowed to attend, as will younger students as their guests. McGonagall privately tells Harry that the Champions and their partners traditionally lead the way into the Ball and to have the first dance. Harry is shocked: he has only a month to find a date, learn to dance, and prepare to lead the schools into the ball.

At the Ball, McGonagall takes the four Champions aside to say they will be entering in procession after the other students are seated.

As Harry, Hermione, and Ron are researching ways that Harry can breathe underwater for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] arrive to summon Hermione and Ron to Professor McGonagall's office. It is revealed later that they have been chosen to be charmed and handed over to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] as &quot;hostages&quot; that the Champions must &quot;rescue&quot; underwater for the Second Task.

Near the end of May, Professor McGonagall sends Harry to the Quidditch pitch to receive instructions about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]].

Immediately prior to the Third Task, Professor McGonagall tells Harry that the Champions and their families are congregating in a small room off the Great Hall. Harry, not expecting anyone, remains in the Great Hall until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts Champion, summons him. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] have come to watch him compete.

Professor McGonagall, with Hagrid, Professor Moody, and Professor Flitwick, will patrol the maze's outer perimeter during the Third Task, rescuing anyone who fails the challenges.

When Harry returns from the duel with Voldemort in the graveyard, Moody, against Dumbledore's instructions, escorts Harry to his office. Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, and Professor Snape rescue Harry by breaking down the door and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunning]] Moody. McGonagall wants to send Harry to the Hospital Wing, but Dumbledore overrules her, saying that Harry needs to know what has happened and why. Dumbledore sends McGonagall to fetch a large black dog waiting in Hagrid's pumpkin patch and take it to his office. Moody's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|dose of Polyjuice Potion]] wears off, and when McGonagall returns, she is stunned to see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] lying on the office floor.

After Barty's confession, Professor Dumbledore leaves McGonagall to guard him, and takes Harry to his office to see Sirius Black and discuss that night's events. Harry is then taken to the Hospital Wing, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] gives him a dreamless sleep potion. Professor McGonagall's noisy arrival awakens Harry. She reports that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] that accompanied Cornelius Fudge to Hogwarts instantly administered the &quot;Kiss&quot; to Barty Crouch, sucking out his soul. Barty can no longer tell anyone anything.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

We learn that Professor McGonagall is a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] when Harry, then staying at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|the Order's headquarters]] sees her arriving, looking somehow odd in Muggle clothes.

Professor McGonagall is, if course, at the Arrival Feast and presides over the Sorting ceremony. She seems to be among the few teachers able to listen to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s droning &quot;welcome speech&quot;.

On the first day of classes, Professor McGonagall hands out timetables. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, Harry argues with Professor Umbridge about whether or not Voldemort has returned. He is given a note that he must take to McGonagall, where he learns he has been given detention every day for a week. McGonagall asks if he had understood Umbridge's welcoming speech, and Harry suggests it means that the Ministry was going to be taking a more active hand in running Hogwarts. McGonagall comments that she is glad Harry at least listens to Hermione. She then warns Harry to be cautious around Umbridge, especially in keeping his temper, to give her the least possible reason to punish Harry.

While leaving detention, Harry runs into Ron, who notices his cut and bleeding hand. Ron demands that Harry tell McGonagall, though Harry stubbornly demurs, insisting it is a personal issue between him and Umbridge now.

When Harry gets another week's detention, McGonagall additionally penalizes him House points, for failing to heed her advice to avoid antagonizing Umbridge.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] is injured while delivering Sirius' message to Harry, he takes her to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] in the staff room. Professor McGonagall is also there, and she warns Harry that all communication channels in and out of Hogwarts are likely being monitored.

Draco Malfoy's taunts combined with an after-the-whistle Bludger from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] result in a brawl after a Quidditch match against Slytherin. Harry and George Weasley are called into McGonagall's office and assigned a week's detention. But Umbridge, appearing with a new Educational Decree, overrules her, and instead imposes a lifetime Quidditch ban on the two boys and confiscates their brooms. Fred Weasley is also banned, even though he was not involved. Umbridge ignores McGonagall's protests that the punishment is out of line.

Just before Christmas, Harry dreams he is a snake attacking someone in a long hallway. Waking up, he tells Ron that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|his father]] is being attacked and needs help. Professor McGonagall takes Harry and Ron to Professor Dumbledore's office. After hearing Harry's story, Dumbledore sends two portraits, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dilys Derwent|Dilys]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Everard|Everard]], to investigate. When the portraits return, reporting that the man was found but is badly hurt, Dumbledore sends McGonagall to fetch the other Weasley children. McGonagall asks about contacting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly]], but Dumbledore says that is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes']] job. Shortly after McGonagall returns with Fred, George, and Ginny, Dumbledore sends her to head off Umbridge. She evidently is successful, as neither appears in Dumbledore's office before the Weasley children and Harry have left.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] warns Harry that Umbridge is on her way to catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|&quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot;]]. Harry alone is captured, and Umbridge escorts him to Professor Dumbledore's office. Waiting there are Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] acting as scribe, and two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Shacklebolt]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]], a student, has also been brought as a witness. Umbridge claims Harry held an illegal meeting at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]]. When she says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Willy Widdershins|Willy Widdershins]] provided her the information, McGonagall comments that she had wondered how he had gotten off so lightly for all those regurgitating toilets. When Fudge attempts to have Dumbledore arrested, a bursting white light knocks out him and the other Ministry officials. McGonagall has pushed Harry and Marietta safely to the floor. Dumbledore makes sure the three are unharmed, then departs.

Harry meets with McGonagall to discuss his career plans to become an Auror, only to find Umbridge is also there. Umbridge continually interrupts McGonagall, claiming Harry's &quot;criminal&quot; record will prevent his becoming an Auror. McGonagall, outraged, vows to do everything possible to help him achieve his goal. Harry leaves as their argument escalates.

With Dumbledore's departure, as well as Fred and George Weasley's exit, the school has become largely unmanageable. In silent rebellion, the teachers do nothing to help Umbridge regain control. At one point, McGonagall walks, apparently uncaring, past Peeves as he unscrews a crystal chandelier, though she might have told him that it turned the other way.

Umbridge, accompanied by multiple Aurors, attempts to sack Hagrid. Apparently attracted by the confusion and wand flashes, McGonagall runs to Hagrid's aid, but is simultaneously hit by four [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunners]]. When Harry envisions Voldemort torturing Sirius Black, he attempts to speak with McGonagall, the only Order member he can think of, but she has been taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. As a result, Harry attempts to contact Sirius directly by using Professor Umbridge's fireplace, and is caught.

Harry, distraught over Sirius' death, nearly gets into a duel with Draco Malfoy, who blames Harry for his father being sentenced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison. Professor Snape intervenes, then prepares to penalize Harry House points, only to discover the Gryffindor hourglass is empty. Professor McGonagall happens to return from St. Mungo's, recovered but still physically weak and using a walking stick. She sends Draco and his cronies off, then awards House points to all students who participated in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the battle at the Ministry]]. She then subtracts the points that Snape intended to deduct.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] chases Umbridge from the school, Professor McGonagall is upset because she unable to get outside to cheer Peeves on without her walking stick, which Peeves is using.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At the beginning of the year, Professor McGonagall hands out timetables to the sixth-year students. The process is complicated because the courses that students can take are limited by their OWL scores. Hermione gets her courses straight away. Neville cannot take [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] with only an Acceptable OWL, but his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] grade is high enough for that course. While Neville is reluctant, saying that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother]] believes Charms is a soft option, McGonagall comments that Augusta having failed her Charms OWL is no reason for her to argue against it. McGonagall informs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] are splitting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] classes. Harry's lost hope to become an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] revives when Professor McGonagall tells him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] accepts lower OWL grades than Professor Snape did for NEWT-level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] classes. Both Harry and Ron enroll. Professor McGonagall also hands Harry a list with prospective [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] players for the House team.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne carry a necklace that cursed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] back to the school. McGonagall has Professor Snape inspect it. Harry, over Ron and Hermione's objections, states that Draco Malfoy must be involved. McGonagall says that Draco was serving detention in her office during the attack.

We see McGonagall briefly in the Quidditch match following Ron's birthday. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] is commentating, and while the school seems vastly amused by her announcements, McGonagall is heard correcting her several times.

When Harry, defending himself against Draco, uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]], Snape gives him detention every Saturday for the remainder of the year. It is mentioned that McGonagall agrees with Snape's setting this amount of detention.

While we never see her in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle with the Death Eaters]], she is in the Hospital Wing after Dumbledore's death while they figure out what had happened. She is so shocked upon hearing that Dumbledore was killed by Snape, that Madam Pomfrey conjures her a chair. She said that Dumbledore had always said he trusted Snape, for good reason. Harry says that he knows the reason Dumbledore trusted Snape: Snape had carried the prophecy about Harry to Voldemort, and then repented of that to Dumbledore. McGonagall blames herself for sending Professor Flitwick to fetch Snape.

McGonagall reports that when Dumbledore and Harry left for the sea cave, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] had been on patrol. Harry tells McGonagall that the Death Eaters entered through the linked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinets]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

McGonagall, as acting Headmaster, must make decisions about the school's future. She summons the other heads of Houses, Professor Flitwick, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], and Professor Slughorn to meet in the Headmaster's office; she also asks Harry and Hagrid. There, under Dumbledore's newly-present portrait, before the others arrive, McGonagall asks Harry what he and Dumbledore had been doing. Harry demurs, saying that he had been instructed to keep their activities secret, and Dumbledore had not said he should stop following his orders if he died. McGonagall and the other teachers decide the school should remain open, but McGonagall asks if the students should be sent home early. Harry points out that many will want to stay for Dumbledore's funeral. The Hogwarts Express is scheduled for the day after the funeral. Seeing the Minister for Magic approaching the school with a delegation, McGonagall quickly dismisses Harry.

McGonagall is present at the funeral, but we do not speak with her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

It seems surprising that McGonagall, acting Headmistress following Dumbledore's demise in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], and Deputy Headmistress since the series' beginning, was not made Headmistress; however, given Voldemort's interest in Hogwarts, it was probable that only a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] would receive the post, thus making Severus Snape's appointment as Headmaster logical.

Professor McGonagall remains unseen until the book's conclusion. McGonagall is called upon to unlock the Ravenclaw common room for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]], as the way to open the common room door is to answer a philosophical question posed by the eagle-head door knocker, and Amycus is unable to answer it. When Amycus finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto]] lying unconscious in the Ravenclaw common room, he decides to frame the Ravenclaw students for her having summoned Voldemort. When McGonagall objects, Amycus tries to override her, spitting on her in the process. Harry, concealed under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|curses]] Amycus, knocking him out. McGonagall quickly binds both Amycus and Alecto, then summons the other three House Heads as she and Harry, hidden under his cloak, head for her office. Severus Snape suddenly appears, demanding to know what is happening. Snape's suspicions of McGonagall's explanation escalates into a fierce duel. Snape breaks and runs when Flitwick and Sprout, followed by Slughorn, approach, and Snape crashes through a window, soaring away.

McGonagall orders the castle to prepare for battle. Harry, returning to the Room of Requirement, is unable to find Ron and Hermione. He heads to the Great Hall, hoping they will be among the other students gathering there. McGonagall informs the school that Professor Snape has &quot;resigned,&quot; resulting in cheers from all but Slytherin. Underage students are to be evacuated, along with any older students wishing to leave. Voldemort's booming voice interrupts her, stating that if Harry is turned over, no one will be harmed, otherwise, at midnight, he will be forcefully taken. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]], at the Slytherin table, aims her wand at Harry; the other Houses quickly jump to Harry's defence, and McGonagall orders all Slytherins to be evacuated. She then reminds Harry that he is searching for something.

McGonagall then marshals Hogwarts' defence, mobilizing the armour, along with other enchanted objects, to defend the school during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]].

During a break in hostilities, Harry views Snape's memories in the Pensieve and sees that Professor McGonagall was present at Snape's Sorting, some twenty years before.

In the final battle, Voldemort is simultaneously dueling McGonagall, Shacklebolt, and Slughorn. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] is felled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], Voldemort sweeps the three aside to attack Molly, but is thwarted by Harry from under his Invisibility Cloak.

McGonagall is glimpsed at the victory celebration, but Harry is too tired to speak to her just then, and simply wants to get away.

== Strengths ==

McGonagall is a highly intelligent and powerful witch, particularly adept at Transfiguration. Although a strict teacher, she has her students' respect. Despite her discipline often being severe, it is always fair and even-handed, nor does she show favoritism to her own House, several times deleting points from any misbehaving Gryffindor student. Professor McGonagall possesses a tender side, and always considers the students' welfare to be her most important vocation, but she takes pains to conceal it.

McGonagall is extremely loyal to Albus Dumbledore and his causes. She was one of his most accomplished students in Transfiguration. Although she had a successful Ministry career, she wanted to teach at Hogwarts, where Dumbledore still taught.

In the final books, McGonagall shows she is an extremely adept and quick duelist. It is likely that if she had not elected to follow Dumbledore into education, that she would have made an excellent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], and she is likely a valuable Order of the Phoenix member.

== Weaknesses ==

McGonagall is never portrayed as having any particular weaknesses. Her stern facade likely prevents anyone from getting close to her emotionally, with the possible exception of Dumbledore. We are led to believe that she prefers her solitude.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It is hard to imagine the stern and staid Professor McGonagall &quot;letting her hair down&quot; to any great extent, which makes it difficult to imagine that she has many close relationships. However, she enjoys a warm friendship with Albus Dumbledore, and seems on friendly terms with the other Hogwarts teachers, including Severus Snape (up until Dumbledore's death) and Professor Slughorn, who becomes head of Slytherin. Also, her concern for Harry's well-being seems more than would be the result of his merely being a student in her House, or even his potential to cause Voldemort's final downfall. 

The author has revealed on Pottermore.com, that the young McGonagall fell in love with a handsome Muggle, Dougal McGregor. She never revealed to him that she was a witch, and, unwilling to continually hide this from other Muggles, broke off their engagement after one day to fully pursue a Wizarding life. McGonagall understood the enormous strain on her parents' marriage caused by her Muggle father's eventual discovery that he had married a witch. This factored into McGonagall's decision to end the relationship with McGregor. McGonagall later had another suitor, her former Ministry boss, Elphinstone Urqhuart, whose many marriage proposals she continually declined throughout the years until much later in life, and then only after her first love, Dougal, had died. Their marriage was happy but short-lived, ending just three years later when Elphinstone was fatally bitten by a venomous tentacula plant. McGonagall had kept her maiden name when she married.

== Analysis ==

Professor McGonagall is portrayed as an older witch who takes great pains to hide her more sensitive side, perhaps fearing it will be construed as weakness and exploited against her. She is moderately successful at this, to the point that Harry is surprised when she shows him any special consideration. In particular, when Harry is sent to Professor McGonagall as a consequence of his first, disastrous Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson with Professor Umbridge, McGonagall offers him a cookie. Harry apparently considers this so uncharacteristic that he initially refuses. Harry is always surprised when he sees a lapse in her severity.

To a certain extent, McGonagall is a stock character, the &quot;stern but fair&quot; instructor. A staple in fiction of all sorts, but particularly in fiction about schools, this character often is seen as being in direct conflict with the strongly biased instructor who is opposed to the hero; in this series, of course, that biased character would be Severus Snape. The story arc requires that Snape's character be more complex than the stereotype allows, so he does get more time &quot;on stage&quot; than almost any other instructor; this means that Professor McGonagall is somewhat more in the background than usual for her role. Where McGonagall breaks away from the stock character is in her ongoing concern for Harry. We can see that McGonagall is deeply concerned for Harry's wellbeing, but knowing that she should not show favoritism for any student, she tries to conceal it as much as possible. We see it in small things: her warnings to Harry about dealings with Umbridge, and her stated determination to get him into the Auror program, for example. If we examine McGonagall's actions throughout the story, we see that in her public actions, such as grades, detentions, House points awards and penalties, McGonagall is fair almost to a fault. It is in her private actions, her concern for Harry's health after the Dementor episode, her meetings with Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and the episode of the Nimbus 2000 in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', that we see her concern for Harry.

To a very small extent, McGonagall serves as something of a foil for Professor Dumbledore. The only time in the series that we see the two of them interacting directly is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|the first chapter of the first book]], where McGonagall protests Dumbledore's choice of a permanent home for the infant Harry. It is interesting there to see the obvious mutual respect between these two characters, despite the fact that they have taken opposite sides of an argument. That respect is also seen in other scenes in the series where Dumbledore and McGonagall are together. Generally, when McGonagall and Dumbledore are on stage together, apart from the instance mentioned above, they are together dealing with another issue which forms the focus of the scene; often, that focus is Harry. Despite this, we can see that there is still some interaction between Dumbledore and McGonagall, with McGonagall being a moderating influence on all parties, while exhibiting staunch loyalty to Dumbledore.

== Overview ==

'''''Irma Pince''''' is the librarian of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She is described to be a &quot;thin, irritable woman who looks like an underfed vulture.&quot; From the very little we see of her, we can guess that she is very impatient, and stereotypically we would guess her to have small glasses on her nose, which would probably be pointy. It is most likely she was in Ravenclaw house, guessing from her job and the location of the library.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Madam Pince is librarian when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] first arrives at the school. As Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] search the library for a book containing information about Nicolas Flamel, Pince was considered someone to avoid, as she could warn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] of their activities. Once, she saw Harry edging towards the Restricted Section of the Library and asked him what he was looking for. When he answered &quot;nothing,&quot; she sent him out of the library.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] seems to be hiding a book from Madam Pince when the Trio see him in the library. It turns out to be a book on raising [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]], and Hagrid promises to explain why he needs that book later.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Madam Pince was among the crowd who read the Heir of Slytherin's message on the second-floor corridor of the Castle.

A while later, Madam Pince is seen supervising the students at Study Hall, and was seen talking to a female student. It is unknown if she regularly oversaw the study hall, or if it was a one-time event.

Later, Hermione Granger arrived at the library with a note written by the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher allowing her to retrieve the volume ''Moste Potente Potions'' from the Restricted Section. She gave it to Madam Pince, albeit reluctantly, wanting to keep [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart's]] autograph, and Pince studied the note very thoroughly, checking for forgery. She then went into the Restricted Section and handed over the book, despite still appearing suspicious.

Madam Pince is seen attending the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match. She seems shocked when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is hurt.

Madam Pince attends the End-of-Term Feast at the end of the school year, in which she sat by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] master, Severus Snape.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry does spend some time in the library, but we don't hear much about Madam Pince in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

As part of the preparation for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione are looking for ways that Harry can breathe underwater for an hour. After Ron and Hermione are summoned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s office, Harry remains in the library, searching on his own, until Madam Pince chases him out at closing time.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

It is mentioned that Madam Pince kept her usual routine of prowling around the library, breathing down the necks of those touching the books.

During the Easter holidays, she was seen checking out a pile of books for a frantic-looking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]], who was presumably revising for her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.s]].

Harry is studying in the library when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] brings him his Easter gift from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]: a large chocolate egg. Harry is distracted; he has just learned something extremely disturbing about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father]] and needs to talk to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] about it. Ginny tells him that, living as long as she has with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], she has learned that nothing is actually impossible. Harry has been distractedly eating his chocolate egg while they have been talking, and Madam Pince spots this potential damage to her precious books and chases them both out of the library, enchanting their possessions to attack them as they flee. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Madam Pince is seen in the library, prowling around the bookshelves and protecting her tomes. 

At one point, as it approaches the 8:00 PM closing time, Madam Pince tells all of the students to return the books back to their shelves and leave. When she reaches the table where Harry and Hermione are sitting, she notices the Half-Blood Prince's highly annotated copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Enraged, she screams about how the book was &quot;despoiled&quot; and &quot;befouled&quot;, and ignoring Harry's claims that it was his own personal copy, almost appears to have a seizure.

Madam Pince was seen in the Entrance Hall prior to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] funeral, standing by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]], and wearing a thick black veil that fell to her knees. It is likely she attended the funeral.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It has been suggested that Irma Pince and Argus Filch have a relationship, by many fans, and in fact by Harry and Ginny in conversation. There is little evidence supporting this relationship anywhere else in the series, though some fans have suggested that the &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; of the title of the sixth book might actually be the son of these two, and &quot;Prince&quot; might be a typo for &quot;Pince&quot;. The final chapters of that book, however, name the Prince (Eileen Prince) and her son (Severus Snape), which rules out that possibility.

Irma is apparently obsessed with her books, and she treats students and teachers with almost equal suspicion, worried that they might be putting her precious books at risk. We never see anyone, apart from Filch on one occasion, with whom she seems to be on reasonable terms; of course, we also never see her away from her precious library. Away from her books, she may be completely different.

== Analysis ==

One thing that anyone who uses a Muggle library is aware of is the helpful nature of the librarians there. By and large, if there is something you need to research, a librarian can help you to find it. In many places in the Harry Potter story line, it becomes necessary for the Trio to find some historical fact from the books in the library: in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], for instance, it is necessary to find the identity of Nicolas Flamel; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] the Trio are researching cases where dangerous creatures won their trials, and later won their appeals; and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Harry needs a way to survive for an hour underwater. In all of these cases, a helpful librarian would have short-circuited the process of finding the answer and would have decreased Hermione's participation. Madam Pince's monumental obstructiveness thus can be seen as important to the story, both as a means of pacing, and as a means of making Hermione, with her library research skills, more valuable to the partnership.

== Overview ==

'''''Poppy Pomfrey''''' is the school nurse for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her office is in the Hospital Wing, and she is usually to be found there, but on occasion will attend patients elsewhere on the grounds.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Madam Pomfrey is first mentioned when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is helping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] take care of his pet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]], Norbert. Norbert bites Ron, but Ron doesn't want to go to the Hospital Wing for fear of revealing Norbert's existence. When the bite swells up and turns green, though, he has no choice. Madam Pomfrey seems skeptical of his claim that it's a dog bite, but asks no further questions.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is in the infirmary after his session in the Chamber, we see that Madam Pomfrey is limiting the visitors that he can have. She is somewhat put out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] has insisted that Harry be allowed to attend the Leaving Feast, but allows him to leave the infirmary anyway.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry's wrist is broken playing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] &quot;heals&quot; it by magically removing all the bones from his arm. Once in the infirmary, Madam Pomfrey says that she can heal broken bones almost immediately, but growing an entirely new set is quite a different matter. The potion she gives him, &quot;Skele-Gro&quot;, tastes horrible, but Madam Pomfrey has little sympathy, saying that he is in for an uncomfortable night.

While he is in the Hospital Wing, he is visited by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. Dobby, as usual, has to punish himself; Harry tries to restrain him, fearing that the noise will wake Madam Pomfrey. Madam Pomfrey is undisturbed, however, until Professor Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] bring in a Petrified [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]]. All she can really do for him, though, is set him on one of the beds and pull curtains around him.

Over the course of the year, other students get Petrified and are moved into the infirmary. We can safely assume that Madam Pomfrey is taking care of them as best she is able.

Madam Pomfrey heals [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] after she ingests [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]] contaminated with cat hair. Madam Pomfrey does not question how she had gotten a tail, fur, cat ears, or cat eyes, simply treating the problem.

When Hermione is Petrified, Harry and Ron are taken to the infirmary to see her. Madam Pomfrey is in the background, but does not say anything.

Harry and Ron determine that the Monster in the Chamber may have been the instrument of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s death, and resolve to go and ask her. They are intercepted in the halls by Professor McGonagall, and to explain their absence from class, they say that they are going to see Hermione. Professor McGonagall agrees that they may go and see her, so they must; Madam Pomfrey is mildly vexed, saying that there's no point in visiting someone who is Petrified, they can't hear anyway.

After Ron, Harry, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] return from the Chamber with Professor Lockhart, Professor Dumbledore suggests first that Ginny should go to the Hospital Wing; he says that Madam Pomfrey will be awake, giving out restorative draughts to the Petrified students. He later suggests Ron should take Lockhart to the Hospital Wing to see if Madam Pomfrey can do anything for him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Having encountered a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] on the Hogwarts Express, Harry is called into Professor McGonagall's office as he enters the school. Shortly, Madam Pomfrey bustles in, telling him he needs attention because of the Dementor. Harry says he's feeling fine, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] had given him chocolate on the train. Madam Pomfrey is pleased to hear that for once they have a teacher of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] who knows his remedies. Harry eventually manages to convince Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey that he is all right and can go to the Entrance Feast.

When Dementors invade the Quidditch pitch during the match against Hufflepuff, Harry loses consciousness and falls off his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]]. He awakens in the Hospital Wing, surrounded by the Quidditch team; apparently they lost the match, though nobody blames Harry, except for Harry himself. Madam Pomfrey eventually shoos everyone out except Ron and Hermione.

After the events in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] gathers up the unconscious students, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and takes them to the Hospital Wing. While Harry and Hermione recover relatively quickly, having suffered from the effects of the Dementors, Ron was hit with a curse by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and is receiving care from Madam Pomfrey when they regain consciousness. Madam Pomfrey is scandalized that Snape and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] would be arguing with her charges, specifically Harry and Hermione, and hindering their recovery. She is further upset when Dumbledore demands to speak with Harry and Hermione alone, sending Fudge and Snape away and Madam Pomfrey back to her office.

After Harry and Hermione return from their mission, Madam Pomfrey, unaware that they have been gone, only knowing that Professor Dumbledore has finally left, reappears from her office, demanding to know if she can finally take care of her patients. She is again interrupted by the return of Snape, Fudge, and Dumbledore. She agrees with Dumbledore that Harry and Hermione had been right there all along. As Snape leaves in a huff, and Fudge and Dumbledore leave more quietly, she locks the Hospital Wing door behind them, and resumes her ministrations to Harry and Hermione, who meekly accept massive slabs of chocolate.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], Harry's class is studying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubotuber|Bubotubers]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] tells the class that the treated &quot;pus&quot; can be used against acne. It is mentioned that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Eloise Midgeon|Eloise Midgeon]] had tried to curse her spots off, but that Madam Pomfrey had managed to get her nose attached again.

Immediately after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], Harry is taken into the first aid tent by Madam Pomfrey. He had been struck by the tail of his dragon, and the spikes had wounded his shoulder. She treats his wounds and tells him to sit still for a minute. She then goes to another part of the tent, and Harry hears her checking on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], who is apparently injured worse than Harry is.

Harry, pushed beyond endurance, had dueled with Draco, and his jinx and Draco's had hit each other and been deflected. Draco's jinx had struck Hermione and made her teeth grow tremendously. Mortally embarrassed, she had run to the Hospital Wing. At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Harry notices that Hermione's teeth look different. Hermione tells him that following the duel, Madam Pomfrey had given her a mirror and told her to say when her teeth were the correct size; she had allowed Madam Pomfrey to shrink them to a smaller, and more becoming, size than they had been originally.

Madam Pomfrey is again in evidence immediately following the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], providing blankets and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pepper-Up Potion|Pepper-Up Potion]] to both Champions and rescued hostages, to revive them following their time in the Lake.

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], and his return from the cemetery, Harry is taken off first to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s office, then to Dumbledore's office. When he finally reaches the Hospital Wing, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] are berating Madam Pomfrey, demanding to know what she has done with Harry. At Dumbledore's instructions, Madam Pomfrey brings Harry a sleeping draught. Harry falls asleep before he has finished it.

Harry is awakened by Professor McGonagall returning to the Hospital Wing with Cornelius Fudge, demanding to speak with Dumbledore. Madam Pomfrey tells her that Dumbledore is not there, but he arrives almost immediately. Madam Pomfrey remains in the background while the debate between Fudge and Dumbledore goes on. After Fudge has departed, Dumbledore sends Madam Pomfrey away to care for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]]; she seems rather surprised to be sent to care for a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]], but complies. It turns out that Dumbledore has sent her away so that he can ask Sirius Black to return to his human form; so far this evening, he has appeared in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form, as a large black dog, because he is still believed to be a fugitive murderer and supporter of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

While Madam Pomfrey certainly returns to care for Harry, she is not mentioned directly again in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] has brought [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] to assist in her sacking of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. In the confusion surrounding this event, Professor McGonagall is hit by multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunners]] and is taken to the Hospital Wing. The next day, Harry receives a vision that leads him to believe Sirius is being tortured. Desperate to reach the only member of the Order of the Phoenix still at the school, he goes to the Hospital Wing to see McGonagall, only to have Madam Pomfrey tell him that McGonagall has been taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]].

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]], Hermione, Ginny, Ron, Luna, and Neville are being cared for in the Hospital Wing by Madam Pomfrey. Professor Umbridge, now rescued from her sojourn among the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], is also there receiving treatment. Ron frightens Umbridge by making the sound of hooves; when she sits bolt upright, Madam Pomfrey pops out of her office to see if she is all right.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] touches a jinxed necklace and is cursed, she is taken to the Hospital Wing. We hear from Dumbledore later that Professor Snape has done what he can for her, and she has been sent to St. Mungo's Hospital. At Harry's question as to why Snape, Dumbledore says that he understands the Dark Arts much better than does Madam Pomfrey.

Ron is poisoned on his birthday, and ends up in the Hospital Wing. When we see him there, Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] are with him. Hagrid arrives, and Madam Pomfrey bustles out of her office, saying &quot;Only six visitors to a patient.&quot; Harry points out that Hagrid would be the sixth visitor, and Madam Pomfrey retreats, confused.

Some time later, while Ron is still in the infirmary, Harry is hit by a Bludger and ends up in the Hospital Wing with a cracked skull. While he is there, he recalls that in his second year, he had been visited by Dobby; and has the idea of summoning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] to tail Malfoy for him. When he summons Kreacher, Dobby arrives as well; it seems they are fighting because Kreacher had insulted Harry. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], always happy at the sight of chaos, also arrives; Harry, worried that he will attract Madam Pomfrey, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Langlock|silences]] him, at which he runs away, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muffliato|muffles]] the sound of the struggling house-elves. Harry is able to give Kreacher his assignment without Madam Pomfrey being any the wiser.

After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, in shock, is taken to the Hospital Wing. There, we see Madam Pomfrey tending to Bill's injuries, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] arrives and takes over.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Madam Pomfrey oversees the evacuation of Hogwarts before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]].  In the pause after the death of Snape in the battle, we see her ministering to the fallen.

== Strengths ==
Madam Pomfrey is a gifted, experienced and dedicated healer.  With few exceptions she is able to treat and cure all manner of illness and injury occurring at Hogwarts.  Given the high injury rate due to [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Major_Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]], magical accidents, dangerous creatures and student pranks, Hogwarts is a hazardous place.  Madam Pomfrey's services are frequently called upon.

Madam Pomfrey is also strict and maintains high standards in the hospital.  She is not afraid to stand up to anyone who is compromising the treatment and recovery of a patient, even [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Albus_Dumbledore|Dumbledore]].

== Weaknesses ==

As Madam Pomfrey is a classic example of a minor character, provided to handle a single function, that of running the school infirmary / Hospital Wing, her character is not as fully limned as some. As a result of this, we do not get a feel for where her areas of weakness, if any, may lie.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Madam Pomfrey is portrayed as the classic &quot;mother-hen&quot; character, possibly over-solicitous of those currently in her care and definitely a bit over-protective. This is somewhat tempered by strictness when necessary to effect a cure for her charges; she does not cavil at forcing Harry to drink the horrible &quot;Skele-gro&quot; potion, for instance, and shoos Harry's visitors out when she feels they might be tiring him out. She almost refuses to allow Harry to attend the Leaving Feast in his first year at Hogwarts, and is upset at being overruled by Professor Dumbledore. Similarly, she intends to have Harry in the infirmary at the beginning of his third year, to deal with the effects of his exposure to Dementors, and is somewhat upset when Harry insists that the is all right and doesn't need to visit the Hospital Wing. In this case, it is only because Harry has already received the appropriate remedy from Professor Lupin that she, reluctantly, allows him to go to the Feast.

This solicitousness only extends to those who she is convinced need her care. As an example of one who does not fit this pattern, we have Draco malingering after the injury he received from Buckbeak is cured. Despite his claims to still be in agony, claims that Pansy Parkinson and Professor Snape take at face value, Draco has been sent back to class rather than being kept in the infirmary. While the scene where Madam Pomfrey scolds Draco for faking appears only in the film version of this story, it seems entirely in character and fits with the events we see in the books.

Madam Pomfrey seems to respect Professor Dumbledore, and will take instructions from him insofar as she does not believe them to hinder her caring for her patients.

== Analysis ==

Interestingly, Madam Pomfrey does not ask any questions about how the injuries she is asked to treat were received. We see this first with Ron's dragon bite, which she must be aware is not the dog bite that Ron claims it is, and then later with Hermione's accident with the Polyjuice Potion, which she must be able to recognize in order to treat. Madam Pomfrey, being in charge of an infirmary which is responsible for the care of several hundred cocksure young wizards and witches, must have seen every imaginable magical side effect, and must be able to recognize many of them on sight. It is safe to assume that she recognizes Ron's wound as the result of something like a dragon, and it is almost certain as well that she recognizes the effects of contaminated Polyjuice Potion, but in neither case does she question the lame explanations offered.

Additionally, what happens in the infirmary seems to stay in the infirmary. While she is likely aware that Hermione's affliction over Christmas in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' was caused by Polyjuice Potion, that being one of the potions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-class]] students work with, she does not divulge the nature of Hermione's illness. This is an indication that Madam Pomfrey is discreet when dealing with student injuries, as Professor Snape does not hear about the probable cause of Hermione's illness, and thus does not make the connection between that and the missing ingredients from his stores.

#How does Madam Pomfrey treat the students? 
#Describe Madam Pomfrey in three words.
#(Extra Credit) Madam Pomfrey and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] are both written as strong but motherly types. Yet they present quite differently; Madam Pomfrey would appear to be unlikely to ever use an offensive spell, even to save herself or her charges, while Mrs. Weasley quite readily attacks those who are attacking her children. What differences in their characterization make up this apparent distinction?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Another author, Randall Garrett, has one of his characters mention that the Healing Art is very different from regular sorcery. The example he uses is that of guiding two drunken companions home. The healer's job is simplified by the fact that the subject wants to be healed, and the healer only has to help him along the way; in much the same way, a man can easily help his two drunken friends home without any equipment other than a soft word and a guiding hand. Replace the two drunkards with three hundred pounds of builder's sand, though, and suddenly you need a wheelbarrow, and more strength but less subtlety. This may have something to do with how seldom we see Madam Pomfrey actually using her wand. It is certainly true that Madam Pomfrey seems to be cut from a different sort of sorcerous cloth than the other wizards in our story. While she seems to be as strong a wizard as most we see, her strength does not seem to lie in the same direction; we cannot see her attacking the Death Eaters, though we can easily imagine her defending the Hospital Wing and her charges there with purely defensive spells, probably of great power.

== Overview ==

'''''Professor (Cuthbert) Binns''''' is the History of Magic professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the only professor who is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]. It is believed that he sat down in front of the staff room fireplace, fell asleep and died; the next day, his spirit simply got up and went to class, leaving his body behind. Initially he was unaware he was dead, though apparently was quite shocked upon learning he was no longer alive.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Professor Binns' only function in this book is to teach History of Magic and put the entire class to sleep. That year, Binns taught his first years about historical figures such as Uric the Oddball and Emeric the Evil, which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] always managed to confuse.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione_Granger|Hermione]] convinces Professor Binns to tell the class about the Chamber of Secrets; this upsets him because it is myth, rather than concrete facts. However, he does explain what the myth says, which is instrumental in the later discovery of the actual chamber.

According to Professor Binns, Hogwarts' four Founders had a falling out. One, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], believed the school should only accept students descended from wizard families. The other three Founders strongly disagreed, believing Muggle-borns and Half-bloods should be allowed to study magic. Slytherin then left the school for good, but not before he supposedly created a secret chamber and housed a monster within. Legend claims the Chamber can be opened, and the monster can be controlled, only by Slytherin's true heir. Binns goes on to say that headmaster after headmaster has searched the school, and none found so much as a secret broom closet. Angry at having his lovely historical facts interrupted by this legend, Binns then refuses to speak any more about it, and the class once again subsides into boredom.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Professor Binns' only function in this book is to teach History of Magic and put the entire class to sleep.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Professor Binns' only function in this book is to teach History of Magic and put the entire class to sleep.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Professor Binns' only function in this book is to teach History of Magic and put the entire class to sleep. It is in one of these classes that an injured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] appears at the window; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] brings her in, excuses himself from class saying that he needs to go to the Hospital Wing, and carries Hedwig off to the Staff Room, where he hands her over to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] to have her healed.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

As neither Harry or Ron received a passing grade on his History of Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL]], they no longer attend History of Magic, and Hermione, whether or not she has chosen to drop the subject, never mentions it; thus, Professor Binns has no role in this book.

== Strengths ==

He manages to put the class to sleep (particularly Harry), very effectively.

He acquired much knowledge during his long lifetime, though he does not seem to have added to that knowledge significantly since his death.

== Weaknesses ==

Binns never seems to be particularly aware of his class, or even of the outside world, and what is going on in it. It is uncertain if he has even updated his curriculum since he passed away. Whether this is because he is a ghost or he was also this way in life is unknown. Binns seems to be a particularly ineffective teacher. Harry thinks that the subject material in his class, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]] Wars, might have been far more exciting if it was taught by a different instructor.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Being a ghost, Binns seems relatively detached from flesh-and-blood characters. As there are no references of him appearing among the other ghosts, it seems that he has no special interest in them either. His only interests apparently lie in teaching his classes. Although this requires that he be attentive to his students, his interaction with them appears to end as soon as they leave the classroom. He is even unable to remember his students' names. When Hermione Granger asks about the Chamber of Secrets, he initially does not recall her name, then addresses her as &quot;Miss Grant,&quot; calls [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]] &quot;O'Flaherty,&quot; and addresses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] as &quot;Miss Pennyfeather.&quot; He also calls Harry Potter &quot;Mr. Perkins&quot; when Harry goes to the Staff Room with injured Hedwig.

== Analysis ==

Professor Binns, being a ghost, shares many features common to all ghosts mentioned in the series. Significant analysis of ghosts appears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|on that page]].

It would appear that the only book in which Professor Binns is at all important to the plot is ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. Presumably any character teaching History of Magic could equally serve the purpose here. Professor Binns also has a tiny role in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where Hedwig's appearance at the classroom window is only noticed because the class itself is so dull.

It is never explained why History of Magic is taught by a ghost; we can only speculate that the author thought it would be an interesting conceit to have an effectively dead subject taught by an effectively dead teacher. There is also no explanation for the confusion of names that Professor Binns displays in his one useful interaction with the class; he does seem to get the initial letter of the student's name right (for instance, Parvati ''P''atil becomes Miss ''P''ennyfeather). It is possible that he is simply recalling the names of students that he taught when he was alive, conflating him with the students he finds in front of him.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# The story of Professor Binns' origin does not tally with what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] says about the origin of ghosts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] — see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghost]] for details. What do you think really happened? 
# Professor Binns shuffles his notes on several occasions. Ghosts are unable to interact with material objects. Does Professor Binns have ghostly notes as well? How does Professor Binns mark exam papers? 
#Did Professor Binns choose to become an Earth-bound ghost rather than &quot;moving on&quot;? Explain.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

At first glance, there does seem to be some difference between what Nearly Headless Nick says about how ghosts are created, and what we know about Professor Binns. However, there is more similarity than it initially appears. Ghosts are created when a person feared dying or was unprepared for death. They choose to haunt the Earth rather than &quot;go on&quot;. Professor Binns was probably not expecting to die at that time. He was a long-time teacher and passed away in the staff room waiting for his next class. His dedication to his vocation caused him to arise as a ghost and carry on as a teacher. Death for him would mean shirking his duties, something unthinkable.

We can also speculate about the notes he seems to be carrying. It may be possible that his notes are part of his ghostly persona. Other ghosts keep their clothing and accessories, and we hear several times that Nearly Headless Nick arranges to change the ruff that he wears, so why should Binns not keep his class notes? The fact that they make noise when handled by Binns is no more strange than hearing ghosts talk and converse. The fact that his &quot;ghost notes&quot; cannot be updated might explain why Hermione once commented that they never learn any History of Magic newer than the late 19th Century; presumably that is when Professor Binns died.

'''''Professor Sinistra''''' is the Astronomy professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

It is mentioned that Professor Sinistra is dancing with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] at the Yule Ball.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Astronomy in the Harry Potter world is very different from real astronomy. There are no physics present in the Harry Potter astronomy. Rather, the lesson focuses on nomenclature and its position in relationship to the other planets. The various stars outside of our Solar System, other galaxies, black holes, and other celestial objects play little importance. In short, Harry Potter's astronomy is descriptive.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#How might Astronomy be important in learning about magic? Why is it considered separate from Divination?
#Think about what kind of personality Professor Sinistra might have, and describe it.

== Overview ==

'''''Pomona Sprout''''' is the Herbology professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She is also the Head of Hufflepuff House.

According to a note posted on the Author's web site, Pomona Sprout's birthday is 15 May.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finds that he has Professor Sprout for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]]. He is learning how to care for the herbs and fungi that are used in magic, and their properties.

Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] learn from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] that one of the enchantments guarding the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] was put in place by Professor Sprout. When they go through the trap door, they find that her contribution is a large [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare plant]], which traps Harry and Ron. Hermione manages to conjure fire to force it to retreat and free them.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Professor Sprout, somewhat the worse for wear, enters our story being trailed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]]; it seems Lockhart has been giving her pointers regarding the first aid she is providing for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], which Harry and Ron had driven into the night before. It does not seem that the pointers were much use; Professor Sprout seems somewhat disgruntled when she arrives, and her mood is not lightened when Lockhart asks to speak privately with Harry for a moment.

Once Harry returns to the greenhouse, he finds that Professor Sprout is giving instructions on the repotting of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mandrake|young Mandrake plants]].

The mandrake plants prove necessary over the course of the book as students and others are petrified by an apparently unknown monster. We hear that Professor Sprout has canceled one class in the dead of winter because she needs to fit winter clothing on the Mandrakes and doesn't trust anyone else to help; and over the course of the year we hear about how the Mandrakes are growing and maturing.

Finally, at the end of the year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] announces that Professor Sprout has informed her that the Mandrakes are ready and the potion to revive the petrified students will be administered that evening.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Though we know that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still taking Herbology, we see relatively little of Professor Sprout in this book. We first see Professor Sprout during a Herbology lesson telling Ron Weasley to be careful after he accidentally drops a pile of beans on the greenhouse floor. We also see her at the Christmas feast, along with Harry, Ron, and a very few of the teachers who have elected to remain at Hogwarts over the Christmas break.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Professor Sprout starts the year by telling the students that they will be squeezing pus from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubotuber|Bubotubers]].

The first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], leaves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] severely shaken. Moody asks Neville back to his office for tea, and while he is there, tells him that Professor Sprout has spoken highly of his abilities in Herbology. Moody also gives him a book, ''Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties''.

At the end of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] is murdered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)]]. It is mentioned that Professor Sprout, as head of Cedric's house, is speaking with his parents.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Like so many of the other teachers, Sprout lectures them on importance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]], and assigns an essay. Harry is beginning to wonder where he will find time for all the homework he has been assigned.

The weather in the autumn is absolutely dreadful; it is mentioned at one point that the rain on the greenhouse roofs nearly drowns out the lecture. 

We see Professor Sprout reading [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Prophet'']] at breakfast, when the news of the mass breakout from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] is published. Shortly, we see a conversation between Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Susan Bones|Susan Bones]] in Herbology; and Sprout is mentioned as being in conference with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], apparently concerning this news article, some days later.

Shortly after Harry's interview is published in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']], Professor Sprout, rewarding him for his bravery in speaking out, awards Gryffindor house twenty points when he hands her a watering can.

As time for the exams comes close, one of the major topics for conversation is revising (or studying) and other ways of attempting to ensure success in the exams. Harry is listening to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie's]] recitation of how many hours a week he is studying, and is thankful when Sprout opens the greenhouse door for them, cutting Ernie off. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are harvesting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snargaluff|Snargaluff pods]], Professor Sprout chides them for being slow; it seems that while they are still strapping on their protective gear (and talking), Neville has already harvested his first pod. The Trio's first pod bounces free while they are trying to open it, and rebounds off the glass roof of the greenhouse, knocking Professor Sprout's battered hat off.

When Harry, with the assistance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]], is trying to recover a particular memory from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], he feels impelled to go past the greenhouses. There, he sees Professors Slughorn and Sprout harvesting leaves of some plant for Slughorn's third year Potions class, and talking about how they are most effective when collected at twilight.

Professor Sprout, as head of Hufflepuff house, is present at the meeting of the heads of house at the end of the book, along with Professor McGonagall (as head of Gryffindor and acting Headmaster), Professor Slughorn (as head of Slytherin), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] (as head of Ravenclaw), Hagrid, and Harry. She has little to say at the meeting, but is in favour of the school remaining open.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Pomona Sprout, as the head of Hufflepuff house, is one of the Heads of House that Professor McGonagall summons when she decides to oust the current Headmaster, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and defend Hogwarts against the Death Eaters so that Harry can locate the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Professor Sprout is present when Snape makes his escape, and is in the Great Hall, with the Hufflepuffs, when McGonagall announces the evacuation of the under-age wizards.

We see Professor Sprout acting to defend Hogwarts against the Death Eaters attack. She is one of the teachers assigned to the battlements, and with the help of Neville among others, we see her carrying various magical plants to the tops of the towers to throw down upon the enemy.

== Strengths ==

Professor Sprout is a master herbologist and may have had some skill in dueling as she fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived. Assisted by Neville Longbottom, who became Herbology professor after her, she used her knowledge of plants to attack the Death Eaters.

== Analysis ==

Arithmancy is otherwise known as numerology, which is in fact a real subject. It involves the finding of magical properties of numbers.

In the Harry Potter world, numbers are often inscribed in places, such as tombs, pyramids, and monuments. These numbers supposedly have meaning, either hiding a secret message or protecting the site with a curse. Arithmancy, if applied correctly, allows the practitioner to interpret these findings.

Gringotts curse breakers are required to have sufficient knowledge of Arithmancy.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] repeatedly states that Arithmancy is very useful. What kind of things might be taught in an Arithmancy class, that Hermione would see as being particularly useful?

== Overview ==

'''''Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank''''' is the temporary Care of Magical Creatures professor at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She is called in on a number of occasions when the permanent Care of Magical Creatures teacher is &quot;unwell&quot;, including a long stretch at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s fifth year.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We first meet Professor Grubbly-Plank in the first class after Christmas. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] has gone into hiding because of an article in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''The Daily Prophet'']] which identified him as being half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]]. While Hagrid has been teaching the class about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]], Professor Grubbly-Plank starts off by teaching a class on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorn]], which everyone except Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] feels is more like what they expected to learn in that class. ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] secretly seems to feel that Professor Grubbly-Plank's lessons are more useful than Hagrid's, but we can see her dissembling to spare Hagrid's and Ron's feelings.) Professor Grubbly-Plank continues teaching Care of Magical Creatures for about a week on this occasion, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] persuade Hagrid to return.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry is dismayed upon returning to Hogwarts to find that it is not Hagrid collecting the first-years for their trip across the lake, but Professor Grubbly-Plank.

Professor Grubbly-Plank teaches Harry's class Care of Magical Creatures. When asked about Hagrid's whereabouts, Professor Grubbly-Plank is abrupt and dismissive. Much later, when she is being inspected by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], she tells Umbridge that that she doesn't actually know where Hagrid is. Professor Grubbly-Plank starts the year by teaching about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bowtruckle|Bowtruckles]]; Harry, overhearing comments from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] about Hagrid, is so angered that he nearly squeezes the one he, Ron, and Hermione are supposed to be drawing in half.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] returns from carrying a message for Harry, arriving an hour later than the usual time for post owls and apparently injured – she is holding one wing oddly. Harry leaves History of Magic class, and goes to the staff room to find someone who might be able to help Hedwig; Professor Grubbly-Plank is there, and says she'll have Hedwig back in shape in a few days. Harry and Professor Grubbly-Plank almost forget the message Hedwig is carrying, which is from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].

Inspected by Professor Umbridge in her role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, Professor Grubbly-Plank passes inspection without difficulty, despite the fact that she obviously supports Dumbledore. Professor Grubbly-Plank continues teaching Care of Magical Creatures up until November when Hagrid returns from his mission.

Hagrid mentions that she would come back to teach whenever Umbridge decides to sack him. There is so little time between when Umbridge violently fires Hagrid, and the events in the Ministry where Umbridge is dismissed and Hagrid reinstated, that we do not learn whether Professor Grubbly-Plank has been summoned in the interim.

== Strengths ==

She seems to be very talented in her field, having knowledge of a variety of creatures.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Professor Grubbly-Plank is not around long enough to form any meaningful relationships with any of the characters at Hogwarts. She is seen to claim that she respects Professor Dumbledore, and we see that she is taking care of Hedwig as she would any other injured animal. Her interactions with the students are neutral, instructor to student, and she does not seem to have any favorites in the student body.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#Why might Dumbledore have chosen Hagrid instead of Grubbly-Plank to teach Care of Magical Creatures?
#What are the main differences between Professor Grubbly-Plank's lessons and Hagrid's?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In at least one respect, Professor Grubbly-Plank is a stereotype: she is portrayed as being very mannish, has a gruff voice, and smokes a pipe. While there is no hint as to her sexual orientation &amp;ndash; we do not see any companion she has, and we don't see enough of her to see her form any attachments &amp;ndash; her depiction is almost stereotypically lesbian. This is, of course, unimportant to the story line, and will quite properly be ignored by the target audience, but inclusion of this alternate lifestyle may be meant as a hint that other characters could be homosexual as well. As it turns out, we do later learn that Professor Dumbledore is homosexual, a fact that does have some plot significance; the revelation is somewhat tempered, we believe, by the earlier introduction of Professor Grubbly-Plank.

== Overview ==

'''''The Fat Lady''''' is the subject of a painting on the seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle. Her portrait guards the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. Students must tell her the password that she has created to enter the Gryffindor common room.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the other first-year students arrive at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] addresses the portrait of a very fat lady, in a pink silk dress, to give her the password, &quot;Caput Draconis.&quot; Never named, the portrait is called The Fat Lady throughout the rest of the series.

When Harry departs for his Wizard's Duel with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] accompanies him as his Second while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] tags along to try and persuade them to return to Gryffindor Tower. Unsuccessful, she tries to re-enter the common room, but is unable to get in because the portrait is now blank; the Fat Lady has gone visiting. When they run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] in the hall, Neville says he had forgotten the password, and the Fat Lady would not let him enter. As they return from the failed duel, the Fat Lady asks what the four of them have been doing, but simply opens the entrance when Harry gives the password.

When Harry, trying out his new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], leaves Gryffindor Tower the night after Christmas, the Fat Lady squawks, &quot;Who's there?&quot; as he exits. Harry does not reply.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry and Ron first reach the Common Room after landing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ford Anglia|flying car]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], the Fat Lady asks them for the password; of course they don't have it, but Hermione tells them (&quot;wattlebird&quot;). The portrait swings open to reveal a large welcoming party in progress &amp;ndash; apparently Harry and Ron are somehow heroes for having taken unconventional means to get to the school.

While Harry goes through the portrait hole a number of times in this book, even under the invisibility cloak, this is the only time that we see or hear him interact with the Fat Lady.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The Fat Lady refuses to let [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] into Gryffindor tower at Hallowe'en because he does not have the password. He destroys her painting in a rage. She leaves the portrait out of fear for several months; during her absence, the entrance to Gryffindor Tower is guarded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]. 

When Sir Cadogan allows Sirius into the tower, he is sacked. The Fat Lady is convinced to return, but she requires that a squad of security [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|trolls]] be provided to keep her safe.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

When Harry Potter and Ron Weasley were called by Hermione Granger to go to the kitchen, the Fat Lady was annoyed that she had to open the door just after they planned to not use it. 

Later that year, after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] ended, the Fat Lady and Violet were both drunk, and Harry Potter had some trouble getting her to open the door. 

Once, when Harry tried to enter the tower, the Fat Lady was asleep, and he had to shout the password to wake her up, much to her irritation.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry is first to the Gryffindor dorm's entrance on his first night back at school, but he does not know the password, and the Fat Lady will not let him in. Neville, arriving almost on Harry's heels, says that he will be able to remember the password this year; it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|''Mimbulus Mimbletonia'']].

On the Thursday of the first week of classes, Harry, returning from detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] near midnight, runs into Ron in the hall. When they reach Gryffindor tower, deep in conversation, the Fat Lady is dozing; after a while, she testily asks them to give the password so she doesn't have to keep listening to their conversation all night.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry returns from Christmas break, Hermione informs him that the new password is &quot;Abstinence&quot;. Apparently the Fat Lady had somewhat overindulged over the break &amp;ndash; there is mention of her visiting a picture of some happy monks with wine casks.

When Harry returns from retrieving a memory from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], the Fat Lady denies him entrance to the Common Room. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], passing by, stops to mention that Professor Dumbledore has returned and is in his office; Harry elects to report to Dumbledore immediately, instead of returning to his dormitory.

The Fat Lady is mentioned at the end of the book where she is told by Harry that Dumbledore is dead, she then wails in despair and swings forward to admit Harry into the common room without a password.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

While Harry does eventually head for Gryffindor Tower to get some sleep after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at Hogwarts]], we leave him before he reaches the Fat Lady's portrait, and so we don't actually see her in this book. We hope that she will let Harry into the dormitories given his recent efforts on the school's behalf; there is mention that all the occupants of the portraits are wandering the school to monitor the battle, and that all the historical Headmasters in their portraits cheer Harry on his return to the Headmaster's office, so we can assume that the Fat Lady is at least as well aware of Harry's role in the battle.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

As early as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 9|the first book]], we learn that at night the Fat Lady leaves her portrait and goes visiting.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], a witch in a portrait in the small room where the Champions gather after they are selected hastens off as Harry is announced as the fourth Champion. We later see her sharing the frame with the Fat Lady; she has evidently told the Fat Lady of Harry's selection as fourth Champion. The same witch, identified as Violet or Vi, is later seen sharing a box of liqueur chocolates with the Fat Lady; they are both rather tipsy at that point.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], it is mentioned that the Fat Lady and Vi between them had drunk all the wine in a picture of monks over Christmas; as a result, the Fat Lady has chosen the word &quot;Abstinence&quot; as the new password.

== Analysis ==

We note that all of the common rooms, not just Gryffindor, must have some way of barring the entrance to those not of that House. The Fat Lady is the only portrait charged with that job as far as we know. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], we will see that the Slytherin common room is reached by providing the password to a particular stretch of blank wall; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 29|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] we will see that entrance to the Ravenclaw common room is allowed in response to answering a philosophical question posed by a brass eagle's head. We never see the Hufflepuff common room. However, the Fat Lady seems to be part of a pattern of doorways hidden behind magically-animate objects; we learn later of the carved gargoyles guarding the headmaster's office, and the still life painting that allows access to the kitchens. Curiously, there are apparently two carved gargoyles guarding the entrance to the staff room, mentioned only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], but not in any of the other books where Harry has business in the staff room.

The Fat Lady is a very minor character, and as she is a portrait, she can't change, at least not much. Whatever character traits we see in her will be, presumably, fixed as of the day her portrait was finished. That said, one must suppose that a portrait, whose job consists of being in one place all day in case someone needs entry to a place she is guarding, must get bored. This would explain her &quot;going visiting&quot;, which we see occurring within the first month of Harry's first year; it likely would also explain her drinking, as there is a plethora of alcohol in the various paintings, and one assumes it cannot be permanently consumed. It is a little odd that a painting, which presumably does not have much of a metabolism, can suffer a hangover; however, our interactions with the Fat Lady lead us to believe that, painting or no, she does have the ability to form, act upon, and be changed to some extent by memories.

We also suspect that the Fat Lady's experiences with alcohol may be meant as something of a warning to readers. With the exception of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], and in later books [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sibyll Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], no characters are seen as having a drinking problem of any sort. In all three cases, but particularly with the Fat Lady, the bad aspects of alcohol, specifically confusion (&quot;Lairy fights, that's right&quot;) and hangovers, are displayed in a way that might cause the young potential imbiber to re-think matters. It is to the author's credit that she manages to show the point without belabouring it.

== Overview ==

'''''Godric Gryffindor''''' was one of the four founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and the creator of Gryffindor House. He preferred to teach students with courage, and members of the House are now known for this trait.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While Godric Gryffindor has been dead for possibly a thousand years, and thus cannot play any direct part in our story, he has influenced events that occur throughout the series.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] are sorted into Gryffindor house, as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] determines that they contain qualities that Gryffindor would treasure: daring and bravery, no matter what their origin. We also learn, from the Sorting Hat's song, that the Hat was once Gryffindor's.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] tells us the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The four founders of the school, Godric Gryffindor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]] had existed in harmony for only a short time, before Slytherin and Gryffindor began to disagree over the nature of the students to be educated. Slytherin felt that only Wizards descended from Wizards, &quot;pure blood Wizards&quot;, deserved education while Gryffindor felt that the ability to do magic outweighed any question of ancestry. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw agreed with Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin left, after (according to legend) creating a secret chamber in the school, and hiding a monster within it. The chamber could only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, according to the legend.

When Harry finds himself in the previously-legendary chamber, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]] brings him the Sorting Hat to assist him in his battle against the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Monster]]. The hat, in turn, produces the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|sword of Gryffindor]], with which Harry vanquishes the Monster.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

It is mentioned that Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], were in Gryffindor house as students.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s pattern of making [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] from relics of the Founders, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] mentions that the only known relic of Gryffindor's was the sword. (It should be noted that the Sorting Hat was his, also, but as it had been granted a rudimentary consciousness, there is question whether it could be considered a relic.)

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], where Harry's parents lived, is named after Godric Gryffindor, it having been his birthplace.

The Sword of Gryffindor is returned to Harry in the Forest of Dean, in a manner that requires courage, a trait beloved of Gryffindor, to regain it.

The sword is later provided to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] by the Sorting Hat as it was earlier provided to Harry, possibly in part as a result of Neville's bravery.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

While very little is known of Godric Gryffindor, we can surmise that Godric Gryffindor was, if not an active fighter against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] discrimination, at least believed that Muggle heritage was not grounds for denial of Magical skills. We know, from the words of the Sorting Hat, that he favoured students with courage, loyalty and chivalry. His specific magical skills remain unknown, though there does seem to be a certain affinity for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] among those who are Sorted into the House he founded – both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and the Transfiguration teacher before her, Professor Dumbledore, are extremely skilled at Transfiguration.

== Overview ==

'''''Helga Hufflepuff''''' was one of the four founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and the creator of Hufflepuff House. She would teach any student that the other three would not, though the Sorting Hat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|mentions]] that Hufflepuffs are generally loyal, and Hufflepuffs have come to be known as the most equitable witches and wizards. She was '''wizard of the month''' for May, 2007 on J. K. Rowling's official website. Rowling's Wizard of the Month feature gives the text on a particular wizard's Famous Wizard card, which was also written by Rowling. Hufflepuff's card reads: &quot;''One of the four celebrated Founders of Hogwarts, Hufflepuff was particularly famous for her dexterity at food-related Charms. Many recipes traditionally served at Hogwarts feasts originated with Hufflepuff.''&quot;

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]], in speaking of the feud that resulted in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] leaving the school, mentioned that Hufflepuff had agreed with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]] that all Wizards should be taught, regardless of parentage.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At the Entrance Feast, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat's]] song is longer than usual, as it points up the dangers of inter-House rivalry and pleads for school unity. In that song, the Sorting Hat mentions Helga Hufflepuff and speaks of her character and the character of the students she preferred to teach.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

While Helga Hufflepuff does not play a direct role in this book, we see that her cup is one of the artifacts of the Founders that is deeply desired by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. We believe that Riddle, to steal that artifact and one other, murdered an old witch, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]], and let her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], take the blame, though not even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] can prove that. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

She does not have a direct effect on this story but her cup is central to the storyline, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] used it to create a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] needs to destroy.

== Overview ==

'''''Rowena Ravenclaw''''' was one of the four founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and the creator of Ravenclaw House. She preferred to teach students with the greatest intellect and members of her House have come to be known by this trait.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] is telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s class about the myth of the Chamber of Secrets, he mentions the four Founders of Hogwarts: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], Rowena Ravenclaw, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]]. He mentions that when the argument between the Founders, as to whether those who could not prove magical forbears, broke out, it was Salazar Slytherin standing alone against the other three.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]]'s study, we see an odd contraption which he says is an attempt to re-construct the lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw. This diadem, we are led to believe, had some enhancing effect on intelligence.

Rowena's heirloom, her magical diadem, was stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|her daughter]] and concealed in a hollow tree in Albania. Not wishing to reveal how it had gotten stolen, Rowena said it had gotten lost. She later sought a death-bed reconciliation with her daughter, but that was refused. Rowena's diadem ends up being one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and is destroyed in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]] spell gone wrong in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

== Strengths ==

She was known for her wisdom and intellectual power; presumably, this made her capable of devising strategies to prevail over her enemies.

== Weaknesses ==

Rowena's unwillingness to accept people with a somewhat lower intellect could be considered her main weakness.

== Overview ==

'''''Salazar Slytherin''''' was one of the four founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and the creator of Slytherin House. He preferred to teach the most ambitious students, and the members of this house have often come to be the most powerful witches and wizards. He also required that his students have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|&quot;pure-blood&quot;]] Wizard-only ancestry and did not take any [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-borns]] in his house. He was famous for being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]], someone who can talk to snakes.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When the Chamber of Secrets is first opened, a message is written on the wall: ''Enemies of the Heir, beware!'' It somehow becomes common knowledge that the Heir is supposed to be the Heir of Slytherin.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] is telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] class about the myth of the Chamber of Secrets, he mentions the four Founders of Hogwarts: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]], Salazar Slytherin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]]. He mentions that when the argument between the Founders, as to whether to accept those who could not prove magical forbears, broke out, it was Salazar Slytherin standing alone against the other three. As a result of the argument, Slytherin left the school, supposedly leaving behind him a Chamber of Secrets containing a monster. Binns notes that in the centuries since, nobody at Hogwarts has found so much as a broom-closet of secrets.

In the Dueling Club, Harry sees that a snake is about to attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. Harry instructs the snake to back off. Great consternation ensues, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] take Harry aside to ask him about this ability. It seems that being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]], being able to talk to snakes, is linked to Salazar Slytherin and his heirs. Harry wonders if he could be Slytherin's heir, given how little he knows of his background.

In the Chamber itself, we see a large statue of a wizard, which Harry presumes is Salazar Slytherin. We also meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], who is, as it turns out, the heir of Slytherin. Present only in spirit, he has all the same been controlling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and having her act as Slytherin's heir. We also meet the Monster of the Chamber, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|basilisk]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In support of his apparent belief that he is above the common lot of wizardry, and thus to an extent above the law, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] displays two artifacts that are meant to prove his heritage. One, a locket with a snake forming the letter S, Marvolo claims was Salazar Slytherin's own. The locket is later sold to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Caractacus Burke|Caractacus Burke]] for a pittance, though he says, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s memory, that its origin was plain enough to him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Apart from the efforts to reclaim and destroy Slytherin's locket, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] speaking of his claim to be the heir of Slytherin, and Voldemort's attempt to abolish all school houses other than Slytherin house, we hear little of Slytherin in this book.

== Strengths ==

Slytherin was one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts, and thus must have been a very powerful and accomplished wizard. While it is uncertain if he was the first wizard to be able to speak to snakes, it is certain that he not only had that ability but was able to pass it down to his descendants. We believe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has learned Parseltongue, but he is an exception; otherwise, Parseltongue is considered a mark of descent from Slytherin.

== Weaknesses ==

Slytherin's inability to accept that Muggle-born wizards, and those who consort with Muggles, can in fact do powerful magic, will have blinded him to the abilities of a large part of the Wizarding world.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

While we don't ever see Slytherin directly, his views have obviously come down to us through the type of student that he selected, and that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], as his deputy, has selected for the House named after him throughout the years. Apparently a scion of an old Wizarding family, even a thousand years ago, Slytherin is clearly portrayed as one who feels that ancestry is all important. From the Sorting Hat and its selections, we also learn that Slytherin chose students who were ambitious. Nowhere do we find a student who more clearly matches this combination of traits than in Tom Riddle, who becomes Lord Voldemort.

It is perhaps important to note that Slytherin is not inherently evil. It is certainly incorrect to assume that only wizards can have wizard children; in fact, we can see from the examples of Hermione Granger and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] that wizards, even quite strong ones, can spring from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] roots. However, this is more short-sighted than particularly evil. Ambition, in itself, is not evil, either. It is the way these two traits are expressed which is wrong. 

Slytherin, losing his argument (it is unknown whether this was merely an argument or if dueling was involved), left, possibly to set up an alternate school, possibly to simply sulk, but in any event apart from the one trap he left behind him, has no further role to play. Voldemort, in a similar situation, apparently kills those who stand in his way. Slytherin would merely refuse to educate the Muggle-born; Voldemort deprives them of the education they already have and incarcerates them.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As far as the intent of Salazar Slytherin, Rowling never said he was not evil; in fact his ideas about pure-blood ideology, particularly as mirrored and enhanced by Voldemort, were similar to Hitler's. We as the readers of the series and viewers of the movies are told that most Dark wizards are trained in Slytherin house, from which we get the perhaps erroneous belief that most of the wizards and witches from Slytherin are Dark. Voldemort was Salazar's heir, and as far as it is explained, he is taking up the mission in the way he believes Salazar had intended, with the Chamber and the Basilisk. Through the books everything need not be explained to understand what the character's perspective is or was. It is well defined through the series that, whether or not Salazar was evil, his position very easily can be perverted to something very evil indeed, and this was done by Voldemort.

As the actual events happened, we are told, over a thousand years ago, they are by now shrouded in the mists of time, and it is unsure whether Slytherin, losing the battle, chose to leave the school or was forced to leave. Given what little we know of his character, it seems more likely that having been overruled, he would gather his dignity about himself and stalk off into the night. Knowing as little as we do about the other three Founders, though, it must remain uncertain as to whether they chose to dismiss him or whether he made the decision on his own.

It is perhaps of interest that Portugal, where the author lived from 1990 to 1994, was ruled by a dictator named [[w:António de Oliveira Salazar|António de Oliveira Salazar]] from 1932 to 1968. Salazar's &quot;Estado Novo&quot; was a rigidly authoritarian, right-wing dictatorship. As the first book in the Potter series was completed in 1995, it is possible that Salazar Slytherin's name is retrieved from recent Portuguese history.

I have copied the Toyota Prius article from Wikipedia, and split the driving tricks into a separate [[Toyota Prius driving tricks|article]].  The driving tricks aren't entirely encyclopedic and fit better here, along with the [[Toyota Prius FAQ]].  I think Wikibooks is a good place to expand on the Wikipedia article, with info that would interest current and prospective owners. --[[User:Kmf164|Kmf164]] 23:09, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Symbols==
Right so I'm a complete n00b to all of this, but is there a reason for choosing the specific symbol set used here?  In the (1) logic course I've taken and in every math course, for example, we've used a tilde for the negation.  If perhaps it is my inexperience in this area that makes this symbol set appear foreign, should there not still be some explanation since the text is meant to educate beginners and not experts?  Please comment soon on this; I'm very interested to know.  [[User:N Vale|N Vale]] 01:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

: The negation is due to a TeX limitation.  I could not get the tilde to display correctly in math mode.  In the following examples, the &quot;\,\!&quot; at the end of the math mode forces the display to use TeX.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;~P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as &lt;math&gt;~P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{~P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{~P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mbox{~P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{~P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as &lt;math&gt;\tilde\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:  Except for the tilde, I used the Tarski set which has caught on quite well with textbook authors.  They are today probably more common than the Russell/Whitehead set more often seen in Wikimedia.  (Note, the Tarski quantifiers are almost never used and I used the standard quantifiers.)  For ''any'' choice I could have made for the sentential connectives, many readers would have find them unfamiliar or at least not their favorites.  Symbol choice for sentential connectives is just not well enough standardized to avoid that problem.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 20:28, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

I don't know who wrote this. But you're saving my arse. Cheers.

Of course, &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as &lt;math&gt;\sim P&lt;/math&gt;, but as the TeX code indicates I think it is meant to be the similarity symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Removed the casts that were used with some of the allocation examples.  In C, the cast is superfluous and can hide the serious problem of a missing prototype.  Also, the explanation about free() returning a value was incorrect and hence removed.  free()'s prototype is: void free(void*).  That is, it returns nothing. -- [[User:67.170.85.37|67.170.85.37]] 04:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== How much memory can you allocate? ==

I've got a 64-bit (x86) computer, but a 32-bit compiler. Can I allocate the whole 32-bits (byte*2^32)?

: No. If you told the compiler to create a 32-bit-address executable, then that program cannot successfully allocate the entire 32-bit-address address space.
: If you are unlucky, when you try to allocate the full 2^32 bytes all a once, the compiler will truncate the amount of memory requested (2^32 bytes) into a 32-bit value of zero, then the malloc call (&quot;&lt;code&gt;malloc( 0 );&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) will succeed, and later parts of your program will likely have confusing and difficult-to-diagnose problems.
: A 32-bit address can access at most 2^32 possible addresses.
: Even when your 64-bit computer has many times more than 2^32 bytes of unused RAM, a 32-bit-address executable will never see a full 2^32 bytes of unused RAM.
: Some long-running programs allocate more and more memory a little at a time --
: the early malloc() calls will typically succeed, but eventually the executable will see malloc() return NULL (&quot;not enough consecutive free space available&quot;) once all free space is used up.
: For a 32-bit-address executable, &quot;all free space&quot; is always *less* than &quot;all 2^32 possible addresses&quot;, because the compiler and the OS puts various things where your program can access it, using up some of those addresses.

: Yes. Your program can call malloc requesting 2^32 bytes, if you told the compiler to create a 64-bit-address executable and it links in a 64-bit-address version of malloc: &quot;&lt;code&gt;malloc( (size_t)1 &lt;&lt; 32 );&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. However, as always, malloc() is not guaranteed to always give you what you want -- sooner or later, the heap will be fragmented enough that there is no block of 2^32 consecutive bytes available, and malloc() will return NULL -- see [[C Programming/Memory management#Error checking]].

: What should we say about &quot;How much memory can you allocate?&quot; in this &quot;C Programming&quot; book?

== Wikibook? ==

Gee, if I wanted links about Delphi, I'd search for &quot;Delphi&quot; in Google. What I expected was a book on Delphi Programming which walks me through the variables, functions, operators, OOP, etc. You know, what Wikibooks is supposed to be all about, editable books and all of that. By the way, ever heard of the [http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/ Lazarus] project, which tries to become an Open Source version of Delphi based on Free Pascal? Maybe cite it as an alternative to buying Delphi for those of us who cannot afford a copy of Delphi. --[[User:Orion Blastar|Orion Blastar]] 04:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Only a Chapter! ===

For once: This is only a chapter of the [[Computer programming|Programming]] book.

But then I agree with you: [[Delphi Programming|Programming:Delphi]] is in a very bad shape. There are far better examples of programming books ([[Ada Programming]], [[C++ Programming|Programming:C plus plus]]). There problem is not with Wikibooks but with the Delphi community which has not provided a good chapter/book on Delphi - at least not in english - the German and Polnish versions  are in a far better shape.

Prehaps they don't see a reason to do so. Maybe ther are to many English Delphi allready. Who knows.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:25, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

== Only know some ==

I could help writing practical guides, like how to actually code a program. But I can't explain the variables and such since my English is way too poor to do that. :/


I've had my experiences using Borland/CodeGear Delphi and I'm willing to explain how to use dialogs,tabsheets etc. basically the program itself rather than the whole language.

--[[User:Kritique|Kritique]]

== Contents ==

Hello,

I also have worked on the German version of this article (the chapters about &quot;GUI&quot; and &quot;type casting&quot;), so I could write some, but then someone should check that for grammar and spelling, because I'm not a native English. I think, at first there should be a chapter about the syntax, data types (integers, strings and so on), an overview about some functions of the 'Math' and 'SysUtils' unit (and not to forget a good introduction: Why Delphi / Pascal? Why not? How to get Delphi? and Delphi's history). Then operators, type casting, pointers, assembler in Delphi and the GUI. Maybe somone can make a checklist? --[[User:Jayk|Jayk]] ([[User talk:Jayk|talk]]) 17:59, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

== Developing book about Pascal first? ==

I'm thinking of improving this book. Could it be a good idea to develop the wikibook about Pascal first and then refer to it in this book so as to avoid repetition? Most of the stuff that is not related to OOP is the same anyway. [[User:DesbWit|DesbWit]] ([[User talk:DesbWit|talk]]) 11:14, 17 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

== 1.  Name the four basic components of a Pinewood Derby car. ==

Body, Wheels, Axle, &amp; Weights

== 2.  Cars must meet the basic following requirements: ==
*Must be made during the current calendar year or Pathfinder club year
*Width of car shall not exceed 2 3/4” (70 mm)
*Length of car shall not exceed 7”. (178 mm)
*Weight of car shall not exceed 5 oz. (142 grams)
*Width between wheels shall be 1-3/4” (44 mm)
*Height from bottom of car to bottom of tires shall be 3/8” (10 mm)
*Use only axles, wheels, and wood provided in the kit you purchase
*Wheel bearings, washers, and bushings are prohibited

== 3.  Know how to use safely the following while building your project: ==
;Saw:
;Wood rasp:
;Course sandpaper:
;Fine sandpaper:
;Wood plane:
;Hammer:
;Shaping stick:

===Principles of safety===
*Wear protective goggles, gloves and a dust mask to protect your eyes, hands and lungs.
*Don’t melt lead to add for weight.  It is not only a very dangerous operation, it is toxic.
*Children should not use power tools without adult supervision.
*If power tools are used, ensure that all safety devices associated with the tools are used.  Use this opportunity to instruct the Pathfinder on the safe operation of power tools.

== 4.  Know the basic steps in designing a car: ==
===a. Design===

Draw a design on paper then cut it out and use it as a template.  Use graph paper.  Draw a side and top view on the paper by tracing around the block of wood. 

[[Image:Pinewood STEP 01.svg|150|Trace the block]]

[[Image:Pinewood STEP 02.svg|150|Draw the design]]

[[Image:Pinewood STEP 03.svg|150|Cut out shape]]

Keep the car a full seven inches.  It has to do with the physics of velocity and length of travel of the weights. The longer your car, the farther back you can put the center of gravity. 

Use the full 2 ¾ inches (outside wheel to outside wheel) that the rules give you.  This will allow the wheels to travel farther before hitting the center strip.

Do not make the front of the car pointed.  It is hard to set up against the starting dowels.

Use your imagination.  Be creative.  Shape has the least to do with winning.  A beaver driving a log or even a pickup truck is more interesting than a wedge and will be just as fast.  The aerodynamics of a small block of wood doesn’t mean much in thirty feet.

====Creative Types of Cars:====
*Banana
*Shark
*Watermelon Wedge
*Dragster Rocket Car
*Swiss cheese Wedge with a Mouse Driver
*Ice Cream Bar
*Carrot Ridden by a Rabbit
*Police Car
*Pencil
*Tow Truck
*Giant Lego Car
*Fire Truck
*Train Engine
*Ambulance with Lights

===b. Transfer of design===

With a pencil, lightly draw your design on your block of wood.  Draw the design on the top, both sides, and both ends.  It will be easier to cut out your car with lines on all surfaces.

[[Image:Pinewood STEP 04.svg|150|Trace onto block]]
===c. Building the car'===

Cutting out your car: Use a 6” coping saw, and a 4” C-clamp.  Use a small piece of scrap wood to protect your car from being dented by the C-clamp. Clamp your block to the table, and SLOWLY start your first cut. Hold the saw with both hands, carefully follow the lines you drew on the block of wood.  Watch the lines on ''both'' sides of the block. 

[[Image:Pinewood STEP 05.svg|150|Cut the block]]

Saw any straight line cuts.

;Shape: Shape concave surfaces with shaping sticks.

;Filing and Shaping: You can shape your car even more with different files and “shaping sticks” (wood with sandpaper glued to it.)

;Sanding: Sand your car so it is reasonably smooth and ready for painting. Sanding the wood smooth can take quite a lot of time.

;Painting:  A great way to paint is to first make the car one solid color using 1” foam brushes.  Then use small brushes for fancy details.  Always apply thin coats of paint.  Thin coats will dry faster.  (Optional - Before painting, pound 4 nails into the bottom of your car to make “legs” for the car to stand on.  Do not pound the nails too deep.  They will be removed when the paint is dry.) 

;Wheels, Screws, Axles:  Screw the wheels to the wood dowel axle.  Not too tight and not too loose.

;Final Assembly:  After the paint has dried, and the wheels are assembled.  Put two (2) small drops of glue in the groove for the wood dowel axle.  Press the wheel assembly into place.

===d. Axles and wheels===

;Wheels: Debur the wheels.  Take off the flashing and seam that was produced when the wheel was molded with a 600 grit or better sandpaper.  Inside as well as out.  Sand any bumps off the wheel with sandpaper.  Metal polish will restore the gloss.  Be careful not to break any rules your race has regarding wheel modification.  (Narrower wheels have less friction and are better, but often disallowed).  Don’t sand too much or you’ll create a flat spot.  Sand by hand not in the drill.  Heat from the high speed of a drill will damage the plastic wheel.

;Polish the axles:  First with a 400 grit if you have a really bad spot.  Then a 600 grit, and then a jewelers rouge.  Finish off with a chrome/metal polish.

(Optional) Have only three wheels touching the track.  Raise a front one slightly.  There is less friction with 3 wheels rolling than 4.

The head of the axle should be tapered about 15 degrees so it rubs against the wheel less.

Wax the wheels with furniture polish.  Make sure the polish does not contain a solvent of any sort.

Axles

Put the axle in at a downward (5-10 degrees) angle.  This provides two benefits.  The first is that only the inside edge of the wheel is in contact with the track.  This seems to make the car go straighter with less wobble.  The second benefit is that the wheel rides to the outside of the axle and doesn’t come in contact with the body.  This tip is for experts only. First timers have trouble getting this right.

Axles must be in straight front to back.  That is square to the body.  True the axles, don’t trust the pre-cut grooves in the block!  If you have one, use a drill press to ensure all axles are straight.  One of the front and two of the back should be measured to be the same height.  Having the axles perfectly parallel to one another is probably the single most important factor affecting the car's speed.  If they are not parallel, the car will steer to the left or to the right, eventually hitting the center guide or a wall.  This will slow it down, and it makes all that polishing a waste of time.   

After pressing in the axles, test the car for crooked wheels…roll it on the floor.  If the wheels are on straight, the car should roll -10 feet in a fairly straight line.  Should the car turn left or right, you need to tinker with the axle placement without removing them from the car body, until it rolls straight.

Do not put the axles in at the top of the groove.  Put them in at the middle.  This lifts the car off the track a bit more and reduces the chance of rubbing on the center strip.

Glue the axles in place.  Nothing is worse than having the wheel fall off as you cross the finish line.

Once you match a wheel and axle together with graphite, keep them together.  They wear into each other as a matched set.

===e. Adding weight===

Leave a lot of wood in the back to put in the weights

Get the weight as close to the 5 ounce limit as possible.  Add the last little bit of weight with lead tape from the golf shop.  This can be trimmed with scissors at the last minute.  Remember, the official scale may not weight the same as yours.

Everyone has an opinion on where to put the weight.  One opinion is that the weight needs to be predominantly in the rear so that so that gravity can act upon the weight further up the incline and for a longer period of time.  A car with more weight to the rear generally grabs more speed down the slope.  Some suggest having the center of gravity at 1 to 1 ½ inches in front of the rear wheels.  But be careful not to put too much in the rear or you’ll pop a wheelie.

What kind of weight?  Melted lead is dangerous and unnecessary.  Tubular weights can be sunk in the sides; flat weights, like those sold in hobby and scout stores can be attached to the car bottom if it is carved in a bit.  Incremental weights (with pre-marked grooves) are easier to snap off into the size you need.  Some folks just use BBs, nuts &amp; bolts, etc., but these must be glued so that they can not move.  No movable weights or mercury allowed.

You can also use the round weights found at the hobby shops and craft stores.  This allows you to stick the weights out the back of the car.  You can paint them and tell everyone that they are jet engines or tail pipes.  That allows you to get the weights as far back as possible.

Keep the weight low on the car and in the center (Left/Right of the car).  Put the weight just in front or behind the rear wheels for less wheel chatter.
===f. Lubrication===

There are two main types of pine car lubricant, dry and liquid. Dry lubricants are usually either graphite or Teflon, while liquid lubricants are some type of oil. They will both help your car to go faster by reducing the friction between the wheel and the axle. Depending on the rules for your race you may be required to use one or the other so check the rules for your race to see what type of lubricant is allowed. Some races allow either type, some only allow graphite or Teflon, and others will only allow oil.

Either type of lubricant will work, however you should never mix them, if you do the liquid and dry lubricants will form a paste that will make your car slower than it would be without any lubrication at all. If you need to switch from one to the other you should change both your axles and your wheels.

Liquid lubricants have several advantages to dry lubricants, the main one is that they tend to last longer. Graphite usually starts to wear out after a handful of heats while most oils will last for 10-20 heats. So if your race involves more than 4 heats a graphite lubricated car will be at a big disadvantage. Oil if used properly is also usually a faster lubricant than graphite. The disadvantages to using a liquid lubricant are that they are more expensive, and some liquid lubricants can melt the wheels. If you use a liquid make sure that it is approved for use with pine cars. 

For most of the liquid lubricants you don't need to use very much. Usually you will just want to use a single drop per wheel. Too much oil will actually cause the car to run slower. To apply the oil put one drop on the axle put the wheel on the axle and spin it, then remove the wheel and wipe the axle with a paper towel to remove any extra oil. You only want a very thin film of oil, this will also keep your car looking nicer. 
 
Dry lubricants are the traditional pine car lubricant. Some people think that graphite works better than the new white Teflon. 

Break in the wheels by spinning them with lots of graphite.

Right before check-in, fill the wheel wells with and cover with stickers like a hub cap.  You can paint the 1 inch stickers in a contrasting color.

Put a small drop of white glue where the axle goes into the car body and put powdered graphite on it there.  That causes friction if the wheel should rub against the car body.

Other than the good polishing of the axles, dump the axles and wheels in a Ziploc bag with some graphite and shake them for a few days prior to the race.  That way the wheel and the axles are as slick as can be.

Just a note - graphite is very messy!

== 5.  Design and build to completion a Pinewood Derby car from a basic kit using the instructions in the kit or if no instructions, follow the directions in #2. ==
== 6.  Participate in a sponsored Pinewood Derby event using the car you built in #5. ==

Here’s some tips for when you come to the race.

Have extra axles and wheels on hand.  You never know when your car may be the one dropped right before a race.

Have a derby tool kit handy.  It should include superglue, sandpaper, a drill, extra screws for your weights, extra weights, a small screwdriver.  You many not use it, but it will make you the most popular person at the event.

Transport your car in a shoebox.  Dropped cars are unfortunately a too common experience.

Add LOTS of graphite right before check in.

Don’t play with your car.  Treat your car with care, at least until Race Day.  The more you play with it, the more likely you are to cause it to run more slowly. Running the car along the floor prior to the race will cause it to lose.

Your first goal is to make sure your car can make it all the way down the track.

*  Build your car within the rules.  If you can’t pass inspection, you can’t race.
*  Assure ground clearance.  If you add weight to the underside of your car, you should chisel or drill out areas in which to put the weight, so that the weight is “inlaid”.  Failure to do this usually results in the car underside scraping the center guide rail.
*   Assure vertical clearance. The lane judge should provide plenty of clearance for most any car.  However some lane judges/timers have only about 3” clearance, so be sure that your car will fit under that.  Crashing your car into the finish line at 120 scale miles per hour is exciting, but not your objective.

== 7.  Define and practice good sportsmanship as it relates to your Christian walk. ==

While building and racing a pinewood derby car your Christian walk may be tested.  If someone needed help on their design, did you help?  If you are having trouble cutting your own car, did you accept help?  Did you clean up your work area so the next person had a clean place to work, or so the staff didn’t have to clean up after you?  Did you have to wait a while to use some of the tools?  Being patient isn’t always easy.

Jesus was a Carpenter…………Jesus may have spent many hours in a wood shop……I wonder if He helped Joseph,…..design, transfer the design, clamp the wood, cut the wood with a saw, file, sand smooth, paint, assemble.  I wonder,…..how many tools did Jesus know how to use, that you just used yourself?  I wonder………………..

'''Note:'''  If you are planning to participate in a conference Pinewood Derby event be sure you use the correct specifications from your conference because some use different specifications than listed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">there seemed to be some vandalism of this section. From what I remembered from my thermo class, some of the sections had been deleted that had correct information.  I took the liberty to restore these sections.

== Removal of comment from text ==

I removed this comment from the text:
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not True!!! - If the product is continuously removed, the reaction will continue trying to establish an equilibrium (not necessarily equal - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/IB_Chemistry_Equilibrium) of reactants and products and the reaction will be driven forward. Another factor is the energy of activation. If the reaction has a transition state that has a very high energy, regardless of the stability of the product, it may require an insurmountable energy of activation to drive the reaction forward. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy)  see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Besides the rather unhelpful format (a book page should not contradict itself in such a fashion. If there is something wrong or something to be added to the page, then feel free to fix it), IMHO the two points are rather void here:
* ''If the product is continuously removed...'' - absolutely correct, but I don't think it fits in this context. Product removal is an ''additional step'', which is described later IIRC. This is not a &quot;data dump&quot; like wikipedia, but a book to learn from. Special cases come ''after'' the basics.
* ''Activation energy...'' is described in the next chapter, [[Biochemistry/Catalysis]]. Come on, people, this is the ''first page'' of the book! It's supposed to be a learning curve and not a concrete wall... --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] ([[User talk:Magnus Manske|talk]]) 13:02, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

== Analogy of equilibrium ==

I don't feel the Monopoly analogy is at all correct. Equilibrium does not mean the same amount of products as reactants. It means equal rates of formation of both products and reactants. The analogy would be more accurate and, more to the point, correct if it read &quot;You each give each other the same amount of money each turn, showing no net increase in the amount of money either of you possess&quot;. This is equilibrium - no net increase in the amount of either products or reactants over time. The amounts do not have to be equal, they just do not change. If a portion of either is removed, reaction in the direction towards the amount that has been decreased will be favoured until the initial amounts are reached and equilibrium (equal reaction ''rate'' in both directions) is restored.</text>

&quot;You&quot; is vi. From the list I can deduce it is (at least) singular. Is there a separate word for you &quot;(plural)&quot; (like most languages) or is it the same (i.e. vi) (like English)?
::''vi'' is singular and plural. There is also ''ci'' meaning ''thou''. [[User:Jonathan Webley|Jonathan Webley]] ([[User talk:Jonathan Webley|talk]]) 07:16, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

== Shuffling sections ==

I did a rewrite of a couple sections (not a major rewrite really), and shuffled them around, because the previous ordering was a little weird. There were references in sections to &quot;using the standard -j prefix&quot; and so on... when the -j prefix had not yet been introduced. I know there are some red links - don't worry, in a little while I am renaming several pages, which will fix that problem. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 19:25, 9 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The information provided in this section of the Instructional Technology Book was provided by students in the Master's of Education program at the University of Mary Washington. Students are in the ITEC521 Information Literacy in the Digital Age course and are working in conjunction with Dr. Teresa Coffman. 

----

=== Information Literacy Defined ===

Information literacy is the ability to articulate a problem to be investigated, locate and assemble information, scrutinize gathered resources, process and apply information towards a solution, and contemplate the effectiveness of the entire process.

According to the American Library Association (2007), &quot;Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to &quot;recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.&quot;

Digitally literate students will be the students who will succeed in the positions of the 21st century. It is critical for students to learn to gather, assess, evaluate, and expand on resources while in school. Teachers should have a vision of digital literacy in the classroom.

=== Teacher Responsibilities ===

Information literacy instruction teaches our students to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy digitally literate] so they may be prepared for living in the 21st century. Our students need to be equipped with the technological skills to succeed. 
	
Many educators feel the need to understand and utilize technology but do not have the necessary tools and resources. It is our responsibility as educators to learn how to teach technology literacy in a way that everyone can understand (Wepner &amp; Liqing, 2002). We also have a responsibility to search for websites that accommodate our student’s literacy skills (Wepner &amp; Liqing, 2002). 
	
National organizations have created standards to indicate what students should know about and be able to do with technology (Bennett, 2005). Look at the [http://www.iste.org/ International Society of Technology in Education]'s standards for students [http://cnets.iste.org/students/ (ISTE-NETS)] and for teachers [http://cnets.iste.org/teachers/ (ISTE-NETS-T)] for help in formulating lesson plans. It is our responsibility to consider these standards as we plan for our classrooms.

=== Determining a Need for Literacy ===

The ability to &quot;effectively locate, evaluate, organize, use, package and present information effectively will become a normal part of life at work&quot;(Cheuk, 2002). Students need to become proficient in using technology to handle these demands and teachers must accommodate this need by integrating technology skills in every facet of instruction. There are several key factors to consider when implementing a technology education program: the students’ abilities, assessment of deficiencies in skill attainment, selection of material and methods for teaching, and application of learning in real world situations. 

Schools and program designers must understand the strengths and weaknesses of their students before planning their instruction. A literacy skills survey of college students found that more than half the graduates could not be categorized as possessing proficiency in analyzing news articles, comprehending documents and balancing a checkbook (Lilienthal, 2006. Being aware of strengths, weaknesses and curriculum needs will do much to guide instruction and develop information literacy skills.

== Strategies and Tools for Developing Information Literacy ==

=== Curriculum content and pedagogy''' ===

What exactly do educators need to teach to students and how will the content be taught? The current focus in education is to access higher level or critical thinking skills in students. “Helping our students achieve information literacy and critical thinking skills is an important goal” (Murray, 2005). Students are expected to utilize their critical thinking skills to solve problems in a technologically-based environment. Students must utilize skills that they have learned that clearly demonstrate technological competency. By performing these tasks students are taught how to use technology to accomplish a curricular goal. 

Exactly what students need to learn should be written into educational standards. For instance, the [http://www.ala.org/ala/aasl/aaslissues/aaslinfolit/informationliteracy1.htm American Association of School Librarians] developed standards for student learning. “The student who is information literate accesses information efficiently and effectively, evaluates information critically and competently, and uses information accurately and creatively” (Murray, 2005). The goals of technology information literacy are to promote lifelong learning among students, utilize critical thinking skills, and promote problem-solving skills (Plotnick, 1999).

==== NetSavvy Model ====
 
The NetSavvy approach developed by Jukes, Dosaj, and Macdonald (2000), suggests that once educators and learners have determined what the essential questions are for the task, it is imperative to consider one’s choice of tools. This consideration means not only what is available, but whether all participants in the project are comfortable with using the selected tools. The NetSavvy approach supplies educators and students with guideposts to tackle any project. Specifically, teachers can evaluate whether the tools are right for one’s pupils for where they are at a particular moment in time and be used to track whether the lesson has helped in reaching the lesson’s objectives.
 
The NetSavvy approach ensures that teachers cover what the authors refer to as the 5A’s. These are Asking, Acccessing, Analyzing, Applying, and Assessing. For each of the 5A’s there are the same five elements to consider, each tweaked to fit one’s particular lesson plan. The first examines the prerequisite skills teachers assume of students. The second element uses the Student Basic Asking Tool which, like a KWL chart, seeks what pre-information students have on the topic and what they wish to learn. (An additional component not seen in the KWL chart or in many lesson plans in general is added, namely, imagination.) The third element of the 5A’s deals with the essential skills the teacher hopes to engender in the students. The remaining two elements deal with equipment needs coverage and a review element appraising the entire teacher, student, and collaborative processes involved in the lesson. Once teachers and students are empowered with this method, they are equipped with innate tools to make good choices.

=== The Internet ===

==== Interactive Sites ====
INTERACTIVE WEBSITES breathe life into the Internet! Interactivity makes the Internet dynamic and highly engaging. Just imagine how long you can stare at an image of an airplane on a web page...you try to imagine how it moves in the air, how it feels when it touches down on a landing strip. You can concentrate for ten, maybe fifteen seconds, right? Now imagine flying that plane - you are in control of a smooth bank to the right, with a sparkling blue expanse below. You might even try a gutsy aileron roll as your engine roars through the sky! That's the potential of interactivity - it puts users in control! And control equates to engagement! Studies show that websites that are &quot;providing opportunities for interaction can increase learning effectiveness&quot;.(Brady, 2004)[http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/62/interactivity.htm].

Interactive websites engage students by providing information and resources coupled with practice, simulations, tutorials, virtual fieldtrips, problem-solving and other learning activities. They can be highly interactive, content-rich simulations such as the [http://www.froguts.com/flash_content/index.html Frog Guts] (subscription-based) simulation and the [http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/play/leonardo/index.html Leonardo's Workshop]. Or, traditional drill and practice like [http://www.funbrain.com Funbrain] or book quizzes like [http://www.bookadventure.com/ Book Adventure]. 

Using music, video, simulations, practice sessions, feedback mechanisms, and a host of other attention-getting and attention-keeping devices, well-designed interactive websites keep minds clicking and seeking more information. A well-designed interactive website is more than &quot;drill-and-kill&quot; types of games, though such skills-based sites are still useful for some students or for certain circumstances.

Teachers should preview sites before sending their students to them. Teachers can also turn to portal or other trusted sites that have prescreened the web pages which they are promoting.One well-known example of such a trusted site is [http://school.discovery.com/schrockguide/ Discovery School], maintained by Kathy Schrock, a former school librarian. Kathy and the Discovery School staff have done much of the wading through websites for teachers. Another alternative would be to utilize specialty websites, such as:

* [http://www.Edufly.com Edu Fly], where education takes flight
* [http://www.educating.net Educating.Net], Portal to the World of Knowledge 
* [http://www.searchedu.com SearchEdu.com] 
* [http://42explore.com Thematic Pathfinders for All Ages]

Instructors should also be teaching students about protecting themselves on the Internet in conjunction with instruction on how to locate, evaluate and choose appropriate sites for their purposes. With &quot;more than 100 million web sites on the Internet&quot; (Netcraft, 2006) and thousands more being added daily, the Internet has much to offer and much to wade through. Students and teachers alike must be equipped to do their searching efficiently. In order to find and assess quality, checklists can be kept on each website visited. 

Examples of checklists can be found at:

* [http://www.quick.org.uk/menu.htm The Quality Information Checklist]
* [http://school.discovery.com/schrockguide/eval.html Discovery School Critical Evaluation Surveys]
* [http://www.library.jhu.edu/researchhelp/general/evaluating/ Johns Hopkins University]

Interactivity is more than visiting websites - there is a multitude of interactive resources for teachers and students to use. On-line games will immediately come to mind. Thought many schools block on-line games, most schools also allow sites to be unblocked if teachers can demonstrate the educational efficacy of a site. Computer games “can provide many self-directed learning strategies, thus stimulating student’s learning interests and promoting student-centered learning” (Yu, Wang, and Che, 2005, p. 94). Keeping students motivated and interested are two of the main goals of interactive gaming. They “incorporate knowledge, fun competition, cooperation, and virtual reality into learning” (Yu, et. al, 2005, p. 95). Like any website, an evaluation should be done on the online game that is in question to use. Here is a sample rubric for evaluating an online games:

[http://www.csus.edu/indiv/k/kaym/rubric/edgamesrubric.html Educational Electronic Games Rubric]: 
 
Other types of interactive resources include instant messaging, podcasts, blogs, and using the Internet for phone calls using services like [http://www.skype.com/ Skype]. Instant messaging has been found to be “more personal, confidential, and targeted than the public space of a discussion list or chat room” (Abram, 2005). Podcasting allows students to record their own thoughts and ideas. Teachers only need to supply a microphone for students to record. Blogging has grown tremendously in the last few years and some sites are designed specifically for school-age children.“Skype is for calling other people all over the world—for free—on their computers” (Abram, 2005, ¶ 12). This could be either an add-on or replacement for a pen pal in other countries. JYBE is a “plug-in to Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox that brings real-time collaboration to Web-based systems and content” (Abram, 2005, ¶ 13). This allows partners to see exactly what the other is doing. JYBE can be downloaded for free.

=== Multimedia Instruction ===

Multimedia instruction is an interactive method of teaching and uses text, graphics, video, animation and sound to instill meaningful learning for students (Juhas, 2004, p.1). Multimedia instruction utilizes technology in the classroom, offering students unlimited means of learning. I found a website, [http://wwww.ezedia.com/education/classroom/library/twelve_reasons.html eZedia], that lists the 12 reasons for using multimedia in the classroom and I have included the list. Projects and activities that include multimedia have the potential to:

* motivate students to participate. 
* integrate all the language arts -- reading, writing, listening, and speaking across curricular areas. 
* build multimedia projects build collaboration skills for students
* create real reasons for reading, writing, and revising communication. 
* give students a larger audience than the teacher and the classroom. 
* require students to analyze sources and think about evidence in new ways. 
* lead teachers to think about their students, classes, and lessons in new ways. Reflection and revision of teaching strategies naturally evolve with the projects. 
* require higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills. These projects promote non-linear thinking and give divergent learners a chance to shine in the classroom. 
* move teachers from the role of lecturer and classroom authority and into the role of learning coach or facilitator. They create student-centered classrooms. 
* increase students' literacy and prepares them for the technology-based communication skills required in the workplace today and tomorrow. 
* let teachers address multiple intelligences and learning styles in the classroom. 
* naturally employ the range of resources and approaches by which most students learn best (Cherry, 2002)

==== United Streaming Video ====

One of the most popular multimedia tools is video streaming, “the process of viewing video over the Internet” (Ross, 2005, ¶ 3). Teachers can download the video and watch it at the same time. Teachers need “a computer with an Internet connection and Windows Media Player” to access video streaming (McNeal, and Kearns, 2005, p. 17). They can be used in a variety of ways. They can be used in presentations or Web sites. Students can also view these on an individual basis. One example of video streaming is [http://www.unitedstreaming.com/ UnitedStreaming]. There are a great number of videos available through Unitedstreaming on every subject and every level.

==== Podcasting ====

One of the newest Internet multimedia resources is Podcasting. This “is an automated technology that allows listeners to subscribe and listen to digitally recorded audio shows&quot; (Flanagan, 2005). The files are downloaded onto an MP3 player or a computer. Students can download everything from a teacher’s lecture to previously recorded audio files on a wide multitude of subjects. David Warlick (2005) explains that educators “can share their knowledge, insights, and passions for teaching and learning and for the stories that they relish and teach.” He began the [http://epnweb.org Education Pod Network] where teachers and students can download educational Podcasts.

==== Vodcasting ====

Along with Podcasting, Vodcasting will soon be used extensively. “’Vodcasts’ are identical to podcasts with the exception being that vodcasts are video-based podcasts” (Switzer, 2006). Students will be able to download video files of interest such as science experiments, group presentations or foreign language lessons.

=== Databases ===
''Definition'': databases are collections of information organized so that a computer program can quickly select desired bits of data. Think of a database an an electronic filing system. Databases are often organized by fields, records, and files. A field is a single bit of information; a record is one set of fields; and a file is merely a collection of records. 

==== What is a Library Database? ====
 
Library databases are used to locate journal or newspaper articles and they are updated daily-to-monthly. (Alverno Library, 2005). Libraries try and update their information whereas the World Wide Web allows anyone to post information without providing continuous updates. Libraries are also able to focus their content, providing researchers to spend more time on qualitative analysis of the articles, rather than the initial search of material. Search results on the World Wide Web may not always have helpful or accurate links to the information that is sought. Based on the accuracy and up-to-date information provided by library databases, it may be more productive and less time consuming to use a library database, rather than to merely search the World Wide Web for information.

==== What is an electronic Database? ====
  
Electronic databases are prevalent in today's technologically-immersed world, and continue to grow and become useful for many professions and topics. Electronic databases are used to help researchers locate periodical articles that relate to their topic. Electronic databases may also provide access to full-text databases. 
 
According to the Expanded Academic ASAP User Tutorial, an electronic database can be defined as &quot;an organised list of published information sources (usually journal articles), either giving directions (a citation) to where you can find the full information or containing the information itself (full-text databases) (Gale, 2005). One thing that is absolutely significant to databases is that they function differently based upon the content that they cover. Not all databases are created equally, thus it helps to understand the particulars of the database before utilizing its multiple functions.

==== Electronic Databases-How are They Different From Library Databases? ====
 
The greatest benefit to using a library database is the security of the information that you will find, &quot;if students click on the school library's databases and catalogs, they have albeit virtually stepped through the doors of the building itself. If they click on an Internet search engine, however, they have hurled themselves into the entire world, the world of cyberspace&quot; (Jenson, 2004). This is not to say that library databases are better, but when doing research for educational purposes, it may be wise to consult the library database, and most especially the libararian.
 
An electronic database is different from a library database only in structure. The general basis of results is primarily the same. Performing a search with either database is going to generate several works in which the researcher can choose from. However, an electronic database differs from a library database in that the timeframe is significantly shortened in a library database, and the location of generated results typically is inconsequential if they are listed in full-text formats. We can endlessly defend the value of books, but we can no longer deny the many advantages of electronic resources: their ease of use, cross-searching capabilities, and simultaneous and remote access options (Roncevic, 2002).

==== Electronic versus Print databases ====
 
Librarians are witnessing a shift in resources that they offer. In an ideal world, many librarians would like to see their libraries with both print and electronic resources. However, economically, this is a tough feat to accomplish (Roncevic, 2002). An electronic database is difficult in nature to build in terms of cost. An electronic subscription to a journal may cost twice as much as the print version (Roncevic, 2002). 

As our classrooms become more enriched with technology and our society becomes more netsavvy, print databases will become less popular. In many libraries, using a print database can be difficult since the options are becoming limited. Electronic databases are becoming more prominent in schools and regional libraries throughout our county. The shift from print to electronic is inevitable. All research can not be conducted from home through use of databases. There are some very valuable resources, such as reference books and other non-circulating materials, that students miss out on unless they physically visit the library. So, for certain research projects, it is important to couple the use of electronic resources with access to print resources.

==== How can databases be used? ====

In order for students to use databases effectively for classroom projects and research, teachers cannot assume that students will automatically know how to search databases because they know how to search the Web. Teachers must always provide as much information for their students as possible, including modeling correct search strategies.

With younger students, certain databases can be great tools because, unlike the vast World Wide Web, they are tailored to the students’ comprehension level. Databases also provide solutions to some of the obstacles that face younger students in their searches for information. 

[http://www.gale.com/InfoBits/ Kids InfoBits], a child-friendly spin-off of InfoTrac, is aimed at students in grades kindergarten through five. It culls only those resources appropriate for children and does not contain advertising (Dempsey, 2003). For younger children, databases like Kids InfoBits do what an Internet search engine cannot: “Organize vast resources into a narrower range that's child-friendly, highly structured so kids can find things easily, and vetted for appropriate content” (Dempsey, 2003). Because databases can sometimes provide more meaningful content for young students than the Internet, teachers should check with their school’s media specialist about the school’s access to children’s databases before starting a research project.

=== Choosing Appropriate Technology Tools for Teaching and Learning ===

==== What is appropriate? ====

When choosing to incorporate technology into a lesson, teachers should choose technology that allows “students to be productive, innovative and enterprising” (TEFA Online, 1999). Teachers need to be certain that incorporating the technology does not hinder the learning process for the students, but instead leads to a deeper understanding of the topic. Technology should “bolster instruction and help students develop higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills” (Brown, 2002, p. 4). To help teachers decide what technology is the best to use, Professor Bell(2004) at Michigan State University designed this [http://www.msu.edu/user/wegnerje/TechnologyRubric.htm Technology Rubric].
 
B.F. Jones, G. Valdez, J. Nowakowski, and C. Rasmussen (1995) developed [http://www.edtech.wednet.edu/Resources/etsctools/PluggingIn(body).pdf The Technology Effectiveness Framework]that shows how to use technology to get a deeper understanding and allows students to reach the higher-levels of thinking. If teachers are undecided of what technology is the best to use, they have also designed a [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/edtalk/insert3.htm Comparison Chart].

==== Are there assessment tools available? What are they? ====

There ''are'' assessment tools available for choosing appropriate technology and technological tools for teaching and learning. [http://www.ncrtec.org/tl/sgsp/lpsg.htm North Central Region Educational Consortium] offers a rubric that can be used to score technology usage within a lesson plan. The rubric guides teachers and ensures proper alignment with curriculum objectives and lesson planning. Rubrics can also be created to provide students with guidelines as to what is expected from them before they begin their projects. By creating rubrics in this way, students have more of a focus when using websites to search for information, and teachers are able to change their requirements easily depending upon the grade level and depth of the project. 

Assessment of whether information is accurate or not falls upon the teacher. By utilizing electronic and library databases, teachers are able to access information that has already been assessed for its content through the database itself. By being able to accurately assess the information provided on a database, utilizing the rubrics provided by NetSavvy (Jukes, Dosaj, &amp; Macdonald, 2000), as well as the rubrics found at the above wesite, teachers and students will be become technologically literate.

The {{C sharp|const}} keyword is used in field and local variable declarations to make the variable ''constant''. It is thus associated with its declaring class or assembly instead of with an instance of the class or with a method call. It is syntactically invalid to assign a value to such a variable anywhere other than its declaration.

Haskell offers several ways of expressing a choice between different values. We explored some of them in the Haskell Basics chapters. This section will bring together what we have seen thus far, discuss some finer points, and introduce a new control structure.

== &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and guards revisited ==

We have already met these constructs. The syntax for &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
if &lt;condition&gt; then &lt;true-value&gt; else &lt;false-value&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;condition&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is an expression which evaluates to a boolean. If the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;condition&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; then the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;true-value&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is returned, otherwise the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;false-value&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is returned. Note that in Haskell &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; is an expression (which is converted to a value) and not a statement (which is executed) as in many imperative languages.&lt;ref&gt;If you have programmed in C or Java, you will recognize Haskell's if/then/else as an equivalent to the ternary conditional operator &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; is ''mandatory'' in Haskell. Since &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; is an expression, it must evaluate to a result whether the condition is true or false, and the &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; ensures this. Furthermore, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;true-value&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;false-value&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; must evaluate to the same type, which will be the type of the whole if expression.
 
When &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions are split across multiple lines, they are usually indented by aligning &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;s with &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;s, rather than with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;s. A common style looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeLetter :: Char -&gt; String
describeLetter c =
    if c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z'
        then &quot;Lower case&quot;
        else if c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z'
            then &quot;Upper case&quot;
            else &quot;Not an ASCII letter&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Guards and top-level &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions are mostly interchangeable. With guards, the example above is a little neater:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeLetter :: Char -&gt; String
describeLetter c
   | c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z' = &quot;Lower case&quot;
   | c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z' = &quot;Upper case&quot;
   | otherwise            = &quot;Not an ASCII letter&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that &lt;code&gt;otherwise&lt;/code&gt; is just an alias to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, and thus the last guard is a catch-all, playing the role of the final &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression. 

Guards are evaluated in the order they appear. Consider a set up like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f (pattern1) | predicate1 = w
             | predicate2 = x

f (pattern2) | predicate3 = y
             | predicate4 = z
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the argument of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; will be pattern-matched against pattern1. If it succeeds, then we proceed to the first set of guards: if predicate1 evaluates to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; is returned. If not, then predicate2 is evaluated; and if it is true &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is returned. Again, if not, then we proceed to the next case and try to match the argument against pattern2, repeating the guards procedure with predicate3 and predicate4. (Of course, if neither pattern matches or neither predicate is true for the matching pattern there will be a runtime error. Regardless of the chosen control structure, it is important to ensure all cases are covered.)

=== Embedding &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expressions ===

A handy consequence of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; constructs being ''expressions'' is that they can be placed anywhere a Haskell expression could be, allowing us to write code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
g x y = (if x == 0 then 1 else sin x / x) * y
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that we wrote the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression without line breaks for maximum terseness. Unlike &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions, guard blocks are not expressions; and so a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; definition is the closest we can get to this style when using them. Needless to say, more complicated one-line &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions would be hard to read, making &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; attractive options in such cases.

== &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; expressions ==

One control structure we haven't talked about yet are &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expressions. They are to piece-wise function definitions what &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions are to guards. Take this simple piece-wise definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f 0 = 18
f 1 = 15
f 2 = 12
f x = 12 - x
&lt;/source&gt;

It is equivalent to - and, indeed, syntactic sugar for:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = 
    case x of
        0 -&gt; 18
        1 -&gt; 15
        2 -&gt; 12
        _ -&gt; 12 - x
&lt;/source&gt;

Whatever definition we pick, the same happens when &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is called: The argument &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is matched against all of the patterns in order; and on the first match the expression on the right-hand side of the corresponding equal sign (in the piece-wise version) or arrow (in the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; version) is evaluated. Note that in this &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression there is no need to write &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the pattern; the wildcard pattern &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; gives the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;To see why this is so, consider our discussion of matching and binding in the [[../Pattern matching/]] section&lt;/ref&gt;

Indentation is important when using &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;. The cases must be indented further to the right than the beginning of the line containing the &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and all cases must have the same indentation. For the sake of illustration, here are two other valid layouts for a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = case x of
    0 -&gt; 18
    1 -&gt; 15
    2 -&gt; 12
    _ -&gt; 12 - x
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = case x of 0 -&gt; 18
                1 -&gt; 15
                2 -&gt; 12
                _ -&gt; 12 - x
&lt;/source&gt;

Since the left hand side of any case branch is just a pattern, it can also be used for binding, exactly like in piece-wise function definitions:&lt;ref&gt;Thus, &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements are a lot more versatile than most of the superficially similar switch/case statements in imperative languages which are typically restricted to equality tests on integral primitive types.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeString :: String -&gt; String
describeString str = 
  case str of
    (x:xs) -&gt; &quot;The first character of the string is: &quot; ++ [x] ++ &quot;; and &quot; ++
              &quot;there are &quot; ++ show (length xs) ++ &quot; more characters in it.&quot;
    []     -&gt; &quot;This is an empty string.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This function describes some properties of &lt;tt&gt;str&lt;/tt&gt; using a human-readable string. Using case syntax to bind variables to the head and tail of our list is convenient here, but you could also do this with an if-statement (with a condition of &lt;code&gt;null str&lt;/code&gt; to pick the empty string case). 

Finally, just like &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions (and unlike piece-wise definitions), &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expressions can be embedded anywhere another expression would fit: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Colour = Black | White | RGB Int Int Int

describeBlackOrWhite :: Colour -&gt; String
describeBlackOrWhite c = 
  &quot;This colour is&quot;
  ++ case c of
       Black           -&gt; &quot; black&quot;
       White           -&gt; &quot; white&quot;
       RGB 0 0 0       -&gt; &quot; black&quot;
       RGB 255 255 255 -&gt; &quot; white&quot;
       _               -&gt; &quot;... uh... something else&quot;
  ++ &quot;, yeah?&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The case block above fits in as any string would. Writing &lt;code&gt;describeBlackOrWhite&lt;/code&gt; this way makes &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; unnecessary (although the resulting definition is not as readable). 

{{Exercises|1=
Use a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement to implement a &lt;code&gt;fakeIf&lt;/code&gt; function which could be used as a replacement to the familiar &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions.  
}}

== Controlling actions, revisited ==

In the final part of this chapter, we will introduce a few extra points about control structures while revisiting the discussions in the &quot;Simple input and output&quot; chapter. There, in the [[../Simple input and output#Controlling actions|Controlling actions]] section, we used the following function to show how to execute actions conditionally within a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block using &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;
                    doGuessing num
            else do putStrLn &quot;You Win!&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

We can write the same &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; function using a &lt;tt&gt;'''case'''&lt;/tt&gt;
statement.  To do this, we first introduce the Prelude function
&lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt; which takes two values of the same type (in the &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;
class) and returns a value of type &lt;code&gt;Ordering&lt;/code&gt; — namely one of 
&lt;code&gt;GT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EQ&lt;/code&gt;, depending on
whether the first is greater than, less than, or equal to the second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
  guess &lt;- getLine
  case compare (read guess) num of
    LT -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
    GT -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;
             doGuessing num
    EQ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You Win!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt;s after the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;s are necessary on the
first two options, because we are sequencing actions within each case.

=== A note about &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; ===

Now, we are going to dispel a possible source of confusion. In a typical imperative
language (C, for example) an implementation of &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; might look like the following
(if you don't know C, don't worry with the details, just follow the if-else chain):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void doGuessing(int num) {
  printf(&quot;Enter your guess:&quot;);
  int guess = atoi(readLine());
  if (guess == num) {
    printf(&quot;You win!\n&quot;);
    return ();
  }

  // we won't get here if guess == num
  if (guess &lt; num) {
    printf(&quot;Too low!\n&quot;);
    doGuessing(num);
  } else {
    printf(&quot;Too high!\n&quot;);
    doGuessing(num);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; first tests the equality case, which does not lead to 
a new call of &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;code&gt; has no accompanying
&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;. If the guess was right, a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement is used to
exit the function at once, skipping the other cases. Now, going back to Haskell, action
sequencing in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks looks a lot like imperative code, and furthermore
there actually ''is'' a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; in Prelude. Then, knowing that &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;
statements (unlike &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements) do not force us to cover all cases, one
might be tempted to write a literal translation of the C code above (try running it if
you are curious)...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
  guess &lt;- getLine
  case compare (read guess) num of
    EQ -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;You win!&quot;
             return ()

  -- we don't expect to get here if guess == num
  if (read guess &lt; num)
    then do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;;
            doGuessing num
    else do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;;
            doGuessing num
&lt;/source&gt;

... but it won't work! If you guess correctly, the function
will first print &quot;You win!,&quot; but it ''will not exit'' at the &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;. 
Instead, the program will continue to the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression and check whether
&lt;code&gt;guess&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt;.  Of course it is
not, so the else branch is taken, and it will print &quot;Too high!&quot; and
then ask you to guess again. Things aren't any better with an incorrect guess:
it will try to evaluate the case statement and get either &lt;code&gt;LT&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;GT&lt;/code&gt; as the result of the &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;.  In either case,
it won't have a pattern that matches, and the program will fail immediately
with an exception (as usual, the incomplete &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; alone should be
enough to raise suspicion).

The problem here is that &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is not at all equivalent to the
C (or Java etc.) statement with the same name. For our immediate purposes, 
we can say that &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is a ''function''.&lt;ref&gt;''Superfluous note'': somewhat
closer to a proper explanation, we might
say &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is a function which takes a value and makes it into an
action which, when evaluated, gives the original value. A 
&lt;code&gt;return &quot;strawberry&quot;&lt;/code&gt; within one of the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks
we are dealing with would have type &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt; - the same type as
&lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;. Do not worry if that doesn't make sense for now; you will
understand what &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; really does when we ''actually'' start
discussing monads further ahead on the book.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; in particular evaluates to an action which does nothing. 
&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; ''does not affect the control flow at all''. In the correct guess
case, the case statement evaluates to &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;, an action of type
&lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, and execution just follows along normally.

The bottom line is that while actions and &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks resemble imperative
code, they must be dealt with on their own terms - Haskell terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Generating Station==

Basically this is a transformation at this station of one kind of energy ([[w:Fossil fuel power plant|coal,]] [[w:Gas turbine|gas,]] [[w:Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|waterpower]], [[w:Nuclear power plant|nuclear energy]], [[w:Wind turbine|wind,]] [[w:Solar panel|solar energy,]] etc.) into electrical energy, often via steam.
While the electricity fed into the grid (see below) is Alternating Current (AC), some of these sources of energy are used to charge batteries; all batteries supply only Direct Current (DC). [[Basic Electrical Generation and Distribution|Converters]] and [[Basic Electrical Generation and Distribution|inverters]] are available to change DC into AC, and [[w:Rectifier|rectifiers]] change AC into DC. Many industrial firms, also hospitals and other emergency operations have their own emergency generators that automatically switch themselves into the circuits if the normal electricity supply fails. These emergency generators usually are powered from [[w:Petroleum|petroleum]] based fuels. Also most cars include a small generator, called an alternator, that charges the car's [[w:Car battery|battery]] and provides electrical power to the vehicle while the engine is running. The battery is disconnected from the generator while the engine is not running, or if otherwise the generated voltage is too low, such as, for example, when there is a breakage of the fan belt.
In order to get a lot of energy into the power grid, a lot of energy is needed to drive the generators, and in case there is a disconnection of the generator from its load the input energy must be removed immediately, or else the generator would speed up more and more, and a lot of destruction would be the result.

To restore small generators to service they could be started up as motors, with the normal energy source supplying no energy at all at first, but then that energy is added slowly back to driving the generator normally. While power at the beginning is taken from the grid into the generator (actually it is a motor at that time), with the power flow then in the negative direction, the direction of power flow soon is reversed to normal. No synchronization is needed in that case.

In restoring large power generators a major problem could be the time taken for the heat source to reach normality. This can take days in case of [[w:Nuclear power plant|nuclear plants.]]. In the meantime severe restrictions on electricity availability must be expected. That is why many firms have their own generators that are switched on automatically if there is a power failure.

==From Generator to [[Electronics/Transformers|Transformer]] to [[w:Transmission line|Transmission line]]==

==From [[w:Transmission line|Transmission line]] to [[Electronics/Transformers|Transformer]] to Substation==

==Substations==
Substations usually contain [[Electronics/Transformers|transformers]] in order to change voltage levels; they are connnected to a &quot;bus&quot; via a circuit breaker.

===What is a &quot;bus&quot;?===
Think of an airport. There is a long corridor from which you can reach many platforms via doors. In a substation that long corridor is called a '''bus''', and each door is a large circuit breaker connecting one or more transmission lines and/or one or more transformers and/or one or more generators or one or more loads (such as a distribution network of electric energy to users) to one or more '''busses''', at one or more different voltages, in rare caes even at different frequencies.

===What are circuit breakers doing in a substation?===
*The circuit breakers can be operated from the main switching console, or they can be operated automatically from a [[w:Relay|protection relay]] or some other protection device. This will ensure that in case of a local [[w:Electrical overload|overload]] the circuit breaker(s) concerned will open immediately, thus disconnecting the circuit and stopping the current, which is higher than a given limit, from doing any damage, even from starting any fires. If the protection device discovers that the problem is outside the local area, then a time delay is activated to permit the problem area to do its switching first, however after that set time delay the relevant circuit breaker, as a backup, will be operated to switch off here if the problem still continues.
*Other protection devices may be activated automatically if the voltage is not within a given set range, or &quot;load shedding&quot; could be activated in case of a local overload. This will switch off a predetermined portion of the distribution system, while leaving on only hospitals, security areas, and other high-priority loads.
*A &quot;reclosing feature&quot; is usually also a part of the [[w:Power system automation|power system automation]]. It is an important feature to deal with very short local problems, such as lightning strikes, tree branches and/or other weather-related problems, even, perhaps, an animal causing a temporary short circuit. A reclosing of one or more circuit breakers may be activated immediately after a disconnection has occurred, but only once, and often at that time everything is back to normal; if not, then a second, permanent, disconnection is activated.
*Some substations also include a synchronizer to ensure automatic synchronization before two circuits can be connected together. This happens in substations, for example, before generators can be connected to a bus that is connected to the grid and that synchronizer ensures the proper phase and voltage relation between the two circuits to be connected together. Because it takes a short time for a circuit breaker to actually effect the connection, that time delay must be taken into consideration by the synchronizer. The speed of a generator is related to the frequency of its output, and that speed is changed as required by the synchronizer to ensure both sides of the circuit breaker are at very nearly the same frequency, within set limits, before the &quot;connect&quot; signal is sent by the synchronizer to the circuit breaker.

===Supervisory Control===

This enables various operations to be carried out from a remote location, such as the operation of circuit breakers, the transmission to remotely located human operators of vital data from unmanned substations, such as voltage, current, power magnitude and power direction at various points of the substation. Even automatic synchronization can be effected remotely, if necessary, before two circuits are connected together by a circuit breaker at just the right time in the cycle.

See also from Wikipedia:[[w:Circuit breaker|Circuit breakers]] and [[w:Power outage|Power outage]]

==The grid==
A transmission '''grid''' is a high-voltage network for long-distance electric power transmission;
 
A distribution '''grid''' is a medium- and low-voltage network for local distribution of electric power to end-users;

Usually the grid contains many substations that are connected via [[w:Transmission line|transmission lines]] to one another. These substations contain protective equipment that in case of problems can automatically operate circuit breakers, disconnecting certain portions of the grid from the grid

==Wires and [[w:Cable|cables]]==
===Wire Gauges===
There are a number of gauges (a certain number assigned to that wire size), with wires and cables sold per that gauge number, not by its diameter. Different gauges exist.
*For example the Radio Engineer's Pocket Book by F.J.Camm, published by George Newnes Limited, London, lists on pages 79-32 that relationship between the gauge number and the actual diameters in inches as well as in millimeters for different gauges. On pages 77 to 78 is a list related to copper wire, giving the number according to the &quot;Standard Wire Gauge&quot; (SWG), the diameter of the wire in inches, its resistance in Ohms per yard, in Ohms per pound weight, the number of pounds per Ohm, per 1000 yards, yards per pound, and the number of turns per inch for coils, using different insulation materials: Enamel only, single silk, double silk, single cotton and double cotton.
*For example the number 10 is assigned to its gauge by the American Wire Gauge ([[w:American wire gauge|AWG]]) to a wire having 0.101 inches diameter (=2.565 milimeter), but that same number 10 is assigned under the British SWG label to a wire having a diameter of 0.128 inches. 
See also on Wikipedia more details about [[w:Category:Wire gauges|Wire gauges]] and about [[w:Power cable|Power cables]]. See also, about gauges, for examples, 
*http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/wirega.html and 
*http://shopswarf.orcon.net.nz/wiregage.html

===Fuses===
A thin piece of wire can be connected in series with the load. The current flowing will heat that wire, and if the current is too high that wire will melt and therefore will disconnect the current flowing into the load. The maximum amount of current such a wire can carry without melting depends on the outside temperature and also to what extent the surrounding air will cool the wire, but wire supply companies have published tables showing the approximate maximum current a particular wire can be expected to carry without &quot;burning out&quot;.
*For example the fuse wire table published by the London Electric Wire Company and Smiths, Limited (LewcoS) lists 
*for 1 Ampere: Copper: 0.0020 inches diameter, Aluminum/Aluminium: 0.0028, Tin: 0.0076, Allo-Tin and Lead: 0.0084
*for 15 Ampere: 0.0124, 0.0164, 0.044, 0.048
*for 60 Ampere: 0.032, 0.040, 0.110, 0.128
Modern fuses have the fuse wire enclosed, and are sold with a specific Ampere rating.

See also Fuses, also [[w:Fuse (electrical)|Fuses]] in Wikipedia.

===Stranded Wire===
When wires are bent often then they very likely will break eventually. If a power cable is going to be subject to movement, then usually '''Stranded Conductors''' are used, meaning that a bunch of wires are used in parallel, ensuring that if one of them breaks very little, if anything, will be affected by that single breakage. Cables should be regularly inspected to find such breakages, if any.
* The LewcoS (The London Electric Wire Company and Smiths, Limited) wire tables provide multiplying constants for stranded circular conductors; their sectional area, weight and resistance.
*For example, if there are 3 strands, then the diameter of the bunch as a whole is multiplied not by 3, but by only 2.155; the sectional area  by 2.94118, the weight by 3.06000, and the resistance (reactance can be neglected at power frequencies) by 0.340000 of those of one of these wires (also called &quot;strands&quot;) alone. Assuming we have a bunch of 3 wires, each with a diameter of 0.029 inches, and we want to know the combined area of 3 of these wires as a bunch, then we multiply the cross-sectional area of one of the wires having that diameter (0.0006605 square inches) by 2.94118 to get 0.001943 square inches for the bunch.
*The multipliers are for DIAMETER, AREA, WEIGHT, RESISTANCE:
*for 3 strands: 2.155, 2.94118, 3.06000, 0.34000
*for 7........: 3.000, 6.88235, 7.12000, 0.145299
*for 19.......: 5.000, 18.6471, 19.3600,  0.0536278
*for 37.......: 7.000, 36.2941, 37.7200, 0.0275527 
*for 61.......: 9.000, 59.8235, 62.2000, 0.0167158
*for 91.......:11.000, 89.2353, 92.8000, 0.0112063
*for 127......:13.000, 124.529, 129.520, 0.00803023
*for 169......:15.000, 165.706, 172.360, 0.00603479

Large diameter wires are also listed up to a carrying capacity of 648 Amperes, for 127-strands of 0.103 inch diameter stranded wire made of standard annealed copper.

===Resistance Wire===
The LewcoS Wire Tables provide data for 3 kinds of '''Resistance Wire''': No.1 and No.2 Nickel Chrome, and also for Eureka resistance wire. These tables provide Gauge (SWG), diameter (inches and millimeters), the resistance in Ohms per 1000 yards while the wire temperature is 15.5°C, 500°C and 1000°Celsius. As current passes through/thru that wire it heats it, and the tables show the current in Amperes that will increase the wire's temperature by 100°C, 500°C and 1000°Celsius. The tables also show the weight of the wire in pounds (lbs) per 1000 yards.
* For example: Many houses have a limit of 15 amperes on their room circuits, and we find in the tables that in order to obtain a temperature rise of about 1000°C with about 14 Ampere flowing No.2 Nickel Chrome Resistance Wire should be used, having a diameter of 0.032 inches or 0.81 millimeters, which is gauge 21 (SWG). The resistance of that wire at 1000°C is 2114 Ohms per 1000 yards. Given the applied voltage, and the required current, the required wire length can be calculated approximately. &quot;Fine tuning&quot; for each specific application may be advisable.

=== Wire for [[w:Coil|coils]]===
The LewcoS wire tables provide also information on enamelled copper wire. Often close-wound coils with insulation coverings of enamel only, enamel plus single silk, enamel with ordinary single cotton, single silk only, double silk, ordinary single cotton and ordinary double cotton are used, and the number of turns per inch of coil length obtained are also listed.
* For example about 26 turns per inch, side by side, are available if gauge No.20 (SWG) wire (0.036 inches diameter) is used with only enamel insulation on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives and Risks ==

Camel and Horse Attacks are normally used as a counter-attack in response to an attack by the enemy Elephant on the opposite side of the board.  Camel and Horse Attacks can also be used as part of a [[Arimaa/Double-Trap_Attacks | Double-Trap Attack]].

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories can apply equally to attacks on all 4 traps.'''''

Reasons to use a Camel and Horse Attack:
* to generate a counter-attack against an enemy trap that is not defended by an Elephant or Camel
* to take control of an enemy trap when the enemy elephant and camel are unable or unwilling to defend the trap (e.g. when the enemy camel has been taken hostage)
* to create a goal threat
* to distract the enemy Elephant
* to complete a double-trap attack

Risks involved in a Camel and Horse Attack:
* Either Horse or Camel can be taken hostage or trapped if the enemy Camel or Elephant approaches the trap.
* Home traps may become weakened.

== Ideal Placement of Pieces ==

The ideal placement of pieces will depend greatly upon the board situation.  If the Silver Elephant is protecting a Camel hostage at f3, it may be advantageous for Gold to launch a Camel and Horse Attack against c6.  In that case, the Gold Camel should be kept safe so that the Silver Elephant cannot escape the hostage situation at f3 by trapping the Gold Camel at c6.  Ideally, the Horse and Camel should be placed on b6 and c7 and additional attacker(s) are often called up to secure and defend the trap.  A third or fourth attacker not only assists in controlling the enemy trap but will also create greater difficulties for the Silver Elephant if it crosses the board to disrupt the attack.  An attacker should never occupy d6 unless the f6 trap can be secured by friendly pieces or all the stronger enemy pieces can be kept away from the d6 square.

If the Gold Elephant is already attacking the f6 trap then the Gold Camel is normally best placed on the b6 square with the Horse on d6.  This places attacking Camel as far as possible from the defending Elephant while still holding the ideal b6/d6 attacking formation.  However, if the Silver Elephant is blockaded, or otherwise unable to reach the d6 square, then it may be preferable to centralize the Camel at d6 due to its greater strength.

During a middlegame or endgame in which the Camel and Horse are being used to facilitate a Rabbit advance, the Gold Camel is normally placed on the c7 square.  From this square, the Camel may still maintain a safe distance from the Silver Elephant while also threatening enemy pieces participating in back rank goal defense.

== Defensive Systems and Counter-Attacks ==

The easiest way to defend against a Camel and Horse Attack is to move a Camel or Elephant toward the same trap with the intention of taking a hostage.  This is not always possible because the attacking player will normally attempt to seize a weak trap which cannot be easily defended by either the Camel or Elephant.

Camel and Horse Attacks are often intended as a counter-attack to offset/distract an enemy Elephant attack on the opposite wing.  In these cases, it is recommended that the attacker bring at least three, preferably four, attackers so that the Silver Elephant cannot easily return to the home trap and capture the Gold Camel.  It is not difficult for a defending Elephant to hold two attackers hostage while threatening to trap a third - hence, four attackers are often recommended.  It is uncommon for an opposing Elephant to commence an attack on the opposite wing in response to a Camel and Horse Attack.

If the Gold player is contesting the f6 trap (with an Elephant and Horse Attack, for example), a second attack against the c6 trap could be devastating for Silver.  Therefore, it is necessary for silver to either counter-attack with the Camel to preempt or prevent a Gold Camel and Horse Attack or, at the very least, to secure the b6 and c7 squares with strong pieces.

== Ideas for Setup ==

For simultaneous attacks against both enemy traps during the opening phase, see [[Arimaa/Double-Trap_Attacks | the next chapter]].

Balanced forces are important during the game both to launch, and defend against, a Camel and Horse Attack.  As such, most players will setup an Elephant and Horse on one half of the board and a Camel and Horse on the other.   Setting up and maintaining the Camel on the home rank middle is a good strategy to protect against a Camel-drag but is not ideal if the Camel wishes to participate on either side of a Camel and Horse Attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives and Risks ==

The Double-Trap Attack is a highly aggressive attacking system in which the attacking player attempts to control both enemy traps in rapid succession.

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6-f6 traps.  Naturally, the same theories can apply equally to Silver attacks.'''''

Reasons to use a Double-Trap Attack:
* to control or contest all four traps simultaneously
* to establish a large space and mobility advantage
* to immobilize large numbers of enemy pieces on both sides of the board
* to facilitate Rabbit advances on both wings simultaneously

Risks associated with a Double-Trap Attack:
* The attack requires a commitment of all the strongest pieces - once the attack has begun there is often no turning back!
* A failed attack will result in large material losses for the attacker.
* The home traps will be severely weakened.
* The goal defense will be compromised for the attacking player.

== Ideal Placement of Pieces ==

== Defensive Systems and Counter-Attacks ==

A successful defense against a Double-Trap attack will often require hostages and frames on both wings and it is essential that the defending Elephant remain mobile.  The defending Elephant should only become decentralized if necessary to trap an enemy piece or take the attacking Camel hostage.

Attacking Rabbits will be brought forward in swarms to unfreeze allied pieces and generate long-term goal threats across the board.  They should be contained and frozen whenever possible, or pushed to the center where they can be used to blockade their stronger allies.

Counter-attacking with the Elephant, along with one or two supporting units, can distract the enemy attackers.  In addition, an aggressive Double-Trap Attack will create a patchy goal defense that can be exploited with a counter-attack that includes at least one Rabbit.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to create counter-threats when both home traps are under attack!  If a counter-attack is not possible, the defender will have to methodically isolate and immobilize attackers while neutralizing the attacks on both wings.  A successful defense will allow the defending player to realize large material gains before a counter-attack is even feasible.

== Ideas for Setup ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 21 years old. I graduated from my third college course and still no job. Interviews come by the dozens but job offers are none! I am a Pharmacy Assistant Health Care Aide plus a medical transcriptionist, but after all the years in school and all the money spent on education, I am still unable to find work! Am I to live in poverty because people only see me at my worst?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews for me are a horrid experience. I've had people pick up a newspaper and start reading it, waiting for me to get out of a block. All the interviewers act as if I'm wasting their time. It's more like they're wasting mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people could only see me when I am fluent I'm sure I would have a job. On interviews I find myself apologizing for my speech&amp;#133;but why do I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone out there who is experiencing the same problems? I need help to cope.{{ref|Giret1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an embedded software engineer, and today I was faced with a situation that I have not ran into yet in my pursuit of employment. Like many of you I have had the phone hung up on me by recruiters, or they rudely and quickly end the phone conversation. I had a personal phone interview with Motorola. First, the interview was designed to be very high stress. Second, the questions were given to me in advance which only made the situation worse. Of course it being a phone interview made it worst. I was unable to form sentences and completely locked up on the interview and was eliminated from the running for this software engineering position. Can I do anything? According to the recruiter I'm a great fit for the position, god this frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&amp;#151;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate students in my stuttering class [surveyed employers, who] indicated that they would prefer to hire someone who was deaf or someone with moderate cerebral palsy rather than someone who stuttered. Interestingly, several of the employers who said they would not hire a stutterer had one or more stutterers already working for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we probed to understand the WHY behind the employers' responses, we learned that essentially they thought they &amp;quot;understood&amp;quot; deafness and cerebral palsy, but stuttering was strange&amp;#151;and they assumed that persons who stutter were strange.{{ref|Freeman1993}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten months after completing a stuttering therapy program, 44% of stutterers had received a promotion. 40% had changed jobs, 36% reporting that the change was for the better. Combining these, about 60% had improved employment after stuttering therapy. The study also found that 88% of the stutterers had maintained their fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their employers reported a 20% improvement in &amp;quot;communication effectiveness&amp;quot; for the stutterers completing therapy.{{ref|Craig1991}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers earn approximately $7200 less per year than non-stutterers.{{ref|Schwartz1996}}
 Two groups of 25 persons were examined. The groups were matched for age, sex, IQ, race, education, and socioeconomic background. The subjects were contacted ten years after graduating from college. They were asked a number of questions relating to levels of achievement. The difference did not appear to be the result of employer discrimination. Rather, the stutterers were reluctant to accept promotions that involved making presentations to groups of people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I have refused (or went &amp;quot;kicking&amp;quot;) different projects at my job, which may/may not lead to promotions. Most recently, I went kicking on co-facilitating a corporate-wide quality workshop initiative. My partner in facilitation, after much coaxing by me, took the majority of the speaking sections, while I became her assistant. (Please be aware that I have not discussed my disorder with my co-workers, I am a mild stutter that can usually &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; for a fluent speaker.) I am now interested in changing careers and am looking for careers that focus on &amp;quot;behind the scenes&amp;quot; work&amp;#133;i.e., technical writing. I have considered such careers as Law, but have veered away from them.{{ref|mail}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Talk About Your Stuttering==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interview lasted about two minutes. The interviewer (another personnel director&amp;#151;they seem to be the worst problem) found an excuse to say I was not qualified for the job&amp;#151;so good-bye. I protested, asked for the technical interview and was asked to leave. As his excuse was plainly made up&amp;#151;this was also probably a case of discrimination.{{ref|Bertollo}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin the interview by talking about your stuttering. You may only get two minutes if you don't!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a copy of &lt;i&gt;Stuttering: Answers for Employers&lt;/i&gt; by the Stuttering Foundation of America with you to the interview.  You can download a PDF of the brochure from the web site at www.stutteringhelp.org.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you're looking for a job or already have a job, talk about your stuttering. Many people feel uncomfortable talking to a person who stutters. Educate them about stuttering to make them feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people make incorrect assumptions about individuals who stutter. E.g., some people think that individuals who stutter are mentally retarded&amp;#151;even if you have a Ph.D.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excellent communication skills&amp;quot; is the #1 qualification employers look for. Regardless of whether the help-wanted ad included this, say that you have excellent communication skills. Give concrete examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you're in a speech therapy program, discuss your progress and the techniques or strategies you use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you learned nonavoidance skills in speech therapy, explain that although you stutter, you've overcome your fears of talking to strangers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I can say a phrase fluently if I say it a lot. In my last job, I pretty much said the same things to customers all day, and my speech was fine.&amp;quot; This should be acceptable for retail jobs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you use an electronic anti-stuttering device, show it to the interviewer and explain how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the job requires making presentations, say that you can't say as much as non-stutterers so you prepare your remarks in advance and get right to the main points, unlike people who ramble on for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Membership in Toastmasters proves that you have excellent communication skills. Toastmasters gives out lots of prizes, so mention if you won a blue ribbon for one of your speeches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is a two-way street. Say that you may not speak as well as other people, but you listen more carefully. Demonstrate that by not interrupting the interviewer, and by rephrasing and repeating back his questions. Ask the interviewer whether listening or speaking is more important in the job&amp;#151;they'll always say that listening is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview for the job that I currently have was one of the few interviews in which I discussed in depth the nature of my stuttering problem. I spent about a half-hour discussing my speech, and I think that it was very helpful for the interviewer in understanding how well I could work around my handicap.{{ref|Morrow}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Americans With Disabilities Act==

&lt;p&gt;In 1992, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) outlawed employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Speaking was defined as a &amp;quot;major life activity&amp;quot; that the inability to do is disabling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central point of the ADA is that individuals with a disability can ask their employer (or potential employer) for a &lt;i&gt;reasonable accommodation&lt;/i&gt;. A reasonable accommodation is a change to the job that will enable the individual to do the job. E.g., a stutterer might ask that he not have to answer the telephone. Or he might ask that the employer buy an anti-stuttering telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an individual with a disability requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer must make the accommodation. The individual must make the request. If the individual doesn't make such a request, the employer is not obligated to suggest an accommodation, or to hire the individual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers aren't allowed to ask employees (or potential employees) about disabilities. It is essential that stutterers talk to employers about their speech. In a job interview, say that you stutter. Then ask whether your speech will interfere with the job. If you don't ask, winning a lawsuit will be difficult or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your employer (or potential employer) tells you that &amp;quot;good communication skills&amp;quot; are necessary for the job, talk about the specifics. As noted above, you can explain that you have excellent communication skills. You can also ask for reasonable accommodations as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers rarely talk to their employers about their speech. The few stutterers who've told me that they talked about their stuttering with their employer reported 100% successful results of the conversation. In every case, the employer wanted to help the stutterer, but didn't know what to do. Every request was a reasonable accommodation has been granted, as far as I've heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 99% of stutterers who don't talk about their speech with their employers are treated badly, in one way or another. When they feel they've been discriminated against, they don't win ADA lawsuits because neither they nor their employer ever said anything about their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the ADA, visit the [http://www.eeoc.gov Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website] or [http://www.justice.gov/disabilities.htm http://www.justice.gov/disabilities.htm]. If you need to hire an attorney experienced with discrimination against stutterers, call the National Stuttering Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADA does not apply to the federal government, including the military services. The ADA covers only employment discrimination. If you experience discrimination or harassment outside of work, you will have to rely on other federal or state laws.&lt;/p&gt;

==Vocational Rehabilitation==

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a job, make an appointment with a vocational rehabilitation counselor. Look in your telephone directory's blue (government) pages under your state's department of labor (or department of education in some states).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voc rehab counselors want you to succeed. They'll get you whatever therapy, devices, or job training you need. I've heard many good reports from stutterers about voc rehab counselors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stutterer complained that, after paying for stuttering therapy and an electronic device, the counselor also wanted to pay for his CPA certification. The stutterer insisted he would pay for his own certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Head injuries and strokes&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Head injury|Head injuries]] and [[w:Stroke|strokes]] can cause repetitions, prolongations, and blocks - some cases being the result of Broca's aphasia, and others being an acquired disorder of neurogenically-based stuttering.  &lt;i&gt;Neurogenic&lt;/i&gt; stutterers lack the same types of struggle behavior, and the fears and anxieties of developmental stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental stutterers can fluently speak certain memorized phrases, such as the &amp;quot;Pledge of Allegiance.&amp;quot; Neurogenic stutterers are disfluent on everything. Developmental stutterers can speak fluently in certain (typically low-stress) situations. Neurogenic stutterers are disfluent everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy techniques and devices help some individuals with neurogenic speech disorders, but don't help others. Because different people have different areas of their brains injured, a treatment that's effective for one person may not be effective for another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Psychogenic stuttering&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Rarely, traumatic experiences caused an adult to stutter. &lt;i&gt;Psychogenic&lt;/i&gt; stuttering typically involves rapid, effortless repetitions of initial sounds, without struggle behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Altered Auditory Feedback&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;High school students can build an altered auditory feedback device for a science project. Several alternatives are also possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find a DAF kit by doing a websearch for &amp;quot;delay echo reverb kit.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find a FAF kit by doing a websearch for &amp;quot;voice changer kit.&amp;quot; Or rewire a voice changer toy (about $20) to use headphones instead of a speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find a MAF kit by doing a websearch for &amp;quot;function generator kit.&amp;quot; MAF uses a 105 Hz sine wave.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guitar effects processors usually have both reverb (DAF) and frequency-shift (FAF) effects.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Writing your own DAF software is easy. FAF software is harder, as it requires a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for octave-scale FAF. DAF/FAF software can be downloaded for about $30 from [http://www.artefactsoft.com/ http://www.artefactsoft.com].&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set up a computer to measure and display your vocal amplitude and frequency. Use a Radio Shack multimeter with a frequency counter and computer output. With a microphone the total cost should be $100-150. Or look for audio recording software with frequency analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do the following experiments on yourself, or find volunteer subjects in your stuttering support group. Ask your speech-language pathologist to help you find a support group, or call the National Stuttering Association at (800) 364-1677. Experiments to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tape record a stutterer's speech at fast and slow speaking rates, without the device; and then with DAF set at 50 ms, 100 ms, and 200 ms. Count the number of disfluencies per minute, and the number of syllables per minute. Graph the relationship between fluency and speaking rate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you agree with speech-language pathologist Janice Costello-Ingham, Ph.D., that &amp;quot;the functional variable in regard to the reduction of stuttering is not DAF, but prolonged speech, and the latter can be produced without reliance on a DAF machine&amp;quot;{{ref|Costello1993}} or do you agree with speech-language pathologist Joseph Kalinowski, Ph.D., that &amp;quot;a slowed rate of speech is not a necessary antecedent for fluency improvement under conditions of altered auditory feedback.&amp;quot;{{ref|Kalinowski1996}} I.e., does DAF improve speech only when the stutterer talks slower, or does DAF improve speech at normal speaking rates?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Math and physics: measure and calibrate the delay control of a DAF device. You'll need a frequency generator, frequency counter, and a dual-trace oscilloscope. Feed a sine wave into the DAF device. Set up the oscilloscope to display the input and output of the DAF device. At what frequencies do the two waves match? Find at least three matching frequencies for each DAF setting. Divide one by the differences between the matching frequencies to get the delay length, in milliseconds. Explain why this works.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the DAF device on a person who does not stutter, at different delay settings. How is the DAF effect different on individuals who don't stutter, and persons who stutter?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tape record a stutterer speaking (without DAF) for at least three minutes. Then have the person speak with DAF for ten minutes. Take off the device and record another three minutes of speech. Does DAF cause carryover fluency (after removing the device)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Show how to use a vocal amplitude display to help you do gentle onsets. Show how vocal frequency is a surrogate for vocal fold tension, i.e., relaxed vocal folds produce a low vocal frequency, and tense vocal folds produce a high vocal frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find out if any of your relatives stutter. Draw a family tree showing your relationship to the person. Present evidence that stuttering has a genetic cause, and evidence that stuttering is not genetic.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find a speech clinic that has a speech biofeedback system. Write a report about what the biofeedback system does.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repeat Wendell Johnson's 1937 studies of adaptation and anticipation. These studies are described in A Handbook on Stuttering, by Oliver Bloodstein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write a report on the history of stuttering therapy, using Stuttering: The Search for a Cause and Cure by Oliver Bloodstein.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write a report about a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Famous People Who Stutter|famous person who stutters]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Interview a speech pathologist about the cause of and treatments for stuttering. Describe the techniques and goals of two therapies. Ask your school district if they have a speech pathologist specializing in stuttering, or call the Stuttering Foundation of America at (800) 992-9392 to find a stuttering specialist.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Help your school's speech pathologist organize a &amp;quot;Youth Day,&amp;quot; with the help of [http://www.friendswhostutter.org/ Friends Who Stutter] or the [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association]. This is a weekend workshop in which a childhood stuttering specialist trains school speech-language pathologists and parents to treat stuttering. At the same time, the children play speech therapy games and meet each other.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Observe a speech pathologist treating a preschool child who stutters. Write a report about this, answering these questions: What games did the speech pathologist play with the child? What was the purpose of the game? What did the speech pathologist talk about with the child's parents?&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Interview a successful adult who stutters. This could be an accountant, a lawyer, or a teacher. You can find such a person by calling a [http://www.nsastutter.org/content/index.php?catid=101 local stuttering support group]. Ask how stuttering affected the person's childhood and high school years; adult life; choice of career; and marriage or relationships. What stuttering therapy has the person had? How severely did the person stutter when he or she was younger? Are there situations in which he or she stutters more, or stutters less? Are there are speaking situations he or she fears or avoids because of stuttering?&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Does another student have a disability? Compare yourself to a student with a physical disability, and to a student with a non-physical disability (e.g., mental, emotional, or learning disability). See [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Support Groups#The Disability Hierarchy|The Disability Hierarchy]].&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun With Fluency: Direct Therapy with the Young Child, by Patty Walton, MA-SLP, and Mary Wallace, MA-SLP (1998; ISBN 1883315395) is the best book I've read about treating children ages two to seven years old. It's all about [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Direct Therapy|direct stuttering therapy]] (as opposed to the old, ineffective [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Indirect Therapy|indirect]] methods. A hierarchical progression of therapy begins with easy, stretchy speech; making direct requests for easy speech; modeling self-corrections; play speech games; contrast easy speech with hard speech; and embracing the speech villains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis, by Richard Schmidt, Tim Lee (2005; ISBN 073604258X) will tell you more about stuttering therapy, especially fluency shaping therapy, than any other book&amp;#151;even though this book never mentions stuttering. This book is about how our brains learn and execute complex motor (muscle) skills. Fluent speech is our most complex motor skill. If the stuttering &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; were to read this book, stuttering therapy would advance fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering: An Integrated Approach to Its Nature and Treatment, by Barry Guitar (1998). This is the best book I've read about stuttering. The first part of the book presents the essentials of stuttering research. The second part of the book differentiates stuttering modification therapy from fluency shaping therapy, and then shows how to integrate the two therapies. The writing is clear and understandable to undergraduate speech-language pathology students or even non-speech-language pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Moves: Why Learning Is Not All in Your Head, by Carla Hannaford (1995; ISBN 0915556278) is yet another book that  isn’t about stuttering. This book shows how (and why) to use cross-lateral exercises to enhance learning. When we learn one thing in one area of our brain, and learn something else in another area, sometimes the different areas of the brain fail to communi-cate and we don’t seem to have learned. This is clear with learning-disabled children who can learn numbers, learn the words for numbers, and learn pictures of a number of objects (e.g., 7, seven, and seven apples) but fail to connect these concepts. Cross-lateral exercises involve moving your left hand or foot to the right side of your body, and your right hand or foot to the left side of your body (crossing your midline). Such exercises require commu-nication between your brain’s left and right hemispheres and seem to enhance learning. Because stutterers have more activity in their right hemispheres during speech, when non-stutterers have more activity in their left hemispheres during speech, cross-lateral exercises might enhance stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering: A Life Bound Up In Words, by Marty Jezer (1997). Jezer was a talented and entertaining writer, and author of biographies of Abbie Hoffman, Rachel Carson, and other books. This is Jezer's autobiography, and stuttering affected everything in his life. You learn much about stuttering and especially stuttering therapies, because Jezer went gone through just about every therapy program (and still stuttered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knotted Tongues, by Benson Bobrick (1996). Bobrick is a historian, and the bulk of the book is about historical and literary persons who stuttered. These include Moses, Charles I, Lewis Carroll, Henry James, W. Somerset Maugham, Winston Churchill, and Marilyn Monroe. Bobrick also covers the history of stuttering treatments. &lt;i&gt;Knotted Tongues&lt;/i&gt; is written for non-professionals. The book also has a thirty-page overview of stuttering science, and a twenty-page overview of stuttering therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Mary Marony&lt;/i&gt; series of books, by Suzy Kline, portrays a seven-year-old girl who stutters. She is supported by her parents, speech pathologist, and teacher. In Mary Marony Hides Out (1996), Mary's favorite author comes to talk to her school. She is torn between her desire to talk to the author and her fear of speaking in the school assembly. When she gets up the courage to speak, a classmate makes fun of her, and Mary hides in the bathroom. The author stuttered growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Loop, by Nicholas Evans (1998; ISBN 0440224624) Like Evans' first novel [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=softlogic&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26keyword=0440222656%26index=books The Horse Whisperer], this book is set in Montana. The central characters are a successful rancher and Luke, the rancher's 18-year-old son. Luke stutters, and the father punishes him as if stuttering were a character flaw. The other teenagers ridicule Luke. His speech-language pathologist (who uses stuttering modification therapy) is sincere but ineffective. Luke decides not to go to college because he's afraid to talk. He's happy alone in the mountains, watching his father's cattle. Or so his father thinks. Luke is actually watching a family of wolves. When his father wants to kill the wolves, Luke courageously stands up to his father.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hypertension is &quot;increasing in blood pressure&quot;. Physiologically (normally) in adult it is under 130/85 mmHg (read: one hundred thirty with eighty five millimeters of mercury column). First value refers to systolic pressure and the second refers to diastolic pressure. Normal blood pressure is defined as blood pressure that does not make any structural or functional modifications on target organs (eye, kidney, brain, heart and periferic vessels). These structural or functional modifications that appear on target organs in hypertension are referred vascular remodeling.
Classification: 
#primary hypertension (multiple causes, or unknown etiology) 
#secondary hypertension (known cause)

== It's a me, AER! ==
I use this name for Wolfenstien: ET, Quake 3, Quake 4, and Doom 3. In Warcraft 3 I am named urbanape. This is the same
for Planetside, Medal of Honor Allied Assault (all expansions), Tribes 2, Diablo 2, Starcraft, and in Active Worlds I
am a tourist, but named urbanape. Oh yea, and in Tribes 1 I am AER (I think... maybe...).
My email is toxicitysystem@gmail.com, feel free to email me with questions about hacking any of the above games (I may
have your answer), and anything at all about the following software:
-Milkshape 3D
-Adobe Photoshop
-Wings 3D
-Blender (I'm still a newb at this, but I can help other newbs with less experience at least)
-Dev C++ (same with this)
-GTK Radiant (or any other radiant AT ALL)

I am open for helping out any potential modmakers, by providing models for no cost at all, and I also don't require for you to even give me credit, I'm just happy for something to practice on.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Context Sensitive Menus==
One of the great advantages of using Wings is its '''Context Sensitive Menus'''.  With all the modeling tools specific to the current Selection mode just a mouse click away Wings has both a powerful and efficient work flow  .  Right-clicking anywhere in the Geometry Window will bring up a menu with all the tools and commands available for the current selection.  Often this menu is referred to as the ''Right-Click Menu''.  There are six different selection modes and each has its own unique Right-Click Menu:  ''No Current Selection'', ''Vertex'', ''Edge'', ''Face'', ''Object/Body'' and ''Lights''.   Right-clicking with any element of geometry selected will bring up the appropriate menu for the mode you are in.  If nothing is selected right- clicking brings up the ''No Selection''  also referred to as the ''Primitives'' menu.

==Selection Modes==
In Wings3D the menu functions displayed are only those available to the current selection mode employed.&lt;br&gt; After all, why display greyed out menu items that are unavailable to the user?&lt;br&gt;
Also note that a lot of operations with the same names should perform a ''similar'' operation in their respective modes. It is possible for the behavior of a given operation to vary (sometimes substantially) depending on what mode it occurs in.

Eg Using Face | Rotate will cause all selected, isolated faces to rotate about their own individual (local) axis, but converting the same selection to Vert mode will result in all selected verts rotating around a single common axis.

== Create mode items (no current selection) ==

Selecting any of these creates a basic primitive in the geometry window:
&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; float: left; width: 15em&quot;&gt;
*Tetrahedron
*Octahedron
*Octotoad
*Dodecahedron
*Icosahedron
*Cube
*Cylinder
*Cone
*Sphere
*Torus&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
*Grid
*Text
*More
**Torus Knot
**Spiral
**Spring
**UV Torus
**Lumpy Torus
**Spiral Torus
&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

Selecting any of these items creates a lighting reference which may be used for rendering:
*Light
**Infinite
**Point
**Spot
**Ambient
**Area

Selecting Material allows you to edit or create a new material.&lt;br&gt;
Selecting image allows you to import an image for later use within wings.

== Vertex Mode Items (vertex selected) ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">I gave a general outline to get things started with context sensitive menus. Anyone who can improve upon it, add a better description regarding context sensitivity and the outline structure should feel free to do so. Also I think rather than describing every funtion outlined for a given mode, each should be provided with a link and its own page so that it can have its operation described in detail. (Axes, magnet moves, in reference to a point, etc.) It would get even more lengthy otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== which microcontroller to choose ==

''(Would this be good to put in the book?)''

A couple of pages that compare various microprocessors:

* I expect [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/3221 ''&quot;APPLICATION NOTE 3221: Benchmarking the MAXQ Instruction-Set Architecture vs. RISC Competitors&quot;''] to be biased in favor of the Maxim MAXQ, but it seems like a fairly neutral comparison of the Microchip PIC16 family, Atmel AVR family, and the TI MSP430.
* [http://www.htsoft.com/forum/all/printthread.php/Cat/0/Board/pic/main/15086/type/thread PIC vs. MSP430] seems to come to the conclusion that, when very low power consumption is critical, the TI MSP430 is the way to go.

A few pointers to C for several microcontrollers:

* The GCC toolchain for the Texas Instruments MSP430 MCUs http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/
* SDCC - Small Device C Compiler for the Intel 8051, Maxim 80DS390, Zilog Z80, Motorola 68HC08, Microchip PIC16, Microchip PIC18 http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/
* WinAVR for the Atmel AVR (includes GNU GCC for C and C++) http://winavr.sourceforge.net/

A few pointers to Forth for several microcontrollers:

* many Forth compilers for a wide variety of microprocessors http://www.taygeta.com/forth.html

----

:I think all of these things are definately worth mentioning. It makes good sense that we compare/contrast the different microcontrollers, on the basis of their price, the available tools (hardware and software) for production, the differences in pin output (voltage levels, max current throughput, etc.). The current outline also doesn't have any information on Forth, which needs to change. I personally don't know a whole lot about the language, but i would be happy to contribute what i do know. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:43, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
:'''PS:''' Also, when comparing the microcontrollers, it would be a good idea to point out what formfactors they come in. For instance, the TI chips have certain benefits, but it can be difficult to find them in DIP packages. Likewise, PIC18 DIP chips are very long compared to other mid-range DIP chips. We can also discuss how to use other form factors for prototyping and hobby use. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

----

I think the list 'which uC to choose' would be much better if compiled into table format, listing which features are available. Things aren't usually depending only on one feature. [[User:193.229.211.1|193.229.211.1]] 09:32, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

&quot;PIC vs. MSP430 seems to come to the conclusion that, when very low power consumption is critical, the TI MSP430 is the way to go.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's not true. There are many application that uses an MSP430 because it is easier to programm as a PIC. The MSP430's von-Neumann Architekture makes it quite simple to acccess its memory. The orthogonal architecture makes it easy to program it in Assembler and allows the C compiler writers to do a good job...

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Status Bar===

The '''Status Bar''' is just below the '''Toolbar''' in the '''Geometry Window'''.
[[Image:Wings_status_bar.png|frame|left|''Here the '''Status Bar''' tells us that the distance between selected vertices 2 and 6 is equal to 2.0 wu (wings units). This is just one example of the kind of useful information to be found in the Status Bar.  The Status Bar changes automatically to display relevant information about selected elements or helpful comments during complex modeling operations.  Keeping an eye on the Status Bar is important as it gives you valuable information about the status of an operation while manipulating elements of geometry.  It displays this information in '''Degrees(°)''' for rotations, as a '''Percentage(%)''' during scale operations, and in '''Distances(D)''' for movements in Wings Units (wu).'']]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The screen shown on this page requires a special appearance plugin for the icon bar. The default appearance is line-drawn &quot;pyramids&quot;. (At least it is for 0.98.31)  Also note that the usual default mouse mode in Wings3D is Mirai mode, not Blender mode. This may lead to confusion elsewhere, and should not be the assumed operating mode.  When tutorials are provided, it should be made clear what mode is used when explaining specific mouse operations.&lt;br&gt;
08:48, 4 January 2006 (UTC) pauljs75

The new default appearance is the purplish-blue cubes, so screenshot is now correct.&lt;br&gt;

Should the two notes at the beginning, talking about the Mirai camera mode being the standard, and that screenshots may not necessarily reflect the most up-to-date versions of Wings, be moved to another page, like an introduction?  Otherwise, we should have these notes on every page, because they apply to every page.</text>

: I've created two templates in my user space that can help with this.  Both are intended to be used at the bottom of the page.

To specify, for example, the Humanities bookshelf, the Bookshelf_name parameter should be &quot;Humanities&quot;, not &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities&quot; or &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf&quot;.
:* [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]] presumes that it will be used on every of a book.  It is called with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:JMRyan/Shelf2|Bookshelf_name|Book_name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; where the second parameter is optional.
: The idea here is to create a [[Template:Shelf]] page by copying one of these two templates.  If we want recommend that the bookshelf be linked from every page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]]; if we want to recommend that the bookshelf be linked only from the main page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Shelf templates ==
Use this page to discuss the proposed templates at [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]] and [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]] or alternatives to these. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 10:26, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

:[[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]] seems interesting. I tried using it at [[NetHack]] and [[Guide to X11]]. Currently I put it at the top of each page.

:I have almost no interest in [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]] because I usually have other methods of linking to the book. For example, [[NetHack/Introduction and General Advice]] uses slash convention, so Wikibooks makes an automatic &quot;&lt; [[NetHack]]&quot; at the top.

:For [[Guide to X11]], I have a navigation template called &lt;s&gt;Guide to X11:toc&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;(now {{tl|Guide to X11}} --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt;. I could try to add a link to that template, saying which bookshelf has the book. However, because only the book, not its chapters, is shelved, I prefer using something like [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]].

:If we combine a shelf template with the [[User:ManuelGR/Centralized development status proposal]], the combination would improve the shelving of books. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:32, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for your interest.  Issues raised:

# ''[[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]].''  This was intended to be useful only if internal pages (subpages, chapters, whatever you want to call them) were to be linked to the bookshelf.  However, I think I agree with you that it is better to link only the book's main or top page to the bookshelf, thus making only [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]] useful.
# ''Placement on a page.''  The template was intended for the bottom of the page.  That is why I gave it the look and feel of the Categories listing instead of modeling the look of it after, for example, [[Template:Wikipedia]].  The bookshelves serve a similar function to Categories (but using a different organizing principle), so I intended the bookshelf link to nestle with the category link.  The template does not have to be used that way, but that was what I had in mind when I created it.
# ''Combining with [[User:ManuelGR/Centralized development status proposal]].''  I'm not sure what you mean.  I can think of three things you ''might'' mean:
## Somehow combine his template and mine.  That does not seem likely to me since the template would not appear on the same pages.  [[User:ManuelGR]]'s template would appear, for example, in a bookshelf while mine links to the bookshelf.
## Modify my template to work link his.  In particular, have a standardly named page something like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book_name/Bookshelf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and have Shelf1 pick up the bookshelf from there.  But if we only link to the bookshelf in on place (on the book's main page), that does not seem helpful.  [[User:ManuelGR]]'s proposal is useful because the development rating might appear in several places.
## Simply add as a guideline or policy using my template plus [[User:ManuelGR]]'s proposal.  Now that I have written all of this, I see that this is most likely what you really had in mind.  My best guess would be to have (1) [[User:ManuelGR]]'s proposal be by policy, (2) Having a link to the bookshelf from the a book's main page be a policy, and (3) using my template to accomplish (2) be a guideline.

Thanks again for your interest. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 09:05, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Photosynthesis ==
[[File:Lilac.leaves.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Lilac tree]]

Like all living things, plants need food to live. This food is used for energy and to make new materials when plants grow. Plants are able to take two inorganic chemicals, carbon dioxide gas and water, to make an organic chemical, glucose. This simple food can be used as an energy source or converted into other useful organic molecules.

Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts: the proteins that participated in the reaction are located in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplast.

Photosynthesis requires an input of energy. Plants have found a way to capture the energy from sunlight, using a pigment called chlorophyll. Once this light energy has been captured it can be used to create glucose, so converting the light energy into chemical energy. Oxygen gas is released as a waste chemical.

The formula for photosynthesis is:   

::::6CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
:: carbon dioxide + water   &amp;rarr; glucose + oxygen

The reaction: 
* reduces production of NADPH
* generates a psroton gradient for the formation of ATP
* produces oxygen

== Photosystems ==

There are two kinds of photosystems in photosynthesis that are called Photosystem I (PsI) and Photosystem II (PsII). During PsI, a light absorbing pigment called chlorophyll which is a molecule that absorbs red light of 700 nanometer wavelength most efficiently, we normally called it P700. On the other hand, the pigment in PsII reaction center chlorophyll absorbs called P680 because it absorbs light at around 680 nanometers. The reason photosynthesis has two system is that one alone can't capture enough energy to power the carbon-fixation reactions and to supply the rest of the energy requirements of plant metabolism. The combinations of these systems can cause different mechanisms to change the light energy to chemical energy, therefore provide the maximum energy that plants require. 

The process, however, starts with PsII, not PsI. The energy absorbed by a P680 molecule of chlorophyll in the reaction center of PsII first converts the molecule to its excited state and then  raises the energy level of an electron, and then the electron lose from the molecule, electron transport system accepts the electron, and immediately moves it down the transport chain, losing some energy in each transfer. We can tell that when The P680 molecule losing an electron, is unstable. To make it become stable again, we need to draw another electron from water. The process and continue over and over. 

ATP known as a energy resource, produced from the energy that lost during electron transfer. the molecule universally used by organisms as a quick energy source. 

The energy that reaches the end of the electron transport chain is transferred to the P700 chlorophyll in the reaction center of PsI. As the above said, both photosystem are similar except PsI captures light energy at 700 nm.

''' 
== Cyclic Photophosphorylation ==
'''
In the process between the photosysthems discussed above, cyclic photophosphorylation occurs on the thylakoid membrane. During Cyclic Photophosphorylation the electrons are recycled. The excited electrons resulting from the absorption of light in PS I are received by the primary electron acceptor and then transferred to an electron transport chain(move from donor to acceptor). And then the electron return back to the reaction center, repeat the process again. The electrons are using to translocate Protons which the ATPase uses to synthesize ATP. Ann No reduction of NADP+ occurs in this process.

'''
== Accessory pigments are able to funnel energy into reaction center ==
&lt;p&gt;
 Chlorophyll A &amp; B can absorb light and funnel the energy to reaction center. Robert Emerson and William Arnold did an experiment on Chlorella cells in 1932. The experiment implies that only 1 molecule of O2 was produced for 2500 chlorophyll molecules excited. Both additional chlorophylls A and B (A has methyl group and B has formyl group) are closely associated with reaction centers.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

=== Limiting Factors ===

Photosynthesis requires the following 3 factors:

#Carbon dioxide
#Water
#Light

There are a 4 factors which affect the '''rate''' at which a plant can make glucose by photosynthesis.

#The Concentration of Carbon Dioxide
#The Light Intensity
#The Temperature
#Any factor that influences the production of chlorophyll, enzymes, or energy carriers(ATP and NADPH).

We can achieve a better rate of photosynthesis, if more CO2 in the air, and if its content was less than the process needed, photosynthesis couldn't happen normally. It is hypothesized that global warming due to increased CO2 might increase plant growth.

Light intensity is another rate factor for photosynthesis. We can increase the light intensity in order to achieve more photosynthesis. But we need to know that where the plant has reached maximum photosynthesis levels, since any increase in light intensity will not affect the plant further.

Photosynthesis will occur faster in area with high temperature. But on the other hand, humidity can also affect the photosynthesis. When the air is saturated with water vapour, photosynthesis is limited. This is because at saturation levels, the air cannot absorb more moisture from the plants when they open the stoma to exchange gases.
&lt;p&gt;
=== The Structure of a leaf ===
Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves of plants. The leaves have many adaptations to make sure that as much photosynthesis goes on as possible. The more a plant can photosynthesize, the more food it can make and the faster it can grow.

[[Image:structureofaleaf.png]]

# The leaf has a waxy cuticle to stop it losing water and drying out.
# The epidermis is a protective layer of cells and contains no chloroplasts.
# The palisade layer contains the most chloroplasts as it is near the top of the leaf. The chloroplasts contain the pigment chlorophyll.
# The palisade cells are arranged upright. This means the light has to pass through the cell lengthways and so increases the chance of light hitting a chloroplast and being absorbed.
# The spongy layer contains fewer chloroplasts, enough to catch what the palisade layer cannot absorb.
# The spongy layer has air spaces to make it easier for gases to circulate in the leaf.
# The vascular bundle provides the leaf with water via the xylem vessels. Food, such as sugar, made in the leaf is transported in the phloem vessels to the rest of the leaf.
# The stomata (stoma - singular) are tiny pores that allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaf while oxygen leaves the leaf.
# Guard cells can open or close the stomatal pores to regulate how much gas can enter or leave the leaf. At night the pores close, opening in the daytime.

==Respiration in plants==

Respiration is the production of energy from glucose and oxygen with the release of carbon dioxide and water as waste products.Photo respiration occurs in many plants under sunlight. It differs from cellular respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria. The difference between photo respiration and cellular respiration is photo respiration does not release energy when it occurs. On the other hand, cellular respiration releases energy. The common part of both respiration is both of them absorb oxygen and release CO2. Photo respiration occurs at the same time with photosynthesis and uses some of the newly made carbohydrate for energy, thereby reducing the yield of photosynthesis to make it more efficiency.

The most important enzyme for the respiration is rubisco, it can make the respiration efficient. Because rubisco lacks the ability of reorganization, it accepts the O2 rather than CO2 and catalyzes a series of different reactions, resulting in carbon being released and energy being expended for no net energy gain.

'''Respiration:'''
:::C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 6CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Energy released

:::Glucose + Oxygen &amp;rarr; Carbon dioxide + water + Energy released

'''Photosynthesis:'''
:::6CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Energy  &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  

:::Carbon dioxide + water + Energy &amp;rarr; Glucose + Oxygen  

Plants use the energy from respiration to power the processes involved in growth.

===Uses of glucose===

The energy obtained from respiration is used to turn glucose into many other substances. Typical uses of glucose are:

* '''Storage products'''

::- glucose is used to make '''starch''' which can be converted back to glucose as required. Potatoes and rice are examples of parts of plants that contain starch.
::- glucose is converted into '''lipids''', especially in seeds. Sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, which are used in cooking, come from sunflower and oilseed rape seeds.

* '''Structural products'''
::- glucose is converted to '''cellulose''' to make '''cell walls'''.

* '''Other products'''

::- glucose and nitrates are used to make '''amino acids''' which are used to make '''proteins'''.
::- glucose is also a basic raw material for making chlorophyll.
::- glucose is used in respiration.

'''

== The ability to convert light into chemical energy Is ancient ==
'''
The photosystems have common structure implies a common evolutionary orgin .Geological evidence suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis became important since approximately 2 billion years ago. The green and purple sulfur bacteria carry out reactions seems exist before oxygenic photosysthesis. And both of them are similar to oxygenic photosysthesis. And because no archaea was found in photosynthetic organism, concluded that photosynthesis did not evolve immediately at the origin of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Breathing==
'''The zone of the body between the neck and the bottom of the ribs is known as the '''thorax'''. The major organs in the thorax are the heart, lungs and tongue. The lungs and associated '''airways''' allow us to breathe.
[[Image:gcsebiolbreathe1.gif|right]]
In the head the airways consist of the mouth and nasal passages. Air and food has a common passage in the throat. 

The airways from the neck into the lungs have the following divisions:

* '''Larynx''' or voicebox. This is where there is speech and sound generation.
* '''Trachea''' or windpipe.
* Two tubes that are each known as a '''bronchus''', plural '''bronchi'''.
* '''Bronchioles''' which are subdivisions of each bronchus.
* '''Alveoli''' which are sacks at the end of the airways that allow oxygenation of the blood.

{{clr}}

The key features of breathing are that when we breathe in the intercostal muscles between the ribs and the diaphragm both contract; when we breathe out both of these muscles relax. When we breathe in the contraction of the intercostals pulls the sternum up and away from the body and the descent of the diaphragm increases the volume of the thoracic cavity. Notice that in the resting state (breathing out) the diaphragm bulges up under the lungs, the lungs themselves are slightly elastic and pull the diaphragm back to this position

[[Image:Gcsebiolbreathe2.gif]]
{{clr}}
The illustrations below are an anatomically correct portrayal of the appearance of the lungs in a human being. The lung tissue itself appears pink in non-smoking country people and almost black in smokers who live in cities.[[Image:heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The '''lungs''' flank the heart and great vessels in the chest cavity. &lt;small&gt;(Source: ''Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body'', 20th ed. 1918.)&lt;/small&gt;]][[Image:graysbronchi.gif|thumb|right|350px|In this image, lung tissue has been dissected away to reveal the bronchioles.&lt;small&gt; (Source: ''Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body'', 20th ed. 1918.)&lt;/small&gt;]]

==Oxygenation of the blood==

The two main functions of the lungs are to oxygenate the blood and to remove '''waste carbon dioxide'''.

The blood is oxygenated in the '''alveoli'''.  The alveoli are thin walled and surrounded by capillaries. The blood enters the capillary network around the alveoli from the '''pulmonary artery''' and leaves the capillary network via the '''pulmonary''' vein.

[[Image:gcsebiolalveol2.gif|thumb|left|Highly schematic diagram of the alveoli with both cross-section and external view|400px]]

[[Image:gcsebiolalveol1.gif|right|300px|thumb|right|More anatomical diagram; r. b respiratory bronchiole; al. d alveolar duct; at atria; a. s alveolar sac; 'a' alveolus or air cell; p. a.: pulmonary artery: p. v pulmonary vein; l lymphatic; l. n lymph node. '''Gray's Anatomy''', 1918]]

{{clr}}

Oxygen diffuses into the blood through the alveolar and capillary walls and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood. The alveoli have a surface area of about 70 square metres to make this gas exchange as fast as possible. 

Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and can easily and reversibly form compounds such as carbonic acid and bicarbonates. 

Oxygen does not dissolve much in water, to overcome this problem the oxygen in the blood is stored in '''red blood cells'''. These contain '''haemoglobin''' which can combine with oxygen to form '''oxyhaemoglobin'''. The red blood cells contain the oxygen in the blood. The blood transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

Oxy-haemoglobin is bright red and haemoglobin is dark red, this is why veins look dark and why all the diagrams show veins in blue and arteries in red.  The exception is the pulmonary artery which carries dark red, de-oxygenated blood to the lungs and the pulmonary vein which carries bright red oxygenated blood away from the lungs.

The composition of '''exhaled''' air (air that is breathed out) is very different from the composition of '''inhaled''' air (air that is breathed in). Inhaled air has the same composition as normal air, it contains:

* 78% nitrogen
* '''21% oxygen'''
* 1% inert gas such as argon
* '''0.04% carbon dioxide'''
* little water vapour

Exhaled air contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide, it is also saturated with water vapour. Exhaled air contains:

* 78% nitrogen
* '''17% oxygen'''
* 1% inert gas such as argon
* '''4% carbon dioxide'''
* '''saturated with water vapour'''

The difference between the amount of oxygen in inhaled and exhaled air is equal to the difference in the amount of carbon dioxide in exhaled and inhaled air.

The special adaptions of the alveoli for gas exchange are:

* Thin walls
* Huge surface area
* Covered in capillaries to provide blood
* A wet lining to dissolve gases

==Respiration==

===Aerobic respiration===

'''Respiration''' is the process in which the chemical bonds of energy-rich molecules such as glucose are converted into energy usable for life processes. '''Aerobic respiration''' uses oxygen to oxidise glucose and produce energy. The equation for the oxidation of glucose is:

:::C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 6CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Energy released

:::Glucose + Oxygen -&gt; Carbon dioxide + water + Energy released

In a fire there is a massive uncontrolled release of energy as light and heat. Respiration is a similar process but it occurs in gradual steps.

Most animals and plants use aerobic respiration as a primary source of energy.

glucose + oxygen -&gt; carbon dioxide + water + energy

===Mitochondria===
Mitochondria are cell organelles which float around in the cytoplasm and are found in both plant and animal cells. In cells, aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Here, the energy is made in the form of a compound called ATP. However, some of the energy made is lost as heat energy. The ATP drives chemical reactions and is used by the cells as a source of energy to do this.

===Anaerobic respiration===

When a person is doing very heavy exercise and the blood cannot supply enough oxygen another sort of respiration occurs. This converts glucose into energy without the need for oxygen and is known as '''anaerobic respiration'''.  The reaction is:

:::Glucose &amp;rarr; Energy released + lactic acid

Anaerobic respiration releases less energy than aerobic respiration. Unfortunately the insufficient blood supply that leads to anaerobic respiration also means that the lactic acid builds up in the muscles. High lactic acid concentrations are painful and felt as '''cramp'''. When exercise stops, the blood supply is able to provide enough oxygen to convert the lactic acid to carbon dioxide and water but this takes time and the muscle pain may continue after exercise until the lactic acid has been converted.  

The amount of Oxygen required to oxidize lactic acid that accumulates on muscles due to an aerobic respiration is known as the '''oxygen debt'''.  Carbon dioxide and lactic acid both cause increases in breathing rate and heart rate to allow the body to repay the oxygen debt. The oxygen debt is the reason why we continue to be out of breath even after exercise.  If athletes are very fit their circulation can provide extra oxygen more rapidly and their '''recovery time''', the time required to restore normal breathing and pulse, will be shorter than in people who are not fit.

===Yeasts and anaerobic respiration===

The direct conversion of glucose to energy without the use of oxygen occurs in many yeasts and fungi.  The ethanol that is used in alcoholic drinks is a result of anaerobic respiration in yeast, the reaction is:

:::Glucose &amp;rarr; Energy released + ethanol + carbon dioxide

Brewers use various types of brewers yeast to produce alcohol. In fizzy alcoholic drinks such as champagne the bottles are tightly stoppered to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Atoms=
An '''atom''' (Greek language|Greek ''&amp;#940;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;'' from ''&amp;#940;'': ''non'' and ''&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;'': ''divisible'') is a submicroscopic structure found in all ordinary matter.  It is the smallest unit of an chemical element to retain all the chemical properties of that element.  The word ''atom'' originally meant a smallest possible particle of matter. They thought that you couldn't divide the atom any further. Later, the objects that had been called atoms were found to be further divisible into smaller subatomic particles, but the word atom nonetheless continues to refer to them. 

Most atoms are composed of three types of massive subatomic particles which govern their external properties:
* electrons, which have a negative electric charge and are the least massive of the three;
* protons, which have a positive electric charge and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and
* neutrons, which have no electric charge and are about 1838 times more massive than electrons.

Together, protons and neutrons form the atomic nucleus of an atom, which is surrounded by the electrons.  

Atoms can differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but can differ in the number of neutrons, in which case they are called isotopes of that element. Atoms are electrostatically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus are less tightly bound to the atom and are relatively easily transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either given away or taken electrons from another atom are called ions. Particles in the nucleus also sometimes escape atoms, in a process known as radioactive decay.

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry, and are conserved in chemical reactions.
Atoms are able to chemically bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds.  Molecules are made up of multiple atoms; for example, a molecule of water is a combination of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.

=== Exothermic reactions ===

[[image:Ac_com.png|thumb|right|A sketch of a typical exothermic reaction]]

According to energy balance criteria, that is, chemical reaction equilibria criteria, any closed system will tend to minimize its free energy. Without any outside influence, any reaction mixture, too, will try to do the same. For many cases, an analysis of the enthalpy of the system will give a decent account of the energetics of the reaction mixture. 
The enthalpy of a reaction is calculated using standard reaction enthalpy|reaction enthalpies and the Hess' law of constant heat summation. Many of these enthalpies may be found in beginners' books on thermodynamics.
For example, consider the combustion of Organic Chemistry/Alkanes and cycloalkanes/Alkanes/Methane|methane in oxygen: 

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

By calculating the amounts of energy required to break all the bonds on the left (&quot;before&quot;) and right (&quot;after&quot;) sides of the equation using collected data, it is possible to calculate the energy difference between the reactants and the products. This is referred to as &amp;Delta;''H'', where &amp;Delta; (Delta) means difference, and ''H'' stands for enthalpy, a measure of energy which is equal to the heat transferred at constant pressure. &amp;Delta;''H'' is usually given in units of Joule|kilojoules (kJ) or in Calorie|kilocalories (kcal). 

If &amp;Delta;''H'' is negative for the reaction, then energy has been released often in the form of heat. This type of reaction is referred to as an exothermic reaction (literally, outside heat, or throwing off heat). An exothermic reaction is more favourable and thus more likely to occur. An example reaction is combustion, known from everyday experience, since burning gas in air produces heat.

=== Endothermic reactions ===
w:Image:Endothermic.png|400px|thumb|right|A sketch of an endothermic reaction

A reaction may have a positive &amp;Delta;''H''. If a reaction has a positive &amp;Delta;''H'', it consumes energy as the reaction moves towards completion. This type of reaction is called an endothermic reaction (literally, inside heat, or absorbing heat).

The above rule, &quot;Exothermic reactions are favourable&quot;, is usually true. However, there may be situations where exothermic reactions may not be favourable. This happens when the stability obtained due to loss of enthalpy is off set by a corresponding decrease in entropy (a measure of disorder). 
The exact rule is that a reaction is favourable when the Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Gibbs free energy|Gibbs free energy of that reaction is negative where &amp;Delta;''G'' = &amp;Delta;''H'' &amp;minus; ''T''&amp;Delta;''S''; &amp;Delta;''G'' being the change in Gibbs free energy, &amp;Delta;''H'' being the change in enthalpy, and &amp;Delta;''S'' is the change in entropy

A reaction is called spontaneous process|spontaneous if its thermodynamically favoured, by that meaning that it causes a net increase on entropy. Spontaneous reactions (in opposition to non-spontaneous reactions) do not need external perturbations (such as energy supplement) to happen. In a system at chemical equilibrium, it is expected to have larger concentrations of the substances formed by the spontaneous direction of the process. 

Thus, in a global isolated system (which it strictly isn't, see entropy), spontaneous reactions may be understood to occur without Intelligence_%28trait%29|human interference. Most spontaneous reactions in this system are exothermic (such as rusting) or metamorphosis, thus increasing the global entropy, though photosynthesis is an important exception (in a global system).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The object of the Sentence Completion section of the SAT is for the test-taker to complete the given sentence using context clues.

A sentence completion question may have one or more blanks, and five answers to choose from. For example:

#

Scotland is a nation in the north of the Island of Great Britain; it has a(n) _________ economy that distinguishes it from the rest of the United Kingdom.

* A. dignified
* B. self-sufficient
* C. fancy
* D. unique
* E. complex

We can use context to help us select the correct answer.  The blank is clearly describing Scotland's economy.  From the rest of the sentence, we can determine that we know two things about Scotland - it's in the north of Great Britain and its economy distinguishes it somehow.  So, the blank must relate to one of those things.  The geographic location of Scotland is probably irrelevant when describing its economy, so the blank must mean something relating to 'distinguishing'.

While distinguished can sometimes relate to being (A) dignified, that is not how the word is being used in this context, and while (B), (C), and (E) may be true, only (D) unique means the same thing as being distinguished, i.e. standing out.

Therefore, the answer is '''D. unique'''.

== What country did they live in? ==
Dravidian refers to the speakers of the Dravidian languages in South Asia. There are around 220 million native speakers of Dravidian languages. Dravidian-speaking people are mostly found in southern India and Sri Lanka, with smaller groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Although in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, nothing definite is known about the ancient domain of the Dravidian parent speech. It is, however, a well-established and well-supported hypothesis that Dravidian speakers must have been widespread throughout India, including the northwest region.[6] Origins of Dravidian people are informed by various theories proposed by linguists, anthropologists, geneticist and historians. 

Some linguists hypothesized that Dravidian-speaking people were spread throughout the Indian subcontinent before a series of Indo-Aryan migrations. In this view, the early Indus Valley civilisation (Harappa and Mohenjo Daro) is often identified as having been Dravidian.[7] Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers such as Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola as being strong evidence for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Dravidian architecture was an architectural idiom that emerged in the Southern part of the Indian subcontinent or South India. It consists primarily of temples with pyramid shaped towers and are constructed of sandstone, soapstone or granite. Mentioned as one of three styles of temple building in the ancient book Vastu shastra, the majority of the existing structures are located in the Southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, and Andhra pradesh.

== What did they eat? ==
Rice is the staple diet, with fish being an integral component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut is an important ingredient in Kerala and costal part of Karnataka of South India, whereas the cuisine in Andhra Pradesh is characterized by the delicious pickles, spicy aromatic curries and the generous use of chili powder. Dosa, Idli, Uttapam etc. are popular throughout the region. Coastal areas like the state of Kerala and the city of Mangalore are known for their seafood. South Indian coffee is generally quite robust, and coffee is a preferred drink throughout the Malabar region.Tamil Nadu is well known for its idli,dosai,pongal,sambhar,vadai which is the common breakfast in Tamil families.

== What did they wear? ==
Traditionally, Dravidian men do not cover their upper body. Sometimes, in a formal situation, a piece of cloth may cover the upper body. Certain temples in South India, even today ban men from wearing upper-body garments when inside the temple. The lungi or mundu or panchey are worn by men. The lungi is draped over clockwise or counterclockwise and is tied at the back or fixed just along the waist line.

Women traditionally wear the sari while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either a white dhoti or a colourful lungi with typical batik patterns. The sari, being an unstitched drape, enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the navel of the Supreme Being is considered as the source of life and creativity.[1][2][3][5] Hence by tradition, the stomach and the navel is to be left unconcealed, though the philosophy behind the costume has largely been forgotten.
Traditionally, South Indian men do not cover their upper body. Sometimes, in a formal situation, a piece of cloth may cover the upper body. Certain temples in South India even ban men from wearing upper-body garments when inside the temple.

== What did they look like? ==
The Elamo-Dravidians are said to be Neolithic settlers from modern-day south western Iran. They are assumed to be darker skinned Caucasian people with slender body and built and copper skin tone. They are usually lumped with the Mediterranean race. They must have taken the route from the erstwhile Elam region via Balochistan to the Indus region around 8000 to 7000 B.C., where they are often credited to have built the famed Harappan civilization. They eventually mixed with the local Austro-Asiatic peoples, who were of Proto-Australoid and Paleo-Mongoloid stock. The admixture was liberal, steady and stabilised. As a result, most modern day Dravidians have clear and dominant Australoid features.

== What did their writing look like? ==
The best-known Dravidian languages are Tamil (தமிழ்), Telugu (తెలుగు), Malayalam (മലയാളം), and Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ). 
There are three subgroups within the Dravidian language family: North Dravidian, Central Dravidian, and South Dravidian, matching for the most part the corresponding regions in the Indian subcontinent.

Dravidian languages are spoken by more than 200 million people. They appear to be unrelated to languages of other known families like Indo-European.

Dravidian grammatical impact on the structure and syntax of Indo-Aryan languages is considered far greater than the Indo-Aryan grammatical impact on Dravidian. Some linguists explain this anomaly by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan and New Indo-Aryan were built on a Dravidian substratum.[24] There are also hundreds of Dravidian loanwords in Indo-Aryan languages, and vice versa.

== What did they believe? ==


== What is their history? ==
South India remains is in the Mesolithic until 2500 BCE. Microlith production is attested for the period 6000 to 3000 BCE. The Neolithic period lasts from 2500 BCE to 1000 BCE, followed by the Iron Age, characterized by megalithic burials.[1] Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Thirunelveli district and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture.[2] The Krishna Tungabhadra Valley[3] is also a place for Megalithic culture in South India.

The earliest Iron Age sites in South India are Hallur, Karnataka and Adichanallur, Tamil Nadu[4] at around 1000 BC.
Early epigraphic evidence begins to appear from about the 5th century BCE, in the form of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions, reflecting the southward spread of Buddhism.

Evidence in the forms of documents and inscriptions do not appear often in the history of ancient South India. Although there are signs that the history dates back to several centuries BCE, we only have any authentic archeological evidence from the early centuries of the common era.

During the reign of Ashoka (304–232 BCE) the three Tamil dynasties of Chola, Chera and Pandya were running in the south, probably with late megalithic phase material culture. These areas (known as Tamilakam- &quot;Land of Tamils&quot;), while not part of Ashoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the Maurya Empire.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==


== What is left of them today? ==

Dravidians have contributed in various fields of science, medicine and arts. Even today many scientific intelectuals from India trace thier roots to ancient dravidians. 

This civilization gave the world the language with letters known as Tamil. Tamil is one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world. 2,200-year-old Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found on Samanamalai It has been described as &quot;the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past.&quot;

Kalaripayattu is an Indian martial art which originated in the west coast of the then Tamilakam, during the early 13th Century AD. It is considered to be one of the oldest fighting system in existence. 

It is now practiced in Kerala, in contiguous parts of Tamil Nadu and among the Malayali community of Malaysia. It was originally practiced in northern and central parts of Kerala and the Tulunadu region of Karnataka.

It is claimed that learned warriors can disable or kill their opponents by merely touching the correct marmam (vital point). This is taught only to the most promising and level-headed persons, to discourage misuse of the technique. Marmashastram stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (marmachikitsa). This system of marma treatment comes under siddha vaidhyam, attributed to the sage Agastya and his disciples.

He Vaasudeva, aap ki kripa se mein aap ki bhakti karun he iishwar.

Maine, he prabhu, pichle kuch dino mein thoda araam kiya beech beech mein.

Aap hi wo Bhrahma hain, jo in pavitra shabdon mein sthita hain.

Aap hi, he Naresh, humare swami, aur is sansaar mein ur bhi jo exist karta 
hai, uske maaliki hain.

Aap hi he bhagwan, har prani ke sarvottam laksha hain.

Aap hi he prabhu, wo mangalmay vichar hin jo aap ke liye yan aap ke bare

Is sansar mein aisa koi jeeva nahin, jo aap ko na yaad kar raha ho.

Is dukh ke mahasagar mein phas kar, kaun bhala aap ko yaad nahin kare ga.

Is dukh ke maha sagar mein sukh bhi milein to we bhi dukh ki kami ke karan 
hi sukh lag rahe hote hein.

Hey Bhagwan, vaastav mein to aap ko yaad karna hi sukh hai. Aur kuch Sukh 
nahin kaha ja sakta.

Isliye, aap ko yaad karna hi sukh hai. Aur He Bhagwan, wo sukh, jo aap ko 
yaad karne se milta hai, bhi aap hi hain.

He Parmeshwar, he Maheshwar, aap ko pranam hai. Aap ko sada pranam hai, he 
Hari.

Humari raksha karein he prabhu. Humari raksha karein.

Is dukh ke maha sagar se humari raksha karein.

=== Vandana ===

He Bhagwan, manushya ki buddhi din par din kamjor hoti ja rahi hai.

Aap ko pranam hai he Hari. Meri raksha kariye he naath.

Mein nahin jaanta ki jeewaan mein kya hone wala hai. Mein nahin janta ki 
mujh se sahi karma ho payengein yan nahin.

Lekin he prabhu, aap ki kripa se, mein jeewan ke har pal aap ki bhakti 
karta rahun.

He Bhagwan, mein jab jeewan mein peeche dekhta hoon, to mujhe dikhta hai 
ki aapne bar bar mujhe pyar diya hai.

Aap hi, he Prabhu, most directly hum sab ke pitah hain.

Aap hi ne, he Iishwar, hume janam diya hai. Aap hi ne hume pala posa hai.

Aap hi ne humari raksha ki hai, hum jaante bhi nahin kitni baar.

Aap hi sab kuch hain, he Iishwar.

Aadmi, jo dikh raha hai, use dekh kar chinta karne lagta hai.

Lekin, he Bhagwan, jo is sansaar mein satya hai, wo to aap hi Hain.

Aap hi to is Sansaar mein har jagah hain.

Aap hi to sab ke mano mein baithe hain.

Aap hi to sab kuch chalaye huye hain.

Aap ki agya ke bina to kch ho hi nahin sakta.

Isliye, he Iishwar, hmara chinta karna moorakhta hai.

Manushya ko to chahiye ki har samay aap ki hi bhakti karta rahe.

Har samay, aap hi ke bare mein soche. Aap hi ko pranam kare.

Aap hi ka gun-gaan kare main mein. Aap hi ko nihare.

Aap hi ko yaad kare. Aap hi ko dekhe.

Aap hi ki sharan le.

He Bhagwan, aap ki kripa se mein ye sab karma karun.

Aap hi meri raksha karein, he naath.

He Bhagwan, manushya ko din mein 2-4 baar nahin, 2-4 lakh bar aap ko yaad 
karna chahiye.

Sansa lena itna jaroori nahin jitna aap ko yaad karna hai.

He Bhagwan, is ghor kalyuga mein, jo ki aap hi ka roop hai, manushya ka 
dimag pagal ho raha hai.

Is ghar kalyuga mein, dimag vichlit ho raha hai.

He Vaasudeva, aap to sab jagah hain. Mere man mein bhi.

Aap ko he Naath, mein punah punah yaad karun.

Aap ko he Naath, mein punah punah chintan kar, pranam karun, aap ki sharan 
loon, aap ki puja karun, aap ko hi niharun, he Bhagwan.

He Vaasudeva, aap ko pranam hai.

He Bhagwan, aap hi ko yaad karna sukh kaha jata hai, aur aap hi ko bhool 
jana dukh hai.

Wo, dukhmayi pal, jab admi aap ko bhool jaye, he Bhagwan, aisa bhayanak 
pal kisi par na aye.

Aise pal mein, na to aadmi ji sakta hai, aur na hi marte bhi banta hai.

Aise pal mein jeewan to mrityu se bhi bura hai. Aur aise pal mein mrityu 
hone se bura kya hoga.

He Vaasudev, dhanya the wo log, jinhon ne, aap ko har pal yaad kiya. Aap 
ki nirantar, ananya bhakti ki.

Dhanya hain wo log, jo aap hi mein base hain he Prabhu.

Mein aap ki sharan leta hoon Naath. Raksha Karein.

Nath.

samay bitaya hua to atyanta dukh hi hai.

Aap ki bhakti na karte hue jo samay bita hai, wo mrityu se bhi dukhdayi 
hai. Aisa dukh kisi ko na mile.

Aur He Bhagwan, aap ko yaad karte jo samay beetta hai, wo sacha sukh hi

svaroop, anmol, atyant karuna ke maha sagar hain.

Mujh jaise papiyon ko, jinka man bar bar bhatakta hai, bhi aap ki 
boundless pyar bhari kripa ke karan aap ko yaad karne ka mauka mil jaata

== 1. Prepare soil, fertilize, and plant a vegetable plot of not less than 100 square feet (30.5 square meters). Grow at least six different vegetables, three from seeds and three from seedlings, through harvesting.==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|First, you should note that there is an error in the metric conversion in this requirement.  Although 100 ''linear'' feet equals 30.5 ''linear'' meters, 100 ''square'' feet does '''not''' equal 30.5 ''square'' meters.  Consider a 10-foot by 10-foot plot of ground.  Ten times ten is 100, and thus our plot of ground is 100 square feet.  The same plot of ground would be about 3.05 meters by 3.05 meters (because 10 feet is about 3.05 meters).  To get the number of square meters, we multiply 3.05 by 3.05, which is about 9.3 square meters.
|Prepare soil, fertilize, and plant a vegetable plot of not less than 100 square feet (9.3 square meters). Grow at least six different vegetables, three from seeds and three from seedlings, through harvesting.
}}

===Preparing the soil===
The first step in soil preparation is to select a suitable site for the garden.  It should be clear of trees and relatively level, and it should receive full sunlight.  The soil should be at least {{units|30 cm|1 foot}} deep.

Once the site is selected, it needs to be plowed and tilled.  Plowing can be done with a plow for large (and medium-sized) plots, or with a spade for very small plots (this is ''heavy'' labor though).  Plowing loosens the soil so that the plants will have easy access to the soil to a depth of {{units|30 cm|1 foot}}.  Tilling can be accomplished with a disc for large plots or with a garden tiller for smaller plots.  The purpose of tilling is to break the soil into a fine aggregate.  The ideal time to till is when a dirt clod can be picked up and easily crumbled in the hand - it should not be done immediately following a rain.

===Fertilizing===
It's generally a good idea to test the soil before fertilizing it so that you know what type of fertilizer to apply.  Soil testing kits are available in garden centers.  Once you have tested the soil and have selected an appropriate fertilizer, it can be spread over the garden with a broadcast seeder.  You can do this before tilling or after.

===Planting===
Planting includes plant selection and placement.  In general, taller plants should be planted on the side of the garden furthest from the Earth's equator. (In the Northern Hemisphere plant them on the north side.   In the Southern Hemisphere plant them on the south side.) This is so they do not shade the smaller plants.  Seed packets will contain data on them telling you how deep, how far apart from one another, and when to plant them in your geographic area.  Seedlings can be bought from a nursery or grown from seeds indoors before the outdoor growing season begins.  

For planted seeds, start by making a furrow with a hoe.  The depth of the furrow should equal the desired depth of the seed.  Then walk along and drop seeds in the furrow, burying them as you go.  Be sure to space them as per the instructions on the seed packet.  Do not pack the soil tightly over the furrow as you bury the seeds.  A common practice is to place the seeds in the furrows in pairs so that if one does not come up, there's a chance the other will.  If both come up, one of them ''must'' be thinned, even if they both look healthy.  

For seedlings, dig a small hole for each plant so that you can bury it to the soil line.  Do not remove the seedling from the container until you are ready to plug it into the hole, and avoid exposing the roots to direct sunlight.  Lightly pack soil around the plant.

Once the seeds and seedling have been planted, water the garden generously.  After that, you will need to make sure the garden is watered deeply and on an ''irregular'' basis.  If you over-water the garden, the roots will stay near the surface where they will be susceptible to disease, and where they will do a poor job of anchoring the plant should a stiff wind arise.  Watering deeply and irregularly will cause the plants send the roots deeply into the ground in search of water and other nutrients.  This will also protect them from disease and strengthen the plant against the wind.

==2. List ways to control insects and/or disease in your garden. Know when and how to apply insecticides and fungicides.==
=== Pest control===
When chemical pesticides were first introduced, they were used to the exclusion of all other types of pest control.  This had the unfortunate effect of poisoning the environment.  In the 1970's this situation was recognized, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques were introduced.  Pesticides are still used, but they are a last resort.

When most people think of pests, they think of insects.  In vegetable cultivation, this term should be expanded to include weeds, microorganisms, and mites.  Pest control depends on the early and correct identification of the pest.  The grower can use cultural mechanical, biological, or chemical controls to reduce the effect of pests.  These methods all rely on constant vigilance by the grower.

'''Cultural Controls''' include the selection of disease and pest-resistant cultivars.  Crop rotation  is another important cultural control, as certain pests feed exclusively on one type of plant.  Eliminating the plant from the environment for a year or two will disrupt that cycle. Another important control mechanism is to mulch, water, prune, and fertilize the plants correctly.  A healthy plant is better able to defend itself from pests.

'''Mechanical Controls''' include covering the plants with netting or setting traps for expected (or observed) pests.  Pests can also be removed with vacuums or by hand.  Hoeing and cultivating around the plants will help control weeds.  It is also important to remove infected plants from the crop as soon as possible so that the disease does not spread.  

Many insects prefer to feed on the underside of leaves where they will be more difficult for a predator to find.  These pests can be discouraged by laying aluminum foil on the ground, shiny-side-up to reflect additional sunlight to the underside of the leaves.  This confuses the insects and encourages them to feed elsewhere.

'''Biological Controls''' include the introduction of natural predators.  For instance, ladybug beetles feast on aphids, and poultry feed on a number of insect pests.  Be careful when introducing predators though, that you do not introduce a non-native species which has no natural enemies of its own.  This can - and has caused its own form of environmental damage.  You can also use commercially available pheromones to disrupt the mating cycle of many insects.

'''Chemical Controls''' can be used when all else fails.  Selection of a pesticide and a fungicide will depend on the particular pest being combated (which his why proper identification is so important).  Sprays are generally more effective than dusts, as nearly all pesticides rely on contact with the pest for their effectiveness.  Read the instructions on the chemical containers carefully before using, especially noting whether the chemical is safe to use on food plants.  Many times a pesticide will warn against its use for a period of time before harvesting.

==3. What is mulch? How and why is it used in the garden?==
Mulch is decomposed plant materials that are used as a planting bed, source of nutrients, and protective top layer that can maintain soil moisture levels and keep heat in.

==4. What is hardiness? Which vegetables are considered hardy in your area?==
Hardiness determines the extent to which a plant or tree can tolerate cold or heat. Normally this is measured in cold such as &quot;plant hardiness to 27 degrees.&quot; This means that below 27 degrees the plant will begin to be effected by the cold, starting with freezing of leaves and or fruit.

In North America hardiness is classed by ''hardiness zone'' (see below).  Seed packets usually have a color-coded map on the back showing these zones - and accordingly, an indication of when the seeds should be planted.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==5. Do one of the following:==
=== a. Test germination for 100 of the same kind of seeds.===
Testing germination can be accomplished with a ''rag-doll test''.  Note that this is also a requirement for the [[../../Nature/Seeds - Advanced|Seeds - Advanced]] honor.

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Germination testing}}

=== b. Make and use a hotbed or cold frame.===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Hotbed cold frame}}

=== c. Prepare any three varieties of vegetables for market.===
When preparing vegetables for market, consider the following attributes:
;Ripeness: Choose vegetables that are at their optimum ripeness.
;Color: Bright colors are more attractive to buyers than dull colors.
;Size: Consumers do not like vegetables that are too small or too large.  
;Shape: Look for vegetables that have a &quot;regular&quot; shape.
;Injury: Choose vegetables that are free from injury.
;Cleanliness: Wash and trim them before taking them to market.

=== d. Make and use a storage bin or pit for your vegetables.===
A vegetable storage bin is a small cabinet with compartments for vegetables.  They are often equipped with a wire mesh door to allow air to circulate.  Some use solid doors to keep the inside of the bin dark (potatoes will sprout if exposed to light).  Some have dark compartments as well as airy compartments to support different types of vegetables.
You can find free plans for a combination bin online at http://www.woodworkersworkshop.com/cached_files/27838_files/

Usage Notes:
#The basic words for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; are はい ''hai'' and いいえ ''iie''. However, as you see above, there are many variants, as well as other common responses to yes/no questions.
#'''Comparing はい ''hai'', ええ ''ee'', and うん ''un'''''
#*はい ''hai'' is a polite way of saying &quot;yes&quot; and can be used in almost any situation.
#*ええ ''ee'' is a more colloquial but still polite way of saying &quot;yes&quot; and also carries a somewhat feminine connotation.
#*うん ''un'' is a colloquial way of saying &quot;yes&quot; and is closer to the English word &quot;yeah&quot;.
#'''Comparing いいえ ''iie'', いえ ''ie'', いや ''iya'', and ううん ''uun'''''
#*いいえ ''iie'' is a polite way of saying &quot;no&quot; and can be used whenever a clear-cut &quot;no&quot; is needed.
#*いえ ''ie'' is a shortened version of the above.
#*いや ''iya'' is a less polite synonym and also caries a masculine connotation.
#*ううん ''uun'' is colloquial and connotes a bit of surprise. It could be translated as &quot;oh, no&quot; or &quot;certainly not&quot;.

=== Grammar ===
As a statement, そう ''sou'' can be used by itself as an interjection or as a na-adjective followed by です ''desu'' or だ ''da''. As a question, そう ''sou'' can be used by itself with a rising tone, or followed by か ''ka'' or ですか ''desu ka''. It means &quot;that is right,&quot; or &quot;that is so,&quot; and is used as an affirmative answer to a question.

#'''Interjection examples'''
#*{{furi|学生|がくせい}}ですか。 ''Gakusei desu ka?''
#*そうです。 ''Sou desu.''

#*そう？ ''Sou?''
#*'''Translation'''
#*This is simple homework.
#*Is it?
#'''Na-adjective examples'''
#*{{furi|弁護士|べんごし}}さんですか。''Bengoshi-san desu ka?''
#* そうです。''Sou desu.''

== Discuss ==
==Culture==
In Japanese, はい ''hai'' is similar to the English word &quot;yes&quot;, while いいえ ''iie'' is similar to &quot;no&quot;. The use of the Japanese terms, however, does not correspond exactly to that of the English words. More precisely, はい ''hai'' in Japanese means, &quot;I agree with you&quot;, or, &quot;It is correct.&quot; Thus, English speakers may struggle with the proper Japanese answer to negative questions (e.g. ''Don't you ...?'' or ''..., don't you?''). Specifically, はい ''hai'' answers a negative question in the sense that corresponds to the English &quot;No&quot;. Likewise, いいえ ''iie'' answers a negative question in the sense that corresponds to the English &quot;Yes&quot;.

==1. Have the Nutrition Honor.==
{{ay prerequisite|Household Arts|Nutrition}}

==2. Keep a record of what and how much food you eat for two weeks. Compare your diet to that of the food pyramid.==

If you have access to the Internet, you can visit the USDA's [http://mypyramidtracker.gov MyPyramidTracker.gov] web site, the official home of the Food Pyramid.  Once you register, you can enter all the foods you eat in a day, and it will analyze your nutrient intake (among other things) based on this information.  MyPyramidTracker can retain the information you enter for up to a year, so tracking it for two weeks will be easy.

If your Pathfinders do not have access to the Internet, have them record their diets on paper.  You can then use the website to extract the necessary data by entering each food individually, or you can find a cookbook that has nutrient values of various foods in an appendix.  Another option would be to meet in a place that has public Internet access, such as a library or Internet cafe.  Then your Pathfinders can enter the data they have collected for a week and analyze it there.

The values in the table below are for children who are physically active for 60 minutes or more per day.  Use the USDA website for adults and less active children.

==3. What is digestion? What is another name for the human digestive system?==
Digestion is the conversion of food into substances that can be absorbed by the body.  Another name for the human digestive system is the ''gastrointestinal tract,'' or just the ''GI tract'' for short.

==4. Where does saliva come from? What are the three functions of saliva?==
Saliva, often informally known as spit, is the moist, clear, and usually somewhat frothy substance produced in the mouth.  Saliva is produced in and secreted from the salivary glands.
 
# Saliva moistens food so it can be swallowed easily. 
# Saliva contains an enzyme that breaks some starches down into maltose and dextrin.
# Saliva protects teeth from decay by plaque.  Saliva is used to neutralize acids made from sugars in the mouth, therefore helping to prevent demineralization. Remineralization is when saliva helps repair the damaged crystals of the tooth enamel.

==5. Be able to identify the following parts of the tooth.  What role do the teeth play in digestion?==

[[image:ToothSection.jpg|thumb|300px|right|float|Parts of the Tooth]]

The primary function of teeth is to tear and chew food, reducing it into smaller pieces.  This is the first step in the digestive process.

=== Enamel===
Enamel is the outside covering of the exposed portion of a tooth.  It is the hardest substance that is part of the human body.

=== Dentin===
Dentin (also called ''Dentine'') is the substance between the enamel (substance in the crown) or cementum (substance in the root) of a tooth and the pulp chamber.

=== Pulp===
The dental pulp is the part in the center of a tooth made up of living soft tissue.

=== Gum===
The gums consist of the tissue surrounding the roots of the teeth and covering the jawbone. 

=== Cementum===
Cementum is a specialized bony substance covering the root of a tooth.

=== Periodontal membrane===
The periodontal membrane is the tissue between the tooth and the tooth socket.  It holds the tooth in place.

==6. Be able to label a diagram or model of all the organs that help with digestion, starting from where the food goes into the mouth to where it is expelled from the anus.==

[[Image:Uppergi.gif|frame|The Digestive System]]

Food enters the body through the '''mouth''' where it is manipulated by the '''tongue''' and chewed with the '''teeth'''.  '''Salivary glands''' secrete saliva which is used to soften and lubricate the food.  The tongue then pushes the food down the '''esophagus''' and it enters the stomach.  The main job of the '''stomach''' is to break down large fat molecules into smaller ones, so that they can be absorbed into the intestines more easily.  Food remains in the stomach for a few hours before it is passed into the upper part of the small initestine - the '''duodenum'''.  The '''small intestine''' is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed.  There are microscopic finger-like projections called '''villi''' covering the small intestinal walls which increase surface area for absorption.  

The '''large intestine''' comes after the small intestine in the digestive tract. It is mainly responsible for storing waste, reclaiming water, maintaining the water balance, and absorbing some vitamins, such as vitamin K.

By the time the chyme has reached this tube, almost all nutrients and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. The '''rectum''' comes after the large intestine and acts as a temporary storage facility for feces.  Feces are expelled from the body through the '''anus''' during the act of defecation, which is the primary function of the anus.

'''Related Organs'''

The '''liver''' secretes bile into the small intestine, employing the '''gallbladder''' as a reservoir. The '''pancreas''' secretes a fluid containing several enzymes into the small intestine. Both these secretory organs aid in digestion.

==7. Know the difference between food bolus and chyme.==
'''Bolus''' is any fairly large quantity of matter, usually food, making its way through the digestive tract. 

'''Chyme''' is the liquid substance found in the stomach before entering the duodenum. It is made of partially digested food, water, hydrochloric acid, and various digestive enzymes.

==8. Where does bile come from? Where is it stored? What does it do in the duodenum?==
Bile (or gall) is a bitter, greenish-yellow fluid secreted by the liver. It is stored in the gallbladder between meals and upon eating is discharged into the duodenum where it aids the process of digestion.

==9. What are villi? What makes them absorb the nutrients so quickly? At what point are all the nutrients removed from the food/chyme? Compare the amount of water absorbed by plain paper compared to a similar sized paper towel using an 1/8 cup (17.2 ml) of water.==

Villi are tiny, finger-like structures that protrude from the wall of the intestine. In all humans, the villi increase intestinal absorptive surface area 9000-fold, providing exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients. This increases the surface area of the intestine to an area about the same size as a tennis court. There are also enzymes on the surface of the villi for digestion. 

Plain paper is smooth, but a paper towel is bumpy.  The bumps in the paper towel are similar to the villi, as they increase the surface area of the paper towel, and thus increase its absorption capacity.  You should see most of the water run off the surface of the plain paper, while most of it is absorbed by the paper towel.

==10. What happens if too much water is present in the large intestine? What happens if not enough water is present?==
Too much water in the colon results in diarrhea.  This occurs when insufficient fluid is absorbed by the colon. As part of the digestion process, or due to fluid intake, food is mixed with large amounts of water. Thus, digested food is essentially liquid prior to reaching the colon. The colon absorbs water, leaving the remaining material as a semisolid stool. If the colon is damaged or inflamed, however, absorption is inhibited, and watery stools result.

Too little water in the large intestine results in constipation.  Constipation or Irregularity, is a condition of the digestive system where a person experiences hard feces that are difficult to eliminate; it may be extremely painful.

==11. How does fiber in your diet aid in digestion? How long should food remain in the digestive tract? What happens if food stays in the digestive system too long?==
Increased fiber consumption appears to lower the risk of developing type II diabetes and heart disease. It may also help prevent high cholesterol and help fight obesity. High-fiber foods help move waste through the digestive tract faster and easier, so possibly harmful substances do not have as much contact with the gastrointestinal tract and reduce straining.

Food stays in the stomach between 30 minutes and two hours.  It takes another two to six hours for it to pass through the small intestine, and between six and 72 hours in the large intestine.

Since the large intestine absorbs water from the food, any food that stays there for too long has too much water removed from it resulting in constipation.  

But that is not the worst of it.  Without proper digestion, food stays in the stomach for prolonged periods, ''fermenting'' and producing increasing amounts of gas and building up ''toxins''.

If some type of antacid is taken at this point, the stomach contents will become alkaline, which will then cause this undigested food to drop into the small intestine where it continues to ferment and produce even more gas.

At this stage, nothing has happened to improve digestion because the antacid has now effectively been made worse by halting any further digestion and merely relocating the symptom by exchanging stomach gas for intestinal gas.

If the emptying time of the stomach is delayed for too long, bile is regurgitated backward into the stomach. Bile is caustic and very irritating to the stomach lining.

So in short, what happens if food stays in the digestive system too long is: #1 Toxicity. Extras: fermentation, constipation, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), and heartburn.

==12. Demonstrate the digestion of starch into simple sugar using the iodine test.==
Starch is converted into sugar by saliva, and when iodine comes into contact with starch, it turns from brown to a dark purple or black.  These two facts can be used in a simple experiment. 

First, have a Pathfinder volunteer to generate some saliva, and collect it in a test tube.  You will need about 1.5 inches of saliva in the test tube.  To aid in salivation, the Pathfinder may find it advantageous to chew on some clean rubber bands.  Do not use gum, as this will put sugar into the saliva and ruin the experiment.  You will need a second test tube with an equal amount of water (1.5 inches).

Second, take a single saltine cracker and wrap it in wax paper.  Then pulverize it into a fine powder.  Add half the &quot;powdered&quot; cracker to a test tube of saliva, and add the rest to the test tube of water.  Allow them to sit for 30 minutes.

Finally, add a drop of iodine to each test tube.  The iodine in the cracker/water test tube should turn purple, showing the presence of starch.  The iodine in the cracker/saliva test tube should not change color (it should remain brown) showing that the starch has been converted to something else (sugar in this case).  

To ensure success, do not allow the Pathfinder to mix the saliva and cracker in his mouth.  You need a LOT of saliva and only a little cracker so that all of the starch is converted to sugar before the iodine is added.

==13. What are the six basic nutrients that are essential for life and where does the bulk of their digestion/absorption take place?==

*'''Carbohydrates''' are compounds made of sugars.  Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth, continues in the stomach, and is completed in the small intestine.
*'''Proteins''' are made of amino acids.  Most protein digestion takes place in the duodenum with the overall contribution from the stomach being small.
*'''Fats''' consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acids attached.  Fats are completely digested in the small intestine.
*'''Vitamins''' are organic compounds essential to the body.  Vitamins are absorbed by the small intestine.
*'''Minerals''' are trace elements such as iron, copper, and salts essential to metabolism.  Minerals are absorbed in the small intestine.
*'''Water''' is an essential nutrient and is directly involved in all the chemical reactions of life.  It is primarily absorbed in the large intestine.

==14. Know the difference between monosaccharide, disaccharide, and polysaccharide. What is the most important carbohydrate?==
*'''Monosaccharides''' are the simplest form of carbohydrates. They consist of one sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, crystalline solids. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. 

*'''Disaccharides''' are sugars (carbohydrates) composed of two monosaccharides.

*'''Polysaccharides''' are relatively complex carbohydrates.  They are made up of many monosaccharides joined together. They are therefore very large, often branched, molecules.

The most important carbohydrate is the one that they are all made from: monosaccharide.

==15. What are amino acids? How many are needed to make all the proteins in the body? What is meant by essential amino acids? How many of them are essential? Where can you get all the essential amino acids?==

Amino acids are the molecules from which proteins are built.  There are twenty standard amino acids used by cells in protein biosynthesis.

Essential amino acids are the nine amino acids required for protein synthesis that cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained in the diet: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. 

Only some foods contain all the essential amino acids. These include milk and dairy products, eggs, fish, meat and poultry. If you don't eat animal products, the only way you can get all the essential amino acids is by combining plant foods. For example: corn plus peas or beans, rice plus beans, lentils plus bread. [http://www.dietitian.com/protein.html]

==16. What is ATP? What is it used for? What does your body make ATP from? What three sets of chemical reactions make ATP in your body? Why do we need to breathe oxygen?==

ATP stands for '''a'''denosine '''t'''ri'''p'''hosphate.  ATP is used for transporting energy around in your body.  All the energy your body uses is supplied by ATP.  ATP is made by three chemical reactions: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

*'''Glycolysis''' is a pathway that takes place within the cytoplasm of a cell and does not require oxygen.  The reaction produces four ATP molecules, but consumes two of them during the process.

*The '''Krebs Cycle''' is a pathway involved in the chemical conversion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and water to generate a form of usable energy.  The Krebs cycle produces ATP and another chemical called NADH.

*'''Oxidative phosphorylation''' converts the leftover NADH produced by the Krebs cycle into more ATP.

While glycolysis does not require oxygen, the other two ATP-producing reactions do.  We need to breathe oxygen to supply it to these processes.

==17. Know the difference between water and fat soluble vitamins. What are two common vitamins that are fat soluble? What are two vitamins that are water soluble?==

Fat-soluble vitamins may be stored in the body and can cause toxicity when taken in excess.  Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body, with the exception of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is stored in the liver.

Fat-soluble vitamins include A, D, E, and K.

Water-soluble vitamins include the eight B's and C.

==18. List four (4) Bible texts that refer to digestion.==
{{Bible verse
| book =Ezekiel 
| chapter = 3
| verse = 2
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
Then he said to me, &quot;Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.&quot; So I ate it, and it tasted sweet as honey in my mouth.
}}
{{Bible verse
| book =Matthew 
| chapter = 15
| verse = 17
| version =NIV
| text =
Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach then out of the body?
}}
{{Bible verse
| book = 1 Corinthians
| chapter = 6
| verse = 13
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Food for the stomach and the stomach for the food&quot; - but God will destroy them both.  The body is not meant for sexual immorality; but for the Lord and the Lord for the body.
}}
{{Bible verse
| book = Proverbs
| chapter = 18
| verse = 20
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
From the fruit of his mouth a man's stomach is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.
}}

==19. List five (5) E.G. White references that promote proper digestion. Choose a variety of topics.==
* Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 175, paragraph 2
* Selected Messages Book 2, page 415, paragraph 3
* Testimony Studies on Diet and Foods, page 91, paragraph 7
* Child Guidance, page 390, paragraph 3
* A Call to Medical Evangelism and Health Education, page 36, paragraph 1

==Notes==

* Requirement 3 of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Nutrition - Advanced|Nutrition - Advanced]] honor also requires that a food diary be kept, but only for one week.  The [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/CPR|CPR]] honor requires that you track your diet (and exercise) for a month.

== Overview ==

'''''Montague''''' is a Slytherin, probably one or two years older than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Montague is mentioned as being on the Slytherin Quidditch team, where he plays in the final against Gryffindor. He and team Captain [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]], between them, rack up a very impressive number of fouls.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

It is mentioned that Montague is the new captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, presumably replacing Marcus Flint. The commentary on the game lets us know that he is playing as one of the three Chasers.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] appoints Montague to be on her Inquisitorial Squad. He attempts to dock House points from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], and they shove him into an old, broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]]. Some short time later, he reappears, apparently partly embedded in one of the toilets. He never seems to fully recover from this misadventure, and while his parents do visit at one point, he is still in the Hospital Wing at the school as OWL exams finish up in mid-June — when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] goes to the Hospital Wing to speak with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] after his vision in the History of Magic exam, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] is spooning blue potion into Montague's mouth.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] reveals that when he was trapped in the Vanishing Cabinets, Montague had found himself sometimes hearing things happening inside the school, sometimes hearing things happening inside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]]. Realizing that the two cabinets were linked, Draco had repaired the Cabinet at Hogwarts, and had used that to allow Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts.

== Strengths ==

It is mentioned that Montague is physically quite strong, and evidently he is a competent flyer.

== Weaknesses ==

It is strongly suggested by the author that after his shattering sojourn in the Vanishing Cabinets, and the bad landing from his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparating]] out of that situation, that his mental abilities are impaired, as is his physical strength.&lt;!-- Editors, see analysis --&gt;

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

We are never actually told about Montague's strength, either mental or physical, after the events in the Vanishing Cabinet. We are, however, given some very strong hints.

On the mental acuity side, when we see him mid-June, Madam Pomfrey is spooning some blue potion into his mouth. The implication inherent in the word &quot;spooning&quot; is that Montague is not capable of steering the spoon himself. On the physical side, it is certain that Montague remained in the Hospital Wing from when the accident occurred, about April, to at least mid-June. Even for wizards as young and healthy as Montague, that much confinement must cause some muscle mass loss. One certainly gets a picture of a near-invalid, confined to the Hospital Wing for two months, and still unable to feed himself.

== Overview ==

'''''Colin Creevey''''' is student a year younger than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. Colin is very obsessed with Harry in his first year, and along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], is teased about creating a Harry Potter fan club.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Colin, an almost intolerably chirpy child, is Sorted into Gryffindor.

On the first day of classes, Colin corners Harry, demanding a photograph as proof that he has actually met the famous Harry Potter. A small crowd, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], gathers while this was going on, and Draco immediately seizes on this, telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], who is passing by, that Harry is offering signed photos. Gilderoy overpowers Harry's reluctance, and tells Colin to make it a picture of the two of them. He then drags Harry away for some &quot;fatherly advice on handling fame&quot;. Harry is later teased about this by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].

Harry is not terribly successful in his attempts to avoid Colin over the next week, and Colin accompanies him to the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practice of the season. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] is initially concerned about this strange person always clicking away with his camera while they are practicing, but soon has larger problems: the Slytherin team arrive, claiming that they have been granted use of the pitch by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], to allow them to train their new Seeker, Draco Malfoy. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] curses Draco with his broken wand, is hit by the curse backfire, and starts vomiting slugs, Colin has to be restrained from taking pictures of him in his distress.

Passing Harry in the hall, Colin mentions that someone had said Harry was the heir of Slytherin, the one apparently responsible for opening the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]].

When Harry is struck by an enchanted Bludger during the Quidditch game against Slytherin, a mistaken spell by Professor Lockhart removes all the bones in his arm, sending him to the Hospital Wing overnight. While he is there, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] bring in Colin, who has been Petrified. They surmise from the bunch of grapes he had been carrying that he was on his way to the Infirmary to visit someone, probably Harry, and as he was holding his camera before his face, they believe he was trying to take a picture of something. Opening the back of his camera to see what he had been trying to photograph, Dumbledore releases a cloud of burned-plastic smoke.

The news of Colin's Petrification apparently quite upsets Ginny. We do not yet know quite why.

Once Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] determine that the monster in the Chamber is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]], they also realize that every person attacked was Petrified, rather than killed, because they did not see the monster directly. In Colin's case, he was looking through his camera, and saw the Basilisk through his camera lens (and presumably mirror, assuming a single-lens reflex camera).

At the end of the story, Colin is re-animated, as are the rest of the Petrified students.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Colin very excitedly tells Harry that his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dennis Creevey|Dennis]] is starting at Hogwarts. Dennis is Sorted into Gryffindor, and Colin points out the famous Harry Potter to him.

Colin is the messenger who summons Harry to the Weighing of the Wands ceremony before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]]. His prattle of photo opportunities and the associated fame quite sours [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], whose class Harry is being summoned from. As Harry and Colin proceed to the designated classroom, Colin goes on about how it must be nice to be so famous, not heeding Harry's weariness at the prospect.

Draco Malfoy has started distributing buttons that say &quot;Support [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the True Hogwarts Champion&quot;, and when pressed, change to say &quot;Potter Stinks&quot;. Colin, with his brother Dennis, are seen at one point trying to Charm one of these badges, but are unsuccessful; when Harry returns to the Common Room that night, they have given up and left the badge on the table. The badge now reads &quot;Potter Really Stinks&quot;, and when Ron interrupts Harry's conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], Harry throws it at him in anger.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Colin is one of the students who attends the first meeting of Dumbledore's Army. We are led to understand that he attends further meetings, and makes much progress with the spells that Harry teaches, but he does not play a very large part in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Colin, seen in the Great Hall, is told to evacuate the school with the other underage wizards, but apparently somehow makes his way back to the school. He is killed by Death Eaters in the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]]; in the quiet time after Harry has seen Snape killed, Harry sees Oliver Wood and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] bringing Colin's body in from the grounds.

== Strengths ==

Colin's main strength is his unremitting cheerfulness. While this can be annoying to those around him, like Harry, it results in him being willing to take on almost any challenge.

== Weaknesses ==

While his cheerfulness does make him willing to take on many challenges, the fact is that much of what he tries to do is beyond his ability. We see this in his attempt to change what the Potter Stinks button says, and quite possibly it is what leads to his death.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Colin almost worships Harry, and is amazed that he has been Sorted into the same House as the famous Harry Potter.

His perpetual gung-ho enthusiasm seems to keep many others at a distance; we certainly never seem to see him spending time outside class with any other students, apart from his brother Dennis.

== Analysis ==

Colin is a rather interesting mix of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] and Wizarding attributes. Clearly, he has not been raised among Wizards, because like Harry he is totally unfamiliar with the ways of magic; he has never before seen Wizarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Photograph|photos]], and is quite obviously amazed to learn that if he uses the correct potion as a developer, the resulting photos will move. However, he also hero-worships Harry, who is a celebrity only among Wizards, and it seems he feels his parents do the same, as he says he wants a signed photo for them. Additionally, there is Dennis, who is also a Wizard; how likely is it that two Wizards can spring from one set of Muggle roots? We have no way of judging. 

In part because of this, Colin and Dennis' Blood status was never entirely clear. On the one side, some commentators have suggested that the Basilisk attack on Colin was evidence of his Muggle origin, though it may be questioned exactly how much control over the Basilisk the Heir actually has at that point. On the other side of the question, the fact that Colin was at Hogwarts during the final battle in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', when Hogwarts has been closed to all except those who can claim Blood status, is seen as evidence that Colin is able to prove that he has Wizarding ancestry.

The author has stated, since publication, that Colin and Dennis are, in fact, Muggle-born, and did not attend Hogwarts during Harry's seventh year. In an online question and answer session on July 30th 2007, she said that Colin had returned to the school along with the other exiled and graduate members of Dumbledore's Army, when Neville summoned them, and joined them all in the Great Hall where they gathered to prepare for the coming battle. There, McGonagall ordered him to leave, which he did, though presumably not actually getting as far as the Room of Requirement. He then sneaked back in to join the battle, as a true Gryffindor would, and died.

== Overview ==

'''''Cedric Diggory''''' is Seeker and Captain of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hufflepuff House|Hufflepuff]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Cedric Diggory, a fifth-year student, is the new captain of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team that is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|competing against Gryffindor]] in the Hogwarts Quidditch championship's first match. Cedric caught the Snitch, winning the match, after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] illegally glided onto the pitch during the game, causing Harry to faint and fall off his broom. Believing that Hufflepuff won by an unfair advantage, Cedric wanted to replay the game, but he was overruled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], the Gryffindor Quidditch captain, and also Hogwarts faculty.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Cedric and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|his father]] briefly appear as they journey to the Quidditch World championship with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], the Weasleys, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]. They then head for another campsite, and we do not see Cedric again until the school year starts.  

At Hogwarts, both Cedric and Harry are chosen as contestants in the inter-school [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] that is being held at the castle. Though Harry is under-aged, he is forced to compete in the dangerous event after an unknown person entered his name into the Goblet of Fire. Much of the plot involves Harry and Cedric's ongoing rivalry while competing in the Tournament, and also for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang's]] affections, though she is already dating Cedric. 

During the Tournament's final task, Cedric and Harry, who have helped each other throughout the contest, agree to grab the Triwizard trophy together. But the cup is actually a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|portkey]] crafted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] servants. Cedric and Harry are transported to a graveyard, where Cedric is immediately murdered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. As Harry duels Voldemort in the cemetery, Cedric's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|&quot;shade,&quot;]] along with the shades of the Dark Lord's other recent victims, helps distract the re-animated Voldemort long enough for Harry to escape to the portkey, returning to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. Later, Harry offers his prize money to Cedric's parents, believing Cedric won it, but they refuse, saying it rightfully belongs to Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Cedric is physically no longer present, he is mentioned several times during the book, chiefly due to Cho Chang mourning his death. Part of the impetus for the relationship between Cho and Harry is Cho's questions about Cedric's death; and Cho's lingering grief contributes to the relationship ending.

== Strengths ==

An athletic, intelligent, and handsome young man, Cedric is what many boys Harry's age aspire to be. He easily makes friends, and has many, and appears to have no enemies. He is considered honourable, fair-minded, and trustworthy. 

Although sorted into Hufflepuff, a house that traditionally garners students with more average abilities, Cedric clearly shows talents and skills far above the usual standard. He quickly becomes a leader within his own house, is the captain of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and is selected over all other Hogwarts students to compete in the grueling and dangerous Triwizard Tournament. Although Harry Potter was also selected, his bogus entry into the Tournament was orchestrated by Lord Voldemort's agent, who &quot;confunded&quot; the Goblet of Fire into sensing that Harry was a student from another school. Despite Harry's suspicious entry, Diggory supports him throughout the Tournament, as Harry does for him.

== Weaknesses ==

Although Cedric is honest and hardworking, he occasionally demonstrates a certain lack of ingenuity, initiative, and drive, though this changes as he competes in the Tournament. Prior to the first Triwizard event, the other contestants, aided by their mentors, utilize whatever means they can to discover what the task might entail. Cedric, however, apparently does nothing to try and give himself a competitive edge, and merely waits for instructions. If not for Harry tipping him off about the Dragons, Cedric, woefully unprepared, might have fared disastrously in that event.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Cedric always acts fairly with Harry, even when they are directly in competition with each other in the Tri-Wizard Tournament; Harry believes it is only fair to provide Cedric the same information that the other champions have learned regarding the first task; in return, Cedric later gives Harry a hint for solving a riddle related to the second task. As mentioned above, when Cedric feels that Hufflepuff unfairly won the Quidditch match against Gryffindor, he demands a rematch.

Because Harry is rather slow to act, Cedric beats him in inviting Cho Chang to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet_of_Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''; this seems to be the start to Cedric and Cho's serious romance, much to Harry's dismay. Their relationship lasts until Cedric's death during the Tournament. It is unknown if they would have lasted as a couple, but Cho is deeply affected by her loss.

Cedric, apparently an only child, is close to his parents, particularly his father, Amos, though the modest Cedric always seems mildly perturbed by Amos' constantly touting his son's accomplishments. Cedric's parents are devastated by their son's death.

== Analysis ==

Cedric's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]], appears to be creating a competitive atmosphere where none exists – casting Cedric's Quidditch win over Gryffindor as a great victory when Cedric would rather attribute it entirely to luck, and by making the rivalry between Harry and Cedric during the Triwizard Tournament into more than either boy is comfortable with. This is an all-too-common tendency of a father trying to live through his child's accomplishments.

== Overview ==

'''''Viktor Krum''''' is the representative from the Eastern European school of magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. He was also on the Bulgarian National Quidditch team. He is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]'s date for the Yule Ball during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] and is therefore seen with jealousy by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We are introduced to Viktor Krum at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. Krum is Seeker for the Bulgarian team, and is widely believed to be the best Seeker in the world; he manages to out-fly his opponent on the Irish team repeatedly, and catches the Snitch in the end despite his injuries. When he is not on his broom, his walk is ungainly; he is repeatedly described as &quot;slouching&quot; instead of walking. Ron almost worships Krum, to the point of buying a souvenir figurine of Krum that walks back and forth across his hand with Krum's characteristic duck-like gait.

When the representatives of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]] arrive at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is stunned to realize that Krum is among them — he had not thought that Krum was young enough to still be in school. His hopes of having Krum sit at the Gryffindor table for dinner are dashed, though: the Durmstrang delegation chooses the Slytherin table.

Krum's name is chosen by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]], making him the Durmstrang champion for the Tournament. His headmaster, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]], seems to feel that the Goblet has made the only logical choice. Krum does not say much when Harry is also chosen as a Champion; Karkaroff has to do most of his talking for him.

During the Fall term, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] keeps finding Krum in the library when she goes there to study. She finds this irritating, not because of Krum, but because of the gaggle of giggling girls who seem to follow him around, looking for autographs.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|first Task of the Tournament]], Krum uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Conjunctivitus|Conjunctivitus curse]] on his dragon to allow him to get past it and steal the Golden Egg. The dragon, enraged, flails around and breaks some of its own eggs, which costs him points; however, he comes out of the First Task with 40 points, tied for first with Harry.

Krum, it transpires, has invited Hermione to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. This infuriates Ron, though he doesn't really understand why; he thinks that he is angry with Hermione for &quot;consorting with the enemy&quot;. After the Ball, Hermione and Ron have a flaming row in the Gryffindor common room, which Hermione ends by saying &quot;''Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!''&quot;, and stalking off to the girl's dormitory. Harry later finds an arm on the floor of the dormitory that looks suspiciously like it might have been broken off a figurine of Krum...

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task of the Tournament]], the Champions each have to retrieve something of great value to them which is being held by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] deep under the lake at Hogwarts. The thing of great value to Krum is Hermione. Krum uses a partial [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] spell to give himself a shark head, but is unable to cut Hermione free; Harry, who is there waiting to see if any other hostages need rescuing, hands him a sharp stone that he has picked up off the lake bed. On the surface, Krum seems to be trying to keep Hermione's attention away from Ron and Harry, when they surface. It is during this interval that Krum invites Hermione to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer. After consultation between the judges, Krum is awarded 40 points for the Task, putting him in second place behind Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], who are tied for first.

Shortly afterwards, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], writing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']], says that Hermione is keeping both Harry and Krum on a string. Hermione wonders how Rita knows that Viktor has invited her to Bulgaria, as she hasn't told anyone.

Shortly after the briefing for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task of the Tournament]], Krum takes Harry aside to ask if Hermione is Harry's girlfriend. Harry responds that she is not; Krum says she talks about him all the time, and Harry says, that's because they are friends, no more than that. While they are talking, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]] emerges from the Forbidden Forest. Krum is at a loss for what to do, but Harry tells him to keep an eye on Crouch, and goes off to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. On Harry's return, Crouch is gone, and Krum is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]]; when Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Enervate|revives]] him, he says that Crouch must have Stunned him.

Being in second place, Krum enters the Third Task maze after Harry and Cedric. Harry finds him performing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]] on Cedric, Stuns him, and signals that he is out of the competition. It turns out later that Krum was being controlled at the time by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]].

After the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], Karkaroff runs. As the Durmstrang delegation prepares to leave Hogwarts at the end of the year, Ron wonders how they are going to get back to school with Karkaroff gone. Krum, who evidently has come to say goodbye to Harry and Hermione, remarks that Karkaroff had not done much of the driving; Krum had been in charge most of the way over and could get them back again easily enough. Finally, Ron unbends enough to ask Krum for his autograph.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Viktor is mentioned in passing when Hermione is trying to get Harry to teach [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Hermione says that Viktor had mentioned that Harry could do all sorts of things that Viktor couldn't, and Viktor was in his last year at Durmstrang. Ron, as usual, makes a sarcastic comment about &quot;Vicky&quot;, which Hermione dismisses.

When Hermione, Harry, and Ron are discussing the events of the final session of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] before the Christmas break, Hermione is in the middle of writing quite a long letter to Viktor. Ron is again sarcastic about &quot;Vicky&quot;, and says darkly that he'd like to be much more than just a pen pal. To the reader, it is quite clear that Ron is correct about Viktor's intentions, that Ron is jealous of Viktor's attentions to Hermione, and, perhaps, that Ron is unaware of these feelings himself.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Viktor Krum is likely still corresponding with Hermione, but no particular mention of that is made in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] has invited Viktor to her wedding; Hermione is quite startled and evidently pleased to see him there. Ron, of course, is jealous.

Harry, disguised as the Weasleys' &quot;Cousin Barny&quot;, is sitting at a table with Ron and Hermione when Krum joins them; this inspires Ron to ask Hermione if she'd like to dance. Krum points out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]], saying that he would duel him in other circumstances, because he is wearing the symbol of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]. He brandishes his wand, reminding Harry of the Weighing of the Wands ceremony in Harry's fourth year, and that reminds him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] had said this was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] wand. Harry had been trying to remember where he had heard the name Gregorovitch, and recognizing the source, he says that Krum's wand was made by Gregorovitch. Krum asks where he had heard that, Harry says it was a fan magazine. Krum muses that he didn't think he had spoken to any fan magazines about his wand, and then comments that this was one of the last wands made before Gregorovitch retired. He then inquires whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] is seeing anyone; Harry says that she is, and that he's big. Viktor expresses displeasure, asking what the point is of being famous if all the good women are taken?

Hermione later comments that she had seen Viktor storming away from Xeno Lovegood, and wonders if they had had an argument.

== Strengths ==
Viktor is an international standard Quidditch player. He displays a perfect example of the Wronski Feint which impresses the spectators at the Quiddich World Cup.

== Weaknesses ==

Viktor is something of a loner and rarely talks unless it is necessary. However, he gets along well with people he knows. While he seems to be quite curt with both Harry and Ron, part of that may be the result of the language barrier; Viktor's native tongue is, of course, one of the Slavic languages, probably Bulgarian.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==
Viktor is Hermione Granger's date for the Yule Ball and he also asks her to visit him in Bulgaria. He tells her he has never felt before the way he does about her.
Ron Weasley is jealous of Viktor's relationship with Hermione yet he has to grudgingly admit that he is a fan of Viktor as a Quidditch player.

== Overview ==

'''''Firenze''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] who lives in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with the other Centaurs. Although they generally avoid humans, Firenze, the least aloof member in his herd, frequently interacts with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].

The author has said that Firenze's name is pronounced similarly to that of the Italian city.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is serving detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest, Firenze [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 15|rescues]] him from an unknown presence. Firenze also helps Harry figure out who is trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone and why. He is roundly criticized for helping Harry by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bane|Bane]], a member of his herd, who believes Centaurs should remain aloof from puny Human problems.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s request, Firenze agrees to teach Divination at Hogwarts when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Sybill Trelawney]] is sacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. This causes enormous turmoil between Firenze and the other centaurs, and Firenze is ejected from the herd.

Firenze teaches the Centaur method of divination, which is different from those used by Professor Trelawney. Instead it emphasizes divination's inexactness. Firenze also calls Harry aside to pass on a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] saying that his (Hagrid's) attempt is not working. Although this is left unexplained, it is shortly learned that Hagrid is attempting to civilize his giant half-brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Although Firenze continues teaching Divination at Hogwarts, alternating with Professor Trelawney, Harry is no longer taking the class and does not interact with him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Firenze is still at Hogwarts. During the battle at Hogwarts, he receives a fairly major injury and is unable to stand. Apparently he is later fully healed.

In an interview after the seventh book was finished, the author stated that, as events had proven him, if not right, at least not wrong in helping the Humans, he was allowed to rejoin his herd in the Forbidden Forest.

== Strengths ==

Firenze is skilled in the ancient Centaurian divination techniques involving smoke and stars. He demonstrates great patience with these strange Human foals that he has been called upon to teach.

== Weaknesses ==

Like all centaurs, he tends to discount the cosmic importance of any non-Centaur race, including humans.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Firenze is more sympathetic to Humans than other Centaurs, but that is not saying much; he remains aloof and supercilious. He evidently shares the opinion that Humans are a lesser breed unable to understand the subtleties apparent to Centaurs or possess their deeper understanding of the universe. He is more open to discussion with Professor Dumbledore and Harry, perhaps because he sees them as pivotal characters in the unfolding events in their personal corner of the universe. However, even with Harry, there is a reserve, an apparent belief that he cannot fully understand the Centaur way. It seems Firenze believes Dumbledore is the one Human who can understand Centaurs. Dolores Umbridge, however, hates and fears him, as she does all intelligent non-human or partly-human creatures. She is furious when Dumbledore appoints Firenze as the new Divination teacher after she sacks Professor Trelawney.
 
Firenze's sympathy for humans causes trouble, and he clashes with the herd's elders. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], he is banished from the herd and is now a lone Centaur.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Why did Firenze choose to abandon the other centaurs and teach at Hogwarts?
# In Firenze's first lesson, he seems unconcerned that none of his students succeed. What does this say about accepting things like control and fate?

== Overview ==

'''''Arabella Doreen Figg''''' is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s neighbor, possibly living on Wisteria Walk, near the Dursley home on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. &quot;Old Mrs. Figg&quot; often is called on to watch Harry when the Dursleys are on some fun outing or other, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s birthday parties. She is a classic old lady with too many cats.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] dreads [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s birthday because it means he will be sent to Mrs. Figg's, where he will spend the entire day being told, again, about the life histories of the cats in her photo album. As it turns out, however, she has broken her leg and so Harry has to go to the zoo with Dudley, much to Dudley's displeasure. After the events at the zoo, Harry is locked, once again, in the cupboard under the stairs; by the time he has been released, Dudley has knocked over Mrs Figg, on her crutches, with his new racing bike.

When he has to visit her later, she is not quite so keen to tell him about all her cats; it seems that she broke her leg tripping over one of them... so he gets to watch television instead.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Harry's time at home at the beginning of this book is very limited, and he does not get a chance to speak with Mrs. Figg before the Weasleys arrive to take him to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]].

At the very end of the book, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] is sending people off on missions, he tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] to get in touch with &quot;the old crowd&quot;, and explicitly mentions Arabella Figg as one of that group. The reader doesn't notice the name going by, as who would connect batty old Mrs. Figg with her cats to the world of magic?

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Much to Harry's surprise, it is revealed that Mrs. Figg is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]] and a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. Apparently, she was stationed to live near Harry in order to keep an eye on him and the Dursleys. With the re-creation of the Order of the Phoenix, she was formally brought into that order to assist in guarding Harry. She sees the attack on him and Dudley by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], and roundly chastises [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] for abandoning his post to attend to one of his shady deals at what turns out to be the worst possible time. Finally, she is a witness at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] when Harry is tried for using magic on that occasion. Although she does testify that Harry was attacked by Dementors, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 the author has stated] that she never actually saw the Dementors, but recognized them by their effects.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry spends so little time on Privet Drive in this book that there is no time to mention Mrs. Figg or the other members of the Order who are likely still present and keeping an eye on Harry. However, it is mentioned in passing that she attends Dumbledore's funeral, along with many other Order members.

== Strengths ==
Arabella is a squib and as such is not tracked or noticed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry_Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].  Thus she is able to assist Dumbledore in keeping a eye on Harry without the knowledge of the Ministry.

== Weaknesses ==
Arabella is unable to use magic to defend herself or Harry.  Without a wizard to assist, her guardian capabilities are limited.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Arabella Figg is a Squib, and as such her relationships with the rest of the Wizarding world are of a very uneven sort; most pity her because she is part of their world, yet unable to partake, being unable to do any sort of magic. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 The author has said] that Arabella does have a &quot;roaring business&quot; breeding cat-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]] hybrids like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]]; it is possible that Crookshanks came from Mrs. Figg originally, but that cannot be certain.

== Analysis ==

Mrs. Figg's major role is in the start of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where she witnesses and bears witness to the attack on Harry and Dudley by the Dementors. There has been some question raised as to whether she, being a Squib, could actually perceive Dementors; a major point against is, of course, the author's statement that she could not see them. However, against this we have to put the words of Mrs. Figg herself, in the first paragraph of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|chapter 2 of that book]]: before anyone else has said anything, Mrs. Figg says &quot;Dementors! In Little Whinging!&quot; Clearly, whether or not she can see the Dementors, she is aware of their presence and can identify them.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Someone has to be placed near the Dursleys' to watch over Harry while he is growing up – the prophecy makes it clear that he will be an important wizard. Why a Squib?
# In the first book, we see that Mrs. Figg has broken her leg and is in a cast and using crutches. If the Wizarding world can mend bones in an instant, why is she using Muggle forms of healing?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

A popular theory for why Mrs. Figg is selected as guard for Harry is that no one could detect their magical power because Arabella is a Squib and Harry is underage. Harry's being underage would, of course, be no bar to the detection of his use of magic, as is amply demonstrated when the Ministry for Magic warns him about the use of magic in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. Perhaps a better explanation is Dumbledore's sympathy for the non-magical. It is likely Dumbledore who managed to get [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] a job as caretaker of the castle at Hogwarts, a job which is one of the few in the Wizarding world of which he is capable; likewise, this watchman job is one suited to Mrs. Figg's lack of Magical ability.

==1. Name at least six materials commonly used by masons in the erection of walls or buildings.==
Primary materials include:
# Brick
# Concrete Block (also known as cinder block)
# Poured Concrete
# Stone
# Glass Block
# Tile

Secondary materials include
# Mortar
# Rebar
# Grout

==2. Demonstrate ability to use properly the following:==
=== Plumb line===
[[image:Plumb_bob.jpg|thumb|200px|Plumb Line]]
A plumb line is a string with a plumb bob at the end of it.  The plumb bob hangs straight down, so the plumb line can be used to make sure that a wall is perfectly vertical and does not lean in any direction.  A perfectly vertical line is said to be ''plumb''.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Line stretcher (chicken legs)===
A line stretcher is used for guiding the mason when laying brick or other materials in a straight line.  Typically, the mason will build up the corners or ends of a wall first, stretch a line between them, and lay the remaining bricks between them.  The line stretcher is often set about a sixteenth of an inch away from the wall so that the bricks do not touch it (otherwise they might push the line out).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Level===
[[image:DetalleNivelDeBurbuja.jpg|thumb|200px|Level]]
A spirit level or bubble level is an instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is level or plumb. Spirit levels feature a slightly curved glass tube which is incompletely filled with a liquid, usually colored 'spirit' (a synonym for ethanol), leaving a bubble in the tube. Ethanol is used because of its low freezing point, −114°C, which prevents it from freezing in cold weather. Most commonly spirit levels are employed to indicate how horizontal (level) or how vertical (plumb) a surface is.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Trowel===
[[image:Masons_trowel.jpg|thumb|200px|Trowel]]
A trowel is used for applying mortar to bricks, blocks, or other material.  It is also used for &quot;throwing a mortar line&quot; - that is, laying a line of mortar atop the surface upon which that the bricks will be laid.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== S-tool===
An S-Tool is more commonly known as a jointer.  The purpose of the S-tool is to place the grooves in the mortar between bricks. The concave grooves seen within the mortar lines of bricks are placed there by scraping the S-tool along the mortar well before it sets.

The S-tool should be used sometime between the time that the mortar is placed, and when it begins to harden. If the S-tool is used too late, then it will result in uneven lines throughout the mortar. The mortar will not have a smooth concave surface, and will look very raggedy.

Sometimes an S-tool is not used, and the mortar is placed on in excess; the slapping of the bricks causes it to drip down over the bricks, and it has a very nice effect when the bricks are painted afterwards.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Mason's hammer===
[[image:Masons_hammer.jpg|thumb|200px|Mason's hammer]]
A Mason's hammer has one flat traditional face and a short or long chisel-shaped blade. It can thus be used to chip off edges or small pieces of stone without using a separate chisel. The chisel blade can also be used to rapidly cut bricks or cinder blocks.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==3. Demonstrate a knowledge of building cement characteristics (know how to prevent sweating, cracking, shrinking, crumbling, and loss of strength).==
Properly mixing and curing concrete will address most of the problems listed here.  Adding too much water to concrete will cause it to lose strength.  Ideally, you should only add enough water to the dry ingredients to make them all slightly wet.  It is sometimes necessary to add more water than this so that the concrete can be poured into a form, and in these cases, only enough water to get the concrete to flow should be added.  

Once the concrete is wet, it will begin to cure.  It must be kept moist while it cures, and this can be accomplished by slowing the evaporation of the water that was mixed into it.  Usually, this is done by covering the concrete with plastic sheeting or by spraying it lightly with water as it cures.

Concrete will shrink and expand with temperature, so large slabs must be fitted with expansion joints.  These are most commonly seen as the gaps in roadways and sidewalks, but they are also built into walls and other structures as well.

==4. Make usable mortar and state proper proportions of ingredients (lime, sand, etc.).==
There are two basic types of mortar: type N and type S.  

'''Type N''' mortar is used for interior work and exterior work that is above grade (that is, not buried).  It is made by combining:

* Lime (one part)
* Cement (one part)
* Sand (six parts)

'''Type S''' mortar is used for below-grade applications such as retaining walls and basements.  It is made by combining:

* Lime (one part)
* Cement (two parts)
* Sand (nine parts)

Water is added to either of these mixtures and worked in with a trowel or a hoe until it reaches the desired consistency.  Both types can be purchased pre-mixed so the mason need only add the water.  Mixing is done on a hard flat surface, often in a wheelbarrow or on a sheet of plywood, but more properly in a mortar box.

==5. Lay a straight stone, brick, or block masonry wall at least four feet (1.2 meters) high and ten feet (3.0 meters) long, including an inside or outside corner (surface must be struck and broomed).==
===Brick===
Good bricklaying procedure depends on good workmanship and efficiency.  Efficiency involves doing  the work with the fewest possible motions.  Each motion should have a purpose and should accomplish   a definite result.  After learning the fundamentals, every builder should  develop  methods for achieving maximum efficiency. The work must be arranged in such a way that the Builder is continually supplied with brick and mortar.  The scaffolding required must be planned before the work begins. It must be built in such a way as to cause the least interference with other crew members.

To efficiently and effectively lay bricks, you must be familiar with the terms that identify the position of masonry units and mortar joints in a wall. The following list, which is referenced in '''Figure 1''', provides some of the basic terms you will encounter. 

[[Image:Brick_terms.jpg|frame|'''Figure 1''']]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
;Course: One of several continuous, horizontal layers (or rows) of masonry units bonded together.

;Wythe: Each continuous, vertical section of a wall, one masonry unit thick. Sometimes called a tier. 

;Stretcher: A masonry unit laid flat on its bed along the length of a wall with its face parallel to the face of the wall. 

;Header: A masonry unit laid flat on its bed across the width of a wall with its face perpendicular to the face of the wall. Generally used to bond two wythes. 

;Row lock: A header laid on its face or edge across the width of a wall. 

;Bull header: A rowlock brick laid with its bed perpendicular to the face of the wall. 

;Bull stretcher: A rowlock brick laid with its bed parallel to the face of the wall. 

;Soldier: A brick laid on its end with its face perpendicular to the face of the wall.

====Bonds====
The term “bond” as used in masonry has three different meanings: structural bond, mortar bond, or pattern  bond.  Structural bond refers to how the individual masonry units interlock or tie together into a single structural unit.  You can achieve structural bonding of brick and tile walls in one of three ways:  

*Overlapping (interlocking) the masonry units
*Embedding metal ties in connecting joints
*Using grout to adhere adjacent wythes of masonry.

Mortar bond refers to the adhesion of the joint mortar to the masonry units or to the reinforcing steel. Pattern bond refers to the pattern formed by the masonry units and mortar joints on the face of a wall. The pattern may result from the structural bond, or may be purely decorative and unrelated to the structural bond.  '''Figure 2'''  shows  the  six  basic pattern bonds in common use today: running, common or American, Flemish, English,  stack, and English cross or Dutch bond. 
[[Image:Types_of_masonry_bonds.jpg|frame|'''Figure 2''']]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
The  running  bond  is  the  simplest  of  the  six patterns,  consisting  of  all  stretchers.  Because  the bond  has  no  headers,  metal  ties  usually  form  the structural bond.

The common, or American, bond is a variation of the running bond, having a course of full-length headers at regular intervals that provide the structural bond as well as the pattern. Header courses usually appear at every fifth, sixth, or seventh course, depending on the structural bonding requirements. You can vary the common bond with a Flemish header course. In laying out any bond pattern, be sure to start the corners correctly. In a common bond, use a three-quarter closure at the corner of each header course. 

In the Flemish bond, each course consists of alternating headers and stretchers. The headers in every other course center over and under the stretchers in the courses in between. The joints between stretchers in all stretcher courses align vertically. When headers are not required for structural bonding, you can use bricks called blind headers. You can start the corners in two different ways. In the Dutch corner, a three-quarter closure starts each course. In the English corner, a 2-inch or quarter closure starts the course. 

The English bond consists of alternating courses of headers and stretchers. The headers center over and under the stretchers. However, the joints between stretchers in all stretcher courses do not align vertically. You can use blind headers in courses that are not structural bonding courses. 

The stack bond is purely a pattern bond, with no overlapping units and all vertical joints aligning. You must use dimensionally accurate or carefully rematched units to achieve good vertical joint alignment. You can vary the pattern with combinations and modifications of the basic patterns shown above. This pattern usually bonds to the backing with rigid steel ties or 8-inch-thick stretcher units when available. In large wall areas or load-bearing construction, insert steel pencil rods into the horizontal mortar joints as reinforcement. 

[[image:Metal_masonry_ties.jpg|right|frame|300px|'''Figure 3''' Metal Masonry Ties]]

The English cross or Dutch bond is a variation of the English bond. It differs only in that the joints between the stretchers in the stretcher courses align vertically. These joints center on the headers in the courses above and below.

When a wall bond has no header courses, use metal ties  to bond the exterior wall brick to the backing courses. '''Figure 3''' shows three typical metal ties.

Install flashing at any spot where moisture is likely to enter a brick masonry structure. Flashing diverts the moisture back outside. Always install flashing under horizontal masonry surfaces, such as sills and copings; at intersections between masonry walls and horizontal surfaces, such as a roof and parapet or a roof and chimney; above openings (doors and windows, for example); and frequently at floor lines, depending on the type of construction. The flashing should extend through the exterior wall face and then turn downward against the wall face to form a drop.

You should provide weep holes at intervals of 18 to 24 inches to drain water to the outside that might accumulate on the flashing. Weep holes are even more important when appearance requires the flashing to stop behind the wall face instead of extending through the wall. This type of concealed flashing, when combined with tooled mortar joints, often retains water in the wall for long periods and, by concentrating the moisture at one spot, does more harm than good.

====Mortar Joints and Pointing====
There is no set rule governing the thickness of a brick masonry mortar joint. Irregularly shaped bricks may require mortar joints up to 1/2 inch thick to compensate for the irregularities. However, mortar joints 1/4 inch thick are the strongest. Use this thickness when the bricks are regular enough in shape to permit it. A slushed joint is made simply by depositing the mortar on top of the head joints and allowing it to run down between the bricks to form a joint. You cannot make solid joints this way. Even if you fill the space between the bricks completely, there is no way you can compact the mortar against the brick faces; consequently a poor bond results. 
The only effective way to build a good joint is to trowel it. The secret of mortar joint construction and pointing is in how you hold the trowel for spreading mortar. 
[[Image:Holding_a_trowel.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 4''' The proper way to hold a trowel]]

'''Figure 4''' shows the correct way to hold a trowel. Hold it firmly in the grip shown, with your thumb resting on top of the handle, not encircling it.  If you  are right-handed, pick up mortar from the outside of the mortar board pile with the left edge of your trowel.  You  can pick up enough to spread one to five bricks, depending on the wall space and your skill.  A pickup for one brick forms only a small pile along the left edge of the trowel.  A pickup for five bricks is a full load for a large trowel.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Picking up and spreading mortar.jpg|frame|'''Figure 5''']]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Poor_mortar_bond.jpg|frame|left|'''Figure 6''' Poor mortar bond]]

If you are right-handed, work from left to right along the wall.  Holding the left edge of the trowel directly over the center line of the previous course, tilt the trowel slightly and move it to the right (view 3), spreading an equal amount of mortar on each brick until you either complete the course or the trowel is empty (view 4). Return any mortar left over to the mortar board.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
!rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|[[Image:Making a bed joint in a stretcher course.jpg|frame|right|'''Figure 7''' Making a bed joint in a stretcher course.]]

|-
|[[Image:Making a head joint.jpg|frame|right|'''Figure 9''' Making a head joint in a stretcher course.]]
|}
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
Do not spread the mortar for a bed joint too far ahead of laying - four or five brick lengths is best. Mortar spread out too far ahead  dries  out  before  the bricks become bedded and causes a poor bond. The mortar must be soft and plastic so that the brick will bed in it easily. Spread the mortar about 1 inch thick and then make a shallow furrow in it (Figure 7, view  1).  A furrow that is too deep leaves a gap between the mortar and the bedded brick. This  reduces the resistance of the wall to  water penetration. Using a smooth, even stroke, cut off any mortar projecting beyond the wall line with the edge of the trowel (view 2).  Retain enough mortar on the trowel to butter the left end of the first brick you will lay in the fresh mortar. Throw the rest back on the mortar board. Pick up the first brick to be laid with your thumb on one side of the brick and your fingers on the other. Apply as much mortar as will stick to the  end of the brick and then push it into place (Figure 8). Squeeze out the excess mortar at the head joint and at the sides.  Make sure the mortar completely fills the head joint (Figure 9).  After bedding the brick, cut off the excess mortar and use it to start the next end joint. Throw any surplus mortar back on the mortar board where it can be restored to workability.

|[[Image:Inserting a brick in a wall space.jpg|frame|300px|left|'''Figure 10''']]
|[[Image:Making a cross joint.jpg|frame|300px|right|'''Figure 11''']]
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
'''Figure 10''' shows how to insert a brick into a space left in a wall. First, spread a thick bed of mortar (view 1), and then shove the brick into the wall space (view 2) until mortar squeezes out of all four joints (view 3). This way, you know that the joints are full of mortar at every point. To make a cross joint in a header course, spread the bed joint mortar several brick widths in advance. Then, spread mortar over the face of the header  brick before placing it in the wall ('''Figure  11''', view 1). Next, shove the brick into place, squeezing out mortar at the top of the joint. Finally, cut off the excess mortar as shown in view 2. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Closure joint in header course.jpg|frame|'''Figure 12''']]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

'''Figure 12''' shows how to lay a closure brick in a header course. First, spread about 1 inch of mortar on the sides of the brick already in place (view 1), as well as on both sides of the closure brick (view 2). Then, lay the closure brick carefully into position without disturbing the brick already laid (view 3). If you do disturb any adjacent brick, cracks will form between the brick and mortar, allowing moisture to penetrate the wall.  You should place a closure  brick for a stretcher course using the same techniques as for a header course. As we mentioned  earlier, filling exposed joints with mortar immediately after laying a wall is called pointing. You can also fill holes and correct defective mortar joints by pointing, using a pointing trowel.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===Block===
====Planning====
The first step in laying a block wall is to carefully plan the project.  When using concrete block to build a wall, it is important to select the dimensions of the wall based on the size of the block.  Standard concrete blocks are 7 5/8&quot; wide, 7 5/8&quot; deep, and 15 5/8&quot; long.  Assuming that the mortar joint is 3/8&quot; thick brings the block plus mortar dimensions to 8x8x16&quot;.  You will want the outside dimension of the wall to be a multiple of a half-block length (minus one mortar joint) so that you do not have to cut blocks to a custom size.  The height of the wall should also be a multiple of the block height (including the mortar joint).

====Locate the Corners====
[[Image:Block wall first course.jpg|frame|right|Figure 13: Laying the first course]]
The first step in building a concrete masonry wall is to locate the corners of the structure. In locating the corners, you should also make sure the footing or slab
formation is level so that each builder starts each section wall on a common plane.  This also  helps ensure that the bed joints are straight when the sections are connected. If the foundation is badly out of level, the entire first course should be laid before builders begin working on other courses. If this is not possible, a level plane should be established with a transit  or  engineer’s  level.  

====Chase Out Bond====
The second step is to chase out bond, or lay out, by placing the first course of blocks without mortar (Figure 13, view 1).

{| border=&quot;0&quot;

|-
|[[Image:Vertical joints.jpg|frame|Figure 15: Vertical  joints.]]
|}

Snap a chalk line to mark the footing and align the blocks accurately. Then, use a piece of material 3/8 inch thick to properly space the blocks.  This helps you get an accurate measurement.  
====Lay the Mortar Bed====
The third step is to replace the loose blocks with a full mortar bed, spreading  and furrowing it with a trowel to ensure plenty of mortar under the bottom edges of the   first course (figure 13, view 2). Carefully position and align the corner block first (view 3 of figure 14). Lay the remaining first-course blocks with the thicker end up to provide a larger mortar-bedding area. For the vertical joints, apply mortar only to the block ends by placing several blocks on end and buttering them all in one operation (view 4). Make the joints 3/8 inch thick. Then, place each block in its final position, and  push the block down vertically into the mortar bed and against the previously laid block. This  ensures a well-tilled vertical mortar joint (view 5). After laying three or four blocks, use a mason’s level as a straightedge to check correct block alignment (figure 14, view 1). Then, use the level to bring the blocks to proper grade and plumb by tapping with a trowel handle as shown in view 2. Always lay out the first course of concrete masonry carefully and make sure that you properly align, level, and plumb it.  This assures that succeeding courses and the final wall are both straight and true.

====Build Up the Corners====
The fourth step is to build up the corners of the wall, usually four or five courses high.  This is also called laying up a lead.  Step back each course one-half block.  For the horizontal joints, apply mortar only to the tops of the blocks already laid. For the  vertical joints, you can apply mortar either to the ends of the new block or the end of the block previously laid, or both, to ensure well-filled joints (figure 15).  As you lay each  course at the corner, check the course with a level for alignment (figure 16, view 1),  for level (view 2), and for plumb (view 3).  Carefully check each block with a level or straightedge to make sure that all the block faces are in the same plane. This ensures true, straight walls.

|[[Image:Masonry horizontal spacing.jpg|frame|right|Figure 18: Checking the Horizontal Spacing.]]
|}
[[Image:Masonry between corners.jpg|frame|right|Figure 19: Filling in the wall between corners.]]
A story or course pole, which is a board with markings 8 inches apart (figure 17), helps accurately place each masonry course.  Also check the horizontal block spacing by placing a level diagonally across the corners of the blocks (figure 18). When filling in the wall between the corners, first stretch a mason’s line along the extensor block edges from corner to corner for each course. Then lay the top  outside  edge  of  each  new  block  to  this  line (figure 19). How you grip a block before laying is important.  First, tip it slightly toward you so that you can see the edge of the course below.  Then place the lower edge of the new block directly on the edges of the block below (figure 19).  Make all position adjustments while the mortar is soft and plastic.  Any adjustments you make after the mortar stiffens will break the mortar bond and allow water to penetrate. Level each block and align it to the mason’s line by tapping it lightly with a trowel handle. 

====Installing the Closure Block====
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|[[Image:Closure block.jpg|frame|right|Figure 20: Installing the closure block.]]
|[[Image:Cut_off_excess_mortar.jpg|frame|Figure 21: Cutting off excess mortar from the joints.]]
|}&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt; 
Fifth and last, before installing the closure block, butter both edges of the opening and all four vertical edges of the closure block with mortar.  Then, lower the closure block carefully into place (figure 20). If any mortar falls out, leaving an open joint, remove the block  and  repeat the procedure. To assure a good bond, do not spread mortar too far ahead when actually laying blocks.  If you do, the mortar will stiffen and lose its plasticity.  The recommended  width of mortar joints for concrete masonry units is 3/8 inch.  When properly made, these joints produce a weathertight, neat, and durable concrete masonry wall. 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt; 
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|[[Image:Tooled_mortar_joints.jpg|frame|Figure 22: Tooled mortar joints for weathertight exterior walls.]]
|[[Image:Tooling_mortar_joints.jpg|frame|Figure 23:Tooling  mortar  joints.]]
|}&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt; 
As you lay each block, cut off excess mortar from the joints using a trowel (figure 21) and throw it back on the mortar board to rework into the fresh mortar.  Do not, however, rework  any mortar dropped on the scaffold or floor. Weathertight joints and the neat appearance of concrete masonry walls depend on proper striking (tooling). After laying a section of the wall, tool the mortar joint when the mortar becomes “thumb print” hard.  Tooling compacts the mortar  and forces it tightly against the masonry on each side of the joint. Use either concave or V-shaped tooling on all joints (figure 22).  
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt; 

[[Image:Installing anchor bolts.jpg|frame|Figure 24: Installing anchor bolts for wood plates.]]
Tool horizontal joints (figure 23, view 1) with a long jointer first, followed by tooling the  vertical joints (view 2).  Trim off mortar burrs from the tooling flush with the wall face using a trowel, soft bristle brush, or by rubbing with a burlap bag.

A procedure known as pointing may be required after jointing.  Pointing is the process of inserting mortar into horizontal and vertical joints after the unit has been laid.  Basically, pointing is done to restore or replace deteriorated surface mortar in old work. Pointing of this nature is called tuck pointing.  However, even in freshly laid masonry, pointing may be necessary for filling holes or correcting defective joints. 

You must prepare in advance for installing wood plates with anchor bolts on top of hollow concrete masonry walls.  To do this, place pieces of metal lath in the second horizontal mortar joint from the top of the wall under the cores that will contain the bolts (figure 24,  view 1).  Use anchor bolts 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 inches long. Space them not more than 4 feet apart.  Then, when you complete the top course, insert the bolts into the cores of the top two courses and till  the cores with concrete or mortar.  The metal lath underneath holds  the concrete or mortar filling in place.  The threaded end of the bolt should extend above the top of the wall (view 2).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==6. Pour a level footing, using hand mixed cement and proper reinforcement.==
{| border=0
|[[image:Typical_footing_form.jpg|frame|Figure 25: Typical  footing  form.]]
|[[Image:Footing keyway.jpg|frame|Figure 26: Methods of bracing bearing wall footing forms and placing a keyway.]]
|}
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
A footing is a concrete structure upon which a wall is built.   Figure 25 shows a typical footing formwork for a bearing wall, and figure 26 shows bracing methods for a bearing footing.  A bearing wall, also called a load-bearing wall, is an exterior wall that serves as an enclosure and also transmits structural loads to the foundation. The form sides are 2-inch lumber whose width equals the footing depth.  Stakes hold the sides in place while spreaders maintain the correct distance between them. The short braces at each stake hold the form in line. A keyway is made in the wet concrete by placing a 2-by-2-inch board along the center of the wall footing form. After the concrete is dry, the board is removed.  This leaves an indentation, or key, in the concrete. When you pour the foundation wall, the key provides a tie between the footing and wall. 

Concrete is strong under compression, but relatively weak under tension.  The reverse is true for steel.  Therefore, when the two are combined, one makes up for the deficiency of the other. When steel is embedded in concrete in a manner that assists it in carrying imposed loads, the combination is known as reinforced concrete.  The steel may consist of welded wire fabric or  expanded metal mesh, but, more often, it consists of reinforcing bars, or more commonly &quot;rebar.&quot;

Before placing reinforcing steel in forms, use a piece of burlap to clean the bars of rust, scale, grease, mud, or other foreign matter. A light film of rust or mill scale is not objectionable.  Rebars must be tied together for the bars to remain in a desired arrangement  during pouring.  Tying is also a means of keeping laps or splices in place.  Laps allow bond  stress to transfer the load from one bar, first into the concrete and then into the second bar.

Once the forms are in place and the rebar has been laid, it is time to mix the concrete.  You can get the dry ingredients premixed and simply add water to it (follow the directions on the bag).  Mixing can be done in a wheelbarrow or in a mixer.  Use a hoe to work the water into the cement until it is thoroughly worked in.  Do not add more water to the mix than the bag indicates is acceptable.  Adding too much water will create a weaker concrete.  When the mixing is complete, pour the concrete into the forms.  You must then consolidate the concrete.

Consolidation eliminates rock pockets and air bubbles and brings enough fine material both to the surface and against the forms to produce the desired finish.  You can use such hand tools  as spades, puddling sticks, or tampers, but mechanical vibrators are best.  Any compacting device must reach the bottom of the form and be small enough to pass between reinforcing  bars.  The process involves carefully working around all reinforcing steel with the compacting device to assure proper embedding of reinforcing steel in the concrete.  Since  the strength of the concrete member depends on proper reinforcement location, be careful not to displace the reinforcing steel.

Manual consolidation methods require spades, puddling sticks, or various types of tampers.  To consolidate concrete by spading, insert the spade along the inside surface of the forms, through the layer just placed, and several inches into the layer underneath. Continue spading or puddling until the coarse aggregate disappears into the concrete.

====Finishing====
The finishing process provides the final concrete surface.  There are many ways to finish concrete surfaces, depending on the effect required.  Sometimes you only need to correct surface defects, fill bolt holes, or clean the surface.  Unformed surfaces may require only  screeding to proper contour and elevation, or a broomed, floated, or troweled finish may be specified. 

====Screeding==== 
The top surface of a floor slab, sidewalk, or pavement is rarely placed at the exact  specified elevation. Screeding brings the surface to the required elevation by striking off the excess concrete. Two types of screeds are used in concrete finishing operations: the  hand screed and the mechanical screed.

Hand screeding requires a tool called a screed. This is actually a template (usually a 2-by-4) having a straight  lower  edge  to  produce  a  flat  surface  (or  a curved  lower  edge  to  produce  a  curved  surface). Move the screed back and forth across the concrete using a sawing motion. With each  sawing  motion,  move  the  screed  forward  an  inch or so along the forms. This forces the concrete built up against the screed face into the low spots. If the screed  tends  to  tear  the  surface,  as  it  may  on air-entrained  concrete  due  to  its  sticky  nature,  either reduce  the  rate  of  forward  movement  or  cover  the lower edge of the screed with metal. This stops the tearing action in most cases.

==7. Make the forms and lay a piece of concrete walk or floor, using commercially mixed cement. Finish it and rule it.==
The interpretation of &quot;commercially mixed&quot; cement is up to interpretation.  If you call a concrete company and have them show up with a cement truck, that is certainly &quot;commercial.&quot;  But if it's a small job, you may wish to use &quot;commercially mixed&quot; cement available in bags (just add water).  It's up to you.

To lay a sidewalk or a floor, proceed as described for a footing, but once the screeding is done, there are additional steps in finishing: floating, edging, and troweling:

===Floating===
If  a  smoother  surface  is  required  than  the  one obtained by screeding, the surface should be worked sparingly  with  a  wood  or  aluminum  magnesium  float. The  aluminum  float,  which  is  used  the same  way  as  the  wood  float,  gives  the  finished concrete a much smoother surface. To avoid cracking and  dusting  of  the  finished  concrete,  begin  aluminum floating when the water sheen disappears from the freshly  placed  concrete  surface.  Do  not  use  cement  or water as an aid in finishing the surface. Floating has   three purposes: 
# to embed aggregate particles just beneath the surface;  
# to remove slight imperfections (high and low spots); and,  
# to compact the concrete at the surface in preparation for other finishing operations.

Begin floating immediately after screeding while the concrete is still plastic and workable. However, do not overwork the concrete while it is still plastic because you may bring an excess of water and paste to the  surface.  This  fine  material  forms  a  thin,  weak layer that will scale or quickly wear off under use. To remove a coarse texture as the final finish, you usually have to float the surface a second time after it partially hardens. 

===Edging===
As the sheen of water begins to leave the surface, edging should begin. All edges of a slab that do not abut  another  structure  should  be  finished  with  an edger.  An  edger  dresses  corners  and rounds or bevels the concrete edges. Edging the slab helps prevent chipping at the corners and helps give the slab a finished appearance.

===Troweling===
If  a  dense,  smooth  finish  is  desired,  floating  must be   followed   by   steel   troweling . Troweling  should  begin  after  the  moisture  film  or sheen disappears from the floated surface and when the  concrete  has  hardened  enough  to  prevent  fine material  and  water  from  being  worked  to  the  surface. This  step  should  be  delayed  as  long  as  possible. Troweling  too  early  tends  to  produce  crazing  and  lack of durability. However, too long a delay in troweling results in a surface too hard to finish properly. The usual  tendency  is  to  start  to  trowel  too  soon. Troweling  should  leave  the  surface  smooth,  even,  and free  of  marks  and  ripples.  Spreading  dry  cement  on  a wet  surface  to  take  up  excess  water  is  not  a  good practice where a wear-resistant and durable surface is required.  Wet  spots  must  be  avoided  if  possible. When  they  do  occur,  however,  finishing  operations should  not  be  resumed  until  the  water  has  been absorbed,  has  evaporated,  or  has  been  mopped  up.

An unslippery, fine-textured surface can be obtained by troweling lightly over the surface with a circular motion immediately after the first regular troweling. In this process, the trowel is kept flat on the surface of the concrete.  Where a hard steel-troweled finish is  required, follow the first regular troweling by a second troweling. The second troweling  should begin after the concrete has become hard enough so that no mortar adheres to the  trowel, and a ringing sound is produced as the trowel passes over the surface.  During this  final troweling, the trowel should be tilted slightly and heavy pressure exerted to thoroughly compact the surface.  Hairline cracks are usually due to a concentration of water and extremely fine aggregates at the surface. This results from overworking the concrete  during finishing operations.  Such cracking is aggravated by drying and cooling too rapidly. Checks that develop before troweling can usually be closed by pounding the concrete with a hand float.

==8. Write a paragraph describing the behavior of cement; that is, its reaction to water, its adhesive qualities, how long it takes to set, etc.==
Adding water to Portland cement to form the water-cement paste that holds concrete together starts a chemical reaction that makes the paste into a bonding agent.  This reaction, called  hydration, produces a stone-like substance — the hardened cement paste.  Both the rate and degree of hydration, and the resulting strength of the final concrete, depend on the curing  process that follows placing and consolidating the plastic concrete.   Hydration continues indefinitely at a decreasing rate as long as the mixture contains water and the temperature conditions are favorable. Once the water is removed, hydration ceases and cannot be restarted. Curing is the period of time from consolidation to the point where the concrete reaches its  design strength. During this period, you must take certain steps to keep the concrete moist and as near 73°F (23°C) as practical. The properties of concrete, such as freeze and thaw resistance, strength, watertightness, wear resistance, and volume stability, cure or improve  with age as long as you maintain the moisture and temperature conditions favorable to continued hydration.  The length of time that you must protect concrete against moisture loss depends on the type of cement used, mix proportions, required strength, size and shape of the concrete mass, weather, and future exposure conditions.  The period can vary from a few days to a month or longer.  For most structural use, the curing period for cast-in-place concrete is usually 3 days to 2 weeks. This period depends on such conditions as temperature, cement type, mix proportions, and so forth.

== Overview ==

'''''Scourgify''''' is one of the cleaning charms, used to clean foreign material off surfaces.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], we see it a couple of times; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] uses it with limited results to clean [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]'s cage (she admits that she's not very good at that); and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] uses it to clean up the Stinksap that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|Mimbulus Mimbletonia]] has sprayed around the compartment of the Hogwarts Express. It is also used to &quot;wash out&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|a young Snape]]'s mouth in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

== Analysis ==

Scourgify seems to be limited to surfaces; it cannot restore spilled liquids to a container, only eliminating them. It also is not used to remove foreign matter from a container; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Evanesco|Evanesco]] is used for that – which may be why Tonks' attempt to clean Hedwig's cage, a container, does not succeed. There is also a charm [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tergeo|Tergeo]] that seems to be used for almost the same purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With many cameras, it can be difficult to get a good clear picture of a watch.  Many cameras will not focus close enough.  If that problem is solved, then the flash is likely to be too bright, and if you turn the flash off indoors, colors are likely to be incorrect.  
 Budget macro:  

A jeweler's loupe or similar magnifying lens held in front of the camera lens will allow the camera to focus closer.  On my camera a 2x or 3x works best for a whole watch, while a 10x is useful to highlight a watch part or a small area.  I temporarily attach the loupe with Velcro, so I can change loupes or take standard pictures. 

 Flash:

The easiest way to get good pictures is outdoors with natural light.  If that is not practical, you may be able to diffuse the flash enough to allow closeup pictures with flash.  I use several layers of crumpled watch tissue (Watch tissue is similar to gift wrap tissue, except pre-cut in 3&quot; squares) over the flash--Sometimes I tape them directly over the flash, other times I will sandwich the tissue between 2 small plastic condiment cups.  

 Other lighting:

Diffused lighting will typically mask scratches and similar flaws, while leaving markings clear.  Many photographers use a light tent--Some sort of translucent material covering the watch, with a small opening for the camera. Lights will be outside the tent.  This will produce extremely diffused light.  To control reflections, you may want a ring of dark material around the watch, just outside the camera's field of view

Be careful of the colors around the watch--I've had problems with silvertone watches looking gold when I take pictures at my watch bench. I blamed it on my fluorescent lights, so replaced one with an incandescent.  That helped a very little.  I discovered that the main problem was the cork base and backdrop I had been using.  Switching to green craft foam (what I had handy other than yellow) helped a lot. 


Sometimes you want to enhance flaws--In these cases, you will want direct light--Experiment with different angles to get the result you want.  I will use this for auction pictures, rather than describing the flaw's severity-I will find an angle that shows the flaw on the camera at approximately realistic levels and say &quot;Watch has a blister on the dial, see pics&quot; or something similar.

 Resolution:  

For web pictures, 640x480 (or 480x640) is usually enough for most purposes with careful framing.  If you want to show a particular detail, take a second close-up of just that detail, or crop a 640x480 rectangle.  

 Misc: 

If you take a batch of pictures by holding the camera sideways, and the camera doesn't auto-rotate, Windows XP can batch-rotate in Windows Explorer when in thumbnail mode.  Hold the ctrl button while clicking on each picture that needs to be rotated in the same way (you can also draw boxes to select multiple pictures) then right-click and select one of the rotate options.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Starting in 1949, Bulova used a simple date code for it's watches.  There will be a 2 character code.  The first character will be a letter indicating the decade:

A=1940's
L=50's
M=60's
N=70's
P=80's
T=90's

Earlier Bulovas used a cycle of symbols to indicate date, references

      <comment>/* The Believer's Charter */ fall in love with God</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous chapter, we learn about salvation, inner-peace. In this chapter, we will learn about a fulfilling, honorable life. Just after explaining The Straight Path, in [[s:Quran/6#151-154 | 6:153]], God mentions the righteous. In [[s:Quran/49#11-18 | 49:13]], God mentions that &quot;being righteous&quot; is the highest honor a human can get.

&lt;blockquote&gt;O mankind, We created you from a male and female, and We made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely, ''the most honourable among you in the sight of God is the most righteous''. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[s:Quran/2#177-182 | 2:177]], God explains that being righteous requires much more than just moral and wisdom:
# Believe in God and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets, 
# Give money out of love to the near relatives, and the orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer, and those who ask, and to free the slaves, and 
# Hold the contact-method, and 
# Contribute towards betterment; and 
# Keep their pledges when they make a pledge, 
# Patient in the face of good and bad and when in despair. 

In the previous chapter, God offered us The Assenter's Charter, where we need to believe only in God, believe in the Last Day and do good according to The Moral Criterion. We don't have to believe in Quran nor Muhammad, nor have to do any religious rituals as far as this charter is concerned. Now suddenly, we need to believe in the Angels, the Scripture and the Prophets and do rituals, such as the contact-method and paying the betterment. This is clearly a new charter offered by God.

These are not just physical rituals. To achieve righteousness, one should be focus and determined. And not like the people described by God as:
# Totally heedless of their contact-method in [[s:Quran/107 | 107:5-7]]
# Clueless, turning towards the east and the west [[s:Quran/2#177-182 | 2:177]]

=== The Believer's Charter ===

In [[s:Quran/8#1-10 | 8:2-3]], this new charter is not offered for the entire humankind, but only for the believers. In Modern Islam, believers is known as Muslim. But, the way that hearts trembles, as described in the verse, give us a hint that a true believer is a person who fall in love with God.
# When God is mentioned, their hearts reverence; and 
# When His revelations are recited to them, it increases their faith; and
# They put their trust in their Lord.
# They hold the contact-method, and 
# from Our provisions to them they spend.

The benefit of this charter is the believer will become a real believer that will receive: 
# Grades with their Lord and 
# A forgiveness and 
# A generous provision.

We will call it the Believer's charter. Another proof, that this charter is not for everybody is in [[s:Quran/49#11-18 | 49:14-15]]. Here, God refuses one person to call himself a believer. Finally, God only allow him to call himself an assenter. In other words, he pacts only The Assenter's Charter with God, but not the Believer's charter yet.

Unlike The Assenter's Charter that understandable with common sense, the Believer's charter does not. Everything in this charter are sacrifice for the love of God. This personal and direct bonding with God cannot be explained with common sense, not to mention finding the right words to describe it. For example doing religious pilgrimage requires enormous sacrifice of time and material, physically and emotionally. Such as by going to a long travel to a desert country not knowing to be able to return to the family left behind. That is why it start with &quot;When God is mentioned, their hearts reverence&quot;. However, this is a re-enforcing cycle. The more sacrifice you make, the tighter your bond to God, which in turn encourage you to sacrifice more.

In the Modern Islam, a person converts into Islam religion by uttering two confession. The first confession makes him an assenter to God (i.e. not a dissenter). The second one makes him a believer to God's Book and Prophet. With these two confessions, a person pacts both The Assenter's Charter and the Believer's charter with God at the same time.

The diagram below illustrates human grades, from the highest to the lowest:
{|
|- bgcolor=green
| Real believer
|- bgcolor=yellow
| Assenter
|- bgcolor=red
| Wicked/Criminal/Dissenter
|}

Please do not confuse the terms Real Believers and Believers. A true believer is a believer, while a believer is not always the true believer. Righteous and Criminal are a general classification mentioned in [[s:Quran/19#83-98 | Koran 19:85]]. In the Modern Islam, the term believer is synonym of the term Muslim, the follower of Muhammad. Real believer is the highest rank possible for Moslem, while dissenter, a false believer, is the lowest rank possible. A false believer are either hypocrite or bigot Moslem. 

Hypocrites are Muslims who do The Believer's Charter while skipping some or all of The Assenter charters. For example, he could prays five times a day and fasts during the Ramadhan, but he is a corrupt business man or a corrupt government employee. So, he is skippling the Fairness part of The Straight Path, which is part of The Assenter's Charter. Bigots are Muslims who assumes that he, his scholar or his religious institution are partners of God. For example, a bigots make a various prohibitions such as smoking or shaving beard as a sacred prohibition sanctioned by God. See the previous chapter for more info.

What happens to Muslims that does not fully practicing The Believer's Charter while still practicing The Assenter charters? The society knows them as non-practicing Muslims. Perhaps, we can offer them a better name. We can call them as Muslim Apprentice. 

We can spot Moslem Apprentice by the following signs:
# The women do not cover their hair and the men shave their beards
# They eat meat that has been slaughtered without mentioning the name of Allah
# They cannot recite nor understand the Arabic Koran
# They never shows up or show up late for the weekly prayer
# They never pause from work for the five-times-daily prayer
# They do not have the mark of prostration in their forehead

Please note, that those signs are not required as long as The Assenter charter is concerned, nor part of Sacred Prohibitions from God. They are still our brothers and sisters as long as they still believe in the Prophet Muhammad. However, their love and loyalty to the Prophet is not high enough. They cannot be trusted for high level religious affair, such as teaching, defending, promoting the religion or leading a religious gathering or ceremony. On the other hand, they need to be given a lot of love and encouragement, and not hate and judgement.

=== The Contact-Method ===

Holding the contact-method is part of Believer's Charter. The contact-method has specific goals:
# Remembering God ([[s:Quran/20#1-24 | 20:14]])
# Prohibiting evil and vice ([[s:Quran/29#45-51 | 29:45]])
There is a third goal that may be related. It is glorifying God.

The [[s:Quran/11#84-95 | 11:84-87]] is the proof that contact-method is a tool to prohibit evil and vice. Here the people of Median questioned whether the contact-method ordered Shu'ayb to prevent corruptions in business dealing.

Unfortunately, these two goals are not automatic. In [[s:Quran/107 | 107:4-7]], there are cases of people doing the contact-method but failing to reach its specific goals, because:
# His is totally heedless 
# They only want to be seen
# And they deter from helping others

This book suggests that the secret to have an effective contact-prayer is to have an activity during or after the contact-method aimed to reach its goals. Such activities might include:
* Doing it together with family
* Reciting God's Message
* Evaluating its implementation

In the Modern Islam, the contact-method is the most important activity. But in [[s:Quran/29#45-51 | 29:45]], it is what you do after the contact method that is more and the most important. This activity is called remembering God. In [[s:Quran/3#190-200 | 3:191 ]], it is important because it is done continuously during standing, sitting and resting, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

We learn from the previous chapter that remembering God, includes remembering His commandments during every single activities in our life. Remembering God is the last defense against the devil. In [[s:Quran/5#87-93 | 5:91]], we can witness that intoxicants and gambling is the most powerful weapons used by the devil to cause strife between people and repel them from remembering God.

=== The Development ===

Spending is part of Believer's charter. In various part of Koran, it is referred as the development. We cannot find any practical detail about it in Koran. But in [[s:Quran/9#100-110 | 9:103]], the development is detailed as either charity or spending. So, if we collects all details about both charity and spending, we conclude that it is to bring welfare benefit to the women, your family, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, the handicap, those who work to collect them, those whose hearts have been united, to free slaves, those in debt, in the cause of God, and the wayfarer.

The targets of charity and gift are detailed in [[s:Quran/2#211-216 | 2:215]], [[s:Quran/9#60-66 | 9:60]], and [[s:Quran/4#1-10 | 4:4]].

But how much to spend? According to [[s:Quran/2#217-221 | 2:219]] it is the excess of wealth. It means, it wont put you in a great burden. 

To be effective, according to [[s:Quran/2#261-266 | 2:262-263]] a gift should not be followed with either insult or harm.

=== The Self-Restraint ===

In [[s:Quran/2#183-188 | 2:183]], fasting is decreed for the believers. It also mentions that the purpose of fasting is to be righteous.

In [[s:Quran/2#183-188 | 2:187]], this purpose can be achieved by self-restraint ourselves from lower passions, such eating, drinking and sex and into higher aspiration of righteous.

In various verses such as [[s:Quran/4#92-96 | 4:92]], the fasting can be used as a tool to take control of ourselves after making a serious mistake.

=== The Visit ===

In [[s:Quran/22#26-33 | 22:27]], the visit to the Abraham's sanctuary is offered to the entire mankind. In [[s:Quran/22#26-33 | 22:28]], the purpose of this visit to witness the benefits for themselves. 

In [[s:Quran/22#26-33 | 22:31-33]], to take the full benefit of the visit, you should be at least a monotheist, and preferably a believer.

The effective visit is the one that allow people to observe their benefits. Their benefits is detailed in [[s:Quran/3#92-101 | 3:96-97]]. There also some details on how to reach the benefits in [[s:Quran/2#197-210 | 2:197-200]]

== Talk Back ==
Have you ever experience a situation when your heart is pumping when somebody special is near? 
Or when your heart becomes empty when she/he is away? 
Have you seen such phenomenon happening on a Moslem when the name of God is mentioned?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;ISLAM&quot; is derived from the Arabic root salaama peace, purity, submission and obedience. In the religious sense, Islam means submission to the will of God and obedience to His law.

This book is about Modern Islam, a 1.5 millennium old religion originating in the Middle East. There was an Ancient Islam, which is explained in other parts of this book. The Ancient Islam is inclusive, religion-neutral and guarantees equal salvation to the followers of Judaism and Christianity as well, anyone who trusts in God and acts accordingly. This is based on the Holy Book of Islam, [[s:Quran/2#62-71 | Quran 2:62]] or [[s:Quran/5#67-77 | Quran 5:69]].

Islam as a religion consists of Faith (Aqidah), Law (Sharia) and Attitude (Akhlaq). The first two regulates the Six Articles of Faith and Five Pillars. The later and the most important of all is remembering God continuously, 24 hour per day. We discuss the public part of Law in another chapter, [[../Legislation/]].

== Articles of Faith ==

First, the six principles of beliefs start this book from the inner soul of a believer. This chapter tries to present a vivid vision on what results you will get from God if you succeed in becoming the true believer. This chapter also discusses about things that happen before this life, the hidden and future after life. &lt;!-- COMMENT This chapter has no direct impact on Muslim life, but it gives more understanding on how things works behind the curtain and where are we going in this life.--&gt;

'''Why Believe?

Time is precious. &quot;Time is money&quot; might best express it. So, why should we believe on some invisible things and doing some weird rituals like Muslims do? We are busy people.

In [[s:Quran 103:1 | Chapter 103]], The Quran address this &quot;busy&quot; people straight to the point.

''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;By time. &lt;br&gt;
''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The human is indeed in loss. &lt;br&gt;
''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Except those who believe, do good works, support one another with the truth, and support one another with perseverance.

The Quran argues that by becoming a true believer, humans can reach its full potential, by directing him/her resources more effectively and efficiently to achieve what is the most precious for him/her. This book tries to explore The Quran's unique approach to the Time and Resource management issue through Faith, Good Works, Collaboration and Perseverance.

'''What to Believe?

This book argues that belief in God and the Final Justice are something natural for humans. The book [[Quranic Law of Nature]] shows to the great length how natural it is. But the true believers do not stop on that point. True believers also believe in God's Books, Prophets, Angels, Divine Guidance and Predestination. 

=== Allah, the One and Only God ===
A Muslim believes in ONE GOD, Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, Creator and Provider. God has neither father nor mother, neither sons nor was He fathered. None equal to Him. He is God of all mankind, not of a special tribe or race.

God is High and Supreme but He is very near to the pious thoughtful believers; He answers their prayers and helps them. He loves the people who love Him and forgives their sins. He gives them peace, happiness, knowledge and success. God is the Loving and the Provider, the Generous, and the Benevolent, the Rich and the Independent, the Forgiving and the Clement, the Patient and the Appreciative, the Unique and the Protector, the Judge and the Peace. God's attributes are mentioned in the Quran.

God creates in humanity the mind to understand, the soul and conscience to be good and righteous, the feelings and sentiments to be kind and humane. If we try to count His favors upon us, we cannot, because they are countless. In return for all the great favors and mercy, God does not need anything from us, because He is Needless and Independent. God asks us to know Him, to love Him and to enforce His law for our benefit and our own good.

=== Messengers and Prophets of God ===
A Muslim believes in all the Messengers and Prophets of God without any discrimination. All messengers were mortals, human beings, endowed with Divine revelations and appointed by God to teach mankind. The Holy Quran mentions the names of 25 messengers and prophets and states that there are others. These include Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. Their message might look different, but the core message is similar. The miracles of the prophets are somehow dependent on the era they were chosen. 

Moses had miracles to challenge the magicians, because magic was very popular in his era. At the time when Jesus was chosen, medicine and healing was popular, so his miracles was mainly related to giving life to the dead or making a statue come alive. Corrupt poetry was very popular when Muhammad was chosen. Muslims believe that Muhammad’s miracle is the holy Quran, and is the direct book of God. 

The book itself challenges people in many ways, and tells them they can not bring a verse, or a sura like Quran. God tells the humankind that he protects Quran from being corrupted, and has saved it until now without any corruption.

=== Revelations and the Quran ===
A Muslim believes in all scriptures and revelations of God, as they were complete and in their original versions. Allah, the Creator, has not left man without guidance for the conduct of his life. Revelations were given to guide the people to the right path of Allah and sent down to selected people, the prophets and messengers, to convey it to their fellow men.

The message of all the prophet and messengers is the same. They all asked the people of their time to obey and worship Allah and none other. Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad who were revealed their own book of Allah, were sent at different times to bring back straying human beings from deviation to the right course.

The Quran is the sacred book of the Muslims. It is the last book of guidance from Allah, sent down to Muhammad, peace be upon him, through the angel Jibraeel (Gabriel). Every word of it is the word of Allah. It was revealed over a period of 23 years in the Arabic language. It contains 114 Surahs (chapters) and over 6000 verses.

The Quran deals with man and his ultimate goal in life. Its teachings cover all areas of this life and the life after death. It contains principles, doctrines and directions for every sphere of human life. The theme of the Quran broadly consists of three fundamental ideas: Oneness of Allah, Prophethood and life after death. The success of human beings on this earth and in the life hereafter depends on obedience to the Quran teaching.

The Quran is unrivalled in its recording and preservation. The astonishing fact about this book of Allah is that it has remained unchanged even to a dot over the past fourteen hundred years. No scholar has questioned the fact that the Quran today is the same as it was revealed. Muslims till today memorize the Quran word by word as a whole or in part. Today, the Quran is the only authentic and complete book of Allah. Allah is protecting it from being lost, corrupted or concealed.

=== The Angels ===
There are purely spiritual and splendid beings created by Allah. They require no food or drink or sleep. They have neither physical desires nor material needs. Angels spend their time in the service of Allah. Each is charged with a certain duty. Angels cannot be seen by the naked eyes. Knowledge and the truth are not entirely confined to sensory knowledge or sensory perception alone.Angels have been created from 'nur' which means light.We do not know the exact number of angels from the holy Quran or authentic hadiths.

=== The Day of Judgment ===
A Muslim believes in the Day of the Judgment. This world as we know it will come to an end, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. On that day, all men and women from Adam to the last person will be resurrected from the state of death for judgment. Everything we do, say, make, intends and thinks are accounted for and kept in accurate records. They are brought up on the Day of Judgment.

One who believes in life after death is not expected to behave against the Will of Allah. He will always bear in mind that Allah is watching all his actions and the angels are recording them.

People with good records will be generously rewarded and warmly welcomed to Allah's Heaven. People with bad records will be fairly punished and cast into Hell. People who killed other people will go to Hell, because their records are bad. They killed people who were created by Allah. The real nature of Heaven and Hell are known to Allah only, but they are described by Allah in man's familiar terms in the Quran.

If some good deeds are seen not to get full appreciation and credit in this life, they will receive full compensation and be widely acknowledged on the Day of Judgment. If some people who commit sins, neglect Allah and indulge in immoral activities, seem superficially successful and prosperous in this life, absolute justice will be done to them on the Day of Judgment. The time of the Day of Judgment is only known to Allah and Allah alone.

=== Qadaa and Qadar ===
A Muslim believes in Qadaa and Qadar which relate to the ultimate power of Allah. Qadaa and Qadar mean the Timeless Knowledge of Allah and His power to plan and execute His plans. Allah is not indifferent to this world nor is He neutral to it. It implies that everything on this earth originates from the one and only Creator who is also the Sustainer and the Sole Source of guidance.

Allah is Wise, Just, and Loving, and whatever He does must have a good motive, although we may fail sometimes to understand it fully. We should have strong faith in Allah and accept whatever He does because our knowledge is limited and our thinking is based on individual consideration, whereas His knowledge is limitless and He plans on a universal basis. Man should think, plan and make sound choices, but if things do not happen the way he wants, he should not lose faith and surrender himself to mental strains or shattering worries.

== Pillars of Islam ==
Second, the five pillars of Islam give you the framework that gives schedule, controls and state of mind necessaries to prepare you into the real actions. There are several schools in Islam about this study notably Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Maliki. &lt;!-- COMMENT This chapter has indirect impact in Muslim life. It allows Muslim to grab a strong rope with His Creator and weapon to conquer his lower passion to pursue higher aspiration and ready for any challenge in this life--&gt;

=== Witnessing (Shahada) ===
That Allah is one and Muhammad is His Messenger

This statement of faith must be declared publicly. It should be a genuine belief which includes all the above articles of faith. The witnessing of the Oneness of Allah is the rejection of any form of deity other than Allah, and the witnessing that Muhammad is His Messenger is the acceptance of him being chosen by Allah to convey His message of Islam to all humanity and to deliver it from the darkness of ignorance into the light of belief in, and knowledge of, the Creator. The statement of Shahada in Arabic is:

 Ashhadu Alla Ilaha Illa Allah Wa Ashhadu Anna Muhammad Rasulu Allah

An English translation would be:

I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Messenger

=== Prayer (Salah) ===
Praying to the Creator on a daily basis is the best way to cultivate in a man a sound personality and to actualize his aspiration. Allah does not need man's prayer because He is free of all needs. Prayer is for our immeasurable benefit, and the blessings are beyond imagination.

In prayer, every muscle of the body joins the soul and the mind in the worship and glory of Allah. Prayer is an act of worship. It is a matchless and unprecedented formula of intellectual meditation and spiritual devotion, of moral elevation and physical exercise, all combined.

Offering of prayers is obligatory upon every Muslim male and female who is sane, mature and in the case of women free from menstruation and confinement due to child birth. Requirements of prayer: performing of ablution (Vozu), purity of the whole body, clothes and ground used for prayer, dressing properly and having the intention and facing the Qiblah (the direction of the Ka'bah at Mecca).

Obligatory prayers: Five daily prayers, the Friday's noon congregation prayer and the funeral prayer. Times of obligatory prayers:

# Early morning: After dawn and before sunrise.
# Noon: After the sun begins to decline from its zenith until it is about midway on its course to set.
# Mid-afternoon: After the expiration of the noon prayer time until sunset.
# Sunset: Immediately after sunset until the red glow in the western horizon disappears.
# Evening: After the expiration of the sunset prayer until dawn. 

Highly recommended prayer:Those accompanying the obligatory prayer and the two great festival prayers.

Optional prayer:Voluntary prayer during the day and night.

Prayer should be offered in its due time, unless there is a reasonable excuse. Delayed obligatory prayers must be made up. In addition to the prescribed prayer, a Muslim expresses gratitude to God and appreciation of His favours and asks for His mercy all the time. Especially at times of, for example, childbirth, marriage, going to or rising from bed, leaving and returning to his home, starting a journey or entering a city, riding or driving, before or after eating or drinking, harvesting, visiting graveyards and at time of distress and sickness (see [[#Remembering God | Remembering God]]).

=== Obligatory Charity (Zakah) ===
Obligatory charity giving is an act of worship and spiritual investment. The literal meaning of Zakah is purity and it refers to the annual amount in kind or coin which a Muslim with means must distribute among the rightful beneficiaries. Zakah does not only purify the property of the contributor but also purifies his heart from selfishness and greed. It also purifies the heart of the recipient from envy and jealousy, from hatred and uneasiness and it fosters instead good-will and warm wishes for the contributors.

Zakah has a deep humanitarian and social-political value; for example, it frees society from class welfare, from ill feelings and distrust and from corruption. Although Islam does not hinder private enterprise or condemn private possession, it does not tolerate selfish and greedy capitalism. Islam adopts a moderate but positive and effective course between individual and society, between the citizen and the state, between capitalism and socialism, between materialism and spiritualism.

Zakah is paid on the net balance after paying personal expenses, family expenses, due credits, taxes, etc. Every Muslim male or female who at the end of the year is in possession of the equivalent of 85 grams of gold (approx. $1400 in 1990) or more in cash or articles of trade, must give Zakah at the minimum rate of 2.5%. Taxes paid to government do not substitute for this religious duty. The contributor should not seek pride or fame but if disclosing his name and his contribution is likely to encourage others, it is acceptable to do so.

The recipients of Zakah are: the poor, the needy, the new Muslim converts, the Muslim prisoners of war (to liberate them), Muslims in debt, employees appointed to collect Zakah, Muslims in service of research or study or propagation of Islam, and wayfarers who are foreigners in need of help.

Note the obligatory nature of Zakah; it is required. Muslims can also go above and beyond what they pay as Zakah, in which case the offering is a strictly voluntary charity (sadaqa).

=== Fasting (Sawm) ===
Fasting is abstaining completely from eating, drinking, intimate sexual contacts and smoking from the break of dawn till sunset. It is a matchless Islamic institution which teaches man the principle of sincere love to God. Fasting teaches man a creative sense of hope, devotion, patience, unselfishness, moderation, willpower, wise saving, sound budgeting, mature adaptability, healthy survival, discipline, spirit of social belonging, unity and brotherhood.

Obligatory fasting is done once a year for the period of the month of Ramadan; the ninth month of the Islamic year. Recommended fasting includes every Monday and Thursday of every week, three days in the middle of each Islamic month, six days after Ramadan following the Feast Day and a few days of the two months before Ramadan.  But usually it is done on everyday in the month of Ramadan in India, this is up to my knowledge. Fasting of Ramadan is a worship act which is obligatory on every adult Muslim, male or female if he/she is mentally and physically fit and not on a journey. Exceptions: women during their period of menstruation and while nursing their child, and also in case of travel and sickness for both men and women.

=== The Pilgrimage (Hajj) ===
It is a pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in a lifetime and it is obligatory upon every Muslim male and female who is mentally, physically and financially fit. It is the largest annual convention of faith on earth (in 1989: 2.5 million). Peace is the dominant theme. Peace with Allah, with one's soul, with one another, with all living creatures. To disturb the peace of anyone or any creature in any shape or form is strictly prohibited.

Muslims from all walks of life, from every corner of the globe assemble in Mecca in response to the call of Allah. There is no royalty, but there is loyalty of all to Allah, the Creator. It is to commemorate the Divine rituals observed by the Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael, who were the first pilgrims to the house of Allah on earth: the Ka'bah. It is also to remember the great assembly of the Day of Judgment when people will stand equal before Allah.

Muslims go to Mecca to glorify Allah, not to worship a man. The visit to the tomb of Prophet Muhammad at Madena is highly recommended but not essential in making the Hajj valid and complete.

== Remembering God ==
Third, The Remembering God (Zikr Allah), is the real actions you need to do continuously in your life 24 hour per day to be the true believer. &lt;!-- COMMENT This is the life. It should be the hallmark of each Muslim, such as trustworthy, humble, family matters and peaceful--&gt;

=== The purpose of life ===
A Muslim believes that the purpose of life is to worship Allah. Worshipping Allah does not mean we spend our entire lives in constant seclusion and absolute meditation. To worship Allah is to live life according to His commands, not to run away from it. To worship Allah is to know Him, to love Him, to obey His commands, to enforce His laws in every aspect of life, to serve His cause by doing right and shunning evil and to be just to Him, to ourselves and to our fellow human beings.

=== Status of Human Beings ===
A Muslim believes that human beings enjoy an especially high ranking status in the hierarchy of all known creatures. Man and woman occupy this distinguished position because they alone are gifted with rational faculties and spiritual aspirations as well as powers of action. Man and woman are not a condemned race from birth to death, but dignified beings potentially capable of good and noble achievements.

A Muslim also believes that every person is born Muslim. Every person is endowed by Allah with the spiritual potential and intellectual inclination that can make him a good Muslim. Every person's birth takes place according to the will of Allah in realization of His plans and in submission to His commands. Every person is born FREE FROM SIN. When the person reaches the age of maturity and if he is sane, he becomes accountable for all his deeds and intentions. Man is free from sin until he commits sin. There is no inherited sin, and no original sin. Adam committed the first sin, but he prayed to Allah for pardon and Allah granted Adam pardon.

=== Salvation ===
A Muslim believes that man must work out his salvation through the guidance of Allah. No one can act on behalf of another or intercede between him and Allah. In order to obtain salvation, a person must combine faith and action, belief and practice. Faith without doing good deeds is as insufficient as doing good deeds without faith.

Also, a Muslim believes that Allah does not hold any person responsible until he has shown him the Right Way. If people do not know and have no way of knowing about Islam, they will not be responsible for failing to be Muslim. Every Muslim must preach Islam in words and action.

=== Acceptance of Faith ===
A Muslim believes that faith is not complete when it is followed blindly or accepted unquestioningly. Man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty. Islam ensures freedom to believe and forbids compulsion in religion (one of the oldest synagogues and one of the oldest churches in the world are in Muslim countries).

A Muslim believes that the Quran is the word of Allah revealed to prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. The Quran was revealed from Allah on various occasions to answer questions, solve problems, and settle disputes and to be man's best guide to the truth. The Quran was revealed in Arabic and it is still in its original and complete Arabic version today. It is memorized by millions.

A Muslim also believes in a clear distinction between the Quran and the Traditions (called Hadiths) of the Prophet Muhammad. Whereas, the Quran is the word of Allah, the Traditions of Prophet Muhammad (hadiths - i.e. his teachings, sayings, and actions) are the practical interpretations of the Quran. Both the Quran and the Hadiths of Prophet Muhammad are the primary sources of knowledge in Islam.

=== The Straight Path ===
This part will explain The Straight Path as understood in [[Islam Way of Life]]. According to the Islam Way of Life, the straight path is keeping the moral values of Equality, Family, Humanity, Fairness and Integrity.

== One Day in Muslim Life ==
Meet Khadijah! She is a twenty-year old Muslimah. Currently, she is studying in France, who bans headscarf in public school. Her home country, Turkey, bans the headscarf years earlier before France. Most of the time, she covers her head, except at school and at home. She feels comfortable and confidence with it. What is important for her is dress modestly, so it bring respect from the boys and they did not disturb her.

Khadijah is a complete opposite of her brother, Khidr, who spent most of his time in the mosque. For her, Islam is the most pure and flexible form of religion that strengthen her soul and enhance her productivity. She believes that the problem in the Muslim world today, such as poverty and lack of education is because of lack of commitment. The leaders do not commit to their people, the fathers do not commit to their children future, even her friends often have problems keeping their promises or deciding something even for themselves.

=== Reading the Quran ===
She wakes up at 5 a.m. in the morning. As usual, she starts her day with a tahajud prayer. The fresh water helps her to wake up fully. The standing and bowing doubles as her morning stretch.

Normally, she would start either listening or reciting Quran. The rhythm of Quran calms her, massages her soul. But, from time-to-time she tries to understand the translations to get some inspiration from her Creator. Some verses in Quran are quite practical, but some other verses require deep understanding and may contain multiple valid meanings. She understands this and only focuses on practical verses and uses her heart for the other verses. It is a great way to start a day. After reading the Quran, normally she feels ready for anything that could happens today. 

But, today is special. She and her friends invite decided for Online Quran Study. Normally, she does it through internet mailing-list. But, today they choose to chat about it, before the Early-morning prayer.

The sound of Adzan, calling for prayer, breaks their chat. The sound came from the prayer-time software installed in one of their computer. The sound thrills their heart. Some of them listen, some of them leave to do the preparatory washing. 

Once the Adzan stop, they continue chatting because the chat was almost finished. After saying goodbye, Khadijah perform the Early-morning prayer.

=== Trustworthy ===
Today’s breakfast is cereals and orange juice. Even then, she never forgets to mention the God's name before eating. While eating, her eyes wander around her kitchen and notice that the sink was blocked. It is still early in the morning, so she writes in her agenda to call her landlord to fix it.

God told her to keep her commitments. She has several lists in her agenda to help her remembers all commitments that she make to her self or other people. The blocked sink is an urgent one, but she can only call her landlord during office hour. Therefore, she writes the task in her &quot;at office&quot; task list. Similarly, when she remembers to bring something from home, she write the task in her &quot;at home&quot; list while she is in the office. Each time, she needs to buy something, she write it in her &quot;at shopping&quot; list first. To keep her commitments under a manageable number, she drop, do it now or delegate it as much as possible.

The Prophet Muhammad pbuh. was known as &quot;Al-Amin&quot; or The Trustworthy in his community. She believes that if someone dares to claim that he or she is the follower of Muhammad pbuh., then the first thing she or he should follow is how the Prophet manages his commitments. Don't be surprise if she also keeps track of other people commitment to her. For example, if the landlord promises to fix the sink, she will note it in her &quot;at people&quot; list. If the landlord forgets, she will help him to remember.

She also keeps track her schedule and projects. So, when one of her relatives ask her whether she can come to help this weekend, she can answer it quickly yes, no or propose alternative time or other person to help. She believes that undecided commitment is the second worst than a broken commitment. It burdens everybody and &quot;Make me getting old faster&quot;, she jokes. 

Also when she knows in advance that she will not be able make a commitment, she informs the other party as soon as possible. A renegotiated commitment is not a broken one. Last but not least, she never makes a commitment without saying, &quot;God Willing, I will do that&quot;. Because, she never knows what would happens tomorrow, but God decides it.

As typical women, she likes to shop. Especially if there is something new or discounted. Therefore she likes to read offers. Each time she receive an offers, she quickly decide whether to trash it, put it in her &quot;at reading&quot; box to read it later or if she has interest, note in her calendar when the offer expires. Her desk is clean most of the time, so is her mind. Her friends always wonder why she could be so productive and happy with so many activities and commitments.

Of course, she also keeps the list of summary of moral codes and wisdoms from sura Al-An'aam and Al-Isra. See [[#Remembering God | Remembering God]] above. This is her commitments to God, she does not want to forget.

=== Prayers ===
She tries to keep her prayer short and on time. Even in such a short she does it in full concentration. When she stands for the prayer, she tries to imagine God in front of her, heaven on her right and hell on her left. That way she can forget whatever is going on in this temporarily world. Once she finishes her praying, she feels that she is ready for anything. When her forehead touch the ground, the gravity refreshes the blood presure in her brain. She feels humbleness in front of The Almighty.

And during the extreme winter or summer time she combines two prayers in one go. The praying time during these two extreme is totally impractical. During the extreme summer, the night prayer and early morning prayer are too close to each other giving her no time to sleep. During the extreme winter, the noon, afternoon and evening prayer are too close to each other, giving her no time to work.

For her, what she does in-between prayers that are important. Remember that to do the prayer we need to be in a clean condition? She tries to be in clean condition all the time. When she breaks this condition, such as coming from the toilet, she tries to take another abdulation as soon as possible. She believes that clean and fresh body helps to clean her mind, her acts and her talks all the time. The water on her skins reminds her that God watch her all the time on every single acts, talks and intention she makes.

Unlike typical Muslimah from Arabian countries who prefers to pray at home, she likes to go to the mosque. Except during Friday noon prayer when so many Muslim men crowd the mosque for Friday gathering. In the mosque, she often meets Muslimah from Asian countries that also likes to go to the mosque. She prays anywhere she could, at her office, at the parking or in a janitor room.

=== Charity ===
For her, charity has a broad meaning. Prophet Muhammad pbuh. once said that smile is also a charity. Charity for her means solidarity and empathy. She learns from her Online Quran Study that the Koran wants her to take cares of her relatives first before the rest of the world. In her agenda there are entries like &quot;One month since I call my auntie in Turkey&quot;. That way she can regularly call and find out whether her relatives need her help. If she cannot helps, at least she can sooth them or ask somebody else to help.

For her solidarity starts early:&lt;br&gt;
First, she should be honest on her work, so she is not a burden to the society such as the corrupts and criminals. One day she bought a discount train ticket, but can only be used after 9 a.m. Her friend ask her, why she let the 8:55 trains away? She said that she does not want God to kick her out of heaven just because of this stupid 2 Euro ticket. &lt;br&gt;
Second, she should not spend money on unnecessary things and tries to re-use a lot. Remember that she tries to keep track everything, so she knows where to buy, why and when efficiently. She also shares and gives away some items she is not using for friends who need it. &lt;br&gt;
Third, she keeps up with her relatives and her neighborhood whether her helps is needed. Because some people does not ask repeatedly or even asked for help when they need it.

=== Trusting God ===
When she goes to sleep, she prays to God that her life and her death are belonging to God. Salvation is a condition of no fears and no regrets. With this peace in her mind, she can rest and ready for another day of her life tomorrow. If there is still something in her mind, she writes it down to a paper and off her mind and tries to rest.
She prays to God to grant her wealth, so she can be as rich as Khadijah, the Prophet first wife. She also asks a loving husband as handsome as the Prophet and life happily ever after during her life in this world. She has a firm believe that God will grant her wish or replace it with something better. Sweet dream.

== One Year in Muslim Life ==
Khidr is Khadijah's older brother. Unlike his sister, he has no interest of getting rich. He chooses simple life with less commitments and devout more time at the mosque glorying God and learns the Books of older Scholar of Islam. He spent sometime in jail during his struggle with his friends to turn his country back into an Islamic State.

Because he does not like to see so much violence and hatred, he later joins a [[w:tarika | tarika]]. He believes peace is the true meaning of Islam and the greater jihad is to conquer our own soul. He also believes that true Islam can only be learned through scholarship and not from friends or by reading the Quran yourself, like what he did before he went to jail.

He spends some time in Syria, just to learn Islam from a knowledgeable scholar. Unlike Iran or Saudi Arabia follows only one version of Islam, Syria has both. This phenomenon is reflected in Khidr respects on what other people believes. People turn to him for help and spiritual cure. He never says no and always can see the bright side of even the worst situation.

=== Muharram ===
Of much interest to us Muslims these days should be the fasting of the 9th and the 10th of Muharram. The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) said about the voluntary fasting on the Day of Aashooraa: &quot;It expiates the sins of the preceding year.&quot; (Muslim)

&quot;The day of Aashooraa was the day when Moosa and his men got freedom from the hands of the Pharaoh and it was in the sacred memory of this great event that the Muslims observed voluntary fasting. The idea underlying this is to stress the affinity amongst the messengers of Allah and to show that religious devotion is a constant flow from one generation to another. The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) came not to abrogate all the earlier religious practices but to codify and preserve them for all times to come in ideal forms.&quot;

=== Maulid ===
Prophet Muhammad pbuh. was born on 12 Rabi Al-Awaal. We can use this moment to gather and reflects of his path.

=== Ramadhan ===
Ramadhan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslims consider this whole month as a blessed month. They fast during the days of this month and make special prayers at night. People also give more charity and do extra righteous deeds. Also, in this Holy Month, The Prophet Muhammad received the first revelation of Al-Qur'an. Ramadhan is the month of celebration as well as the month of discipline and self-control. Muslims always wait for the first day of Ramadhan to come.  

The Night of Power is a very important occasion in Islam. Everyone is asked to live it and to enjoy it. This Night is a night of Mercy, a night of Blessing, a night of Peace and a night of Guidance. It is a night of Unification between the finite world of ours and the Infinite Universe of the Unseen.

Anyone who is interested in attaining the Mercy of Allah will strive very hard to look for the Night of Power. Anyone who is interested in receiving the blessings of Allah on the Blessed Night will work very hard to enjoy the Night of Power. Anyone who is interested in attaining peace of mind, peace of body and peace in society, he has to look for this Night and to live it.

At the conclusion of the month of Ramadhan, on the first day of the 10th month of Islamic lunar calendar, Muslims all over the world celebrate Eidul Fitr. This is one of two main festivals of Islam.

The ceremony of Eidul Fitr starts early morning with a worship service. This service is generally held in a large open place and is attended by thousands of Muslims. After the prayer, a short sermon was delivered and then the people greet each other. The rest of the ceremonies are held generally privately with families and friends.

The significance of Eid is that it is the day of thanksgiving to Allah that He gave the opportunity to Muslims to benefit from and enjoy the blessing of the month of Ramadhan.

=== Eidu al-Adha ===
Following the day of Hajj or Pilgrimage (9th of Thw al-Hijjah), it comes the Eidul Adha day. It begins from the 10th of the 12th month of Islamic lunar calendar. This is the second main annual festival in Islam. On this day, like on the Eidul Fitr celebration, festivities begin with a prayer service held in an open place in the morning of the first day. This prayer is usually attended by a large number of Muslims. Since this festival occurs immediately after the Day of Pilgrimage, those who go to make pilgrimage celebrate it in Mina, near Makkah. Other Muslims around the world also join with the pilgrims in their joy and thanksgiving.

One of the significances of Eidul Adha is that it is a time of sacrifice. Muslims commemorate Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice everything for Allah including his beloved son, Ismael. Since Allah gave Prophet Abraham a lamb to sacrifice instead of sacrificing his son, Muslims also offer the sacrifice of animals. The sacrifice can be done after the prayer on the 10th until 12th day of Thw al-Hijjah month before sunset. The meat of the animals is given to needy people and friends and a portion of it is also kept for one's own consumption. Often people cook this meat during holidays, make feasts and enjoy the celebration.

== Muslim Family ==
Khadijah and Khidr are children from Imron and Hana family. This is just a fictional story and has nothing to do with people with similar name mentioned in the Quran. 

=== Household Supports ===
As in typical Muslim family, Imron is the bread whiner for the family and Hana is the stay at home mom. In Islam, it is the husband who should give the dowry to his bride. A dowry is normally significant financially. Therefore sometimes, it came from the male family collectively. This prevents tragic phenomenon like selective-abortion in India, where female fetus is the primary target, because in India, it is the female who should pay for the dowry. 

The dowry is not considered as buying a woman because it goes directly to the bride and not to her father. This is handy when the new family face a financial difficulty, she can help. Or when she asks for a divorce, she should return the dowry. In the western world, woman sometimes face dilemma between missing her children often or miss the money. The dowry helps to ease the dilemma.

While a stay at home mom takes care the children, it does not mean that the house keeping is her responsibility. There are reports that the Prophet Muhammad pbuh. he is responsible for cleaning his cloths. In Islam, it is part of husband responsibility to support and protect his family. It is important for him to feed his family from a lawful job. He believes if his children eat food from unlawful money, the food will become part of their body and drives them to become criminals later on.

=== Engage and Educate ===
They believe that humans are social creatures. There are times when a child needs to check things out and testing the limits. But there are times when they have to respect, shares and care of each other. Imran and Hana believes that names are prayers. So, they refrain from calling bad names if their children make mistakes. For example, they keep calling Khidr as good boy (salih) or upright boy (hanif), hoping that God will grant it to be true someday.

In case of Khadijah, Imran and Hana gives a lot of things to try during her childhood. She even went for swimming and horse riding. Imran and Hana afraid that when Hana reach the age of independence, she will try those things out wildly. They want Khadijah to have enough experiences and knowledge, to deal with even the super liberal or ultra conservative environment where ever she goes later. The first will exploit an unexperienced girl, the later will deprive the girl from such experiences. Both Imran and Hana cannot predict the future, they can only prepare their children for it.

They believe education is important for both Khadijah and Khidr. Besides professional skills they learn at school, they learn social skills at home and their neighborhood. Their father also sent them to practice some financial skills at their neighbor shops. There are many skills that they cannot get from ordinary school, but important for survival. They learn Islam also from two different mosques who has different views to keep their mind open. Imran and Hana always remind them over and over, that their parents will leave someday and they have life on their own.

=== Finding Spouse ===
Freddy, a French colleague of Khadijah, asks her to marry. Imron and Hana should make a though decision, but at the end it is up to Khadijah to decide. In Islam, a boy should not marry a girl without her father permission. But, if the girl asked for independence to choose, the father should grant her. At the same time, Islam does not allow a non-Muslim to marry a Muslim girl. Therefore a background checks  and re-check is a must before a Muslim marriage could take place.

After face-to-face discussion and parallel investigations, it became apparent that Freddy shares the same interest with Khadijah for a pure and simpler religion. With Imron helps, Freddy learns about Islam faiths, rituals, moral and ethics. One day, he converts to Islam by confessing the Shahada in front of an Imam and take Faisal as his new name. Finally, Imron gives his blessing to the marriage between Faisal and Khadijah.

At first, Khidr has no interest on family life, but in Islam parents should encourage and support their children to marry. Hana with the helps of the &quot;auntie&quot;-net (not internet), comes up with several candidates to become Khidr's wife. Khidr knows that he should follow the Prophet example to life a family life finally picks on of the girl. He was so afraid at first to take more commitments, because in Islam a marriage is super-big commitment equivalence to the commitment of the prophets to their God. But he trust in God and he is lucky that his wife also fully trust in God and at him. She has firm believes that if Khidr does not have enough wealth to supply her, God will grant him.

=== Making Will ===
Before he dies, Imran wrote a will that his wealth should be divided evenly between his wife and one child that wish to take care of his wife. In Islam, if there is a will from a deceased, it will take precedent over Islamic ruling. Islam encourages parents to write their will, because parents knows better of their family situation instead of outsiders. 

It turns out that both children want their mother to stay with them in rotation. Then it is up to the court to distribute the wealth. Anyway, Imron does leave much wealth. It is the spiritual skills that he teaches to their children, the most valuable inheritance possible. His family are one amongst the fortunate families who does not split and fought each other over inheritance.

== Muslim World View ==
Muslims do not live in vacuum. There are many things happening in this world that affect their lives.

=== Materialism ===
Imron goes further by explaining that the true enemy of Muslims is materialism. All of the world wars are wars of resources. The world probably will have to support 9 billion people in 50 years. The resources will be enough and war is unnecessary only if people stop their materialistic thinking. Imron told his son that he can start it with himself, then his family and then his neighbor.

Consumerism replaces all things that the local community can provide with products made by factories. This includes necessities and entertainments. This leads to two problems. First, the social breakdowns, where family and neighbor does not look for entertainments from each other any more. They became isolated and do not recognize each other anymore. This leads to frustration, drugs/alcohol abuse, domestic violence, or even suicides. Second, their increased dependence on consumer products and services drains their resources and the resources from the Third World countries more than their fair share through Globalization and Free Trade.

=== Globalization ===
Imron tries to remember the story of Fir'aun (Pharaoh), Qarun (Corah) and Hamman who rules and destroys the Ancient Egypt. Today, the Multinational Company, The World Bank and the International Media rule the world. Local Governments, including the Government of United States has less and less power. 

It is the Multinational Company who holds the executive power of the world, much like Fir'aun in the Ancient Egypt. They have the power to transfer their money and business in and out as reward or punishment to local governments. The local government is forced to lower their taxes to attract foreign investments. It translates to less government funding for social, education and health services, and more taxes for the worker.

The World Bank, International Monetary Funds and World Trade Organization holds the budget and legislation power, much like the super-rich Qarun in the Ancient Egypt. IMF forced local governments to free their market, let the Multinational Company to take over local banks and important companies with cheap prices and plunder the natural resources and cheap workforces. They do this by overriding local legislators and supporting dictatorial regimes.

The International Media giants holds the Educational and Yudicial powers, much like the highest-priest Hamman in the Ancient Egypt. It is no longer the parents but the television that educates our children nowadays into materialism way of thinking. It is the media who judges who is the criminals and who is the heroes today.

Imron believes that Globalization is just a disguise of a global plundering of rich countries over the Third Worlds. For example, Globalization and Free-market causes poor countries to plants and exports bananas to pay their debts instead of rice to feed their people. Globalization and Free Market will remove the ability of one country to rejects woods sold by companies who did not replant the forest. They will increase hunger and speed up draining the natural resources of the poor countries.

=== Spirituality ===

Imron keep saying to himself that, if he wants to fight for injustice and oppression, we should identify first the real enemy and the best way to defeat them. The best way to defeat them are by strengthening yourselves with four strategy mentioned before in [[s:Quran 103:1 | Chapter 103]].

''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;By time. &lt;br&gt;
''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The human is indeed in loss. &lt;br&gt;
''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Except
# ''those who believe, 
# ''do good works, 
# ''support one another with the truth, and 
# ''support one another with perseverance.

First, starting by turning off the television and strengthen your soul and your family against excessive life style (''believe and perseverance''). Second, strengthen local economy by consuming only local products and producing local necessities instead of export goods to pay government debts (''good works and support one another''). Third, limits global plundering by influencing the local government to redirect as much as possible local resources and profits into local people even under the pressures of the modern day Fir'aun, Qarun and Hamman (''support one another with the truth'').

The strategy includes seeing the world beyond its physical states. Wealth should no longer be measured by physical possession but the actual benefits of possession. Beauty should no longer be measured by physical appearance but by attitude and inner beauty. The second strategy is to remember death will certainly come, so we will seek for eternal pleasure in hereafter instead of a temporary one in this world. The third strategy is observe God's limits to avoid extremism. For example, while it is good to seek the hereafter but it does not mean you can force everybody to do the same. More information on God's limit in [[Islam Way of Life]]

Imron dreams about the old fashioned system of tribes, where each tribe have zero economic growth and self-sufficiently provide their own necessities and entertainments. These are honorable and sustainable tribes who have no desire to plunder other tribes’ resources under the pre-text of economic growth, conquering new markets or joining the world powerful nations.

Prophet Muhammad handles the trio oppressors similar to how Prophet Moses did. First, both of them defends the poor and oppressed as the just cause. Second, both of them invites the ruler into the truth and exposes lies of the magicians. Third, both of them and their follower migrates leaving the ruling power crumbles, without direct confrontation. Fourth, both of them build and lead a powerful and prosperous nation. 

Imran may let the capitalism and materialism works to produce nice things in this world, on the second thought. Spirituality may give direction, limits and harmony to reduce the bad effects of capitalism and materialism. It is similar to controlling fire or water. You can use it for your own benefits but also it can drown or burn you as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Home Staging}}

'''Home staging''' is the act of grooming or preparing a home to make it more attractive to potential buyers, thereby raising the value of the home. People have always &quot;staged&quot; their homes before selling them to command better prices, but in the 1990s, staging became a profession for those skilled in the art of preparing homes for sale, creating light, neutral environments with as much space as possible.

== Some tips ==
Below are some tips on how to stage your home before a potential buyer inspects it. Imagine seeing your own home for the first time. What does it look like? How does it smell? What is impressive? Can it be enhanced or more visible? What is less impressive?

=== Completion ===
Mend everything broken, paint over ugly marks, or put up new wallpaper. Little things that bug you are also likely to irritate a potential buyer.

=== Cleaning ===
Everything should be tidy and clean. No clutter! Remove personal items, such as photographs and Post-it notes. The bathroom and kitchen ''must'' give a fresh impression. If you utilize a commercial janitorial service to clean the windows, floors, and house, you'll get a better deal and faster service.

==== Kitchen ====
Remove ''everything'' from kitchen counters and clean them thoroughly. They should be shiny and totally empty. Keep everything off the counters for all showings unless its aesthetically useful. Put away coffee makers and toasters after breakfast if you're showing the house that day. You want to minimize clutter in order to maximize the spacious feeling. Buyers want space and spacious counters. The same principle applies to kitchen cabinets. Buyers will look in the cabinets if they are at all interested in your home. They are looking for space in there, too. Remove everything from the cabinets that you can do without while your home is listed. Pack these items away. Clean the cabinets and organize them. 

==== Bathroom ====
Do not leave your personal grooming items out on the counter or on shelves. Curling irons, makeup, shaving supplies, etc. must be put out of sight. There are two reasons for this:
#to reduce clutter and create space
#to minimize the appearance of any personal items throughout the home. You want buyers to be able to imagine themselves living there, and it really helps to have a clean slate

Buy a new shower curtain and towels unless yours are fairly new already.

=== Furniture ===
If possible, remove furniture and all other household goods that might contribute to a cluttered appearance. This gives a more spacious impression. Don't stack these things in the attic, basement, or garage since that still portrays clutter and distracts potential buyers. Hire a moving company to remove your furniture or do it yourself. Store it at rental storage facility.

=== Plants ===
Fresh plants give a fresh impression. But keep the importance of space in mind. Don't overdo it.

=== Lights ===
A well-lit home gives a fresher impression than does a dark one. Pull up the blinds and pull the curtains aside to showcase the clean windows and let the sun in. Some well placed lamps may brighten up the room.

But lighting doesn't have to mean electrical lighting.  Effective use of natural light can instantly make a room feel warmer and more inviting.  Light or shimmering fabrics work well to help amplify natural light as do mirrors and light or bright artwork.  

Mirrors are also very effective in making smaller spaces seem larger.  By placing a large mirror on one wall or by placing two similarly sized mirrors on opposite walls, existing light will be bounced around the room opening up the space and the room feel instantly larger.  

Using light in these ways can make your efforts pay off by making your existing space seem much larger and brighter.

=== Outdoors ===
Mow the lawn and sweep the terrace (or balcony).

Next. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;The Node Selection
page appears. Select the nodes that you want to configure as part of the RAC
database and click Next. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;The
Database Templates page is displayed. The templates other than New Database
include datafiles. Choose New Database and then click Next. Note: The Show
Details button provides information on the database template selected. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;DBCA now
displays the Database Identification page. Enter the Global Database Name and
Oracle System Identifier (SID) as test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;The
Database Options page is displayed. Select the options you wish to configure
and then choose Next. Note: If you did not choose New Database from the

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Select
the connection options desired from the Database Connection Options page. Click
Next. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;DBCA now
displays the Initialization Parameters page. This page comprises a number of
Tab fields. Modify the Memory settings if desired and then select the File
Locations tab to update information on the Initialization Parameters filename
and location. The option Create persistent initialization parameter file is
selected by default. Enter raw device name /orac/spfile_raw for the location of
the server parameter file (spfile) must be entered. The button File Location
Variables… displays variable information. The button All Initialization
Parameters… displays the Initialization Parameters dialog box. This box
presents values for all initialization parameters and indicates whether they
are to be included in the spfile to be created through the check box, included
(Y/N). Instance specific parameters have an instance value in the instance
column. Complete entries in the All Initialization Parameters page and select
Close. Note: There are a few exceptions to what can be altered via this screen.
Ensure all entries in the Initialization Parameters page are complete and
select Next. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;DBCA now

for each tablespace in your database. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;The
Database Creation Options page is displayed. Ensure that the option Create
Database is checked and click Finish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;The DBCA
Summary window is displayed. Review this information and then click OK. Once
you click the OK button and the summary screen is closed, it may take a few
moments for the DBCA progress bar to start. DBCA then begins to create the
database according to the values specified. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;During
the database creation process, you may see the following error: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;This is a
known issue (bug 2925665). You can click on the &amp;quot;Ignore&amp;quot; button to
continue. Once DBCA has completed database creation, remember to run the
'prvtxml.plb' script from $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin independently, as the user
SYS. It is also advised to run the 'utlrp.sql' script to ensure that there are
no invalid objects in the database at this time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;A new
database now exists. It can be accessed via Oracle SQL*PLUS or other
applications designed to work with an Oracle RAC database. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Login as
root &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;su – oracle&lt;/span&gt; and run following command to
check if both instances of oracle are running or not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Oracle
Corporation recommends that you use SRVCTL to administer your Real Application
Clusters database environment. SRVCTL manages configuration information that is
used by several Oracle tools. For example, Oracle Enterprise Manager and the
Intelligent Agent use the configuration information that SRVCTL generates to
discover and monitor nodes in your cluster. Before using SRVCTL, ensure that
your Global Services Daemon (GSD) is running after you configure your database.
To use SRVCTL, you must have already created the configuration information for
the database that you want to administer. You must have done this either by
using the Oracle Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA), or by using the
srvctl add command as described below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;To
display the configuration details for, example, database test, on nodes node1
and node2 with instances node1 and node2 run:- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Login as
root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Su to
oracle with command &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;su - oracle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl config -p test -n node1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;node1

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl status database -d test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Instance
test1 is running on node node1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Instance
test2 is running on node node2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Examples of
starting and stopping RAC follow:- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl start database -d test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl stop database -d test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl stop instance -d test -i node2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl start instance -d test -i node2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Oracle
Corporation recommends that you use SRVCTL to administer your Real Application
Clusters database environment. SRVCTL manages configuration information that is
used by several Oracle tools. For example, Oracle Enterprise Manager and the
Intelligent Agent use the configuration information that SRVCTL generates to
discover and monitor nodes in your cluster. Before using SRVCTL, ensure that
your Global Services Daemon (GSD) is running after you configure your database.
To use SRVCTL, you must have already created the configuration information for
the database that you want to administer. You must have done this either by
using the Oracle Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA), or by using the
srvctl add command as described below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;To
display the configuration details for, example, database test, on nodes node1
and node2 with instances node1 and node2 run:- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Login as
root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Su to
oracle with command &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;su - oracle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;$ &lt;span
style='color:navy'&gt;srvctl config -p test -n node1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In humans, these pigments include hemoglobin and myoglobin, the latter is present in red muscle fibers. Hemoglobin is a coordination compound of iron. It had attachment sites for gases, namely oxygen and carbon dioxide. Its reactivity depends upon partial pressure of these gases. The presence of heme makes it appear red colored. Myoglobin is present in muscles to make available extra oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[/Introduction|Jini]] is a specification of several capabilities and associated tools related to distributed computing and dealing with the [[/Eight fallacies of distributed computing|eight fallacies of distributed computing]].  There are a number of [[/Vendors selling Jini compatible tools or implementations|vendors selling Jini compatible tools or implementations]] of APIs in the specification (one of the more common APIs being implemented in these commercial products is [[/The JavaSpaces API|The JavaSpaces API]]) and a number of [[/Consultancies with expertise in Jini and JavaSpaces|consultancies with expertise in Jini and JavaSpaces]] based systems design and implementation.

The [http://www.jini.org Jini community website] was originally created to contain the software being developed by community members which needed to be protected by the SCSL licensing.  Since the conversion of the licensing to ALV2, this primary need is starting to disappear as some of the projects are moved to ALV2 or other non-SCSL licensing.

However, [[/The jini-users mailing list|the jini-users mailing list]] and [[/The javaspaces-users mailing list|the javaspaces-users mailing list]] contain a large amount of very useful information about using Jini and answers to common questions that have been popular topics over the years.  The Blitz Project (http://www.dancres.org/blitz/) maintains a conglomeration of a lot of very important links and information regarding the changes between [[/The Jini Platform/1.x|Jini 1.x]] and [[/The Jini Platform/2.0 and later|Jini 2.0 and later]] together with other useful resources at http://www.dancres.org/cottage/starting_jini.html.

==Chapters==
In the end, this should be a book.  That means that there need to be more serialized content than is typically present in a wiki created documentation set.

# [[/Introduction|Introduction]]

==Miscellaneous topics==
The following are some of the most popular topics that have surfaced on the mailing lists over the years.  As people have time, these pages will likely get filled in with references to the list messages that contain answers to these questions, as well as other informative information.

* I need help [[/Moving an RMI application over to Jini|Moving an RMI application over to Jini]]?
* Where do I learn more about [[/Using Jini Exporters|Using Jini Exporters]] instead of [[/Subclassing the UnicastRemoteObject class|Subclassing the UnicastRemoteObject class]].
* Is there a good overview on [[/Using Configuration Files|Using Configuration Files]] for services.
* Where is the documentation on [[/Using Jini Extensible Remote Invocation|Using Jini Extensible Remote Invocation]] for security and access control.
* How to capitalize on [[/JavaSpaces05|JavaSpaces05]] changes for batching.
* What in the world is the [[/Java.rmi.server.codebase|java.rmi.server.codebase]] property all about.
* [[/Specifying a Codebase|Specifying a Codebase]] dynamically or otherwise at runtime instead of on the command line.
* The ins and outs of [[/Multicast and unicast lookup|multicast and unicast lookup]].
* [[/Service discovery through a firewall|Service discovery through a firewall]].
* [[/Using a service through a firewall|Using a service through a firewall]].
* [[/Commercial Support|Commercial Support]].

The orginal Jini toolkit and specification was developed by Sun Microsystems.  It was released under a flurry of marketing pointing at toaster automation and a kitchen full of communicating gadgets.

Jini is now an Apache License Version 2 licensed, open source, community driven and supported system.  The specification provides the compatibility control.  The licensing of the specification and Sun Microsystems contributed implementation under the ALV2 license provides the opportunity for everyone to participate in the continued evolution of this powerful technology.

Jini exploits the RMI programming model to make use of mobile Java code.  The original Java Applet mechanism demonstrated the power of downloading software on the fly to perform a task that was not programmed into the environment of the user.  The [[The Java Platform/Java Security Model]] allows a secure and predictable outcome to software running in an instance of the [[The Java Platform/Java Virtual Machine]].  In [[The Jini Platform/Jini 2.0]], the [[The Jini Platform/Jini Extensible Remote Invocation API]] provided
extensions to the Java Security Model which provided more control over security.

The [[Jini and Network Computing]] section contains more information on using Jini for advanced network computing.

== Piano Practice == 
Piano practice is an important aspect of piano playing. Piano pedagogues have several theories on the best way to implement and encourage students to practice. Resources are available for students to chart the time spent in practicing. 

Teachers dictate varying amounts of time required for students of different levels of skill. For example, a beginning student may be required to practice 20 minutes a day while an advanced student may practice over an hour a day. A common approach in a practice session is: 

#warm-up - scales, [[arpeggios]], chord progressions; 
#work sections of pieces gradually expanding to include before and after the trouble spot - rhythms, fingerings, and/or notes that need to be drilled; 
#work entire pieces - consistent tempo, accurate dynamics and touch, etc. 
The metronome is a useful tool in piano practice sessions. Students need to have ready access to their own piano - having to travel somewhere to practice often provides an unnecessary hurdle for some students.

== How to practice ==

At first, you can play some of your finished pieces. You learn to play your pieces without warming up (which is a skill surprisingly easily cultivated) and warm up at the same time! But let's go to the real practising.

Find the most difficult bars of your piece. These bars almost always have all the technique you need in order to play the piece. Then you should practice them hands separate. This allows you to speed up music quickly so you can practice the correct technique earlier and thus save time. In slow play, you can play with all kinds of unnecessary movements, but in fast playing you simply don't have time to do them! Hand separate practice also allows resting your tired hand, but always play slowly (about 75% of the speed) after changing hands. It cleans you from the bad habits you just learned practising fast. You should do hands separate pratice only when you can't play hands together adequately, except in contrapuntal music.

A good method to join hands together (but not the only) is following:

Play the more difficult hand. Then repeat with the first note of the other hand. Then repeat with the first two notes etc. You almost never get stuck with this method. But don't choose too large sections, otherwise you waste your time.

The other way is to outline the piece. Forget about anything other than the bass and melody (but keep the fingering same) and gradually fill the piece with other notes

Choose overlapping sections and practice the most difficult. Ideally they should be small enough to be learned in 20 minutes, but if you learn them after 30 minutes or 10 minutes, don't worry. Also memorize them. After that, forget about it until next day. You can choose another section or piece.

If your sections overlap, joining them together will be easy. If you get this far, congratulations! You can now start to make music. But the text above is just peak of an iceberg. Answering to the more specific problems need more specific questions. The is the cure for the problems in rhythm, rhythm variations short-long and long short are answer to the uneven sounding passages and so on.

There is a Web-Book available: [http://www.pianopractice.org/ &quot;Fundamentals of Piano Practice&quot;]  by Chuan C. Chang.

''Stegosaurus'' is Greek for &quot;plated lizard&quot;; this name is given to the dinosaur due to a heavy armour of plates down its back. It is also sometimes known as one of the dumbest dinosaurs, because it had a very small brain compared to its large body.

== What did they look like? ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
An average ''Stegosaurus'' was about 12&amp;nbsp;m (40&amp;nbsp;ft) long and about 2.75&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. ''Stegosaurus'' weighed about 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg or 6,800 pounds (around 3 tons!) ''Stegosaurus'''s front feet each had five toes and there were three toes on each back foot. The feet resembled gigantic horse hoofs and the people who first discovered them actually thought they might have come from giant horses!
[[Image:Stegosaurus_size.png|thumb|left|A ''Stegosaurus'' next to an adult human]]

The most prominent feature of a ''Stegosaurus'' was the row of plates running down its back, along the spine. These plates could be larger than 75&amp;nbsp;cm in height. It was once thought that they were used as protection against predators such as the ''[[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Allosaurus|Allosaurus]]'', but in fact they were not solid bone and would have been easy to break. They were covered with thin skin and lots of blood vessels.

Nobody knows for sure what the back plates were used for, but many scientists now believe that they were used for temperature control &amp;ndash; to gather heat from the surroundings. They would have been used like solar panels. When the animal needed to warm up, it would stand with its side toward the sun. The thin skin and many blood vessels covering the plates would soak up the heat of the sun. When the ''Stegosaurus'' got too hot, it could stand in the shade, or turn itself to face the sun (or face away from it). Then the blood vessels could be cooled.

For defence ''Stegosaurus'' did have four (or eight) heavy spikes on its tail, which could be used to hit attackers.

''Stegosaurus's'' mouth was shaped a bit like a beak and had no teeth in the front &amp;ndash; probably for snipping plants.

== What did they eat? ==
''Stegosaurus'' was a [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|herbivore]], meaning it ate plants. It mainly liked to browse plants near the ground, because they were the easiest to reach with its short neck. They were plants such as ferns, mosses, cycads and baby evergreen trees, which contained little nutrition. Most of them were only 3&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;feet high. ''Stegosaurus'' may have been able to rear up on its hind legs for short periods of time to browse plants that were otherwise out of reach.

Due to plants having little nutrition in each bite, the ''Stegosaurus'' had to eat a lot. It would spend most of its day eating.

== When did they live? ==
They lived during the late Jurassic period about 156&amp;ndash;145 million years ago.

== Where did they live? ==
They lived in subtropical parts in the USA, but there were also stegosaurus living in other parts of the world including Africa, China, Mongolia and Europe.

''Stegosaurus'' fossils have been found in the US states of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

== How were they discovered? ==
The first ''Stegosaurus'' fossil was found in Colorado, USA, in 1876 by M. P. Felch.  It was named in 1877 by Othniel C. Marsh.

The most complete ''Stegosaurus'' fossil ever found was nicknamed &quot;Spike&quot;.  It was discovered in Colorado, USA, by Bryan Small, Tim Seeber and Kenneth Carpenter in 1992.

== What do we need to learn? ==
*We would like to know why &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; had the big bony plates on its back. Did they cool ''Stegosaurus''?  Did it use them to show off?  Or to protect itself?  We don't know.
*''Stegosaurus'''s back plates were not solid &amp;ndash; they were filled with long hollow tubes or tunnels.  What were they for?
*''Stegosaurus'' had cousins, known as Stegosaurs.  Some of the cousins lived in herds (like cows and horses do today), and some did not. We would like to know whether ''Stegosaurus'' lived in herds, or whether it lived mostly alone.
*''Stegosaurus'' had a very small brain.  Scientists used to think a structure near its hip was a second brain, perhaps to help control its tail and hind legs.  Now they think it might be a &quot;glycogen body&quot;, which is something birds have and is related to storing energy, although they're not sure quite what it does even in birds.  We would like to know for sure.

The Allosaurus was one of the largest [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|predators]] of its time. 

== What did it look like? ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
[[Image:Allosaurus_skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|An Allosaurus skeleton in a museum]]
The ''Allosaurus'' was a large carnivorous dinosaur that walked on two legs and had two arms on the front of its body. This dinosaur could grow to be '''12 meters''' long (38 feet) '''5 meters''' tall (16.5 feet) and weigh up to about '''1.4 tons''' (3086 lbs)!  This dinosaur had a very long head, '''90cm''' (3 ft), with many '''5 to 10 cm teeth'''. The ''Allosaurus'' did not look like the other dinosaurs that existed at that time. Because of this, the word ''Allosaurus'' means &quot;different lizard&quot;.

The ''Allosaurus'' is in the theropod (meaning &quot;beast foot&quot;) family. ''Allosaurus'' had two arms.  Its arms were longer than those of the ''T.Rex'' with large wicked claws.
''Allosaurus'' was bipedal.

Allosaurus had 2 crests above its eyes which may have been used for mating display.

== What did they eat? ==
''Allosaurus'' were [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|carnivorous]] dinosaurs. ''Allosaurus'' hunted in small groups which allowed them to take down even the largest prey. In the same way as raptors would, only slightly smaller groups. They even ate the gigantic ''Apatosaurus'' (which used to be called [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Brontosaurus|Brontosaurus]]) even though the ''Apatosaurus'' was more than three times the size of an ''Allosaurus''. The ''Allosaurus'' was also likely to have hunted [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Stegosaurus|Stegosaurus]], and Iguanodonts such as ''Camptosaurus''.

Young baby ''Allosaurus'' might have eaten insects like dragonflies and centipedes, and other small animals.  When about two years old, ''Allosaurus'' might have eaten small dinosaurs (''Othnielia'', ''Dryosaurs'' and so on).

Allosaurs competed for food with ceratosaurs when they first arrived but may have eventually driven the ceratosaurs to extinction.  Allosaurus's teeth were thin and serrated not made to puncture bone but to strip bits of meat off a carcase.  Often Allosaurus left pieces of meat on the bone that other predators like Ornithelestes would scavenge.

== When did they live? ==
Like all dinosaurs, ''Allosaurus'' lived in the Mesozoic era. Mezo means middle so Allosaurus lived in the middle era.  They lived in that era's late Jurassic period, between about 154 and 115 million years ago.

== Where did they live? ==
''Allosaurus'' was a very common dinosaur around 135 million years ago. It lived on the land that now makes up the Morrison Formation, USA and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Portugal|Portugal]]. A major discovery was made in Colorado when a rancher named M. P. Felch discovered an almost perfect skeleton of an ''Allosaurus''. They have also been found in Africa, which was connected to North America by a land bridge at the time. There is a site in Utah where the fossils of more than 40 Allosaurus have been found. Some close relatives lived in Asia. 

''Allosaurus'' probably lived on the plains and lowlands where groups could hunt easily. It probably had to compete for food against Ceratosaurus and some species of Dilophosaurus. Some allosaurs lived in [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]].  There is proof that ''Allosaurus'' lived in wetlands.  One find in Utah shows that a &quot;predator trap&quot; may have made plant eating dinosaurs trapped in sticky mud, and the allosaurs wanted an easy snack, but they soon were caught, and died one by one.

== How were they discovered? ==
[[Image:Allosaurus SDNHM.jpg|right|thumb]]
The first [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|fossil]] of an ''Allosaurus'' to be discovered was found in the USA state of Colorado, in 1869. At first, the people who found it thought it was a [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|petrified]] horse hoof instead of a dinosaur bone. In 1991 a complete ''Allosaurus'' skeleton was discovered. This ''Allosaurus'' was named &quot;Big Al&quot;. When scientists looked at the skeleton they discovered that &quot;Big Al&quot; was actually an ''Allosaurus'' teenager. They also discovered that this young Allosaurus was about 8 meters (26 feet) long! &quot;Big Al&quot; was made famous by a TV programme called ''The Ballad of Big Al'' also called ''Walking with Dinosaurs: Allosaurus''.  This program showed what Big Al's life could have been like. They are also one of the most common dinosaurs in museums from the Jurassic time period.

== What do we need to learn? ==
*The colour of their skin. Their skin was green or brown with fading red stripes on their back.
*How big their hunting groups were. It isn't even certain that they did hunt in groups, although until recently, most people assumed that they did. They did not hunt in groups or they were really, really, rare. Also if one came across another they would fight until they either saw limping or blood. They did not see each other as enemies; it was just natural instinct. Although they hunted dinosaurs that lived in groups they did not or they were like one in a million rare of hunting in groups.
*How much did they eat each day? They ate about 20 pounds per meal so 60 pounds a day.

The ''Apatosaurus'', whose name means &quot;deceptive lizard&quot; in Greek, was one of the largest land animals ever. For many years, this dinosaur was sometimes called ''[[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Brontosaurus|Brontosaurus]]''.

== What did they look like? ==
The ''Apatosaurus'' was one of the largest land creatures that have ever lived.  They were '''20&amp;ndash;27 metres''' in length, '''3&amp;ndash;5 metres''' in height, and weighed an enormous '''30&amp;ndash;35 tons'''!  This is over 6 times heavier than an elephant!

They walked on four legs with a big muscular body, but a much smaller head attached on a long neck.  They held their tail up a little above the ground as they moved.  The main purpose of this tail was to make sure that the dinosaur would not fall over due to its heavy long neck.  It was also used for defence against predators.  Their heads were long and narrow.  Strangely, apatosaurus's nostrils were on the top of its head; this is believed to have been so that it could breathe with all but the top of its head underwater, to hide from predators.  
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}

== What did they eat? ==
They were [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|herbivores]] &amp;mdash; that is, they ate plants.  They used their long necks to reach up into trees to get leaves and branches. They could not chew, most scientists think that they swallowed stones called ''gastroliths'' to help grind the food in their stomach! Because there were no broad leafed trees, they ate pine needles and ferns. There also was no grass.

== When did they live? ==
They lived in the late Jurassic Period, about '''157&amp;ndash;146 million''' years ago. The Jurassic period was warm and humid and had lots of vegetation.

== Where did they live? ==
When they were first discovered, scientists believed that because of their large size they could not live on land.  So they would have to walk in water with their heads sticking out.  Now scientists think that this is not true – no bones were found in any ancient watery places.  They most likely lived near river banks where they could find both water and trees.  They could not live in the forests, because they were simply too big to walk around in a forest!

Their fossils have been found in Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, in the USA, North America.

[[Image:Apatosaurus2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Apatosaurus head]] 
== How were they discovered? ==
Professor Othniel Marsh discovered parts of the first fossils of a young ''Apatosaurus'' in 1877. The first ''Apatosaurus'' skeletons were found without heads. Because of the confusion with the ''Brontosaurus'', the head of ''Apatosaurus'' was not conclusively identified until 1972. By this time many examples of the correct head had been found. ''Apatosaurus'' means &quot;deceptive lizard,&quot; because its fossils were so similar to those of other sauropods.

== What do we need to learn? ==
*We need to learn how flexible their neck really was, whether they could raise it up high or whether it could only be raised slightly.
*Where and how they really lived, all we have now are just some educated guesses.
*Whether they lived alone or travelled in herds like their close relatives the ''Diplodocus''.
*How they laid their eggs.</text>

Pterosaurs are commonly referred to as Pterodactyls. However scientists prefer Pterosaurs so this name is used in this book. 

Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs, but a close relative. They lived alongside dinosaurs and died out at the same time. 

== On the Ground ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
As well as flying probably very large distances due to the different atmospheric content (dense oxygen-rich atmosphere). Pterosaurs could move on the ground and needed to as to be able to take flight. For a while scientists didn't know if this was using two feet (bipedal), or using four feet (quadrupedal). We now know that they used four, from fossil footprints. However, we don't know if they did this all the time. Some scientists think that small Pterosaurs could walk or even run on two feet, but larger ones used all four like bats do now.

== Body shape ==
[[Image:Pteranodon reconstruction Eaton 1910.jpg|thumb|left|reconstruction of Pteranodon by palaeontologist George F. Eaton.]] 
The different types of pterosaurs all had different sizes.  Ranging from '''0.75m''' wingspan and of the ''Pterodactylus'' to '''11 meters''' wingspan and '''135 kg''' weight of the ''Quetzalcoatlus''. ''Quetzalcoatlus'' was the largest pterosaur, its wingspan being '''45 feet'''.

The pterosaurs are divided into two groups; the ''Rhamphorhynchoids'' had no crests and tails, while the ''Pterodactyloids'' had crests but no tails. 

Most large ''Pterodactyloids'' had crests on their head, possibly colored brightly, but different types of ''Pterodactyloids'' had differently shaped crests.  All were narrow, but some stretched out behind their head in a triangle shape (as in the picture on the left), while others were small rounded humps on top of their heads.

They didn't have feathers, but almost all scientists even think they might have had fur, like bats! They might have been for warmth, just like bats!

== What did they eat? ==
Pterodactyls were [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|carnivores]] and [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|scavengers]]. In the first few months of their life, they ate insects. As an adult they ate a lot of fish which they would catch from the surface of the water by dipping their long beaks in as they flew over, but they would also eat dinosaurs who were already dead.

== When did they live? ==
The Pterosaurs lived all through the mesozoic era. The ''Rhamphorhynchoids'' lived in the Triassic and early Jurassic periods; and the ''Pterodactyloids'' in late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

== Where did they live? ==
It is believed that most of the species of Pterosaurs lived close to the sea shores, as to have easy access to fish and ample space to fly and glide with the benefit from different temperatures in air columns (hot to climb and cold to drop). Like some modern birds they seem to form large groups and behaviour should have been as varied as with today's bird species. Some Pterosaurs fossils have even been found in caves.

They lived in some parts of America, Guam, China, Japan, [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|England]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Germany|Germany]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]], Tanzania (in Africa) and many other places too.

== When and how they were discovered? ==
Different types of pterosaurs were discovered at different times.  The earliest to be found was the ''Pterodactylus'' in 1784 in France by the Italian scientist Cosimo Collini. He didn't think they could fly but thought they could swim. This seems silly now that we know they have wings. Another species was discovered in 1876 by Othneil C. Marsh, and one of the most recently discovered the gigantic ''Quetzalocatlus'' found by Douglas A. Lawson.  New discoveries are still being made; in the 1990s there were several discoveries made to suggest that even a larger pterosaur could have existed than previously known (''Arambourgiania philadelphiae'').

== How were they wiped out? ==

The last of the larger ''Pterodactylids'' seems to have been killed in the [[w:Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|K-T extinction]], along with the dinosaurs. However, the ''Rhamphorynchids'' seem to have been extinguished earlier, probably because they could not compete with birds (which evolved around that time).

== What do we need to learn? ==
*What colour were they?
*What were the crests on their heads used for?
*Were they really  [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|scavengers]]?
*Were they covered in fur?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What did they look like? ==
The body of the Triceratops was big and round, planted on top of short sturdy legs. It was 8 meters long, about 3 meters tall and weighed somewhere between 6 and 12 tons (the size of an elephant).

Triceratops means &quot;Three Horned Face&quot; in Greek. It is called that because it has three horns – two above its eyes and one on its nose. Triceratops horns could be up to 40 inches long. It had a big frill that extended up above the head.

The horns were used for defense, against such enemies as the [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus]]. When threatened, the Triceratops would stand and fight. Its sharp horns would act as spears and cause a lot of damage. It also had a powerful bite.

Scientists do not all agree on what its head frill was used for.  Some say it could have been a defense – like a shield, to protect its body. Some say it was used to give a warning to members of the herd by changing colour.

== What did they eat? ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
Triceratops were a herbivore &amp;mdash; a plant-eater &amp;mdash;  that fed close to the ground. We know this because it had flat teeth that are good for chopping up vegetation, and its massive head would have been difficult to lift high in the air. Unlike any animal today, a Triceratops had a beak in front of its mouth and teeth in back. The beak would have a hard covering like a parrot beak.

A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough and woody branches and roots. Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous. These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves. A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk. Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them.

Triceratops, like any animal that eats woody foods, had to be big: they needed to process the food very slowly because it took a long time to digest, requiring a long digestive tract. This is evident in how, for instance, an elephant can digest a tree branch, or a cow can digest hay, but a human cannot.

== When did they live? ==

Triceratops lived in the late Cretaceous period, around 70 to 65 million years ago. The climate was warm and dry and there were numerous volcanoes.

== Where did they live? ==

Triceratops lived in the North American continent. Remains have been found in the United States (USA) states of Colorado, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is evidence that they were a herding animal. They lived in groups like buffalo or bison.

[[Image:Triceratops 2.jpg|thumb|left|A Triceratops skeleton in a museum.]]

== How were they discovered? ==
The first Triceratops was discovered in 1887, in Colorado, USA.  Since then many of their fossils have been found with [[../Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus]] tooth marks!

== What do we need to learn? ==
*What their head frill was used for. - Some people believed that the Triceratops babies were hunted by smaller meat eaters and the adult used their frills to protect their young.
*If they were really hunted by ''T.Rex''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Plesiosaurus2.jpg|right|thumb|230px]]
The Plesiosaur is not actually a dinosaur, but rather a large swimming reptile.  ''Plesiosaur'' is Greek for &quot;nearer to the reptiles&quot;.  This name given to this creature because it resembles something that is part reptile and part fish.

== What did they look like? ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
[[File:Plesiosaurus.jpg|left|thumb|An early image of the Plesiosaurus, surprisingly accurate with only one problem.]]
There were different types of Plesiosaurs which were different from each other in size and in shape.  The shortest were 2.5 metres long and the longest were '''14 metres long'''!  That is about as long as 8 adults lying in one long line! They all had long necks with small heads on the end.  Their stomachs  were oval-shaped with two front flippers and two back flippers.  They had long tails, though much shorter than their necks.

Scientists first thought that they swam close to the surface of the water (as the picture on the left shows).  This way they could stick their head above the water and look down on fish.  But because their eyes are placed facing slightly upwards, this is probably not true.  They probably swam completely underwater and used their long necks to dart their heads towards fish.
Plesiosaurs were very successful.

== What did they eat? ==
They ate fish, squids, mollusks and other small sea creatures.  Recently, scientists have found evidence that the Plesiosaurs may have also been &quot;bottom-feeders&quot;.  That is they would feed from the bottom of the sea - on things like clams and snails.

== When did they live? ==
They lived from the early Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous period.  That is from about 220 million years to about 65 million years ago. Plesiosaurs, like dinosaurs, lived in the Mesozoic era. Nobody is sure why the plesiosaurs went extinct.

== Where did they live? ==
Some people think that they could climb out of the water and crawl around on land, like seals.  But other scientists disagree with this.  Either way they would have spent a lot of their time under water.  And because they were air-breathing animals, they would have to come up to the water surface for air every now and then.

Their fossils were found in [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|England]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Germany|Germany]], Japan, Australia and USA. They lived also in Manitoba, Canada,and Mexico

== How were they discovered? ==
The first Plesiosaur was discovered in 1821 by Mary Anning, in England.
Mostly found in the Benthic zone, they can also be found in the intertidal zones as well.

== Modern mysteries around the Plesiosaurs ==
The most famous mysteries around these creatures is the Loch Ness Monster. There are a lot of stories of some large creature in the lake called Loch Ness in Scotland.  Most descriptions of the monster are close to what the Plesiosaurs must have looked like. Some of the sightings have been proven to be a hoax and at present there is no scientific proof of the existence of the animal but many people believe in it. The study and search for animals which fall outside of contemporary zoological catalogues has the name of Cryptozoology.

In 1977, some Japanese fishermen off the coast of New Zealand found a very rotten carcass of some large creature with flippers.  It was so rotten that it was very hard to tell anything from it, but some people believed that it was a plesiosaur.  Scientists however ascertained it was a basking shark, fallen to bits because it was so rotten.

== What do we need to learn? ==
*How flexible were their necks?  Scientists don't agree on this.
*Is there any truth to the stories around them?

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Velociraptor'' means &quot;swift thief&quot;. This is a good name because ''Velociraptor'' was a small dinosaur that could run fast. ''Velociraptor'' was a ''theropod''. The theropods were a group of dinosaurs that walked on two legs. This group of dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds. ''Velociraptor'' brains were bigger than most other dinosaurs compared to the size of their bodies. ''Velociraptor'' was a smart dinosaur.

== What did they look like? ==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}[[Image:Buitreraptor-Deinonychus.jpg|left|thumb|248px|A ''Deinonychus'' fossil replica stands behind a ''Buitreraptor'' replica, at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois.]]
The ''Velociraptor'' was just under a meter tall (about three feet), usually about 5-6 feet long from nose to tail, and weighed anywhere from 7-15 kilograms (15-33 pounds). ''Velociraptor'' had feathers on its skin, the same as birds do today. These dinosaurs walked on two legs and had two hands with three fingers and sharp claws. Their heads were long and narrow like a crocodile, and had a mouth with 26 or more teeth which was able to close very quickly. On each foot, they had a large dangerous curved toe claw. Their claws could grow up to 5 inches long. ''Velociraptor'' had a stiff tail that it used for balance. The tail could only flex from side to side, not up and down; this helped the dinosaur run fast and change directions quickly. ''Velociraptor'' had two legs which means it was bipedal. Its legs were strong and sturdy and it may have used them to jump. ''Velociraptor''s were also very agile.

== What did they eat? ==
''Velociraptor'' was a ''carnivore''. This means that it ate meat. It slashed or punctured its victims with its very long toe claw. Closely related dinosaurs like ''Deinonychus'' and ''Dromeosaurus'' hunted in packs and ''Velociraptor'' probably did too.

Alone a ''Velociraptor'' could have killed and eaten animals like lizards, early mammals and small or young dinosaurs. In a pack, ''Velociraptor'' may have hunted even larger prey such as ''Homocephale'' and even the large hadrosaurs!

One meal that was definitely on a ''Velociraptor’s'' menu was ''Protoceratops''. ''Protoceratops'' was a plant-eating dinosaur that was a relative of ''[[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Triceratops|Triceratops]]'', but had no horns and was the size of a pig. Scientists have found a fossil of ''Velociraptor'' locked in a fight with a ''Protoceratops''. The animals killed each other during the fight and a sand dune collapsed on top of them. 

[[Image:Fightingdinosamnh2.jpg|left|thumb|186px|A ''Velociraptor'' and ''Protoceratops'' fossilized in a fight to the death.]]
In a group, ''Velociraptor'' could have quickly and quietly circled around an animal that was alone to trap it. ''Velociraptor'' hunted by separating a victim from the herd. They killed their prey by piercing its vital organs with their claws or teeth. ''Velociraptor'' would  stalk up on their prey and pounce on it then it will slash through its prey with its claws
and then eat it.

== When did they live? ==
''Velociraptor''s lived during the Late [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/Glossary of Basic Terms|Cretaceous]] period, about 80 - 85 million years ago. This was only 15 million years before the dinosaurs became extinct. The world was much hotter than it is today, and there were no polar ice caps. There were small mammals and birds living at the same time as ''Velociraptor''. There were flowering plants and many insects similar to the ones we see today.

== Where did they live? ==
''Velociraptor'' lived in Asia. Fossils have been found in ''[[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]]'', ''China'' and ''Mongolia''. They lived in a place that was hot and covered by sand dunes. There were streams of water close to where some fossils have been found. They may have lived near the water and preyed on animals that came to drink. Some predators do this today.

== How were they discovered? ==
The first Velociraptor was discovered by ''Paleontologist'' Henry Osborn in Mongolia in 1924. A Paleontologist is a scientist that studies dinosaurs. The first fossils found were a skull with jaws and some toes with a claw. The skull was found next to a ''Protoceratops'' skull. Paleontologists have found 12 different examples of the animal so far.

== Velociraptors and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; ==
In a popular film called ''Jurassic Park'',the ''Velociraptor'' did not look like it would have in real life. The movie's ''Velociraptors'' were twice as tall as they really were, they were scaly instead of feathered and their tails were too flexible. A real &quot;Velocoraptor&quot; was only the size of a Labrador Retriever.  The ''Velociraptors'' in Jurassic Park look more like a Dromeosaur (Raptor) called ''Utahraptor'', which was ''Velociraptor's'' much bigger cousin (which also had feathers). But don't let that fool you, these little creatures were swift, powerful, and would have no problem killing you.

== What do we still need to learn? ==
* How did they use their long claw when hunting? Did they slash or stab with it? It is not likely they slashed at their prey, as their claws were more designed for gripping, and were too brittle to rip through flesh.
* Did they really hunt in packs? All the fossils found have been alone.
* Did they live in packs or did they live alone?
* How much did they eat each day?

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A sequence in a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a function from the set of natural numbers into that space, that is &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{N}\to X&lt;/math&gt;. The members of the domain of the sequence are &lt;math&gt;f(1),f(2),\ldots&lt;/math&gt; and are denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(n)=a_n&lt;/math&gt;. The sequence itself, or more specifically its domain are often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left\langle a_i\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. 

The idea is that you have an infinite list of elements from the space; the first element of the sequence is &lt;math&gt;f(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the next is &lt;math&gt;f(2)&lt;/math&gt;, etc. For example, consider the sequence in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 1/n&lt;/math&gt;. This is simply the points &lt;math&gt;1,1/2,1/3,1/4,...&lt;/math&gt; Also, consider the constant sequence &lt;math&gt;f(n) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. You can think of this as the number 1, repeated over and over. 


== Convergence ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; be a topology on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\left\langle x_i\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &quot;&lt;math&gt;\left\langle x_i\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot; if for any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; together imply &lt;math&gt;x_n\in U&lt;/math&gt;

This is written as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=x&lt;/math&gt; 


== Exercises ==
# Give a rigorous description of the following sequences of natural numbers:&lt;br /&gt;(i) &lt;math&gt;1,2,3,4,5\dots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ii) &lt;math&gt;2,-4,6,-8,10,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; be a topology over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;U_1\subset U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in U_1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly construct neighbourhoods &lt;math&gt;U_i\subset U_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x\in U_i\forall i&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\left\langle x_i\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence such that each &lt;math&gt;x_i\in U_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prove that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=x&lt;/math&gt;

Hello and welcome to Wikibooks.

Thanks for contributing to Civilistation wikibook but there are some things that need to be fixed. Firstly, you created duplicated modules: [[Civilization IV]] and [[Civ:Civilization IV]]. Decide which one you want to develop and mark other with {{tl|delete}} template so that we know it can be safely deleted. Secondly, you should use proper [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming convention]] in your book. You shouldn't name pages like [[Chapter 1 - Leaders]]. It should be: &lt;tt&gt;Civilisation IV:Leaders&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Civilisation IV:Leaders&lt;/tt&gt;.

If you have any questions, use my talk page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:50, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

== Copyright Violations ==
As much as I am thankful that you contributed to the Civilization wikibook, I am saddened by the fact that you copy/pasted it from gamespot. Please, don't do another copyright violation. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:59, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'm going to add to this here.  If you are contributing to Wikibooks and adding the content, it is up to you, the author, to provide verification that you have copyright clearance.  If you want to do the legwork and ask Sid Meier for explict permission to release this gaming guide on Wikibooks under the GFDL, go ahead.  Please provide either a link to or a copy of that permission, with a link to an e-mail address or something that could be used to provide verification that the permission was granted.  Otherwise it will have to be deleted as this is an explicit violation of copyright.  Gamespot is copyighted with the terms &quot;all rights reserved&quot; and is subject to criminal penalties in many nations that could get you into jail for doing things like this.  For legal reason we simply can't have stuff like this on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== How To Be A Good Student ==

Hi, I was perusing your wikibook &quot;How to Be A Good Student&quot; and I would like to suggest that you heavily edit some of the pages in your book. There are many problems with your use of English, and as an English-native speaker, I find the entire book extremely confusing and often vague and deficient in its purpose.  If you would like me to assist you in your writings, please contact me, and I will do so. Otherwise, I'll start editing your book to better convey your sentiments. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:Pengson|Pengson]] ([[User talk:Pengson|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Pengson|contribs]]) 07:07, 18 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

Hello, Murtaza :) I was hoping you would give my post (&quot;Failed Editing Attempts&quot;) on the discussion page of your book, &quot;How To Be A Good Student&quot; a read. Thanks in advance.

== GCC internals manual ==

There's already an &quot;official&quot; GCC internals manual from the FSF, licensed under the GFDL [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/].  If we really want to also have a wikibook, why not start with the FSF manual's contents? [[User:71.141.251.153|71.141.251.153]] 04:57, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

== GEM ? ==

Are &quot;GCC Extensibility Modules&quot; part of GCC suite ? Since most part of the book is about GEMs I think the title is misleading. Please change it to something like &quot;Using GEMs with GCC&quot;, indeed this book says really little about GCC internals.

Thanks,

== Inheritance == 

Inheritance is the ability to create a class from another class, the &quot;parent&quot; class, extending the functionality and state of the parent in the derived, or &quot;child&quot; class. It allows derived classes to overload methods from their parent class.

Inheritance is one of the pillars of object-orientation. It is the mechanism of designing one class from another and is one of the ideas for code reusability, supporting the concept of hierarchical classification. C# programs consist of classes, where new classes can either be created from scratch or by using some or all properties of an existing class.

Another feature related to inheritance and reusability of code is polymorphism, which permits the same method name to be used for different operations on different data types. Thus, C# supports code reusability by both features.

Important characteristics of inheritance include:

# A derived class extends its base class. That is, it contains the methods and data of its parent class, and it can also contain its own data members and methods.
# The derived class cannot change the definition of an inherited member.
# Constructors and destructors are not inherited. All other members of the base class are inherited.
# The accessibility of a member in the derived class depends upon its declared accessibility in the base class.
# A derived class can override an inherited member.

An example of inheritance:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Text;

namespace ContainmentInheritance
{
    class Room
    {
        public int length;
        public int width;
        public int height;
        public string name;

        public Room(int l, int w, int h)
        {
            length = l;
            width = w;
            height = h;
        }
    }

    class Home
    {
        int numberOfRooms;
        int plotSize;
        string locality;

        // create an object of class Room inside class Home
        Room studyRoom = new Room(10, 12, 12);

        public Home()
        {
            numberOfRooms = 1;
            plotSize = 1000;
            locality = &quot;Versova&quot;;
            name = &quot;study room&quot;;
        }

        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;MyHome has {0} rooms&quot;, numberOfRooms);
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Plot size is {0}&quot;, plotSize);
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Locality is {0}&quot;, locality);

            int area = studyRoom.length*studyRoom.width;
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Area of the {0} room is {1}&quot;, name, area);
        }
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Home myhome = new Home();
            myhome.Display();

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subtyping Inheritance ==

The code sample below shows two classes, {{C sharp|Employee}} and {{C sharp|Executive}}.
{{C sharp|Employee}} has the methods {{C sharp|GetPayCheck}} and {{C sharp|Work}}.

We want the {{C sharp|Executive}} class to have the same methods, but differently implemented and one extra method, {{C sharp|AdministerEmployee}}.

Below is the creation of the first class to be derived from.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Employee
{
    // We declare one method virtual so that the Executive class can
    // override it.
    public virtual void GetPayCheck()
    {
        // Get paycheck logic here.
    }

    //Employee's and Executives both work, so no virtual here needed.
    public void Work()
    {
        // Do work logic here.
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we create an {{C sharp|Executive}} class that will override the {{C sharp|GetPayCheck}} method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Executive : Employee
{
    // The override keyword indicates we want new logic behind the GetPayCheck method.
    public override void GetPayCheck()
    {
        // New getpaycheck logic here.
    }

    // The extra method is implemented.
    public void AdministerEmployee()
    {
        // Manage employee logic here
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You'll notice that there is no {{C sharp|Work}} method in the {{C sharp|Executive}} class, as it is inherited from {{C sharp|Employee}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Employee emp = new Employee();
    Executive exec = new Executive();

    emp.Work();
    exec.Work();
    emp.GetPayCheck();
    exec.GetPayCheck();
    exec.AdministerEmployee();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Virtual Methods ==
If a base class contains a virtual method that it calls elsewhere and a derived class overrides that virtual method, the base class will actually call the derived class' method:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Resource : IDisposable
{
    private bool _isClosed = false;    // good programming practice initialise, although default
    
    protected virtual void Close()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Base resource closer called!&quot;);
    }
    
    ~Resource()
    {
        Dispose();
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (!_isClosed)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Disposing resource and calling the Close() method...&quot;);
            _isClosed = true;
            Close();
        }
    }
}

public class AnotherTypeOfResource : Resource
{
    protected override void Close()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Another type of resource closer called!&quot;);
    }
}

public class VirtualMethodDemo
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Resource res = new Resource();
        AnotherTypeOfResource res2 = new AnotherTypeOfResource();
        
        res.Dispose();  // Resource.Close() will be called.
        res2.Dispose(); // Even though Dispose() is part of the Resource class, 
                        // the Resource class will call AnotherTypeOfResource.Close()!
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Constructors ==
A derived class does not automatically inherit the base class' constructors, and it cannot be instantiated unless it provides its own. A derived class must call one of its base class' constructors by using the {{C sharp/kw|base}} keyword:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MyBaseClass
{
    public MyBaseClass(string text)
    {
        console.WriteLine(test);
    }
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    public MyDerivedClass(int number)
        : base(number.ToString())
    { }
    
    public MyDerivedClass(string text) // even though this is exactly the same as MyBaseClass'  
    // only constructor, this is still necessary as constructors are not inherited.
        : base(text)
    { }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Inheritance keywords == 
The way C# inherits from another class syntactically is by using the {{C sharp|:}} operator.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Executive : Employee
&lt;/source&gt;

To indicate a method that can be overridden, you mark the method with {{C sharp/kw|virtual}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public virtual void Write(string text)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Text:{0}&quot;, text);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To override a method, use the &lt;code&gt;{{C sharp/kw|override}}&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public override void Write(string  text)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine(text);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A missing {{C sharp|new}} or {{C sharp|override}} keyword for a derived method may result in errors or warnings during compilation.:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| title      = C# design: Why is new/override required on abstract methods but not on virtual methods? / Answer
| quote      = Using either the C# 3.0 compiler as shipped in .NET 3.5 SP1, or the C# 4.0 compiler as shipped in .NET 4.0, I get the following error for your first example: [...] And the following warning for the second one: [...] In the first case it's an error because you aren't actually overriding the base method, which means there is no implementation for the abstract method in a concrete class. In the second case it's a warning because the code is technically correct, but the compiler suspects that it isn't what you meant. This is one of the reasons it's generally a good idea to enable the &quot;treat warnings as errors&quot; compilation setting.
| url        = http://efreedom.com/Question/1-3634529/CSharp-Design-New-Override-Required-Abstract-Methods-Virtual-Methods}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Here an example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
abstract class ShapesA
{
    abstract public int Area(); // abstract!
}

class Square : ShapesA
{
    int x, y;

    public int Area() // Error: missing 'override' or 'new'
    {
        return x * y;
    }
} 

class Shapes
{
    virtual public int Area() { return 0; } // it is virtual now!
}

class Square : Shapes
{
    int x, y;

    public int Area() // no explicit 'override' or 'new' required
    { return x * y; }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{C sharp|Square}} class method {{C sharp|Area()}} will result in a compilation error, if it is derived from the {{C sharp|ShapesA}} class:

 error CS0534: 'ConsoleApplication3.Square' does not implement inherited abstract member
 'ConsoleApplication3.Shapes.Area()'

The same method will result in a compilation warning, if derived from the normal {{C sharp|Shapes}} class:

 warning CS0114: 'ConsoleApplication3.Square.Area()' hides inherited member 'ConsoleApplication3.Shapes.Area()'.
 To make the current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new
 keyword.

A Microsoft dotNET Assembly is an exe or dll. Assemblies are the basic unit of deployment. An assembly consists of 4 components:
# Assembly Metadata (also known as Assembly Manifest)
#*This is sort of like a packaging list of everything that is required for this assembly to work. A manifest contains:
#*#Version requirements
#*#Security Identity
#*#Scope of assembly
# Type Metadata 
# IL (Intermediate Language)
# Resources

.NET Framework is a common environment for building, deploying, and running Web Services, Web Applications, Windows Services and Windows Applications. The .NET Framework contains common class libraries - like ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Windows Forms - to provide advanced standard services that can be integrated into a variety of computer systems.

== Introduction ==
In June 2000 Microsoft  released both the .NET platform and a new program language called C#. C# is a general-purpose OOP language designed to give optimum simplicity, expansiveness, and performance. Its syntax is very similar to Java, with the major difference being that all variable types are derived from a common ancestor class.

C# is a language in itself. It can perform mathematical and logical operations, variable assignment and other expected traits of a programming language. This in itself is not flexible enough for more complex applications. At some stage, the developer will want to interact with the host system whether it be reading files or downloading content from the Internet.

The .NET framework is a toolset developed for the Windows platform to allow the developer to interact with the host system or any external entity whether it be another process, or another computer. The &lt;em&gt;.NET&lt;/em&gt; platform is a Windows platform-specific implementation. Other operating systems have their own implementations due to the differences in the operating systems I/O management, security models and interfaces.

== Background ==

* Originally called NGWS (Next Generation Windows Services).
* .NET does not run ''in'' any browser. It is a ''runtime'' language ([[:w:Common Language Runtime|Common Language Runtime]]) like the Java runtime. By contrast, [[w:Microsoft Silverlight|Microsoft Silverlight]] &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; run in a browser.
* .NET is based on the newest Web standards.
* .NET is built on the following Internet standards:
** HTTP, the communication protocol between Internet Applications
** SOAP, the standard format for requesting Web Services
** UDDI, the standard to search and discover Web Services
** XML, the format for exchanging data between Internet Applications

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called TantalumTelluride. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name TantalumTelluride~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Correction ===

I took out this section because it didn't work on my TI-83

When using &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; to regulate the execution of more than one instruction, it is important to indicate the end of the set of instructions with an &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt;.  Without the &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt;, only the instruction immediately follwing the &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement will be reguated while the rest will be executed indifferent to the value of the criteria.

For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
::If X&gt;3
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
:Disp &quot;My Name is Seth&quot;
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

will display &quot;Hello World!&quot; followed by &quot;My name is Seth&quot; if X (the user's input) is greater than 3, and will display only &quot;My name is Seth&quot; if X is less than 3.  This is beacsue &lt;tt&gt;:Disp &quot;My Name is Seth&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is executed regardless what the value of X is.  Meanwhile,

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
::If X&gt;3
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
:Disp &quot;My Name is Seth&quot;
:End
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

will display &quot;Hello World!&quot; followed by &quot;My name is Seth&quot; if X is greater than 3 and will display nothing if X is less than 3.  This is because the execution of all the intructions between &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt; is regulated by the criteria stated after &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt;.</text>

==Zigzwang==
i edited the zigzwang module,jus a bit,felt the definition was not clear or even wrong,i think even the explanation have to be rewritten. fanx-johnson

I agree, I think that it should be clearer. I don't think I'm the person to do it as I'm someone who understands the game but is not knowledgable in the game. Perhaps make it clearer that the pawn is protected (rook or bishop) and define why the king cannot simply move in front of the pawn. --[[User:Doc0tis|Nathan]] 22:42, 6 January 2006 (UTC)--[[User:207.54.103.2|207.54.103.2]] 22:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

== Capitalization ==

Just wanted to ask...do we capatalize piece names &quot;Bishop, Knight&quot; regardless of their position within a sentence or not?  I have seen this applied randomly and just wanted to check.

--[[User:IRelayer|IRelayer]] 20:46, 12 January 2006 (UTC)


== King worth 3.5? ==
This doesn't make sense to me. Is there citation to explain how the King could be worth 3.5 (and thus logically worth less than both a rook and a queen) when the entire point of the game is to capture the other player's King while defending your own? The King's value should be infinite.

==utter nonsense==
&quot;Games are considered open if the central pawns have been captured, and closed if they have not. Semi-closed games refer to games where some mix of the center pawns have been captured.&quot;
What ignorant bulls**t; that's not an accurate definition at all. And it just gets worse. Get someone who actually knows something about chess to write this thing, or toss it on the junkpile; as it is, it's worse than useless, and gives the impression that Wikibooks is a joke. {{Unsigned|98.108.225.240|09:37, 18 January 2011}}
:Yes, agree about that sentence. How about correcting it yourself? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SunCreator|contribs]]) 01:33, 22 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Plan==
Asset allocation is an important part of investing, and thus a wikibook on the topic should have both instruction and data.  Numerous authors have written on the subject (Rick Ferri, William Bernstein, etc.) and citing their recommendations should be fine.  Additionally, a large data set should be present here: historical prices and returns for a variety of asset classes, including the stock market, certain components of the stock market (SV, etc.), real estate, international stocks (from various regions), treasuries, bond market, high yield bonds, inflation protected securities, etc.  From this data we should have rolling correlation values between all asset classes.  I'm suggesting a working plan as follows:

*Introduction (cite studies showing the power of AA)
*General information on asset classes and role in a portfolio (i.e. return/risk/correlation, ''not'' how each one &quot;works&quot;)
**Domestic stocks
**International stocks
**Real estate (including REITS)
**Government bonds
**Investment-grade bonds
**High-yield bonds
**Precious metals
*Suggested portfolios (based on various factors)
**Risk tolerance
*Appendices
**Raw data for all asset classes
**Correlation and return graphs/tables

Feel free to propose changes/discuss. --[[User:Spangineer|Spangineer]] 21:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

==Raw data sources==
Looking for these so that tables can be constructed for return and correlations.  So far I've got [http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm]; it looks pretty solid.  I'm planning to create charts and compare them to previously published charts to ensure their quality, and once that's done, add them here to appropriate pages. --[[User:Spangineer|Spangineer]]&lt;sup&gt;[[:w:User:Spangineer|wp]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Spangineer|(háblame)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 15:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called DrABomb. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name DrABomb~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Introduction==

Wikijunior books welcomes you to the Wikijunior book “Dinosaurs”. Dinosaurs were the biggest animals ever to walk this Earth, and their stories excite the imagination of kids of all ages. Dinosaurs have long been extinct, but the creativity of a child is so great that it can be benefited even by learning of a creature that walked the Earth millions of years ago. The importance of this task has led many experts here at Wikibooks to donate their time and talents to bring this volume together.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing free, easily available quality reading for both children and adults to promote the global spread of knowledge. Traditional publishing houses make the bulk of their income from re-issues of classic books, new books by authors with long track records, or celebrities who are famous in their own right. Within Wikibooks, the research is new, the facts gathered by thousands of tireless volunteers who work without pay, without compensation, and without the urging of others. The works you see here are a labor of love on the part of the contributors and their only wish is that their knowledge be shared with the world freely.

{{WJ Dinosaurs}}

With this project we have reached a crossroad between the books of yesterday, and the encyclopedia of everything for tomorrow. Simply by reading this book and telling your friends, you have advanced the cause of free access to information and of democratizing the field of publishing. Thank you for the opportunity; in return, our gift to you is to learn the tale of the greatest creatures that ever lived. Everyone who contributed to this book hopes that you find adventure in this book, adventure and knowledge.

This book will give you a basic understanding of dinosaurs and some of the events that happened in their time. Of all the creatures that have walked this Earth, few have captured our imagination and fed our desire for knowledge like the dinosaurs have.

== One Day Millions Of Years Ago ==

One day, you are walking through a prehistoric forest, you hear a twig snap behind you. You turn, slowly, hoping that it isn’t what you think it is. Standing behind you is a ''Stegosaurus'', chomping away on some leafy ferns. You breathe a sigh of relief. You were afraid it was a predator with its eye on you as a tasty snack. Of course, that was millions of years ago, so it could only happen in your imagination. In fact it was so long ago that there were no people around at all; there weren't even any apes or monkeys yet! 

The prehistoric world of the dinosaurs is both strange and exciting. Many things were very different from what you see today. Some dinosaurs stood taller than buildings, and others weighed as much as your entire family put together. Some dinosaurs were small enough to fit in your backpack. Some would not hesitate to eat you on the spot if they were hungry. Others spent all day chomping on ferns and other plants. The one kind of dinosaur that never existed was a dull dinosaur! 

There is so much to know about dinosaurs. What is a dinosaur? How is it different from animals today? Are there any dinosaurs living now?  Where did dinosaurs live? What did they eat? What did they look like? Why are they gone? How do we know about dinosaurs? Were other animals living at the time of the dinosaurs? How did dinosaurs get their food? Did dinosaurs sleep? How did dinosaurs move? How did dinosaurs protect themselves? Did dinosaurs fight? Could dinosaurs swim? How big was a baby dinosaur? Were dinosaurs poisonous?  No matter how long this book is, it could never cover everything there is to know about every dinosaur. If you wish to learn more about dinosaurs, you can find lots of information at the library. You can check out the reference section in the back of the book. You can also visit natural history museums.

== General Overview ==

'''''Platform Nine and Three Quarters''''' is a secret platform at King's Cross Station in London. From this location students for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] are able to catch the Hogwarts Express train. This train runs directly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Station]], close by the school.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''Platform Nine and Three Quarters''''' is reached by leaning against, or running through, the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross Station. It is apparently physically located within the confines of the station, though perhaps at a lower level, as the train does seem to pass through an appropriate area of London as it leaves the city. Leaving the platform is generally done by walking through an archway, and a wizard railway guard allows only a few students through at a time to prevent alarming the Muggles when a large number of students appear through a solid brick wall.

The platform has been used in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|third]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 12|fourth]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 10|fifth]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 7|sixth]] year, as the place for last-minute questions and warnings, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] depart the place they have been through the summer for another year at Hogwarts. In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|first year]], of course, it was the stage for the initial meeting between the Weasley children then attending Hogwarts (Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]]), and Harry; it proved inaccessible in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|second year]] due to the well-intentioned but misguided actions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf]]; and as Harry did not attend school in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|his seventh year]], we never reached this platform.

== Analysis ==

While the platform might well have been intended to be the place where we change from Muggle to magical life, it has only actually acted as that transition once, in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. In the other four books where it is a factor, and in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' where it is inaccessible, Harry has been living in the magical world for at least a short time before the trip to the station: three times at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], once at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Leaky Cauldron|the Leaky Cauldron]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], and once at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]]. 

That is not to say that it is not a transition; in each case, it is a return to school, and thus to a place where Harry's own use of magic is not only permitted, but required. Harry, as an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|underage wizard]], is of course not allowed to use magic anywhere except school. It seems that the largely unsupervised Hogwarts Express is seen as an extension of school, for the purposes of determining whether magic is allowed. Thus, the transition from the repressed world of the underage wizard, to the free world of the wizard who is able to cast spells, seems to happen on the platform.

The reverse transition, of course, happens in the other direction. Stepping off the train and onto Platform Nine and Three Quarters is a return to the world of the underage wizard, a return to the world where magic must be repressed or hidden for fear of frightening the Muggles. We see, in each of the first five books, Harry's reluctance to approach that transition, to return to the unexciting life he perforce must share with the Dursleys.

There is some question, of course, as to why so many students travel on the Express. London is in the south of mainland Britain, and Hogwarts is in the north. Would it not make sense for students who live further to the north, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]], who is apparently Irish (although we don't know where he lives over the summer), to travel directly to Hogwarts, rather than detouring far to the south of Britain to London and then heading further north to Scotland? This question is never addressed, though it may be worth pointing out that a lot of the British rail network is what is called a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; topology. For reasons dating back to the early days of the railroads, it seems that almost all railroads run to or from one of the several London stations, with relatively few interconnections. It may be simpler to connect with the Express in London than to try and find a train that runs in a more direct manner, particularly since Hogsmeade, as an all-magical village, likely does not appear on many rail schedules.

It is mentioned on the [http://www.pottermore.com Pottermore web site] that travel on the Hogwarts Express has been mandated by Wizarding law, in order to prevent mass migration of students at the start and end of the school year, and use of more dangerous means of transportation. No suggestion is made as to why mass migration to London at the same times is considered less alarming to the Muggles.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|seventh and final book]], of course, Harry does not attend school, and so the transition from Muggle to Wizarding worlds does not occur. However, in the opening chapters of that book, Harry reaches his seventeenth birthday and comes of age. At this point, he is allowed to do magic on his own, and so the transition from repression to encouragement of magic does not require boarding the Hogwarts Express. As he has also left [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley house]] for the last time, there have already been fairly major transitions, so adding another one would be superfluous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Poorly Written ==
I wrote it, and I realize this.  Something needs to be done to it, and it needs to be expanded in some way.  I was thinking of including a short little story making it fun while being informative, but I didn't have time, I will return though.  Like it says on the cover discusion page, '''nothing is sacred''' rip, tear, rewrite, and edit the heck out of everything.  We don't even have a rough draft done right now!  The book is just a collection of thoughts, and the research isn't done.  So, if anyone has any Ideas for the introduction, may you edit in peace.

=== After several rewrites ===

Still poorly written, but I believe its better.  I stole a section of it out of Wikijunior's Big Cats, but just because I like the forward alot.  Still, I don't think it shows enough...of something, but I am lost for what it needs, if anyone out there see the missing link, please fill it in.

== Bias ==

This module appears highly biased. Educational material should at least inform the reader that a controversy exists. I'm talking mostly about the origin of life and how old it is.

How would someone counter an argument from the &quot;opposition&quot; if they don't even know the view point exists?

:Note that not only is this wikibook not complete, it is also not all inclusive.  If you feel that the book needs a bit of information or another section, create it, or discus it in a friendly mannor on the discussion page.  Please note that no one and no group of people will ever enjoy being called biased, no matter wether or not how true it might be.  Secondly, your comment seems to sugest that the science comunity is torn apart by this issue, which is plainly not true.  Few scientists agree with the intelligent design, and most with evolution and the idea that the earth is very old.  No matter what you say, that is true.  One of the great things about the spirit of free knowledge and free inquiry that wikipedia and wikibooks provides you however is that it does not require that you agree with the majority.  I think if enough people are going to be offended by the lack of an alternitive mentioned in this book, then write a section, let future readers of this book know of an alternative that exists in this world to the facts and information they are being given.  You must face the cold hard reality of the magority, and the cold hard reality presented by the facts.  If one day scientists prove that an intelligent being created the world, I will be happy, for science would have triumphed and our knowledge of the world would be one bit more complete.  Until that day, I will stick with that which seems moost likely, and has had the most evidence, and the most backing.--[[User:Pampaeditor|Pampaeditor]] 22:42, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
::I think the anyonamous author above is reffering to the creation-darwin &quot;contoversy&quot; which has mostly vanished in the last century. This is not valid here. The scientific facts here are what must be accepted. WikiMedia is not a religious institution and therefore the views of a certain group must not be represented over those as another. Creationisim can be discussed in another book, but here, where the dinosaurs are the subject matter, one must assume that they existed if one wishes to write about them.

--[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 00:15, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

: Anonymous poster, the only &quot;controversy&quot; is entirely generated by religious hacks, 99% of whom don't have any formal education in biology, geology, or paleontology. Their ignorance does not constitute evidence, nor does it make for a very good argument.

'''TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS: Please Sign your Talk!'''

Another bias I noticed is in the statement, &quot;Dinosaurs were the greatest beings to ever walk this Earth.&quot; Saying &quot;greatest&quot; violates the NPOV policy. Could we please be more specific? --[[User:Gray Porpoise|Gray Porpoise]] 01:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
: &quot;Dinosaurs were the largest creatures known to have walked the earth&quot;? I think that might be what the author meant, but it doesn't convey the fact that dinosaurs varied greatly in size.

== Editing ==

I am making some small edits to make the flow of the Intro more real, sincere, and less chopy. The content included is good and it states all the right ideas, but it is in need of a non-author editor. I would encourage each and every person on the project to take a look themselves!
P.S. The spelling in this article is completely correct as of my edit   
at the time below

== You hear a twig snap ==

Sure it's a nice line, grabs attention. But it also reinforces the myth that humans and dinosaurs have coexisted. I've added a bit about &quot;it could only happen in your imagination&quot; to counter that. [[User:203.22.236.14|203.22.236.14]] 09:23, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
: Or write it explicitly from the POV of another dinosaur. [[Special:Contributions/68.127.123.197|68.127.123.197]] ([[User talk:68.127.123.197|talk]]) 22:31, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

== Some ideas ==

Eugh! I know what you mean!  Paleontology can't be an easy topic to discuss with juniors in a meaningful way.  I have a dreadful book aimed at kids which starts off &quot;Dinosaurs were a group of really successful, land-dwelling creatures that dominated Earth bewteen X million and Y million years ago.&quot; Really! It must be hard for a paleontologist to talk to children. I have just typed in what I told my five-year-old, 8 lines.  Hope it's religiously inclusive enough for you all (heh heh).  I'm NOT going to change a word of what you put in your introduction because my description is aimed at younger people, but if you see anything you like cut and paste - it's my own work, you can have it.

&quot;''For thousands of years'' - since before the first history books - people have been digging things up out of the ground.  

Here are some of the things we dig up: '''amber''', for jewellery, '''flint''', for arrows; '''clay''', for making pots; '''Slate''' for roof tiles; '''chalk''' for drawing; '''peat''', which burns easily in fires and so on.

Now, some rocks come from volcanoes when they spit out globs of molten rock, which cools down and goes hard.  No volcanic rocks contain bones (but they might have diamonds in them!).  Another way rocks are made is by being built up over time  --  by layer upon layer of mud and sand from a river that floods from time to time.  The lower levels can be very hard.  Slate, for example, is a type of stone made from compressed mud.  With these rocks, the deeper you dig, the older the mud that you are digging up. These types of rock sometimes contain the skeleton of an animal that has been buried in the mud.

From time to time people would dig up big - and I mean REALLY big bones.  When this happened, it caused a bit of a problem for the people that wanted to know what animal the bone came from, because we know about all the animals that live in the world today and there aren't any with bones that big.  Judging by how deep they were, they must have been from a long time ago.

People came up with ideas to explain how it could be that you can a) have bones and b) not have any animals with those bones.  Here are some explanations people came up with: that there was an enormous flood that drowned nearly all the creatures on Earth, and all the creatures alive today have descended from the ones that escaped the flood.  Another idea was they are the bones of dragons - gigantic and powerful reptiles[1].

As time went on, more and more of the bones have been unearthed and we have now got a lot of skeletons.  We have also learned how to tell exactly how old they are, and when we arrange them in date order we have a '''fossil record''' that shows how 'modern' dinosaurs evolved from 'primitive' dinosaurs.  We have also found winged, feathered dinosaurs, which look like they could have been distant relatives of birds today.

One day, about sixty-five million years ago, something happened and now the dinosaurs are all dead.  Nobody is quite sure what happened, but the rock at that depth has a lot of soot in it. You can find dinosaur bones below that line, but you never see any above the line.  Most people think that there was a huge disaster that caused a lot of fires and changed the Earth's climate so the dinosaurs died out.  Nobody really knows for sure, but it could have been caused by an asteroid hitting the Earth.  We do know that very large asteroid hit the Earth around the time the dinosaurs died out and the crater it left behind is 180 km or 112 Miles across[2].

We also sometimes find the bones of people (human remains).  The oldest human remains are about 100,000 years old[3], which is much less than 65 million years, so at no time has a human ever met a dinosaur.&quot;

PS. Tend to agree with the comment about the twig snapping - you'll need a time machine if you want to keep it with a person in it.     -- M-streeter97</text>

== Reads acwardly and is shallow ==
Prose needs to be cleaned up, and it needs more depth.
:please sign talk! this is how you make the link &quot;User:Username|Username&quot; thanks [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]

== Humility ==
Agreed.  By [[User:Pampaeditor|Pampaeditor]] Jan 7.

== When to abbreviate? ==
We really need to decide when to say the cute name and when to use the full one. Do we introduce the short one and say &quot;let's just call him T-Rex&quot; and use it afterwards, or should the full name lead each section before reverting the the short name once more? [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Factoids ==
Would it be possible to create a list of interesting facts (on this page, perhaps) that should probably be worked into the text?  For instance, I remember being fairly impressed as a kid that T Rex's estimated running speed was 35 miles per hour.  I remember there being numerous other things like this that can give a 'wow' factor or help put size and power in modern context.  [[User:N Vale|N Vale]] 19:47, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== T, Rex ==

Rather than a hypen we should use a Period. Cause T stands for something. [[User:N1person|N1person]] 18:12, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

:Hm, well, I disagree. The hypen has been used so long and so widely, if we did otherwise we'd merely end up explaining why we'd changed it in the first place. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I see no problem with having breif grammer lesson in the book. :) [[User:N1person|N1person]] 03:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

:::I think Garrett is right its really more understandable for young kids just to use the hyphen especially because Tyranasaurus is not really in their vocab. [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 22:47 6 February, 2006

&quot;T. rex&quot; is correct, though. Giving incorrect imformation is a type of vandalising. [[User:Dora Nichov|Dora Nichov]] 12:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

==T-Rex==
The T-Rex page now appears unreadable in my opinion. It looks like the sentences are ending all over the place. Young Kids will take one look at this and see A LOT of T.'s whoever put that in please change it 
—[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]


Ive done my edit on whats already been written!
--[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 23:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Great project! Made some corrections  ==


I just recently found this project. I am thrilled that a project aimed at children is underway. As a homeschool mom with 9 and 4yo boys, I see a lot of potential here. I do not see that potential being fully realized, but I am sure it will eventually mature. I am hoping to jump in and become an active participant.

As for this page, I went and corrected some spelling errors. There is also the inconsistency with the two different abbreviation conventions (T-rex and T.rex). I can see the discussion already going on about it. T-rex is what children will recognize. I did not want to change the T.s if there is still a question, but if nobody objects I will be happy to make it consistently T-rex.

My 9yo has volunteered to be a test reader. He is a gifted kid with very high reading ability, but he is good at identifying what will be appropriate for &quot;normal&quot; 9yo's. I will pass along his comments.

== About the size of the eyes ==

The article says that &quot;Their bodies could easily be spotted by their forward lean, their short but deep jaws, their huge teeth, '''large eyes''', long tail, and tiny arms&quot; but also that &quot;Due to their '''small eyes'''--&quot;. So does the T-rex have small or large eyes? -[[User:80.220.34.82|80.220.34.82]] 13:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for pointing out, and sorry for the slow response (Wikijunior Dinosaurs are rather inactive now).  I am not certain what the original authors meant, but I have rephrased these parts - should be clearer now.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 08:32, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

The universe is a big place &amp;mdash; too big for us to comprehend. But how big? Astronomers have struggled with this question for millennia, and their view of the known universe has steadily grown to immense and incomprehensible sizes. It’s an important question, and a basic part of our grasp of the universe itself. To study astronomy, it’s essential to understand what’s out there, how everything relates, and where we fit in the universe. The problem is that the '''size scales''', the relative general sizes of classes of objects, are too foreign for things much larger than Earth. In a big universe, this can be a challenge. To tackle the problem, let's try to connect the familiar life-size world around us with the unfamiliar cosmic size scales.

[[image:Craie1.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]

If you're a student, you probably watch your instructor write on the chalkboard almost every day. The chalkboard is something you're much more familiar with than the whole universe because you can see it and touch it. You ''know'' the size of the board, the chalk, the markings, the eraser, and so on because they’re right at hand. How much bigger is the board than a dot made on the board with a piece of chalk? It turns out that the answer is about a thousand, for an average sized chalkboard, and a fair sized chalk dot.

Now let's consider something that's a thousand times the size of a blackboard. A blackboard is a few meters across, so we want to think about something a few kilometers across. That's something like the size of a small city. If a city is 1000 times larger than a chalkboard and a chalkboard is 1000 times larger than the mark on a chalkboard, that's a useful connection that helps us think about the size of a city: ''we can say that the chalkboard in the city is like the mark on the chalkboard''.

In this way we will now step out from the city into the larger universe. With each step, we will consider something (very roughly) a thousand times larger than the last step. As we move out, each stop in our journey will be much smaller than the next, like a mark on a chalkboard.



A city is much larger than the blackboard we used as a reference point, but it's still something we are very familiar with. Many people drive across part of their home city and back again every day. It's possible to drive through most small cities in a half hour or so, even with stoplights, and it only takes a few hours to walk from one end to the other. As promised, the next step out will be much larger and farther from our everyday experience. Our next stop will have a size of several thousand kilometers, and that's the size of Earth.

In a car, you can drive across a city in less than an hour, even at a slow speed. If you could drive around the Earth at a speed of 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour), going day and night over land and water, it would take a full 17 days. Remember, driving through a small city at 60 miles per hour would only take a few minutes. Seventeen days is much, much longer than a few minutes. The fastest jets, which have a top speed of about {{convert|2,000|mi|km}} per hour, can make the trip around the world much faster. At that speed, you could circle the Earth in 11 hours. Even speeds like that will quickly become inadequate as we continue moving out into the universe.

The size of Earth is typical of the sizes of the rocky planets, the '''terrestrial planets''', but planets made mostly of gas such as Jupiter and Saturn are larger by a factor of several to ten. In general, we can expect the same kinds of things to have similar properties. Given no other information about a planet, we might guess its radius to be the same as Earth's. If we knew that our imaginary planet were a much larger gas giant, we might change our estimate and guess that the planet has the same radius as, say, Saturn. 

This size scale represents the vast majority of human experience. Only a small number of people have ever been in Earth orbit, and these people remained very close to Earth. Most of the satellites launched remain ''very'' close to Earth. The shuttle, for example, orbits at an altitude of only a few hundred kilometers &amp;mdash; a few percent of the radius of Earth. Some spacecraft are sent to other planets or to the Moon, but the majority stays at the scale of this step in our journey. Only 24 people &amp;mdash; the Apollo astronauts &amp;mdash; have ever left Earth's orbit to visit the next stop on our journey.

[[image:Earth and Moon.bjb.svg|thumb|center|380px|This illustration shows the Earth and the Moon scaled to their relative sizes and distances. The two are very small and far apart, and the Earth-Moon system is surrounded by huge expanse of empty space. This view is only a small piece of the fifth step in our journey, and Earth is already becoming very tiny.]]

As we continue to move out, we reach a size of about 1000 times the size of the Earth. The distance to the Moon is about 30 times the diameter of Earth, so the Moon is easily within reach in this step, but there's little else in the remaining distance. The nearest planets, Mars and Venus, are out of our reach. Aside from the Earth and Moon, we find the space in the neighborhood Earth to be almost completely empty, with only the occasional passage of an asteroid or comet.

Although the Moon seems nearby when we consider the huge space surrounding the Earth-Moon system, we should remember that the Earth and Moon are really very far apart. If we could get in a car and drive to the Moon, the trip would take five months of driving nonstop, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. If our jet could go to the Moon, it would take five days to get there. These trips are becoming longer now, but they're still manageable. The trip by foot is much longer, though &amp;mdash; a walk to the Moon would take nine years! Light travels faster than anything else in the universe. It has a speed of {{convert|300,000|km|mi|sigfig=3|abbr=off}} per ''second''. At this speed, light can travel to the Moon in just over one second. This distance, the distance light travels in one second, is called a '''light-second'''.

[[Image:Voyager solar system.bjb.jpg|thumb|400px|This mosaic image of the Sun and six planets was taken by the Voyager spacecraft from beyond the planets. Earth is barely visible as a blue dot in one of the frames, almost lost in the glare from sunlight. The Voyager spacecraft, which view the orbits of the planets from outside, are the most distant man-made objects from Earth. Notice that the two terrestrial planets, Venus and Earth, are much nearer the Sun than the others.]]

Another step out will give us reach to most of the planets. We now encompass the bulk of the '''Solar System''', the system comprising the Sun and all of the objects orbiting around it. This size scale is about five billion kilometers across, 30 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The distance from the Earth to the Sun is a convenient standard for measurement in the Solar System, so astronomers use the average Earth-Sun distance as a standard unit called the '''astronomical unit (AU)'''. One astronomical unit is equal to about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. We can say that we are now working at a size scale of 30 astronomical units, or 30 AU for short. A box this size centered on the Earth will comfortably fit Saturn's orbit, but Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are still too far away. For much of human history, none of the Solar System objects outside of this box were known to exist.

Remember that our size scale has increased from the last step by a huge factor, a factor of 1000. Using our jet to take a trip from Earth to Saturn would take about fifty years. Light takes about 80 minutes to travel from Saturn to Earth, depending on where Earth and Saturn are in their orbits. Because it takes so long for light to make the trip from Saturn, the light we see from the planet at a given moment actually left 80 minutes ago. This means that we don't see Saturn as it is presently, but as it was 80 minutes ago. This means that looking out into space is like looking back in time. The farther we look, the older the light. This is not very important for Saturn, but it will become more important as the size scales increase.

As before, we can use the speed of light as a measure of distance. A light-second is the distance light travels in one second. Likewise, a light-minute is the distance light travels in one minute. That means that Saturn is 80 light-minutes away. In the same way, we could write that Saturn is 1.3 light-hours away, and that's about the same as the Saturn's distance from the Sun. Saturn's orbit is ''much'' bigger than Earth's orbit, which is only 8 light-minutes in radius. This is a striking and important fact about the Solar System &amp;mdash; the rocky planets, the terrestrial planets, orbit close to the Sun and close to each other, but the giant gas planets, the '''Jovian planets''', orbit at greater distances and have more widely spaced orbits.

The next step in our journey will encompass a distance of 30,000 AU, or half a light-year. Although this step completely encloses the planets, Solar System objects are found at much greater distances. These objects form the '''Oort cloud''', a vast, sparse region of comets surrounding the Sun. The Oort cloud is almost empty, but it's there just the same. At this step we've only covered a piece of the range of influence of the Sun, and plenty of Oort cloud remains out of our reach. The Oort cloud is thought to extend out from the Sun as much as two light-years.

If we look just beyond this step, we find the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, at about four light-years. It will take ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' 80,000 years to reach this star. (These ships, launched in 1977, have a speed of 51,500 km/hour.) As other stars enter into the picture, the Sun will no longer be the dominant source of gravity. This means that we can expect the solar system to really end as we begin approaching other stars.

Our next step out places us in a 500 light-year box. This size scale is easily large enough to fit the Sun, Alpha Centauri, and many other stars. In fact, about 250,000 stars are within 500 light-years of Earth. Astronomers refer to this region as the Solar Neighborhood. As we've seen, the stars in the Milky Way are very far apart, with vast stretches of mostly empty space separating them.

Stars in the Solar Neighborhood (and throughout space) are mostly small and faint. If these fainter stars were much farther away, they would be too faint to see from Earth. Much brighter stars are more rare, but they can be seen from much farther away. Because of this, two &quot;kinds&quot; of stars fill the sky from Earth: stars that are intrinsically faint but nearby, and stars that are bright and more distant.

[[image:Milky Way 2005.jpg|thumb|This painting illustrates how the Milky Way might look if it could be viewed from outside. It has a bright central bar with four spiral arms coming out from the center. Individual stars are much too small and faint to see in this picture.]]

As we continue outward in our journey, we see the random scattering of stars form into a pattern. Spiral structure emerges, and we see that the Earth, the Solar System, and nearby stars are collected together into an orderly system of stars called a '''galaxy'''. Our galaxy is called the '''Milky Way Galaxy'''. 

Like the Solar System, the Galaxy is shaped like a flat disk, but the Galaxy is much bigger. Our galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and the Solar System is only one member contained inside. The Sun is located in the spiral arms of the galaxy about two thirds of the way from the center, and it orbits around the center of the galaxy with all the other stars. If the Milky Way were fifty miles long, the Solar System would only be a dot the size of the tip of a ball point pen. In actuality, the Galaxy is 100,000 light-years across, but only a few thousand light-years thick.

As we start out towards the next step, we see other galaxies like the Milky Way begin to appear. Compared to stars in the Milky Way, galaxies are packed together much more closely, and collisions between galaxies are much more common. The Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest galaxy to the Milky Way, is 2.5 million light-years away and on a collision course for Earth. Don't panic, though, as the collision won't happen for another 3 billion years.

At a size scale not much larger than our last, we see that the galaxies are clumped together. These '''galaxy clusters''' typically have hundreds of galaxies and are millions of light years across. Galaxies orbit around the center of their clusters. The Milky Way is a member of the Virgo Cluster. It orbits near the edge of the Cluster, so we can see much of its center in a small region of the sky in the direction of the constellation Virgo. Presently, the Milky Way is moving away from the center of Virgo Cluster. In the distant future, however, the Cluster's pull will slow the Milky Way and draw it inward.

Although our reach now includes many more objects, the size scale of galaxy clusters still does not represent an expansion over the last size scale by a factor of 1000. We have not fully reached the next step in our journey until we come to the scale of hundreds of millions of light years. At this scale, even the galaxy clusters form clusters. These groups of galaxy clusters are called '''superclusters'''. A supercluster may contain hundreds of thousands of galaxies. The Virgo Cluster is a member of a supercluster called the Virgo Supercluster.

Light from the edge of our 500 million light-year reach has traveled for 500 million years before reaching us. This means that we see the Virgo Supercluster as it was 500 million years ago. Five hundred million years can be a long time, but it isn't really long enough for the universe to have changed significantly. Even though the light is old, the universe at the edge of the Virgo Supercluster still looks much like the universe nearby.

[[Image:Hubble Sphere.bjb.jpg|thumb|left|270px|This artist's conception shows a schematic of the Hubble volume as if you could look &quot;down&quot; on it from &quot;above&quot;. In reality, this view is impossible because an observer will always see the Hubble sphere as if from the center, regardless of location in the universe. This happens because the edge of the Hubble sphere is made by light emitted from a great distance when the universe was very young. The Virgo Supercluster is the small dot at the center of the image, circled in blue.]]

As we continue out from the 500 million light-year size scale, we see older and older parts of the universe. As the distance becomes very large, we begin seeing billions of years into the past, and big changes in the Universe as a whole become important. Going further and further back, we see the formation of the first galaxy clusters, galaxies, and stars. Eventually, we see the universe so young that no stars have formed yet. Before the first stars formed, the Universe was cool and dense enough for the loose, unused gas in space to block visible light. Beyond this, we can't see any further. The contents inside this wall are called the '''Hubble volume''', or the Observable Universe. There's no way to observe objects outside of this volume because the light from these distant objects hasn't reached us yet.

The Universe extends out infinitely, but our view is limited to the Hubble volume. Trying to visit the edge of the Hubble volume is impossible. You'll never reach it because it's only an illusion. If you tried to visit the location where we see the edge of the Hubble volume, you would see the universe around you as it today, not billions of years ago, and you would see the edge of the Hubble volume all around you, billions of light years away.

Extending out further inevitably delves into the pages of theory and crosses the line dividing what we have seen and what we cannot see. Some have theorised that the universe itself does not comprise all of existence, and that there may be other universes with different physical laws existing together in clusters and groups in a multiverse.

As we go further and further out, many note that there must be an edge, an end, a border of reality. Others have speculated that the universe, or the multiverse it sits in, is simply infinite, and has no such boundaries. However, at this point in time, there can be no absolution, no definite answer to these questions.

Much remains unknown about what the Universe is like, but our picture has evolved dramatically since humanity first began asking questions about the world around it. Armed with curiosity and the tools of science, astronomers have investigated the heavens for centuries, and their work continues today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intelligence ==
The concept of intelligence is, in many ways, culturally bound.  Not all languages or cultural groups have a word equivalent to &quot;intelligence;&quot; to cultures in which academic work and achievement are unimportant, the idea of &quot;intelligence&quot; is moot.


== IQ ==
In 1904, the French Ministry of Education asked [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Binet Alfred Binet] to come up with a way to identify children who would need remedial help with schoolwork.  They wanted to identify these children as early as possible.  In 1912, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stern William Stern] developed a formula often misattributed to Binet or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Terman Lewis Terman] to capture the essence of Binet's work: Intelligence Quotient = Mental Age/Chronological Age x 100.  This is typically written: IQ = MA/CA X 100.  In other words, if a child of 6 years (CA) is achieving at the same level as his 6-year-old peers (MA), his IQ = 6/6 x 100, or 100.  For this reason, the score of 100 became the &quot;average&quot; IQ, and remains so today.

== Theories of Intelligence ==
Since Binet, psychologists have gone back and forth between believing intelligence is one thing and believing it consists of many talents or intelligences.  Many of the most [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_%28statistics%29 reliable] modern intelligence tests are based on the idea of intelligence as one thing (in keeping with Binet's original mission, typically something that is highly correlated with academic achievement), but proponents of multiple intelligences argue that

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Addition==
Addition is thought to be the easiest function the abacus can calculate. To add, the user must  display the original number and add the desired number of beads to the original number.

Example: (6+5)
 6=6
 0000-|-0  (0)
 000-0|0-  (6)
 
 6+5=11
 000-0|-0  (1)
 000-0|-0  (1)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiplication is, by definition, the addition of some number so many amount of times. Therefore, to multiply a number by a desired number requires the same priniciple.

To multiply: 
#Display the original number.
#Think of desired multiplier.
#If multiplier has more than one digit, multiply by digits seperately
#Add the original number however many times desired.
#Move to the next digit and repeat step 4 if multiplier has more than digit.


Example: (4×5)
 4=4
 0000-|-0
 -0000|-0
 
 4+4=4×2=8
 0000-|-0
 0-000|0-
 
 8+4=4×3=12
 000-0|-0
 00-00|-0
 
 12+4=4×4=16
 000-0|-0
 000-0|0-
 
 16+4=4×5=20
 00-00|-0
 0000-|-0


Here is another example with one number having two digits: (5×2.5)

 5=5
 0000-|-0   (0)
 0000-|0-   (5)
 0000-|-0• (.0)
 
 5×2=10
 000-0|-0
 0000-|-0
 0000-|-0•

 5×0.5=2.5
 0000-|-0
 00-00|-0
 0000-|0-•

 10+2.5=12.5=5×2.5
 000-0|-0
 00-00|-0
 0000-|0-•

      <text xml:space="preserve">Division is practically the opposite process of multiplication. Division of a given number by a desired number involves the subtraction of the given number by the disired number a certain amount of times, and this certain amount of times the answer.

To divide:
#display original number
#think of desired number
#subtract original number by desired number
#add a bead to a separated row (recommended two above highest digit of original number), this is the counter row
#Repeat steps 3-4 until original number is less than desired number
#multiply original number by 10 and repeat steps 3-4 while adding one bead one digit less than counter.


Example: (15/4)
 15=15      Counter
 000-0|-0   0000-|-0
 0000-|0-   0000-|-0•
 
 15-4=11    1
 000-0|-0   000-0|-0
 000-0|-0   0000-|-0•

 11-4=7     2
 0000-|-0   00-00|-0
 00-00|0-   0000-|-0•
 
 7-4=3      3
 0000-|-0   0-000|-0
 0-000|-0   0000-|-0•

 30-4=26    3.1
 00-00|-0   0-000|-0
 000-0|0-   000-0|-0•
 
 ... (6 more times)
 
 6-4=2      3.7
 0000-|-0   0-000|-0
 00-00|-0   00-00|0-•

 20-4=16    3.71
 000-0|-0   0-000|-0
 000-0|0-   00-00|0-•
            000-0|-0
 
 ... (4 more times)
 
 4-4=0      3.75
 0000-|-0   0-000|-0
 0000-|-0   00-00|0-
            0000-|0-
 
 
 Thus (15/4)=3.75

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[AK-47 Instruction Manual]]==
Welcome to Wikibooks.  I hope that you enjoy your experience while you are here.

I've noticed that you've started a new Wikibook here called [[AK-47 Instruction Manual]].  Make sure that you try to expand this into something that really resembles a manual and not just a simple encyclopedia article.  I know that this is right at the beginning thoughts on how to do this, so I am willing to offer you some suggestions and pointers.

If you want to look at some successful Wikibooks and try to see how they are formatted, you might want to look at [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] for a list of some of the best ones here.  You can copy stuff from Wikipedia as the foundation and initial core of content here, but it would be suggested that you substantially expand the content once you bring it to Wikibooks.  That process is especially recommended if you are trying to cut a Wikipedia article down due to the length of that article.

Good luck on this project, and I hope it proves to be successful.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:36, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

: Thank you for your attention. However, I started the [[AK-47 Instruction Manual]] merely because the operation section of AK-47 article in en.wikipedia was removed by somebody (not me!) due to wikipedia policy, which says that wikipedia is not instruction manual. I thought that it would be good to preserve the removed content for future use, so I copied it to here.

: Sadly, I don't have enough knowledge for AK-47. I just hoped that someone else will expand that small section to a real manual. -- [[User:Shotgunlee|Shotgunlee]] 06:38, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The case of uniform gravity , disregarding drag and wind, yields a '''projectile motion''' [[Wikipedia:trajectory|trajectory]] which is a [[Wikipedia:parabola|parabola]]. To model this, one chooses &lt;math&gt;V = m g z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; ([[Wikipedia:gee|gee]]) is the so-called acceleration of gravity. 

Relative to a flat terrain, let the initial horizontal speed be &lt;math&gt;v_h&lt;/math&gt;, and the initial vertical speed be &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt;. It will be shown that, the [[Wikipedia:range|range]] is &lt;math&gt;2v_h v_v/g&lt;/math&gt;, and the maximum altitude is &lt;math&gt;{v_v^2}/2g&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum range, for a given total initial speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained when &lt;math&gt;v_h=v_v&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the initial angle is 45 degrees. This range is &lt;math&gt;v^2/g&lt;/math&gt;, and the maximum altitude at the maximum range is a quarter of that.

==Derivation==

The equations of motion may be used to calculate the characteristics of the trajectory.

Let:
:&lt;math&gt;t \;&lt;/math&gt; be the time into the flight of the projectile
:&lt;math&gt;d_h(t) \;&lt;/math&gt; be the horizontal displacement at time t
:&lt;math&gt;d_v(t) = z \;&lt;/math&gt; be the vertical displacement at time t
:&lt;math&gt;v_h \;&lt;/math&gt; be the horizontal velocity (which is constant)
:&lt;math&gt;v_v \;&lt;/math&gt; be the initial vertical velocity upwards
:&lt;math&gt;v \;&lt;/math&gt; be the initial speed
:&lt;math&gt;v_v(t) \;&lt;/math&gt; be the vertical velocity at time t

Along the horizontal dimension, &lt;math&gt;v_h&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and thus by the equations of motion,  
:&lt;math&gt;d_h(t)=v_h t \;&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 1)

The vertical distance, or [[Wikipedia:altitude|altitude]], follows the equations of motion for constant negative acceleration &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=v_vt- {{gt^2} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 2)
:&lt;math&gt;v_v = \frac{d}{dt} d_v(t) = v_v-gt&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 3:  velocity equation which is the [[Wikipedia:derivative|derivative]] of equation 2)

The range of the projectile occurs when &lt;math&gt;d_v(t)&lt;/math&gt; is zero again and intercepts the ground.  This occurs when &lt;math&gt;d_v&lt;/math&gt; in equation 2 is zero:
:&lt;math&gt;0=v_vt- {{gt^2} \over 2 }&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this for time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; gives the time of the projectile's flight:
:&lt;math&gt;t={2v_v \over g }&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 4:  &quot;hang time&quot; of projectile)

The maximum range occurs when equation 4 is substituted into equation 1:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h(t) = { v_h t } = { v_h ({2 v_v \over g})} = { {2 v_h v_v} \over g } &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 5:  range of projectile)

The maximum altitude for a given trajectory occurs when the vertical velocity is zero.  Thus set equation 3 to zero:
:&lt;math&gt;0=v_v-gt \;&lt;/math&gt;
Solving for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t= { {v_v} \over g } &lt;/math&gt;
This can be substituted into equation 2 to give the maximum altitude:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v(max)=v_v ( {v_v \over g}) -  \frac 1 2 g( { v_v \over g } )^2 = {{v_v}^2  \over 2g } &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 6:  maximum altitude of projectile)

Thus, not surprisingly, for a given initial speed the attained altitude is highest if the initial velocity was straight up. This altitude is twice the attained altitude when the range is maximized.

==Derivation in polar coordinates==
In terms of angle of elevation &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and initial speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{ {v_h}^2 + {v_v}^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_h=v \cos \theta \;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=v \sin \theta \;&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting into Equation 1 gives:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h=v_h t = vt \cos \theta \;&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 1a)
Substituting into Equation 2 gives:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=v_vt- {{gt^2} \over 2} =  ( v \sin \theta ) t - { { g t^2 } \over 2 } &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 2a)
Taking the derivative gives the vertical velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;v_v=\frac{d}{dt} d_v = \frac{d}{dt} (v \sin \theta) t - {{g t^2} \over 2} = v \sin \theta -gt &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 3a:  vertical velocity)

Hang time calculated above in equation 4 may be expressed in terms of angle of elevation:
:&lt;math&gt;t={2v_v \over g} = {{2 v \sin \theta } \over g }&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 4a)

Equation 4a may be substituted into Equation 1a to get the horizontal distance or range:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h=v_h t = { vt \cos \theta } =v ({{2 v \sin \theta} \over g}) \cos \theta = { { 2 v^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta } \over g}&lt;/math&gt;

Now using the [[Wikipedia:trigonometric identity|trigonometric identity]] for &lt;math&gt;2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = sin 2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h={{ v^2 \sin 2 \theta } \over g}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 5a:  range of projectile)

This may be solved for angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to give the &quot;angle&quot; equation to hit a target at range &lt;math&gt;d_h&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; { \theta } =  \frac 1 2 \sin^{-1} ( { {g d_h} \over { v^2 } } ) &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 7: angle of projectile launch)
Note that the [[Wikipedia:sine|sine]] function is such that there are two solutions for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for a given range &lt;math&gt;d_h&lt;/math&gt;.  Physically, this corresponds to a direct shot versus a [[Wikipedia:mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shot up and over obstacles to the target.

The maximum altitude for a given range may be determined by setting the vertical velocity to zero in equation 3a and solving for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;0= v \sin \theta -gt \;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t= \frac{v \sin \theta}{g} &lt;/math&gt; (rearrange and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
Now substitute into the vertical height equation 2a:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v = (v \sin \theta) t - \frac{g t^2}{2} = (v \sin \theta)(\frac {v \sin \theta}{g}) - \frac {g (\frac{v \sin \theta}{g})^2}{2} = \frac{v^2 {\sin}^2 \theta}{g} - \frac{v^2 {\sin}^2 \theta}{2g} = \frac{v^2 {\sin}^2 \theta}{2g}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 6a: max altitude for a given launch angle)

==Maximum range==
Given the above range and altitude equations, the maximum range and altitude may be determined.   Both equations for the range, equations 5 and 5a may be used to determine the maximum range by setting their derivatives to zero.  For equation 5, range of the projectile is a function of &lt;math&gt;v_h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v_v^2+v_h^2=v^2&lt;/math&gt; where v is the total initial velocity and is constant.   Thus, the range may be expressed as a function of &lt;math&gt;v_v&lt;/math&gt; by solving for &lt;math&gt;v_h&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v_h=\sqrt{v^2-v_v^2}&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 8)
And substituting &lt;math&gt;v_h&lt;/math&gt; into equation 5:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h={ {2 v_h v_v} \over g } = { {2v_v \sqrt{v^2-v_v^2} } \over g} &lt;/math&gt;

The maximum &lt;math&gt;d_h&lt;/math&gt; may be determined by calculating the derivative and setting it to zero.  The derivative is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dv_v} d_h={1 \over g} \frac{d}{dv_v}  {2v_v \sqrt{v^2-v_v^2} } &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;={1 \over g} (2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2} +2v_v \frac{d}{dv_v} \sqrt{v^2-v_v^2} &lt;/math&gt; (application of [[Wikipedia:product rule|product rule]])
::&lt;math&gt;={1 \over g} (2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2} +2v_v \frac{d \sqrt{v^2-v_v^2} }{d{v_v}^2} \frac{d{v_v}^2}{dv_v}) &lt;/math&gt; (application of [[Wikipedia:chain rule|chain rule]])
::&lt;math&gt;={1 \over g} (2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2} +2v_v (\frac{-1} {2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2}}) 2v_v) &lt;/math&gt; (derivative of [[Wikipedia:square root|square root]])
::&lt;math&gt;={1 \over g} (2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2} - \frac{2{v_v}^2}{\sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2}}) &lt;/math&gt; (simplify second [[Wikipedia:Term (mathematics)|term]])
Set to zero and solve for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;0={1 \over g} (2 \sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2} - \frac{2{v_v}^2}{\sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2}}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2}=\frac {{v_v}^2}{\sqrt{v^2-{v_v}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v^2-{v_v}^2=v_v^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v^2=2v_v^2&lt;/math&gt; (Equation 9)
Thus maximum range occurs when &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2v_v^2&lt;/math&gt; and this can be substituted back into equation 8:
:&lt;math&gt;v_h=\sqrt{v^2-v_v^2}=\sqrt{v^2-v_v^2}=\sqrt{2v_v^2-v_v^2}=v_v&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the maximum range occurs when &lt;math&gt;v_h=v_v&lt;/math&gt;.

The actual maximum range may now be calculated by substituting &lt;math&gt;v_h=v_v&lt;/math&gt; and equation 9 into equation 5:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h =  { {2 v_h v_v} \over g } = { {2 v_v v_v} \over g } = { {2 v_v^2} \over g } = {v^2 \over g} &lt;/math&gt; 

==Maximum range in polar coordinates==
The same conclusion may be drawn by starting with equation 5a.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\theta} d_h = \frac{d}{d\theta} {{ v^2 \sin 2 \theta } \over g} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac{v^2}{g}  \frac{d}{d2\theta} \sin 2 \theta \frac{d2\theta}{d\theta} &lt;/math&gt; (application of [[Wikipedia:chain rule|chain rule]])
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac{v^2}{g} (\cos 2 \theta) 2 \quad &lt;/math&gt;
Set to zero and solve for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;0= \frac{v^2}{g} (\cos 2 \theta) 2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0=\cos 2 \theta \quad &lt;/math&gt;
Now cosine is zero at &lt;math&gt;\pi \over 2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;2 \theta=\frac \pi 2&lt;/math&gt; (also directly clear from equation 5a, it gives the maximum possible sine value of 1)
:&lt;math&gt;{\theta}_{\max} = \frac \pi 4 &lt;/math&gt; [[Wikipedia:radian|radian]]s
Thus the maximum range occurs when the angle is 45 degrees.

The actual maximum range may now be calculated by substituting 45 degrees into equation 5a:
:&lt;math&gt;d_h={{ v^2 \sin 2 \theta } \over g}={{v^2 \sin 2 ( \frac{\pi}{4} ) } \over g} = {v^2 \over g}&lt;/math&gt;

==Maximum altitude at maximum range==
Equations 6 and 6a may be used to calculate the maximum altitude at the maximum range.  Equation 9 may be substituted into equation 6:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=\frac{v_v^2}{2g}=\frac{(\frac{v^2}{2})}{2g}=\frac{v^2}{4g}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise 45 degrees may be substituted into equation 6a:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=\frac{v^2 {\sin}^2 \theta}{2g}=\frac{v^2(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})^2}{2g}=\frac{v^2}{4g} &lt;/math&gt;

==As a parabola==
Equations 1 and 2 are [[Wikipedia:parametric equation|parametric equation]]s that describe a parabola.  They may be rearranged into the more familiar quadratic form by solving equation 1 for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and substituting into equation 2:

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{d_h}{v_h}&lt;/math&gt; (rearrange equation 1 for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)

Substituting this into equation 2:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=v_vt- \frac{gt^2}{2}=v_v(\frac{d_h}{v_h})-\frac{g(\frac{d_h}{v_h})^2}{2}=-\frac{g}{2{v_h}^2}(d_h)^2 + \frac{v_v}{v_h}(d_h)&lt;/math&gt;

This is now in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c \quad &lt;/math&gt; 
where 
:&lt;math&gt;y=d_v, x=d_h, a=-g/{2{v_h}^2}, b=v_v/v_h, c=0&lt;/math&gt;.  
This is the form of a parabola and thus the trajectory is a parabola.

Likewise equations 1a and 2a can be rearranged into quadratic form.  Equation 1a may be rearranged to:

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{d_h}{v \cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

And this may be substituted into equation 2a:

:&lt;math&gt;d_v=vt \sin \theta - \frac{gt^2}{2}=v \sin \theta \frac{d_h}{v \cos \theta} - \frac{g {(\frac{d_h}{v \cos \theta})}^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta=\sin \theta / \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;, so:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v=-\frac{g}{2v^2{\cos}^2 \theta}d_h^2 +  d_h \tan \theta &lt;/math&gt; (Equation 10)

This is again now in the form &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=d_v\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x=d_h\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=-g/{2v^2{\cos}^2 \theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=\sin \theta / \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=0\,&lt;/math&gt; demonstrating that this is a parabola.

The [[w:quadratic formula|quadratic formula]] gives the location of the intersection of the parabola and the x-axis.  This is where the projectile trajectory starts and ends and thus may be used directly to calculate the range.  In terms of rectilinear coordinate systems:

:&lt;math&gt;
d_h=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac\  }}{2a}=\frac{-(v_v/v_h) \pm \sqrt{(v_v/v_h)^2 - 0} }{2(-g/2v_h^2)} = \frac{-v_v/v_h \pm v_v/v_h}{-g/v_h^2}=0, \frac{2{v_v}{v_h}}{g}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same result as equation 5 above.

In polar coordinates and using the trigonometric identity &lt;math&gt; 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin 2 \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;, the intersections are:

:&lt;math&gt;
d_h=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac\  }}{2a}=\frac{-(\sin \theta / \cos \theta) \pm \sqrt{(\sin \theta / \cos \theta)^2 - 0  }}{2(-g/2v^2 \cos^2 \theta)} =0, \frac{2 \sin \theta / \cos \theta}{g/v^2 \cos^2 \theta} = 0, \frac{2 v^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{g} = 0, \frac{v^2 \sin 2 \theta}{g}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same result as in equation 5a above.

Similarly, the vertex of the parabola is the maximum altitude for a given range.

==Computer simulation==
[http://nclab.com NCLab] provides an interactive graphical module for projective motion with and without air friction. The Python source code of the simulation can be freely view and copied. For the case with air friction, Runge-Kutta methods of orders 1, 2 and 4 are used to solve the underlying ordinary differential equations.

== Translucency 5? ==

The translucency slider only goes up to 1. And in the example panels at the foot of the page, the translucency is set to zero. [[Special:Contributions/213.122.18.200|213.122.18.200]] ([[User talk:213.122.18.200|talk]]) 12:14, 20 June 2010 (UTC)


==glass not see thru in 3d view==
Just in case anyone is stupid like me, this does not look transparent until you render. It is not transparent on the 3D view. Ickathu</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maybe this module should be 'dealing with feeling'? There's got to be a section on love for example... Jan. 06. Duncan

Jan 13 - I thought the same thing - you can't have a guide to growing up without talking about love! I think love is a big enough topic, however, to get its own chapter - especially since it will likely touch upon the mixed-up feelings around around love and sex, and how to consult your own moral compass deep within to steer yourself through the hormones.

This chapter is going to get big enough: I notice the title's been changed to include trauma... there's much more to say about trauma! In fact, we might consider making trauma its own chapter as well. The 'stunned' or 'shock' feelings that result from emotional trauma, and the emotional 'backwash' that goes with it, is different than depression and has different patterns, handling, expectations and healing.

==overuse of explanation marks==
I like this module, but there seems to be an overuse of explanation marks.  They look like an attempt at humor or to make the module more interesting, but they end up making it look unprofessional and full of hype.  Explanation marks are good in a relaxed setting, like an IM, but I think they should almost never be used in what is supposed to become textbook quality.  The point that is made should make itself important; it should not require an explanation mark.  If it is something that is really important, it should be bolded, without an explanation mark.  I don't think any of the parts that have explanation marks are important enough that they should be bolded, as I don't think importance was the reason they have explanation marks in the first place.[[User:CatastrophicToad|CatastrophicToad]] 17:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Plug-ins and Add-ons==
Any plug-ins and add-ons are granted by you the same privilege as external applications on your computer.  They do not observe the proxy settings at your browser.  Generally they have the same access to the Internet as your browser.  All these applications need to do is to connect to their own server and reveal your true IP.  The Firefox NoScript add-on can reduce the risk by disabling these plug-ins by default, until you white-list the websites.

These plug-ins are typically referred to collectively at the browser as Javascript.  However, Javacript codes as downloaded from webpages are executed via the browser, and do not have elevated privileges.  This is different from the Javascript used in, say, add-ons for Firefox.  These scripts has total access to your computer just as any applications, and browser based defense such as NoScript has no effect.

==Browser Fingerprints==
Even with all the anonymity precautions, your browser may still leaves the same [http://panopticlick.eff.org fingerprint] on different hosts.  Fingerprints are deduced from seemingly harmless features - installed fonts and add-ons - but these are rather unique, and can be used to show that the same person make the posts on the forum as different users.  A very power adversaries can use it to link the person paying his DMV fee online at home, with the person accessing a secret email account.  The IP addresses doesn't matter, if your adversary can order massive fingerprinting and have the capacity to match them sooner or later.

The most effective way to avoid defeat fingerprinting is to use setup different profiles, such as that on Firefox - one for public everyday life, one for special interests that could identify you, and one for your secret life, etc. In each profile, you can store cookies, bookmarks and enable history for convenience.  You should use add-ons to fake browser headers, install different add-ons and fonts.  Use different proxies or VPN.</text>

I agree [[Fencing]] should be a disambiguation page and [[Fencing (Sport)]] be this book.   If anyone wants to start a book on construction then it would be [[Fencing (Construction)]] or somthing with a similar name. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Are you guys sure? ==

Fencing (sport) could also be broken down into categories like:
- a history of sports fencing
- a guide to getting started
- a guide to the current climate
- a guide to weapons
- a training manual
- a fitness manual
- etc
Where would you draw the line?
[[User:Kothos|Kothos]] 14:40, 28 August 2006 (AEST)

At the moment it seems like this is a guide to fencing. Maybe seperate books can be made for specific parts.</text>

{{Serial Programming}}

This page lines out a typical serial
RS232-hardware configuration as it can be found in computers and devices 
of all kinds. It should serve as a guideline and introduction to the
direct programming of some
serial hardware.

The provided information is generic in nature, since the actual serial
hardware which can be found in some device or computer do vary. Often these days
the hardware is integrated in one single chip, even with many other functions
like a parallel port, unrelated to serial communications.
Nevertheless this module provides a good overview about which logical or
physical components
do what, and where the programming of serial hardware actually happens.

== Involved Components ==

The following figure provides an overview of the involved components,
and how they are in principle connected:

                            +-----------+

We will discuss the components and their purpose in turn.

== Line Driver / Receiver ==

RS-232 communication uses voltage up to ±15V (some early specs even use ±25V).
And it uses an inverse logic (high/true/1 is a negative voltage, low/false/0
is a positive voltage). These voltages are far too high for modern (and even
older) computer logic. Therefore, RS-232 interfaces typically contain special
hardware, a so-called line driver and a line receiver.

The line driver is responsible for converting typical computer voltage
logic to the high voltages used on the RS-232 line, and for inverting
the logic. This is used when the computer hardware transmits serial data. 
The voltage output is typically continuous short-circuit safe, as this is
required by the RS-232 standard.

The line receiver is responsible for the inverse operation of the line
driver. It converts incoming RS-232 signals to voltages safe for computer
logic, and it of course also inverts the logic.

Actually, there is usually more than one line driver and receiver in
use, because each incoming RS-232 signal in a RS-232 cable needs its
own receiver, and each outgoing RS-232 signal needs its own driver. However, typically multiple
drivers / receivers are combined in one chip. The chip as such also
protects the computer logic from spikes which could happen on the serial
wire. Some line driver / receiver chips even generate the necessary RS-232
voltage on-chip, while others need external power sources for these
voltages.

Line drivers / receivers are typically not programmable. They are
hard-wired into the logic and as such of no great concern for the
programmer.

* The module [[../MAX232 Driver Receiver|MAX232 Driver/Receiver Family]] for an example of a popular driver / receiver in amateur electronics.
* The module [[../RS-232_Connections|RS-232 Wiring and Connections]]

== UART ==

The [[wikipedia:Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter|UART]] (universal
asynchronous receiver transmitter) is the heart of the serial hardware.
It is a chip or part of a chip with the purpose to convert between
parallel data and serial data. RS-232 UARTs also typically add the
necessary start/stop and parity bits when transmitting, and decode this
information when receiving. 

A UART typically operates entirely on computer logic voltage. Its serial data input/output voltage is the computer logic voltage, not
the serial line voltage. They leave the actual line interface to a
particular line driver / receiver. This line driver / receiver does not necessarily
need to be an RS-232 line driver / receiver, but could e.g. also be
an RS-422 differential driver / receiver. This, and the fact that baud rate,
parity, number of stop bits, number of data bits are programmable is the reason
why UARTs are called ''universal''. The distinction between UART and line driver / receiver blurs
if they are both placed in the same chip. Such chips are typically also sold under
the label 'UART'.

UARTs are called ''asynchronous'', because they don't use a special clock signal
to synchronize with the the remote side. Instead, they use the start/stop
bits to identify the data bits in the serial stream.

Thanks to the UART the rest of the hardware, as well as the software
application can deal with normal bytes to hold the communication data.
It is the job of the UART to chop a byte into a series of serial bits when
sending, and to assemble series of bits into a byte when receiving. UARTs
typically contain eight bit wide
receiver and transmission buffers. Of which not all bits might be used if e.g.
a 7 bit transmission is used. Received serial data is provided in
parallel in the receiver buffer, to-be-send data is written in parallel
to the transmission buffer. Depending on the UART the buffers might just have a
depth of one byte, or a few bytes (in the range of 15 or 16 bytes). The less deep
the buffers are, the more precise the communication with the CPU needs to be. E.g. if
the receiver buffer just has a depth of one byte, and the data is not fetched fast enough,
the next received data can overwrite the previously received data in the buffer, and the
previously received data is lost.

Because of the fact that the timing on the serial interface is
important, UARTs are typically connected to a baud rate generator,
either an internal one in the UART chip, or an external one.

== USART ==
A U'''S'''ART (universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver transmitter) is a version of an UART that can also communicate synchronously. Many modern ICs have this feature. However, as RS232 works asynchronously, the synchronous features of a USART aren't used for serial communication. Depending on the particular type of USART the synchronous features are either turned off at start or need to be turned off. Once they are off a USART is a UART when it comes to RS232 communication.

== Baud Rate Generator ==
=== Principle of Operation ===
The baud rate generator is an oscillator. It
provides a frequency signal which is used to control the timing on the
serial interface. Since different line speeds need a different timing,
the baud rate generation needs to be flexible.

There are two general ways to achieve a flexible baud rate generation.
Either the baud rate generator itself is programmable and can produce
the necessary different frequencies, or the UART has a programmable
divider or multiplier, which converts the frequency from the baud rate generator into
the required frequencies. Observers might have noticed that there are
fixed relation between typical baud rates (300bps, 600bps, 1200bps,
2400bps, 9600bps (4 x 2400bps), etc.). This simplifies the usage of frequency
dividers or multipliers to generate the necessary timing.

Depending on the actual UART, the baud rate generator either needs to be
some external component, or it is directly integrated into the UART chip.
From the outside, the programmatic change of the baud rate generation is
the means to control the speed of the serial connection. Often when
programming the baud rate one doesn't provide the desired baud rate in
'clear text', but needs to provide some divider or factor. Providing the
right divider or factor requires to know the basic frequency of the used
baud rate generator.

=== Oscillator &amp; Magic Quartz Crystal Values ===

RS-232 communication is asynchronous. So there is no explicit means, no shared clock signal, how a transmitter and receiver synchronize. Instead they synchronize on the start bit and further assume a certain bit length. The bit length is a direct function of the baud rate. E.g. 9600 bauds on RS-232 means 9600 bits are transmitted in one second. Each bit therefore has a length of 1/9600 seconds. To ensure the transmitter and receiver assume the same bit length, they need to work with the same baud rate. And the baud rates on both sides of the communication need to be precise up to a certain level. Otherwise the data transmission fails. Typical errors when the baud rates on the two sides aren't well enough aligned are framing errors, wrongly received or missed bits.

The baud rate generator, as it generates the clock frequency for sending, as well as receiving data, is responsible for providing the required baud rate precision. As a rule of thumb, typically, the total difference in the baud rate should not exceed +/- 4% in the worst case. If one distributes this &quot;error budget&quot; equally to both sides it means the baud rate on each side needs to be kept within +/- 2% of the nominal value. In fact, one should avoid this worst case and keep the baud rate at least within +/- 1% on each side.

It is common to use a crystal oscillator to build a baud rate generator with an initial precision, temperature drift and long term drift suitable for RS-232. That is, the baud rate generator is based on an oscillator that in turn uses a quartz crystal as a reference. Simpler oscillators, like RC oscillators are usually not good enough. 

Typically all the crystal oscillator electronics is build into the baud rate generator IC. If a UART with an integrated baud rate generator is used, that UART typically contains the electronics. The only thing that typically needs to be added is the quartz crystal.

To achieve the common baud rates, the frequency value of the quartz crystal needs to have one of certain &quot;magic&quot; values. These values at first glance seem rather odd. However, they are typically multiplies of 300 (often the lowest baud rate to support) or 25 (for very low baud rates of 25, 50, 75, 150) and a power of two. Powers of two are used, because it is easy to divide a frequency by a power of two, thus making a configurable or programmable baud rate generator possible.

For example, dividing the rather odd crystal frequency 4.915200 MHz by 256 (a power of two), gives the nice value 19200 Hz. Crystals with frequencies like 4.915200 MHz are called ''baud rate crystals'' or ''magic crystals''. The following table lists common baud rate crystal frequencies.

* 1.8432 MHz, 3.6864 MHz, 4.9152 MHz, 5.5296 MHz, 6.1440 MHz, 7.3728 MHz, 9.8304 MHz
* 11.0592 MHz, 12.2880 MHz, 12.9024 MHz, 14.7456 MHz, 16.5888 MHz, 18.4320 MHz, 19.6608 MHz
* 20.2752 MHz, 22.1184 MHz, 23.9616 MHz, 25.8048 MHz, 27.6480 MHz , 29.4912 MHz
* 31.3344 MHz, 33.1776 MHz, 35.0208 MHz, 36.8640 MHz

Which crystal frequency to use depends on the baud rate generator / UART in use. The datasheet of the baud rate generator / UART should be consulted for details.

== Interface Logic ==

The UART and the baud rate generator are just chips or can be components of a larger chip. For simplifying the discussion we assume they are one chip. This chip typically has a bunch of pins which somehow need to be written to or read by the CPU. As such, there needs to be some way for the CPU to address the chip to talk to it. There also needs to be some way for the chip to make itself heard in certain situations.

It is the job of the interface logic to provide this connection. The logic varies considerably from one system architecture to another. One common technique used is to map the UARTs transmit and receive buffers in the CPU's memory address space. That way they look like ordinary memory to the CPU. Another way is to connect these buffers to some CPU-specific I/O port. Along with the transmit and receive buffers, the CPU must also have access to control lines, baud rate, parity, and character size programming interface of the UART.

Since a UART can't buffer an endless amount of incoming data (some can only buffer one byte in the receiver buffer), the CPU (or some other hardware) needs to read from the UART 'fast enough'. The CPU can either continuously poll the UART to check if new data is available, or the UART can notify when new data is ready. This notification is typically done via a CPU interrupt. It is the job of the interface logic to trigger such an interrupt on behalf of the UART. Both mechanisms (polling- or interrupt-driven) have advantages and disadvantages.

In the other direction, when sending data, there is a similar problem. The CPU needs to deliver the data 'fast enough' to prevent a buffer underrun. This is not fatal, but can degrade the performance and efficiency of the serial communication. The CPU can also deliver the data 'too fast' to the UART causing an overrun of the transmitter buffer in the UART. This can again be controlled by polling (the CPU checks if the UART is ready to send) or via an interrupt (the UART tells the CPU it needs more data). Again, the interface logic has to provide the means to accomplish either or both of these operating modes.

The interface logic determines how and where a programmer finds the UART he/she wants to program, and in which operating mode(s) (polling, interrupt driven) he/she can transmit and receive data. The interface logic in, for example, modern PCs is programmable to some extent. However, this is typically done by the BIOS (setting I/O addresses and interrupt numbers). In older PCs and many other computers the interface logic is not programmable. From an application programmer's point of view there is very seldom a need to program the interface logic. Typically it is treated as hard-wired logic.

== Summary ==

In order to program a particular hardware one needs to know:

* How to reach the UART and baud rate generator (how the interface logic works). Typically this requires knowledge of some I/O or memory addresses.
* How the communication with the UART and baud rate generator works (does the interface logic provide polling or interrupts, or both?).
* How to program the UART. Having the UARTs data sheet available is very helpful for this.
* How to program the baud rate generator, which just might be part of the UART chip.

Alternatively, one uses the serial programming API of an operating system, which is supposed to know all this, and 'do the right thing'.

== Force as a vector ==

Because the writer has introduced vectors, I would propose that it should be at least mentioned that Forces can be described as vectors.

The writer could also continue with the addition of vectors(even if they are in the same direction) to explain when to forces of 5N each get a 0N and when a 10N net force.[I saw that this is for the next topic] Mallamanis 11Jul06</text>

Brachioradialis: function, innervation, one relation, one attachment BrachioRadialis: Function: Its the Beer Raising muscle, flexes elbow, strongest when wrist is oriented like holding a beer. Innervation: Breaks Rule: it’s a flexor muscle, But Radial. (Radial nerve usually is for extensors: Recall BEST rule: B was for brachioradialis). Important relation: Behind it is the Radial nerve in the cubital fossa. Attachment: Attaches to Bottom of Radius. 

Pleura surface markings&quot;All the even ribs, in order: 2,4,6,8,10,12 show its route&quot;: Rib2: sharp angle inferiorly Rib4: the left pleura does a lateral shift to accommodate heart Rib6: both diverge laterally Rib8: midclavicular line Rib10: midaxillary line Rib12: the back • See diagram.  

Aortic arch: major branch order &quot;Know your ABC'S&quot;: 
Aortic arch gives rise to: Brachiocephalic trunk left Common Carotid left Subclavian • Beware though trick question of 'What is first branch of aorta?' Technically, it's the coronary arteries.

MALE: Mandibular nerve Accessory meningeal artery Lesser petrosal nerve Emissary veins 

Pterygoid muscles: function of lateral vs. medial
&quot;Look at how your jaw ends up when saying first syllable of 'Lateral' or 'Medial' &quot;: 
&quot;La&quot;: your jaw is now open, so Lateral opens mouth. 
&quot;Me&quot;: your jaw is still closed, so medial closes the mandible. 

Supine vs. prone body position&quot;Supine is on your spine. 
Therefore, prone's the &quot;other&quot; one. • Also, prone to suffocate in prone position. 

Meckel's diverticulum details
2 inches long. 2 feet from end of ileum. 2 times more common in men. 2% occurrence in population. 2 types of tissues may be present. • Note: &quot;di-&quot; means &quot;two&quot;, so diverticulum is the thing with all the twos. 

Perineal vs. peroneal
Perineal is in between the legs. Peroneal is on the leg. 

Anterior forearm muscles: superficial groupThere are five, like five digits of your hand. Place your thumb into your palm, then lay that hand palm down on your other arm, as shown in diagram. Your 4 fingers now show distribution: spells PFPF [pass/fail, pass/fail]: Pronator teres Flexor carpi radialis Palmaris longus Flexor carpi ulnaris Your thumb below your 4 fingers shows the muscle which is deep to the other four: Flexor digitorum superficialis.  

Carpal tunnel syndrome causes MEDIAN TRAP: Myxoedema Edema premenstrually Diabetes Idiopathic Agromegaly Neoplasm Trauma Rheumatoid arthritis Amyloidosis Pregnancy • Mnemonic fits nicely since median nerve is trapped.

Occulomotor nerve (III) Trochlear nerve (IV) Ophthalmic nerve (V1) Maxillary nerve (V2) Carotid artery Abducent nerve (VI) T: When written, connects to the T of OTOM.  

Bronchi: which one is more vertical&quot;Inhale a bite, goes down the right&quot;: Inhaled objects more likely to lodge in right bronchus, since it is the one that is more vertical

61

Carotid sheath contents &quot;I See 10 CC's in the IV&quot;:
I See (I.C.) = Internal Carotid artery

Parietal
Ethmoid
Sphenoid
Temporal
Occipital
Frontal
• The 6 just reminds that there's 6 of them to remember.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lists can be created, stored and accessed in several ways.  On the Home Screen, simple list operations can be performed.  The editor in the STAT menu is used for more comprehensive needs.

A list must have at least one element in it.  Trying to work with a list with no elements, will cause an error message.

=== On the home screen ===

To enter a list of real numbers on the home screen, start with a curly bracket: '''{'''.  Follow this with the numbers in the list separated by commas.  End the list with a closing curly bracket: '''}'''.

:The open-curly is the 2nd function on the open-parenthesis key, just above the 8 key.  The comma key is just above the 7 key.  The close-curly is on the close-parenthesis key, just above the 9 key.  [[TI-Lists/TI-86#Curly Brackets|(TI-86)]]

Pressing ENTER after creating a list in this way, displays it without commas.  

:{3,5,8,1}
::::{3 5 8 1}

If the list is to long to display in one line, the first part is shown followed by an ellipsis (...).  At this point, more of the list can be viewed by pressing the Right and Left arrow keys to move it in either direction.  If something is entered on the next line, the list will no longer move.

To store a list from the home screen, use the STO key, either on the same line as creating the list or the next line.  Choose a list variable L1 through L6.  (2nd function on the 1 through 6 keys.)  [[TI-Lists/TI-86#List variable names|(TI-86)]]

:{3,5,8,1,4} STO&gt; L1
::::{3 5 8 1 4}
:{-6,0} STO&gt; L2
::::{-6 0}

To access a list after it has been stored, use the same list variable key.  (Lists can be stored using other single letter variable names on the home screen, but access them is more complicated and will be covered later.)

:L1
::::{3 5 8 1 4}

=== In the STAT Editor ===

'''STAT:1''' is used to enter a list in this editor.  (Press the STAT key.  It is just below the DEL key.  Press ENTER or 1, to access the editor.)  The first three L-variables are displayed with their values, if any. [[TI-Lists/TI-86#List Edit menu|(TI-86)]] Use the Left and Right arrows to access more lists.  Enter numbers into the list, pressing ENTER or the Down arrow, after each one.

After creating a list, you can move to the right to access another one.

The STAT Editor can also be used to modify lists.
*To delete a number from a list, move down to highlight it, and press '''DEL'''.
*To change a number in a list, highlight  the old value, and enter the new value.  When you hit ENTER or Down, it is replaced.
*To insert a new place in a list, highlight the first number that will follow the new one, and press '''2nd:INS(DEL)'''.  A zero value will be inserted and highlighted, which can then immediately be replaced by typing in the new number.

It is often handy to view long lists in this editor.  Seven values are displayed in each of three lists, and as you scroll down all the values can be seen.

=== With arithmetic or functions ===

In the next sections we cover lists in arithmetic operations, lists in arithmetic functions and list functions.  Each time a list is used in an arithmetic calculation a new list is created.  Each time a list is used in an arithmetic function a new list is created.  Some of the list functions create an answer that is a list.  These new lists can be stored in a list variable or used in another arithmetic or list operation.

It would be correct to state that amateurs can have a rank from 30 through 9 dan. Professionals only have ranks 1 dan through 9 dan but  the ranking system is independent or different from the armature one for this reason a 1 dan and 1 pro dan are different levels of strength.

We need to work on the organization, focus, format of this textbook. We need to make it distinct from other online content to give it greater purpose.

I would like to thank whoever got this book on the AGA newsletter (I'm a little behind on emails) I have beet thinking of doing it for a while now but never have. unfortunatly I don't think it has helped much.--[[User:Ulfrinn|Ulfrinn]] 18:55, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

== Structure changes ==
--[[User:Mystic Philosopher|Mystic Philosopher]] 02:17, 26 March 2006 (UTC) I made changes to the structure layout and developed an introduction. Any thoughts on these changes?

take a look at [http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fde.wikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FGo this page] it is the german wikibook (translated with bable fish). It should be a good guide to help with this book.[[User:Ulfrinn|Ulfrinn]] 05:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

I have made many changes to the layout of the book which I think will make it more reader friendly. Many pages still need work and I do not currently have time to do it. Since I have changed the layout many of the links, pointing to the next and previous pages, at the bottums of the pages are now wrong I will adress this when I have more time. [[User:Ulfrinn|Ulfrinn]] 23:54, 30 July 2006

Those did a great job who wrore this book. But I think a major restructuring and rewriting should be done. The reason is simple: a beginner will play the first couple of games on a board 9X9 most likely. With some experience she or he will switch to 13X13. So smaller board games should be described with the corresponding theory. This would belong to the beginner section. Any comments? [[User:Gabaux|Gabaux]] ([[User talk:Gabaux|talk]]) 08:56, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

A suggestion to restructure and rewrite the whole 'Beginners' section:
* move the chapter 'What you need to play' to section 'Introduction'
* Lesson 1: Basic rules and techniques (topics covered: rules of the game, prohibition of suicide moves, ko rule, atari, elementary examples of liberty counting and capturing)
* Lesson 2: Small board games (two games on 9X9 board, one with handicap, one without, and the most elementary game comments.)
* Lesson 3: Introduction to the tactics of Go (the concept of eyes, simple tesujis like the ladder and the geta, simple life and death problems.) It should be very good to use examples from the two games as ilustrations of the tactical elements.
* Lesson 4: Introduction to the strategy of Go (Elementary concepts of strategy, keeping and taking the initiative, sente and gote)
* Lesson 5: Playing on the medium sized board...

My ideas or not clear from this point. I will formulate in a couple of days.

== Things to do==
#in general we need content.
#specifically Joseki and Fuseki additions and additions to the beginner section as well.
#lessons (there are now 2 lesson 3&amp;4 joseki and fuseki need to be renumberd as soon as we got the lessons straight)

== Additions to Life and Death and Capture Strategy ==

I've added some prelim information that may help readers, however, it does need to be elaborated.  The information that i have provided should help guide further editors on the subject.  

Capture strategy has yet to be discussed.  I shall be pulling some stuff from &quot;Teach Yourself:Go&quot; in the near future so that we may be able to develope this area furthur. --[[User:Devildope|Devildope]] 12:48, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

: Be slightly careful of copyright. It's a great book and Charles Matthews has done a brilliant job with general go material for beginners and stronger players alike, but he is also protective of intellectual property (and reasonably so). [[User:Topazg|Topazg]] 10:34, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== Japanese pronunciation of Go ==

I am no linguistics expert, but as far as I understood the &quot;i&quot; at the beginning is silent, and it is just pronounced &quot;Go&quot; (hence I think the western pronunciation also) - Can anyone else shed further light on this? [[User:Topazg|Topazg]] 18:07, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== Ruleset ==
Maybe it would be best to pick a ruleset and stick with at, at least for the earlier chapters. For example, you could then mention the no suicide rule. I think japanese rules would be best, because they are common in the west, and they don't have things like pass stones and white having to go last.

      <comment>Proof of existence of inverse</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Proof of (non-)existence of inverse ==
I've managed to make a proof for the general case, thinking about adding it to make the inverse section more complete, but from this version it seems that the proof can be simplified further. Also, this proof employ the lemma in proving fermat's little theorem, but that lemma is proved by the existence of inverse theorem, which create a circular logic(although this lemma can actually be proven without relying on this theorem, but then I'm not sure should I edit that lemma section also to remove inconsistency if we were to add this proof in).

Anyway, here is the proof.(Note: in all case, x does not equal to 0)

Lemma: &lt;math&gt;(\gcd(x,n)=1) \Rightarrow (ax=bx \pmod{n} \iff a=b \pmod{n})&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:&lt;math&gt;a=b \pmod{n} \Rightarrow ax=bx \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; is obvious.

Now we'll prove that &lt;math&gt;ax=bx \pmod{n} \Rightarrow a=b \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ax=bx \pmod{n} \iff ax-bx=0 \pmod{n} \iff (a-b)x=0 \pmod{n} \iff a-b=0 \pmod{n} (\gcd(x,n)=1) \iff a=b \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Theorem: &lt;math&gt;( \exists x^{-1} )( xx^{-1} = 1 \pmod{n} ) \iff (\gcd(x,n)=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: We'll prove this by breaking it into two part.

Part a: &lt;math&gt;(\gcd(x,n)=1) \Rightarrow ( \exists x^{-1} )( xx^{-1} = 1 \pmod{n} )&lt;/math&gt;

From the lemma, we know that x,2x,3x...(n-1)x are all distinct mod n, hence there must be at least one of them that is equal to 1.

Part b: &lt;math&gt;(\gcd(x,n) \ne 1) \Rightarrow (\forall y)(xy \ne 1 \pmod{n})&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the opposite is true, that is, there is such a 'y'. Now let their gcd be g, and x=ga, n=gb.

&lt;math&gt;xy=1 \pmod{n} \iff xy=1+kn \iff xy-kn=1 \iff gay-gkb=1 \iff g(ay-kb)=1 \iff ay-kb=\frac{1}{g}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer k.

But as a,y,k,b are all integer, this is absurd.

Q.E.D

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello! Anybody out there? ==
This is a good topic for a wikibook, I think.  I was considering writing on paining an automobile, I don't know if this would be the right place.  Regardless, I'd like to contribute, but I think the information here should be a little more general; when I work an a car, I don't follow a step by step recipe.  First I use what I know about how the thing works to try and diagnose the problem, and if the solution is replacing a part, I use common sense and a general knowledge of what a part looks like to find the old one and get it out, then I put the new part in using the reverse process, or if it's a complicated process, I use the same knowledge of how an auto operates to figure out what goes where.  This approach is much more useful I think, it allows for differences in automobiles and it's much more flexible as far as different problems go.  It does, however, require a more intimate knowledge about the mechanics of autos, which may be a disadvantage for people who just want to replace the alternator in their 1979 mercury cougar for cheaper than a mechanic will do it.  I, for one, feel that an empirical approach to automobile repair is somehow the Wrong Thing though. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:65.126.46.104|65.126.46.104]] ([[User talk:65.126.46.104|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/65.126.46.104|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

* Sounds like a good topic, with basic repairs and maintenance such as doing an oil change. [[User:Kmf164|Kmf164]] 16:46, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

* I agree, and there is already some good material that just needs organizing into a book. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Automobile_repair_99_mercury_cougar_alternator_replacement and http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Automobile_repair It needs a Wiki Pro to merge this material.

* I think this is a great forum for auto repair material.  I started adding some &quot;recipe&quot; stuff because I think that's ultimately what I'm going to want when I look to doing a repair that I might only do once in a few years (I'm a diy guy).  I want to know beforehand about what bizarre tool or procedure I'm going to need so I don't waste my saturday.  But, I agree with having general &quot;how it works content&quot;.   I thought about organizing this book to have general sections on automobile modes of failure, diagnosis, and repair as well as sections on specifics for each vehicle.  It seems that this is the right place for this sort of thing. Wikipedia on the other hand does a fine job of discussing each vehicle generally and very general automotive concepts.   References to wikipedia should be made when appropriate.

== Merge candidate ==
merging would be a great idea. I have built some cars and other vehicles both as an ameture and a professional.
The more people that share their experience the better the forum could be. Even the blind squirrel finds the occasional nut!
I learned a long time ago to use the divide &amp; conquer technique to find and repair a problem in the least amount of time.
It has proven to be the most effective way (time &amp; money)to repair a vehicle. I can share this technique with anyone who is
interested. phill.brosseau@gmail.com

== Organizing information with templates ==

Hello all!

I've been working on the Volvo section and have run into a situation that I'd like to get some opinions on. I'm taking a look at the bigger picture and see that auto-repair templates could be a great help for this book. 

Basically lots of information can be applied to various models, engines or bodies of a vehicle. If you write an article on any given procedure for a certain model+year+engine, it is likely applicable to a variety of other models, years or engines. 

Because of this, it seems ideal to break up procedures and information into small chunks that could be assembled based on what the user selects for the Model, Year and Engine. Being able to pull up the information dynamically already makes this book less of a 'book' but otherwise we will eventually be replicating procedures and information. Possibly even creating inconsistencies across the book. I'm beginning to think this would be beyond the scope of a template, however, I would like to hear what other people think about this problem and possible solutions.

Right now I'm trying to build templates that would let the user choose the model, then year, then engine. But I can already see that this will create a huge number of permutations when you consider all model, year and engine combinations. If anyone has ideas or could help with the design of templates that could be used across different auto manufacturers, I'm sure everyone would be greatly appreciative.

== Added section for the Toyota Prius ==
Hi people. Just added [[Automobile Repair/Toyota/Prius]]. It's a bit of a work in progress and I'm trying to keep it Prius/hybrid specific. So far mine has been almost ludicrously reliable (not even a blown bulb after 5 years) so finding things to write about is going to take some research! Rereading the document, something that stands out in mine is the British wording, whereas the rest of this 'book' seems to be highly Americanised - may need to look into some rewording to make it match the rest of the 'book', what do you think? Would welcome any comment, but please be gentle - this is my first offering :)  --[[User:Lunawisp|Lunawisp]] ([[User talk:Lunawisp|talk]]) 16:22, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

== Holden Astra 2003 Wont Start ==

I bought an Astra today. The car was low on fuel. 
Tried to start the car again and it would only just wind over but not starting. 
I though it may be just because of the low fuel so I placed more fuel in with a fuel can but still will not start.
Any answers?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alternator replacement:
The placement of the alternator in the 1999 Mercury Cougar can really take the fun out of performing your own automotive repair, but hopefully with these tips you can avoid the 6-hour job taking days instead.

1.  Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.  Using a 3/8&quot; drive, release tension on the tensioner and slip the belt off of an accessory.

3.  Loosen the passenger side front wheel lug nuts, then raise front of vehicle and remove wheel.

4.  Reinstall two adjacent lug nuts onto the brake rotor and using a prybar on the lugnuts and a socket with a breaker bar, loosen and remove the nut from the splined half shaft(this nut supposedly looses its torque ability and needs to be replaced after being loosened).

5.  Remove the Stabilizer bar link.  This will require two wrenches, one placed near the rubber seal area.  (This step caused me a 3-day delay as I had to order a new one when the nut broke off with the bolt intake)

6.  Remove the steering knuckle pinch bolt and separate the ball joint from the &quot;A&quot;-shaped suspension component with the appropriate tool or prybar.

7.  Remove the &quot;Y&quot;-shaped exhaust pipe from underneath the vehicle.  Spraying a lubricant on the 6 studs and nuts will aid the removal of these nuts.  (Stripping of these threads is easily done with the galling that can happen from the hot conditions it has undergone.  This accounts to adding another 3 days to my repair.If possible tighten the nut 1/8 of a turn before removing to keep from pulling rust into threads)

8.  Remove the half shaft after extracting it from the steering nuckle.  (It may be just as easy to remove the nuckle prior to removal of the half shaft, even though this requires removing the ABS sensor, brake caliper, and rotor.)  A slide hammer can assist on freeing the half shaft from the other half shaft.

9.  Loosen the 5 nuts needed to remove the half shaft that goes into the transmission.  Apparently this half shaft is balanced from the factory and should be reinstalled in the same alignment, so mark the transaxle and the half shaft to make this possible.  Remove the half shaft.

10. There are 3 electrical connections to the alternator: a 3-pin connector that can be removed by slipping off the  clip, a 1-pin connector that is removed by gently prying the plastic clip portion up, and a battery cable sized cable that attaches with a nut that can be removed with a 3/16&quot; socket.

11. There are now 4 bolts that need to be loosened before the alternator can be removed.  Three of the bolts are easily reached, while the 4th is not visible and will have to be felt for.  A 13mm socket will be needed to remove these bolts.  The exhaust manifold and the attached O2 sensor blocks access to the hidden bolt, and removal of the manifold has its own set of hidden bolts which makes removal of the manifold to access the alternator bolt unfeasible.

12.  Installation is the reverse of the above, but it is highly recommended that you replace the O2 sensor that is now exposed.  It uses a square connector, not a round one like the more accessible &quot;catalyst monitor&quot; sensors.  This vehicle has a whopping 4 sensors distributed over 2 banks.  If you choose to replace this sensor, a tip on removing the electrical connector: find a 3-inch or so 3/16&quot; diameter or less piece of metal(I used a tap) and using one hand to feel for the access hole which will point to the rear of the vehicle, use the other hand with the metal piece to insert into the hole and releasing the clip, pull on the connector to disconnect the heated oxygen sensor.

==Alternative method==

This task can also be accomplished WITHOUT removing the drive shafts.

Jack the car up as high as possible and support with jack stands.

1. Disconnect the battery.

2. Remove the passenger side wheel &amp; inner fender well covers

.  

4. Remove the serpentine belt from the alternator.


6. Unbolt the steering joint &amp; press out of the steering arm.

At this point you should be able to see the bottom portion of the 
alternator

9. Use a 13mm socket with a universal joint on the end of a long
extension to get to the upper alternator bolt.  I was able to reach
around into the wheel well with my right hand up to the top of the 
alternator bolt to help guide the socket onto the bolt.



11. The rear alternator bracket is removed with a 10mm socket.

12. Once the bolts are out you make need to pry the alternator out of 
the bottom of its mount.  

13. Once loose, pivot the alternator on its pulley down towards the 
control arm.  If you are having problems bringing the alterantor down
past the rubber boot, just rotate the brake disk and it will walk the 
alternator out.  You will have easy access to the electrical connections.

Replace with new alternator and reverse the process. 

While you are down there you can splice a jumper wire from the Red wire
in the three wire plug over to the &quot;Output&quot; terminal of the alternator.

Question: Why?

Answer:  It gives the voltage regulator a better reading than the 
factory wire that runs all over the engine compartment.  The factory
did the same thing in the later model cars.  I think there was even a
recall for this.   If your battery light flickers when the engine is
rev'd up than this is an inexpensive mod that may fix your problems.

ADVICE: 

I've done this job and it is a BEAR!!! I recommend that one has access to a lift as life will be a lot easier. Also power air tools with a flex shaft extension* for sockets. This will alleviate some disconneting of components for access purposes. 

This is a job one will not want to repeat so I recommend that you spend the money and buy a good replacement alternator-I got a rebuilt one with a 3 yr. warranty. ($170).

Reassembly can be difficult too. I have long arms so I could reach through from the middle of the car as there is a small passage way. I found the reconnecting of wires to be VERY difficult-took several attempts to align things and tighten.

Absolutely make sure to properly put on the serpentine belt-align it and release the tensioner-making sure it is in the proper grooves-no overlap of pulleys as this stress on start up may in my opinion crack one's alternator case.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Barbarians are a touchy subject. When the term is used correctly, they are semi-nomadic, lack a visible set of laws, and raid and pillage for their livelihood. When it isn't used correctly, they are cultures that have less developed technology and different standards of beauty, law, social expectation, and so on. We will be talking of barbarians of the first kind.

Barbarians have two reasons for raiding and pillaging. The first one is purely empirical: the need for material objects. To this end, their ruthless tactics might be explained by &quot;gaining reputation,&quot; so as to frighten the villagers when they attack and make the battle that much easier. Their other reason is not so well supported: the desire to create an &quot;Empire.&quot; Everyone hates insults about them, for example, a male will not be happy while listening to a radical feminist tirade about the worse qualities of men and how this makes them inferior. To this end, Barbarians hate being degraded as barbarians, and, in some small way, want to make the folk tales of them being demons end. They want to join the civilized world, and they think that only if they conquer enough civilizations, then they'll become civilized.

Barbarians have a distinct culture. Often, their religion is a violent one, where the gods demand human sacrifices. Additionally, laws are most often written by the sword.

Briskly boil a small amount of water for a short time in a soft drink can (until it is full of steam) Then, using a pair of tongs (or clamp if your tongs are too small), swiftly invert the can and plunge it into a large beaker (bowl or bucket) of cold water. The steam condenses, the pressure inside the can falls, and the can collapses (is crushed by the higher atmospheric pressure weighing on the outside of the can).

==Understanding systems==
We conceptualize the world around us in terms of systems. A '''system''' is a web of interconnected objects working together in tandem. In the [[w:Systems theory|systems theory]], a system is set out as a single entity within a world surrounded by an environment. A system interacts with its surrounding environment using messages of two distinct types:
* '''inputs:''' messages received from the surrounding environment; and,
* '''outputs:''' messages given back to the surrounding environment.

{{Java/Illustration
|number=1
|caption=A simple system interacting with its environment using input and output messages.
|image=[[File:Understanding Systems.svg|center]]
}}

Life is a complicated mess of interconnected objects sending signals and messages. See the illustration below in figure 2 demonstrating a complex system for an economic ecosphere for a single company. Imagine what this system diagram would be like if you were to add a few more companies and their sub-systems. Computer software systems in general are a complex web of further interconnected '''sub-systems''' &amp;ndash; where each sub-systems may or may not be divided into further sub-systems. Each sub-system communicates with others using '''feedback''' messages &amp;ndash; that is, ''inputs'' and ''outputs''.

==The process of abstraction==
Programming is essentially thinking of solutions to problems in real life as a system. With any programming language, you need to know how to address real-life problems into something that could be accurately represented within a computer system. In order to begin programming with the Java programming language (or in fact, with any programming language), a programmer must first understand the basics of abstraction.

'''Abstraction''' is the process of ''representing'' real-life problems and object into your programs.

Suppose a novelist, a painter and a programmer were asked to ''abstract'' (i.e., ''represent'') a real-life object in their work. Suppose, the real-life object that needs to be abstracted is ''an animal''. Abstraction for a novelist would include writing the description of the animal whilst the painter would draw a picture of the animal &amp;ndash; but what about a computer programmer?

The Java programming language uses a programming paradigm called [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented programming (OOP)]], which shows you exactly what a programmer needs to be doing. According to OOP, every object or problem in real-life can be translated into a virtual object within your computer system.

===Thinking in objects===
In OOP, every abstraction of a real-life object is simply called an '''object''' within your code. An object is essentially the most basic representation of a real-life object as part of a computer system. With Java being an object-oriented language, everything within Java is represented as an object. To demonstrate this effect, if you were to define an abstraction of an animal in your code, you would write the following lines of code (as you would for any other abstraction):

{{Java|code=
class Animal { }
}}

The code above creates a space within your code where you can start ''defining'' an object; this space is called a '''class (''or'' type) definition'''. All objects need to be defined using a class definition in order for them to be used in your program. Notice the curly brackets &amp;ndash; anything you write within these brackets would serve as a definition or specification for your object. In the case of the example above, we created a class definition called &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; for objects that could serve as an abstract representation of any animal in real-life. The way that a Java environment evaluates this code to be a class definition is by looking at the prefix word we used to begin our class definition (i.e., &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;). Such predefined words in the Java language are known as '''keywords''' and make up the grammar for the language (known as '''programming syntax''').

{{NOTE|Class definitions have different names in different languages. They are sometimes called '''type definitions''', '''object specifications''' or '''templates''' as well|Java Programming}}

===Understanding class definitions and types===
[[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] was perhaps the first person to think of abstract types or typologies of objects. He started calling them classes &amp;ndash; e.g., classes of birds, classes of mammals. Class definitions therefore serve the purpose well in defining the common characteristics or types of objects you would be creating. Upon declaring a class definition, you can create objects based on that definition. In order to do so however, you need to write a special syntax that goes like this:
{{Java|code=
Animal dog = new Animal();
}}

The code above effectively creates an object called &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; based on the class definition for &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;. In non-programmer parlance, the code above would translate into something akin to saying, &quot;Create a new object &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;.&quot; A single class definition enables you to create multiple objects as the code below indicates:
{{Java|code=
Animal dog = new Animal();
Animal cat = new Animal();
Animal camel = new Animal();
}}

Basically, you just have to write the code for your class or type definition once, and then use it to create countless numbers of objects based on that specification. Although you might not grasp the importance of doing so, this little exercise saves you a lot of time (a luxury that was not readily available to programmers in the pre-Java days).

===Expanding your class definitions===
Although each object you create from a class definition is essentially the same, there has to be a way of differentiating those objects in your code. Object fields (or simply '''fields''') are what makes your objects unique from other objects. Let's take our present abstraction for instance. An animal could be a dog, cat, camel or a duck but since this abstraction is of a very generic kind, you need to define fields that are common to all of these animals and yet makes the animals stand apart. For instance, you can have two fields: '''name''' (a common name given to any one of these animals) and '''legs''' (the number of limbs any one of these animals would require to walk). As you start defining your objects, they start to look like this:

{{Java|code=
class Animal {

  String name;
  int legs;
}
}}

In the code above you defined two object fields:
* a field called &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;; and,
* a field called &lt;code&gt;legs&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

These special pre-defined types are called '''data types'''. The &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; data type is used for fields that can hold ''textual'' values like names, while the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (integer) data type is used for fields that can hold ''numeric'' values
{{NOTE|Fields are called different things in different languages. They may be called '''state identifiers''', '''properties''' or '''member variables''' in other programming language syntax. Java uses the words ''fields'' and ''properties'' in different contexts, as would be understood from upcoming sections.|Java Programming}}
{{Java/Illustration
|number=3
|caption=In order to denote the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; object as a system within the Java Environment,&lt;br&gt;you present it as such. Note how fields are presented.
|image=[[File:Object in Java Environment.svg|center]]
}}

In order to demonstrate how fields work, we will go ahead and create objects from this amended version of our class definition as such:
{{Java|code=
Animal animal1 = new Animal();
Animal animal2 = new Animal();

animal1.name = &quot;dog&quot;;
animal1.legs = 4;

animal2.name = &quot;duck&quot;;
animal2.legs = 2;
}}

You can access the fields of your created objects by using the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (dot) or '''membership operator'''. In the example above, we created two objects: &lt;code&gt;animal1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;animal2&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;. And since, we had established that each &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; has two fields namely &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;legs&lt;/code&gt;, we accessed and modified these fields for each of our objects using the membership operator to set the two apart. By declaring different values for different objects, we can manipulate their current '''state'''. So, for instance:
* the &lt;code&gt;animal1&lt;/code&gt; object is a &lt;code&gt;&quot;dog&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; legs to walk with; while,
* the &lt;code&gt;animal2&lt;/code&gt; object is a &lt;code&gt;&quot;duck&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; legs to walk with.

What sets the two objects apart is their current state. Both the objects have different states and thus stand out as two different objects even though they were created from the same template or class definition.

===Adding behavior to objects===
At this point, your objects do nothing more than declare a bunch of fields. Being a system, your objects should have the ability to interact with its environment and other systems as well. To add this capability for interaction, you need to add interactive behavior to your object class definitions as well. Such behavior is added to class definitions using a programming construct called '''method'''.

In the case of the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;, you require your virtual representation of an animal to be able to move through its environment. Let's say, as an analogy, you want your &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; object to be able to walk in its environment. Thus, you need to add a method named &lt;code&gt;walk&lt;/code&gt; to our object. To do so, we need to write the following code:

{{Java|code=
class Animal {

  String name;
  int legs;

  void walk() { }
}
}}

As you write this code, one thing becomes immediately apparent. Just like the class description, a method has curly brackets as well. Generally, curly brackets are used to define an area (or '''scope''') within your object. So the first set of curly brackets defined a scope for your class definition called the '''class-level scope'''. This new set of curly brackets alongside a method defines a scope for the further definition of your method called the '''method-level scope'''.

In this instance, the name of our method is &lt;code&gt;walk&lt;/code&gt;. Notice however that the name of our method also features a set of round brackets as well. More than just being visual identifiers for methods, these round brackets are used to provide our methods with additional input information called '''arguments'''.

A method therefore enables an object to:
# Accept input: Receive some argument(s);
# Process information: work on the received argument(s) within its curly brackets; and,
# Generate ouput: ''occasionally'', return something back.

In essence, methods are what makes an object behave more like a system.

Notice the keyword &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; before the name of the method &amp;ndash; this tells us that the method &lt;code&gt;walk&lt;/code&gt; returns ''nothing''. You can set a method to return any data type &amp;ndash; it can be a '''String''' or an '''int''' as well.

{{NOTE|Methods are known by different names in different programming language. They might be called '''functions''', '''procedures''', '''routines''' or '''behaviors'''.|Java Programming}}
{{Java/Illustration
|number=4
|caption=The &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; object can now be denoted as having an interaction behavior within the Java Environment&lt;br&gt;as illustrated here. Note the difference between the presentation of fields and methods.
|image=[[File:Object Behavior in Java Environment.svg|center]]
}}

==The process of encapsulation==
By now, we thoroughly understand that any object can interact with its environment and in turn be influenced by it. In our example, the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; object exposed certain fields &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;legs&lt;/code&gt;, and a method &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;walk()&lt;/code&gt; to be used by the environment to manipulate the object. This form of exposure is implicit. Using the Java programming language, a programmer has the power to define the level of access other objects and the environment have on a certain object.

===Using access modifiers===
Alongside declaring and defining objects, their fields and methods, a programmer also has the ability to define the levels of access on those elements. This is done using keywords known as '''access modifiers'''.

Let's modify our example to demonstrate this effect:
{{Java|code=
class Animal {

  public String name;
  public int legs;

  public void walk() { }
}
}}

By declaring all fields and methods &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, we have ensured that they can be used outside the scope of the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class. This means that any other object (other than &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;) has access to these member elements. However, to restrict access to certain member elements of a class, we can always use the &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; access modifier (as demonstrated below).
{{Java|code=
class Animal {

  private String name;
  private int legs;

  public void walk() { }
}
}}

In this example, the fields &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;legs&lt;/code&gt; can only be accessed within the scope of the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class. No object outside the scope of this class can access these two fields. However, since the &lt;code&gt;walk()&lt;/code&gt; method still has &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; access, it can be manipulated by actors and objects outside the scope of this class. Access modifiers are not just limited to fields or methods, they can be used for class definitions as well (as is demonstrated below).
{{Java|code=
public class Animal {

  private String name;
  private int legs;

  public void walk() { }
}
}}

The following list of keywords show the valid access modifiers that can be used with a Java program:
{|class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
!keyword
!description
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;
|Opens access to a certain field or method to be used outside the scope of the class.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;
|Restricts access to a certain field or method to only be used within the scope of the class.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt;
|Access to certain field or methods is reserved for classes that inherit the current class.&lt;br&gt;More on this would be discussed in the section on ''inheritance''.

Extrude outwards the hood and trunk volumes.&lt;br&gt;(Bonnet &amp; boot for those more used to the U.K. terminology.)
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:Step3.jpg]]

Extrude upward the cab volume.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_quad_car_Step4.jpg]]

Scale car, move edges, etc. in order to make proportions more car-like.&lt;br&gt;
Note window angles, roof line, body lines, cab profile, etc.&lt;br&gt;
In addition to being shorter than the body, the roof also tends to be less wide as well.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_quad_car_tut_5.jpg]]

Select edge ring (default hotkey &quot;g&quot;) and connect (default hotkey &quot;c&quot;) to create centerline.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_quadcar_Step6.jpg]]

Move centerline edges as necessary to define shape a little better.&lt;br&gt;
Note that on most cars, the front and rear windshields have some curvature.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step7.jpg]]

Add these edges to help define the lower body.&lt;br&gt;
Can be done rapidly by selecting appropriate edge ring, hitting &quot;3&quot;, and then connecting.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step8.jpg]]

Add these edge loops to help start the front wheel wells.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step9.jpg]]

I almost forgot. These edges must be added as well before doing making the wheel wells.&lt;br&gt;
Don't forget to adjust where needed to maintain proper curvature on cab windshields.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step10.jpg]]

Select these faces and dissolve.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step11.jpg]]

Connect vertices on front and back corners to create diagonal edges.&lt;br&gt;
(A second diagonal edge is in the front of the wheel well area.)&lt;br&gt;
Making the edges may take more than one step.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step12.jpg]]

Connect the front and back diagonals created previously.
&lt;hr&gt;

[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step13.jpg]]

Scale edge Radial | radial Z | Scale to point. Select same point as illustrated. Scale to 0%.&lt;br&gt; (Holding shift will make snapping to 0% easy.)&lt;br&gt; This is faster than two separate vertice flatten operations.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step14.jpg]]

Create edges inside wheel well (connect, cut, etc.) so that existing edge loops maintain continuity.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step15.jpg]]

Create these &quot;control&quot; edge loops on the cab area of the car.&lt;br&gt;Using slide twice makes placement easy.&lt;br&gt;First slide relative +/- 100%, then without deselecting slide distance desired amount.
&lt;hr&gt;

Create another set of control loops as in the illustration.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step17.jpg]]

Create and place an edge loop as illustrated.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step18.jpg]]

Select edges and slide back as shown in illustration.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step19.jpg]]

Select these faces and repeat the same steps used earlier to make the front wheel well.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step20.jpg]]

Select faces as pictured and scale along Z axis.&lt;br&gt;
(Faces on front inside of wheel wells are also selected but not visible in picture.)&lt;br&gt;
This shapes the wheel openings.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step21.jpg]]

Select these edges and move on Y axis to further adjust wheel well shape.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step22.jpg]]

Loop cut along the centerline. Select the unfinished half and delete it.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step23.jpg]]

Select resulting centerline face, then switch to verts. Flatten verts along x-axis.&lt;br&gt;
(This step works with my personal workflow as I've had problems with the virtual mirror.&lt;br&gt;
It ensures centerline verts actually lie along the centerline when using a RMB reference.&lt;br&gt;
If you find the virtual mirror to work better, you can adapt your workflow to use it.)
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step24.jpg]]

Select centerline face again, mirror.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step25.jpg]]

Of course you would think that it would be done in the previous step.&lt;br&gt;As the smoothed preview here shows, this is definitely not the case.&lt;br&gt;(This is true if you plan on smoothing it later.)&lt;br&gt;Right now it would be a bit &quot;nerfy&quot; if smoothed.&lt;br&gt;Thus a couple more steps to go.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step26.jpg]]

Select all the faces inside the wheel wells and extrude region normal.
&lt;hr&gt;

[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step27.jpg]]

Create these controlling edge loops.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step28.jpg]]

Select these faces. Extrude region 0 units. (Use tab entry and enter 0, or use shift to constrain.)
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step29.jpg]]

Without deselecting faces from before, hit &quot;l&quot; (L, not 1). This will select the edge loops that go around the edges. Slide inward.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step30.jpg]]

Select the faces on the sides as shown. Extrude region outwards a small amount.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step31.jpg]]

Select edges shown. Slide so that edges move inward on the side.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step32.jpg]]

Create some more &quot;control&quot; edge loops such as the ones highlighted here.
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:W3D_all_quad_car_Step33.jpg]]

Let's see how it looks with basic wheels, a few more minor tweaks, and in smoothed preview.&lt;br&gt;
Pretty good, isn't it? You can either use the model as it is for low poly applications, smooth a few times, or use it as the base mesh for a more detailed model. (Maybe the final result here will be the start for a later tutorial on modeling detailed cars in Wings 3D.)

After modeling cars this way a few times, it should become obvious as to how the mesh can be changed for different models.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Charter of the United Nations is the document by which all member states agree to uphold. Introduced and signed on June 25, 1945, in San Francisco the Charter outlines the responsibilities and jobs the United Nations holds. One integral part of the Charter states that it supersedes all other treaties and agreements.

The Charter came into force on October 24, following ratification by the US, UK, China, France and Russia. It has since been signed by all 191 nations except for the Holy See.

The Charter consists of a preamble and chapters outlining the specific parts and duties. 

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 1|Chapter I]]''' sets forth the purposes of the United Nations, including the important provisions of the maintenance of international peace and security. 

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 2|Chapter II]]''' defines the criteria for membership in the United Nations. 

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 3|Chapter III]]''' establishes the six principal organs of the United Nations.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 4|Chapter IV]]''' describes the General Assembly's duties and procedures and voting of matters assigned to it.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 5|Chapter V]]''' describes the Security Council's membership, functions, powers and procedures.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 6|Chapter VI]]''' describes the Security Council's power to investigate and mediate disputes.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 7|Chapter VII]]''' describes the Security Council's power to authorize economic, diplomatic, and military sanctions, as well as the use of military force, to resolve disputes.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 8|Chapter VIII]]''' describes the Security Council's cooperation with local agencies to seek a peaceful resolution.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 9|Chapter IX]]''' describes the UN's powers for economic and social cooperation.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 10|Chapter X]]''' describes the Economic and Social Council's duties and purposes for economic and social cooperation.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 11|Chapter XI]]''' describes the administarting of territories and rights subject to territories.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 12|Chapter XII]]''' describes the Trusteeship Council's duties and goals for decolonization.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 13|Chapter XIII]]''' describes the Trusteeship Council's membership, functions and powers.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 14|Chapter XIV]]''' describes the International Court of Justice's status as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 15|Chapter XV]]''' describes Secretariat's duties to the fellow organs and membership.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 16|Chapter XVI]]''' describes the enforcement of international agreements passed by the United Nations.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 17|Chapter XVII]]''' describes the preclusion of powers of hostile countries during World War II.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 18|Chapter XVIII]]''' describes the coming into force of the Charter upon adoption by two-thirds of the member nations.

*'''[[United Nations/Charter/Chapter 19|Chapter XIX]]''' describes the coming into force of the Charter upon the ratification by the US, UK, France, China and Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello all.  I've created this tutorial to show how easy it is to model a car in Wings3D. The basic mesh created is quite flexible and relatively low poly. From this mesh it should be possible to develop many car designs via modification. Also it should answer some problems faced by new/intermediate Wings3D users in the process of modeling cars.  If there are any problems with this tutorial it might be in length and number of pictures used. Perhaps it could be edited later to fit more consistant formatting and maybe separate pages.

Paul - 
A useful tut, but I've a few minor queries and I wondered if you'd prefer to alter / edit your own stuff?

&lt;&lt; plan drawings in Isometric view &gt;&gt;
Is 'isometric' what you really mean - rather than ortho / 3 view or similar?

Am curious why in steps 23/24 (I think) you selected the VM face, converted to verts, flattened, then back to face mode to select VM face - rather than using Face | Flatten (would rmb flatten be worth a brief mention re badly distorted mesh being kept on the zero centreline?)

Elegant use of scale rad &gt; 0 in (13), btw - but 'vertice'? :)

As this is only meant for you, pl. delete after reading.

pp&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
 Is 'isometric' what you really mean - rather than ortho / 3 view or similar?

I did some minor changes as per suggestion. I changed iso to ortho, although it does appear to render a view as isometric when not viewed direcly side on.

Also when are you going to post a tut here pp? (No ads, the server is fairly reliable, and the Wings 3D wiki needs it.) You've made some incredibly good beginner tutorials, I think they'd do alright here. (Or do you think someone will come in and really mess up your work?)

I don't mind getting input btw. That's what this discussion is for. Also don't worry about anyone reading this. Think of the discussion as providing a context towards changes made in the tutorial. If anything is badly written or plain wrong, the beauty of a wiki is that anyone can go and change it.

 Elegant use of scale rad &gt; 0 in (13), btw - but 'vertice'? :)

Why vertices? Just happens to be that way in the workflow, I suppose edge selection works just the same.

--[[User:Pauljs75|Pauljs75]] 07:30, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#ccf&quot;&gt;Paul - thx for responding :)
Re the Isometric / Ortho issue - Although I queried the terms, I'd probably just put something like? 

&lt;&lt; This tutorial is for a freeform generalized car model. It can be easily adapted for making specific models by importing 3-view drawings and using these as background / reference images when modelling in Ortho view - adding extra edge loops / geometry as and where needed. &gt;&gt; ?

Re the centreline VM face:
It's probably me being thick but I still don't get this :)
After loopcutting the model in half and dumping one half, I'd do:

Select centre face.

Face | Flatten &gt; X (use rmb option if wanting to ensure flattened face was on centreline).

VM


I'm just wondering why you're doing:

Select centre face.

Convert to verts.

Vert | Flatten &gt; X (use rmb again etc if want to).

Deselect verts (or go F, -, to get face by selection jumping).

Select face.

VM

Are you saying you've had problems with Face | Flatten, so that's why you use Vert | Flatten?

&lt;&lt; vertice &gt;&gt; 
Sorry, nothing wrong with the workflow - just me going into 'vertice' rant mode, re its use, as opposed to 'vertex' - it's just another of those weirdo situations in the english language (vertex: singular, vertexes or vertices plural - no 'vertice' - that's all, no more, no less :) )

Re putting tuts here - yes, I probably will at some stage - but I can't see the point atm of just repeating existing (aards) stuff when much of it would benefit from re-writes etc because of changes to wings, since they were originally written. Better to have more upto date / relevant ones, I'd have thought?

pp

(btw - this discussion page doesn't seem to keep the same format as the 'as written' text - making workflow sequences more difficult to read :( )
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
Vertice? Vertex? Pot-a-to? Po-tat-o? *shrug* I never really noticed that before. Probably just too much lazyness in the American version of the English language. As for using vertex mode, it might be a holdover from an older wings version where face flatten didn't always ensure the vertices were indeed flush with the plane of reference. (I remember that they would be off by some wee fraction, but usually enough to cause problems later.) Goofy? Maybe. But I know it does work.

As for keeping posts clearer in discussion? Throw in a &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; tag between entrys. It seems to help separate who's posting what.

== Thanks ==

I wanted to say just thanks for this tutorial, it was very helpful. I created quite easly own car model. It is completly different than model presented in artcile, but most of the steps was similar and in the same order, so i think tutorial is writen perfectly. Only problem I have i sometimes to distinguish where is discription of what is on pictures. Above or under them? It is easy when you are reading article, but not when you switch beetwen wings3d and webbrowser.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arithmetic can be done with Lists in a variety of ways.  A single item in a list can be used in an arithmetic expression.  The operations that are normally used for single numbers can work on lists of numbers.  And there are a variety of functions that do list operations on lists.

=== TI arithmetic ===

After an arithmetic expression is computed, the result is displayed, and this result is available in the Ans variable.  For normal arithmetic, the result is a number.  If the expression is followed by a STO&gt; command, this number is stored in the stated variable, it is displayed, and it is also stored in Ans.

:5 + 7
::::12
:Ans + 1
::::13
:4 STO&gt; X
::::4
:2 + 8
::::10
:X + Ans
::::14

If the result of an expression is a list, the entire list is displayed and the entire list is available in the Ans variable.

:{2,5,3}
::::{2 5 3}
:Ans STO&gt; L1
::::{2 5 3}
:L1
::::{2 5 3}

=== Single Items in a List ===

To access or change a single item from a list, use the list variable followed by the item number in parentheses.

:{2,7,4,9} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 7 4 9}
:L1(3)
::::4
:8 STO&gt; L2(3)
::::8
:L2
::::{2 7 8 9}

One way to put another item on the end of the list is to store the value in the next item number.

:L2
::::{2 7 8 9}
:6 STO&gt; L2(5)
::::6
:L2
::::{2 7 8 9 6}
:L2(1) + L2(4) STO&gt; L2(6)
::::11
:L2
::::{2 7 8 9 6 11}

=== Arithmetic with a List and a number ===

The operations that use two real numbers can also be done on a number and a list.  The number operates on each of the items in the list.

Addition
:5 + {1,2,3}
::::{6 7 8}
Subtraction
:5 - {1,2,3} 
::::{4 3 2}
If L1 is {7,8,9}
:L1 - 5 
::::{2 3 4}
Multiplication
:{1,2,3} * 5 
::::{5 10 15}
Division
:{6,8,10} / 4 
::::{1.5 2 2.5}
:60 / {3,4,5} 
::::{20 15 10}
:{10,12,15} / 6 &gt;Frac 
::::{5/3 2 5/2}
Exponents
:L1 ^ 2
::::{49 64 81}
:3 ^ {2,3,5,6}
::::{9 27 243 729}
Roots ('''MATH 5''')
:3 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{}&lt;/math&gt; {27,64,1000}
::::{3 4 10}
:{3,4,6} &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{}&lt;/math&gt; 4096
::::{16 8 4}
Set the decimal places to 2 ('''MODE down right right right''')
:12 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{}&lt;/math&gt; {2,6,16}
::::{1.06 1.16 1.26}

=== Arithmetic with 2 Lists ===

All the arithmetic operations can be used with two lists.  When two or more lists are used in an expression, each list must have the same number of values, or an error will occur.  Each of the numbers in one list operates on the corresponding number in the other list.  The result is a list of the same length.

Addition
:{3,5,6} + {6,2,1}
::::{9 7 7}
Subtraction
:{3,5,6} - {6,2,1}
::::{-3 3 5}
Multiplication
:{3,5,6} * {6,2,1}
::::{18 10 6}
Division
:{3,5,6} / {6,2,1}
::::{.5 2.5 6}
Exponents
:{3,5,6} ^ {6,2,1}
::::{729 25 6}
Roots
:{3,5,6} &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{}&lt;/math&gt; {6,2,1}
::::{1.82 1.15 1.00}
Multiple operations
:{5,4}({2,5}+{3,9})
::::{25 56}

=== Arithmetic Functions with Lists ===

All of the functions that work on real numbers can also work on a list of numbers.  The result will be a list of the same length.  In these examples the decimal place has been set to 2.

Square root
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{}&lt;/math&gt;({2,3,4})
::::{1.41 1.73 2.00}
Logarithms
:log({2,3,4})
::::{.30 .48 .60}
:ln({2,3,4})
::::{.69 1.10 1.39}
Exponential
:e^({2,3,4})
::::{7.39 20.09 54.60}
Trigonometric (in radians)
:sin({2,3,4})
::::{.91 .14 -.76}
:tan &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;({2,3,4})
::::{1.11 1.25 1.33}
Miscellaneous
:abs({2,-2})
::::{2 2}
:round({&amp;pi;,e^(1),9/7},2)
::::{3.14 2.72 1.29}
The functions that normally need two numbers can work on two lists or a list and a number. The length of the result will match the length of the list used.
:min({4,3},{5,1})
::::{4 1}
:gcd({32,27},36)
::::{4 9}
:6 nCr {2,3,4}
::::{15 20 15}
Each list created as the result of an operation is available using the previous Ans.
:2{5,8} STO L1
::::{10 16}
::3{4,2}
::::{12 6}
::Ans+L1
::::{22 22}

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists.  These functions are found in the LIST menus.  The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key.  It is just below the DEL key.  Move over to the right one or two times to access the List menus.

There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists. These functions are found in the LIST menus. The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key. It is just below the DEL key. The functions that create new lists or change existing ones are found in the LIST OPS menu.

== Functions that change lists. ==

The functions in this section change existing lists.

=== dim( ===

The list dimension function ('''2nd LIST OPS 3''') has several uses.  It will tell you the length of a list (how many elements are in the list.)

:{1,3,5,7,9,11} STO&gt; L1
::::{1 3 5 7 9 11}
:dim(L1)
::::6
:dim({1,5})
::::2

The result of a dim( expression is a single number.

By storing a number in the dim( of a list you can create a new list with a certain number of elements or change the length of an existing list.

Creating a new list, fills it with elements that are all zero.

:3 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::3
:L1
::::{0 0 0}

A list can be made shorter thus deleting elements on the end, or longer thus adding elements with zero value onto the end.

:{2,4,6,8,10} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 4 6 8 10}
:3 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::3
:L1
::::{2 4 6}
:6 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::6
:L1
::::{2 4 6 0 0 0}

=== Sorting ===
The sorting functions '''SortA(''' and '''SortD(''' are the first functions in the List Ops menu: ('''2nd LIST OPS 1''') and  ('''2nd LIST OPS 2''').  These functions sort the elements of the specified list.  The first does an ascending sort (smallest item first); the second does a descending sort (largest item first).

These functions will not work on lists given with curly brackets.  The parameter in the parentheses must be a list name.  This is because the calculator operates on this list in memory as it is rearranged.  The previous order of items is no longer available.  Sorting does not create a new list.
  
:{3,6,2,4} STO&gt; L1
::::{3 6 2 4}
:SortA(L1)
::::Done
:L1
::::{2 3 4 6}

A decreasing sort works in a similar way.

:{6,8,2,9,4} STO&gt; L2
::::{6 8 2 9 4}
:SortD(L2)
::::Done
:L2
::::{9 8 6 4 2}

=== Fill( ===

This function ('''2nd LIST OPS 4''') changes the specified list variable by replacing each element with the same value.

This function will not work on a list given with curly brackets. The parameter in the parentheses must be a list name. The previous items are no longer available. Filling does not create a new list.

:{2,7,4,5} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 7 4 5}
:Fill(-3,L1)
::::Done
:L1
::::{-3 -3 -3 -3}

You can start with all zeros.

:5 STO&gt; dim(L3)
::::5
:L3
::::{0 0 0 0 0}
:Fill(4,L3)
::::Done
:L3
::::{4 4 4 4 4}

== Functions that create new lists ==

The functions in this section create a new list.  The new list is available in the Answer variable.  If the list will be used later it should be stored in a list variable.

=== seq( ===

The sequence function ('''2nd LIST OPS 5''') creates a list based on an expression and a range of values for the variable in the expression.

The first example makes a list based on 3x + 5, where x takes on the values from 1 through 6.

:seq(2X+3,X,1,6)
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

Notice that the first parameter is the expression.  The second parameter is the variable that assumes the range of values.  The third and fourth parameters are the beginning and ending values for the range.  The numbers in the range can be incremented by an amount other than 1, by using an optional fifth parameter.

There are several ways to create the same list as in the first example.  Since the expression is linear, the range can be used to produce it.

:seq(N,N,5,15,2)
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

The expression can contain any mathematical calculation, and the parameters for the range can be negative or decimals.

:seq(round(sin(&amp;theta;),2),&amp;theta;,-0.7,&amp;pi;/8,0.3)
::::{-.64 -.39 -.1 .2}

Since this function creates a new list, if you want do something else with it, you must either use '''Ans''' or '''STO&gt;''' it to a list variable.

We can do the first example again in several steps.

:seq(J,J,1,6)
::::{1 2 3 4 5 6}
:Ans * 2
::::{2 4 6 8 10 12}
:Ans + 3
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

Here's another example that stores the non-rounded list:

:seq(1/R,R,1,6) STO&gt; L1
::::(1 .5 .33333333...
:round(L1,2)
::::{1 .5 .33 .25 .2 .17}

=== cumSum( ===

The cumulative sum function ('''2nd LIST OPS 6''') adds up the items in the list and creates a new list with the partial sums.  The first item in the new list is the same as the first item in the original list.  The second item in the new list is the sum of the first two items in the original list.  The third item in the new list is the sum of the first three items in the original list.  And so on.  The last item in the new list is the sum of the entire original list.

:cumSum({1,2,3,4,5,6})
::::{1 3 6 10 15 21}
:cumSum(Ans) STO&gt; L1
::::{1 4 10 20 35 56}

Once again, if the new list is to be used rather than just observed, it must be stored, or used immediately from the Ans variable.

=== &amp;Delta;List( ===

The list difference function ('''2nd LIST OPS 7''') subtracts adjacent list items and forms a list of the differences.  This new list will be one item shorter than the original.

:L1
::::{1 4 10 20 35 56}
:&amp;Delta;List(L1)
::::{3 6 10 15 21}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{3 4 5 6}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{1 1 1}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{0 0}

Using this function on a list with only one element will result in an error.

=== augment( ===

The list connecting function ('''2nd LIST OPS 9''') has two list parameters.  The result is a list with the two lists connected together.

:{1,2 3} STO&gt; L1
::::{1 2 3}
:{6,7,8,9} STO&gt; L2
::::{6 7 8 9}
:augment(L1,L2)
::::{1 2 3 6 7 8 9)
:augment(L2,L1)
::::{6 7 8 9 1 2 3}
:augment({10,14,8},L1)
::::{10 14 8 1 2 3}
:augment(Ans,{5,1,7}) STO&gt; L3
::::{10 14 8 1 2 3 5 1 7}

The new list must be stored if it is to be used later.

:SortA(L3)
::::Done
:L3
::::{1 1 2 3 5 7 8 10 14}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Green&quot; Roofs==
&quot;Green roofs&quot; refers to growing plants on the top of roofs of buildings. There are several different methods for implementing green roofs. Green roofs have been wide spread in Europe and especially in Germany. Now the concept of green roofs is starting to spread in the USA. Egypt has started a green roofs initiative as well but uses a different method for implementing green roofs.

===Benefits===
; Space Efficiency
: Except from keeping rain and sun off a building's occupants, roof space is essentially wasted.  Green roofing makes use of this wasted space.
; Air purification
: Plants absorb pollution from the air.  Growing plants on the roof of a building contributes to improved air quality in the surrounding city.  Obviously, green roofing will have a larger effect on air quality if it is employed in a widespread manner.
; Aesthetic appeal
: Even urban humans generally retain an aesthetic appreciation for being surrounded by plants.  Green roofs can add a serene communal space to a building.
; Food supply
: Green roofing can be used as a source of vegetables and other edible plants.

There are several schools of thought on how to train dogs, ranging from what are often termed &quot;Traditional&quot; methods, based largely on avoidance or escape, to &quot;Positive-Only&quot; methods, such as Clicker Training. All of these methods when properly applied can be used to train most dogs to be tractable companions.  

This project is aimed at '''novice''' and '''intermediately''' experienced dog owners. This book is about the basic training all dogs will need to have, for example to pass a Canine Good Citizen (CGC) or other similar certification. The training methods recommended in this book should be safe enough that a novice dog owner won't be in danger of harming a dog by following the instructions (or vice versa).

Additional topics in dog training include

* [[Dog Care/Training/Gun Training|Gun training]]
* General dog care
* Electrical, prong, choke collars, gentle leaders
* [[Dog Care/Training/Clicker training|Clicker training]]

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so. I'm also not sure what the best way to organize the chapters is yet. Please feel free to rearrange the sections if it makes more sense to you.

== What is dog training? ==
The key to successful dog training is communication. Dogs don't speak our language so we have to use a language they do understand.

== Set your dog up to succeed... or to fail?==

There are three stages to dog training. Motivational, correction and distraction (or 'proofing'). In the motivational stage, you will set your dog up to succeed, giving it short training sessions and big rewards in a quiet environment and with plenty of encouragement. For example, Sit. You will lure your dog, click, treat, big smile, excitement and if your dog slips, you shrug it off and do it all over again. 

Come the correction stage. Positive Reinforcement trainers view not getting the reward as a correction. They also teach a &quot;no reward marker&quot;, a word or sound such as &quot;oops&quot; or &quot;uh uh&quot; to signal the dog that no reward is coming and pick a new behavior. You're sure your dog knows Sit already. It does it even before the lure comes and you're very pleased. Now you try a 2 second stay without a lure. Your dog does it. You're pretty excited and the dog can feel it too as you dump a big reward on it. Next is a 5 second stay. Your dog slips. You give your no reward marker and help the dog figure out what is expected.  Your dog learns to choose, correctly  = reward, wrongly = correction, or no reward. The dog might get another correction but then it learns, a lightbulb goes up in its head, it has chosen the right path and gets the reward it has been waiting for all along. Using common sense, it is better if you are told what's wrong rather th
an be given little hints that aren't straight-forward.

Training should be done in increments. The biggest mistake novice trainers make is to move too fast. The dog has the mental capacity of the average 2 year old human child. They are sponges, but can only absorb so much at a sitting. Distractions should also be increased slowly. At first, you teach your dog a command, such as &quot;Sit&quot;, in its own house. As the dog masters this, you start moving the dog to places with more distractions, the back yard, the front yard, the sidewalk in front of the house, etc. 

There are certain common sense rules: when teaching stays, &quot;with time comes distance&quot;. Teach your dog to stay while you are close to your dog and can keep him/her in the stay position, before you disappear around the corner. Once your dog learns to stay with you there for 5 minutes, putting that leash down and walking away is a piece of cake.

Also, never call your dog to you and punish him/her. If your dog escapes, after you have panicked, chased him around, screamed yourself senseless, etc. When your dog is finally back to you, YOU CANNOT PUNISH HER. She is incapable of understanding she is being punished for running away. She only knows when she got back to you, bad things happened to her and next time, she won't come back at all.

This indicates a huge problem with your relationship with your dog, and says your dog is not interested in being with you. Perhaps the dog hasn't been trained, or has fear issues, but you need to go back to square one and train your dog.



== Food Lures ==

Luring with food is a very natural way to show the dog what you'd like it to do. Dogs generally will follow your hand with food. This can be used to teach many commands such as &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. If you've ever wanted to create a cool treat for your doggie, with style AND flavor then try &quot;Doggie Popsicles&quot;
&lt;!--This content merged from [[Transwiki:Doggie popsicles]] --&gt;

== Discouraging Bad Behavior ==

There are many things dogs do that humans find unacceptable: Jumping up, mouthing, running away, urinating in the house, chewing, etc. The human has the big brain and should be able to manage the dog's environment so the dog doesn't get a chance to practice objectionable behavior. Don't leave shoes where the puppy can find them, teach the dog to &quot;sit&quot; when greeting people, yell &quot;OUCH!!!&quot; loudly when the puppy puts his teeth on you, go out with the puppy to be sure he potties outside and reward him instantly when he potties appropriately. 

Teach your dog to do something that make the objectionable behavior impossible: teaching your dog to touch the palm of your hand with its nose, makes it impossible for the dog to mouth your hand at the same time. So instead of constantly correcting bad behavior, or just yelling &quot;NO!&quot; to your dog, you will learn to be proactive and not give it a chance to misbehave. Everyone is happier that way.

Redirect your dog when the behavior is inappropriate. If your dog is loose at the dog park, for example, and is starting to be rude to other dogs, call your dog and start walking briskly away. Your dog should want to be with you and will come.

=== Ignoring Bad Behavior ===

Sometimes it is best to ignore the bad behavior. Many times people inadvertently reinforce the bad behavior by giving the dog attention. For example, letting a dog inside while it is outside barking teaches the dog to bark to get inside. You are better off to wait until the dog has stopped barking for several minutes before letting it inside. 



=== Distracting ===

Distracting the dog can be a useful tool to reduce the frequency of an undesirable behavior. A small rattle made from a plastic soda bottle, or a can with pennies placed inside can be shaken to distract the dog from repeating the behavior. Most dogs however only require your voice. A well timed 'Hey, quit it!' is very effective. Then ask the dog to do something that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. Instead of jumping up to Counter surf, call the dog to you and play some tug. 

Be very careful using sound distractions, many dogs are sound sensitive and the shaking of the penny can may make your dog skittish. If your dog is sound sensitive, you can create a situation when your dog will learn to mistrust you.



Using Equipment to get control of your dog while you are training.

If you have a dog that pulls or lunges at other dogs barking, it is imperative that you not give your dog the opportunity to practice that behavior. 

''''''Pulling''''''

If your dog just pulls, using something like the Sense-ation or other No pull harness. In this style of harness, the leash is connected in front of the dog's chest, so when the dog pulls, it inhibits should action and stops the pulling. 

If your dog pulls and bark/lunges at other dogs, you need a head halter. There are several types of head halters available and all fit a bit differently from each other. Some of the most popular brands are the Gentle Leader, the Halti, the Comfort Trainer, the Snoot Loop. The basic idea is like the halters used on horses. A person can control a beast weighing over a ton by controlling the head. The same is true for dogs. The strap over the nose is the control. It hits a pressure point that both controls and helps calm the dog. 

Another piece of equipment that can help with control is a prong, or pinch collar. Contrary to some myths, this is not designed to dig into the dog's neck or puncture the dog. If there is blood, the human is not only using the equipment wrong, but is guilty of abusing the dog. The prong should only be used as a last resort, after other alternatives have been exhausted. It can be an effective tool for dedicated pullers, but it is not recommended for dogs that lunge/bark. The tightening of the prongs on the dog's neck as it is looking at the dog it is lungeing at, can increase aggression.

=== Boobie-traps ===

Boobie-traps are items that will surprise a dog by making a loud noise when tripped or knocked over. They have a big advantage in that you don't have to be right there in order to correct the dog. This prevents the dog from associating you with the correction and allow for consistent correction even when you are out of the dogs sight.  The effectiveness of these traps depends on the dog; some dogs are very calm and won't care that something fell, while others will learn on the first try and never trip the trap again. As always, use good judgment when formulating a trap.  Do not cause harm to the dog, or cause an overconfident dog to get too scared.

Again, this can cause a lot of sound sensitivity. Management is the first defense. Pick up the shoes, keep food of off the counters, put the trash under the sink, etc.

'''Boobie-traps for use while training dogs can be made from various items:'''

Some traps can easily be produced from items found around the house.  An object balanced on the edge of a counter may fall and frighten the dog when the dog sniffs at it.  This is useful to deter a dog from patrolling the counter for food.
*A 12 oz. soda can with several coins inside will make a lot of noise when it falls. 
{{TODO|todonote=add picture of can on windowsill}}
*A small tuna can with water will splash the dog when it is tipped. (Of course, this is only useful if getting some water on the floor is acceptable.)

Some alarm systems to deter a dog from unwanted behavior can be purchased at your local pet store.
*Motion alarms
*trash can lid alarms
{{TODO|todonote=add pictures of alarms}}

== Walking on a Leash ==
Walking a dog gives it exercise to help it remain healthy.  It is also an easy way for the person walking the dog to get a little exercise.  A dog will enjoy being walked because it will be able to explore and see new things.  A dog being walked can often be distracted by things like cars, strange noises, objects, plants, other people, or other dogs, so the person walking the dog will want to keep a good hold on the leash.  Walking on a leash requires a collar and a leash, which may be purchased at a pet store.

It is important to teach a dog &quot;loose leash walking&quot;.  This involves teaching the dog not to pull and to walk with you regardless of distractions.  Treats/clicker can be helpful in this task. 

On of the most effective techniques is 'be a tree'. Dogs pull because they want to go somewhere. If you hold the leash tightly against your body, plant your feet and refuse to move forward when the dog pulls, the dog isn't getting what it wants. At some point, the dog will turn to look at you. When the dog looks back, the leash will get slack, you immediately reward the dog by moving in the direction the dog originally wanted to go. If the dog pulls again, stop moving until the dog looks at you.

This is effective because the dog learns that by not pulling, he gets what he wants. The dog is also learning to pay attention to where you are in relation to the end of the leash. This can build your bond and relationship. Let's work together instead of away from each other.

Another technique is reversing direction immediately when the dog begins to pull. This technique is not effective on a determined dog and will often result in the owner being rather dizzy. It works best on young pups as it is virtually painless. 

People often use 'Prong collars' or other devices such as 'Haltis' to discourage and teach the dog how to walk nicely. Never ever use a traditional halter as it only encourages the dog to pull more (think sled dog). However, the Sense-ation, Sense-ible and Easy Walk harnesses are designed to lessen pulling and work very well.

== House Training ==

== Crating ==
Crating is the practice of keeping a puppy or dog in a kennel when you are not at home and at night.  This provides a safe place for the dog and keeps them from being destructive when unsupervised.  This is an excellent way to housebreak a new dog.

==Basic Commands==
Here are a few commands that almost every dog should respond to:
*'''Come''': This command, also referred to as the '''recall''', is crucial.  If the dog won't come when called, it is not an obedient dog.  One method for training begins by allowing the dog to wander out on a long leash or line, then calling it by name and the command '''Come'''.  This method might require a quick, light tug on the leash to get the dog moving when first teaching this command. Like all commands, it is successful only if the dog is rewarded when it completes the command and only if the practice is repeated&amp;mdash;under different circumstances and distances and gradually removing the controls; until the dog performs flawlessly.  
Another good way to train them without reinforcement is to praise them while afar. They will hear this and come to you.  Then, grant them more &quot;good dog!&quot; and such.  
*'''Sit''': This command is also crucial.  Sitting dogs are under the handler's direct control.  It is common to precede other commands, such as the '''Stay''' command, with a sit command.  One method for training uses a treat held in front of the dog's nose and passed back over its head, forcing the dog to sit.  '''Sit''' and '''Stay''' are used in conjunction with many other commands.  
*'''Stay''': This command gives peace of mind.  An owner can park her dog while doing something else.  One method of training involves placing the dog in a sit or a down position, then telling it to stay while stepping away from the dog.  If the dog stays, the handler rewards it while it is still in the position.  Indoors, use this command to park your dog under a favorite table or bench.   
*'''Lie down''' or '''down''': this command allows even greater control than sitting.  One training method uses a treat drawn forward and down across the dog's face, forcing it to lie down to get at it.  Since even people without dogs are familiar with this command and use it when dogs are bothering them, the better the dog is at it, the better it can get along with strangers and visitors. But don't get discouraged if the dog refuses or is reluctant to drop into position. The Down is a submissive position and often a dominant dog will refuse to give in.  
*'''Go to bed''' or '''get in''': Directs the dog  to go to its bed or its crate and to remain there until released. The dog has freedom of movement in that location to stand up, turn around, or lie down, unlike when placed in a '''Stay'''.  Useful to keep a dog out from underfoot and safe in a busy or complicated situation. Not a necessary command as the dog is taught to 'stay' already while in Down or Sit. Useful for Stand stays though.
*'''Drop''' or '''drop it''': Dogs pick up all sorts of things, some of which they shouldn't have.  A dog that drops anything on command, no matter how attractive (which to a dog can be rotten and smelly), is a dog under control that the owner can prevent from eating dangerous items or from destroying valued personal property.
*'''Leave it''': An adjunct to '''Drop''', directing the dog to not touch an item.  Also useful before the dog has picked anything up.  One method of training involves leaving a treat on the ground and walking the dog past it without allowing the dog to pick it up.  '''Leave it''' is also used in conjunction with '''Take it'''.    
*'''Take it''': The dog leaves a desired object, such as a toy or treat, untouched until given this command.  This can protect an owner's, visitor's, or child's fingers. 
*'''Heel''', '''Close''', '''By me''': The dog walks with its head directly next to the handler's leg and does not deviate until released.  One method of training accompanies the command with a slap to the thigh indicating where the handler wants the dog's head. 
*'''Okay''', '''Free''', '''Break''', or '''Release''':  Releases the dog from '''Stay''', '''Heel''', '''Sit''', and so forth.  Also a general release to play. A clicker acts as a release. 

The specific command word is not important, although the preceding list covers some of the more common words. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally recommended;  that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary.  In fact, dogs can learn commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand gestures, and so forth.

== Less Common Commands ==

While dogs can be trained far beyond these rudiments, a dog that obeys these commands will be a pleasure to keep and take out.  Off-leash obedience is the hallmark of a well-trained dog.

There are a few commands that many domestic dogs learn, but that are not part of the basic repertoire.
*'''Stop''' – a dog that will simply stop whatever it is doing and lie down on command no matter how far it is from its keeper is a dog that can be taken anywhere.  Some handlers use the German word '''''Platz''''' (related to &quot;place&quot;, i.e. stay in position) for this action.  (Useful if your dog is in danger, or headed for some trouble. I.e., your dog is about to get run over by a car. He/she hears &quot;Stop!&quot; and drops and you can be sure it will not be hit. Much faster response than a &quot;Come&quot; command.)
*'''Back up''' – keepers of large dogs or dogs with a reputation for aggressiveness can make strangers more comfortable by teaching the dog to back up on command. (Also useful if you are carrying a large box or something and the dog's in your way.)
*'''Growl''' – the inverse of backing up.  Some owners teach non-aggressive dogs to growl on a subtle command – not the word ''growl'', usually a small hand gesture – as a way of letting strangers know that you and your dog value being left alone.  
*'''Steady''' – keep near by.  The dog can walk free, but not dash off.  Train to this command with a long leash, calling out '''Steady''' when the leash is taut.  Continue off leash.
*'''Stand''' – dog stands still.  Train from lying-down position by lifting under belly while repeating command.  Useful for grooming.  Many dogs are groomed frequently and need to stand quietly during the process.
*'''Speak''' – for amusement or showing off, a dog may be trained to bark on command.
*'''Chase Recall''' – 
*'''Paw, or Give Paw''' – Pretty much for showing off, a dog may be trained to give you a &quot;handshake&quot;. (Though it's also very useful if the dog needs to get their nails clipped or they have an injury.)
*'''Shake''' – Very useful after baths, or walks in snow or rain.
*'''Roll Over''' –
*'''Jump''' –
*'''Calm''' – tells the dog to stop growling and/or playing roughly.  Similar to '''Back Up'''.

== Games ==

Games can be fun for both the dog and the owner.

Here are some games that can be played with a dog:

*'''Fetch''' – This is a game where the owner throws out an object and the dog retrieves it and gives it back to the owner.  It can be played with a small ball like a tennis ball, a frisbee, a stick, or any small light object that is easy to throw and easy for the dog to pick up and carry. Large balls can also be used.

*'''Hide and Seek''' – You hide and your dog seeks. It is more difficult but worth attempting to make your dog hide while you seek.

*'''Tug-of-War''' – It should first be noted, that some (perhaps most) experts state that this game can teach or instil aggressive behavior in your dog.  However, most dogs love playing 'Tug-of-War,' and if vigorously participated in by the owner, will allow the dog, especially a younger dog, to use a lot of its extra energy. One rule of the thumb is that you decide when the game ends and you always win. Never let your dog win even if it means pinching your dog's lips against it's teeth to get it to let go. A 'drop it' command is very useful for this.

== Problem Behavior ==

====Chewing====
One of the causes of destructive chewing behavior in younger dogs, as with children, is 'teething.'  A good suggestion, that will allow your dog to relieve it's discomfort, without destroying your home, uses only a used, but clean hand, dish, or other small towel.  

Soak the towel in clean drinking water.  Wring out the excess, until the towel no longer drips.  Tie the towel in a knot, and place in the freezer (you may want to place the towel in a freezer bag to protect other items).  Once frozen it can be given to the dog as a chew toy.

A more expensive but better way is to purchase toys for your dog. The most popular amongst chewers is the Kong toy. Stuffable and challenging to even the most seasoned of veterans. Squeaky toys are noisy but fun to the dog as it mimics an animal that the dog has attacked. Dogs are often observed 'pouncing' on these. 

====Jumping up====

First you have to decide if you want to allow your dog to jump up on people or not.  Then you need to be consistent in enforcing the rules.  Being consistent is the important thing to help your dog learn what is acceptable behavior.  

Even if you decide it's okay, you may encounter other people who don't like it at all.  NOT jumping on people is generally considered good doggie manners.  Once you've made the decision that it will not be allowed you have to train your dog to understand what the rules are.  

To teach a dog not to jump up on you, simply turn your back on the dog when he jumps up.  The dog wants your attention.  When you turn away from him, you give him the message that jumping up on you will not earn your attention.  After a short time (a few seconds) of having you back to the dog, turn back to him and give him another chance to keep his feet on the ground.  If he does stay down, praise or reward him for it.  He may well try to jump up again then, because he hasn't yet learned what is getting him the praise and what is making you go away.  But the dog will figure it out.  Most dogs catch on quickly, after just a few times of ignoring him.  But remember, it will take a while for your dog to really learn what is expected.  So, don't be surprised if the next time he greets you he jumps up.  Just be consistent in letting him know it's not acceptable.  Keep the emotion out of it.  You don't need to scold the dog or correct him.  The fact that he is not getting the desired result from jumping on you will be self correcting to him.  

You should also ask your visitors not to encourage jumping up on people.  You can explain to them that they should turn their back on your dog if he attempts to jump up on them. A good alternative to permitting a dog to jump up on people is to teach him to sit when greeting people.  Only praise and reward your dog when he is sitting.  Turn away if he jumps up, as described above.  He will learn to offer sitting to get the attention he seeks.

====Barking====

====Scratching on doors====

====Begging====
Don't reward your dog for begging. Dogs learn to beg quickly if you drop food even just a few times and even if you dropped the food on accident. Teach it to lay down out of the way while you are eating or cooking. Crating or a stuffed Kong is also recommended. If you can't prevent the dog from getting the food (this is usually the case when small children have the food) it is best to remove the dog from the room while eating. A well timed correction is also another way to deter Begging forever. 

====Chasing Other Small Animals====
Everyone has heard stories about the dog who ate the gerbil, hamster, or even human baby. Try not to let this happen. Correct the dog (via training collar or voice) for attempting to even sniff the animal. It will soon learn to ignore it.

====Aggression====

====Submissiveness====

====Stealing Food====

Once the dog learns it can steal food, it's hard to break it out of the habit. A good way is also corrections, teaching the Leave It and anticipating the dog's action and reacting (verbal correction, taking the food away and turning the dog away, etc.).

====Getting in the Trash====

There are two situations to consider

1) dog gets into trash when you are present (supervising)

It will be helpful to teach your dog a &quot;Leave It&quot; command.  But start by teaching the command in a more controlled situation with a single piece of food. 

2) dog gets into trash when you are NOT there to supervise

Dogs are dogs, they get into trash if it's left out for them when they are unsupervised.  
Put the trash somewhere where your dog cannot get to it.  Or get a trash can that your dog cannot get open.

====Digging====

Best way to avoid this is to occupy the dog's time. Training, toys and walks are excellent ways.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mozilla. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mozilla~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Merit Badge Requirements ==
'''1) Do THREE of the following:
'''A) Name three types of modern freight trains.  Explain why unit trains are more efficient than mixed fright trains.

Mixed freight trains- contain freight coming from many different origins.  
Unit trains - contain freight all originating from one place,  for instance a refinery, or a chemical plant.  These are more efficient because you don't require all of the time in a rail yard  connecting and disconnecting to attach the required freight.
Intermodal trains- contain flat cars that hold various containers (18 wheeler containers). These are useful in the respect that their freight can be transferred from ship to rail to roads easily.

'''B) Name a Class 1 or regional railroad.  Explain what major cities it serves, the locations of major terminals, service facilities, and crew change points, and the major commodities it carries.

''Class I Railroad: There are four primary Class I Railroads in the United States: '''Union Pacific''', '''BNSF''', '''Norfolk &amp; Southern''', and '''CSX'''. The Union Pacific and BNSF primarily operate west of Chicago and the Mississippi River, while the Norfolk Southern and CSX mainly operate east of Chicago and the Mississippi.

'''BNSF Railway''' - The BNSF Railway (AAR reporting mark BNSF), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the largest railroad networks in North America (only one competitor, the Union Pacific Railroad, is comparable in size).

The BNSF Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, the holding company formed by the September 22, 1995 merger of Burlington Northern, Incorporated and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. According to corporate press releases, the BNSF Railway is among the top transporters of intermodal traffic in North America, and moves more grain than any other American railroad. It also hauls enough coal to generate roughly 10% of the electricity produced in the United States.

Largest Intermodal Facilities (2004 Volume):

Lifts Hobart Yard (LosAngeles, California) 1,318,000 Lifts

Corwith Yard (Chicago, Illinois) 744,000 Lifts

Willow Springs (Illinois) 724,000 Lifts

Alliance (Fort Worth, Texas)561,000

SanBernardino(California)557,000

Cicero(Illinois)502,000

Argentine(KansasCity,Kansas)305,000

LogisticsParkChicago(Illinois)275,000


The '''Union Pacific''' is headquartered in Omaha, NE, and is the largest railroad in North America following a series of mergers between the mid 1980's and 1990's: Chicago North Western ('''CNW'''), Denver Rio Grande &amp; Western (DRGW), Southern Pacific (SP), and Missouri Pacific (MP). It serves most states west of the Mississippi River, as well as Illinois and Wisconsin.

'''CSX''' Transportation is headquartered in Jacksonville, FL, and is the largest railroad east of the Mississippi, serving most states east of the Mississippi River and part of Canada. CSX came about as the result of a 1980 merger between the Seaboard Coast Lines and the Chessie System. SCL was formed as the result of several mergers between the Atlantic Coast Line, Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Likewise, the Chessie System was a combination of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, and the Western Maryland Railway.

'''Norfolk Southern''' is headquartered in Norfolk, VA, and came about from the 1982 merger of the Norfolk and Western Railroad and the Southern Railroad. It serves most states east of the Mississippi River and part of Canada.

Kansas City Southern is headquartered in Kansas City, MO.
''

'''C) Using models or pictures, identify 10 types of railroad freight or passenger cars. Explain the purpose of each type of car.

'''D) Explain how a modern diesel or electric locomotive develops power.  Explain the terms dynamic braking and radial steering trucks.


'''2) Do the following:

'''A) Explain the purpose and formation of Amtrak.  Explain, by the use of a timetable, a plan for making a trip by rail between two cities at least 500 miles apart.  List the times of departure and arrival at your destination, the train number, and the type of service you want.

'''B) List and explain the various forms of public/mass transit using rail as the fixed guide path.


'''3) Do ONE of the following:

'''A) Name four departments of a railroad company.  Describe what each department does.

'''B) Tell about the opportunities in railroading that interest you most and why.

'''C) Name four rail support industries.  Describe the function of each one.

'''D) With your parents and counselors approval, interview someone employed in the rail industry.  Learn what that person does and how this person became interested in railroading.  Find out what type of schooling and training are required for this position.


'''4) Explain the purpose of Operation Lifesaver and its mission.


'''5) Do THREE of the following:

'''A) List five safety precautions that help make trains safer for workers and passengers.

'''B) Explain to your merit badge counselor why railroad rights-of-way are important for safety.

'''C) List 10 safety tips to remember when you are near a railroad track (either on the ground or on a station platform) or aboard a train.

'''D) Tell your counselor about the guidelines for conduct that should be followed when you are near or on railroad property.  Explain the dangers of trespassing on railroad property.

'''E) Tell what an automobile driver can do to safely operate a car at grade crossings, and list three things an automobile driver should never do at a grade crossing.

'''F) Tell how to report a malfunction of grade crossing warning devices.

'''G) List safety precautions a pedestrian should follow at a public crossing.


'''6) Explain the appearance and meaning of the following warning signs and devices: advance warning sign, pavement marking, crossbucks, flashing red lights, crossing gates.

Metallic bonds occur among metal atoms.  Whereas ionic bonds join metals to non-metals, ''metallic bonding joins a bulk of metal atoms''.  A sheet of aluminum foil and a copper wire are both places where you can see metallic bonding in action.

[[Image:Electrona in crystallo fluentia.svg|thumb|The &quot;sea of electrons&quot; is free to flow about the crystal of positive metal ions.]]
When metallic bonds form, the s and p electrons '''delocalize'''.  Instead of orbiting their atoms, they form a &quot;sea of electrons&quot; surrounding the positive metal ions.  The electrons are free to move throughout the resulting network.  The delocalized nature of the electrons explains a number of unique characteristics of metals:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
| ''Metals are good conductors of electricity''
| The sea of electrons is free to flow, allowing electrical currents.
|-
| ''Metals are ductile (able to draw into wires)&lt;br&gt;and malleable (able to be hammered into thin sheets)''
| As the metal is deformed, local bonds are broken but quickly reformed in a new position.
|-
| ''Metals are gray and shiny''
| Photons (particles of light) cannot penetrate the metal, so they bounce off the sea of electrons.
|-
| ''Gold is yellow and copper is reddish-brown''
| There is actually an upper limit to the frequency that is reflected.  It is too high to be visible in most metals, but not gold and copper.
|-
| ''Metals have very high melting and boiling points''
| Metallic bonding is very strong, so the atoms are reluctant to break apart into a liquid or gas.
|}

Metallic bonds can occur between different elements.  A mixture of two or more metals is called an '''alloy'''.  Depending on the size of the atoms being mixed, there are two different kinds of alloys that can form:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:AlloySubstitutional.png|Substitutional alloy
Image:AlloyInterstitial.png|Interstitial alloy

 |description=These books deal with the '''[[w:C (programming language)|C programming language]]''': one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages. C is widely used on many different software platforms, and there are few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. It has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]], which originally began as an extension to C.

Albedo	

; Ambient color
: The overall color of an object. When rendering scene ambiance is multiplied by face ambiance.

Ambient light

; Attenuation
: The intensity of a light through the scene as it diminishes with distance from the source.

; Backface
: The interior side of a face on a solid object.

; Bezier 
: A mathematically defined curve formed by the placement of control points.

Bevel

Bevel smoothing

; Binaries
: Machine readable files created by compiling source code.

; Body
: A 3D object composed of vertices, edges, and faces.

; Bounding box 
: Generally, the minimum volume that can contain a selection. However, a single vertex bounding box is 0 and a single edge bounding box is two dimensional.

; Box modeling 
: A commmon term for the type of polygon modelling used in Wings3D.

; Central edge loop
: A set of edges that completely encircles a model on one of the primary axes, usually the Z axis, for example as the center line of a head.

; Chart packing
: This is the last step that happens before the AutoUV window appears, i.e. each 2d chart is placed somewhere on texture.

; Control Cage
: The model in shaded wireframe mode prior to any smoothing operation.

Crease

; Crease angle
: The angle between two faces that share an edge.

Diffusion

; Diffuse color
: The overall color of a surface absent any highlights, like a matte surface.

; Display Mode
: The way a model appears on the screen, solid shaded, smooth shaded, or wireframe.

; Dolly
: Moving the camera in and out towards or away from the model; i.e. zooming.

; Edge
: The boundary between two faces having exactly two vertices; the line joining two vertices together.

; Edge Loop
: A set of edges that connect at vertices with 4 way intersections.

; Edge Rings
: The lateral edges that run between two adjacent edge loops.

; Element
: A graphic element in the scene that can be selected; a vertex, edge, face, body, or a light are all elements of a scene.

; Emission
: A color setting that affect the overall self illumination of the object.

; Face
: An element of an object consisting of a set of interconnected edges.

; Facet subdivision
: Breaking down a component of two dimensions (i.e. a face) into more and more faceted surfaces (faces) without doing any smoothing.

; GNU GPL
: GNU General Public License, one of the most popular OpenSource licensing agreements. GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix.

; Ground plane
: Usually an imaginary plane used as the horizontal reference plane.

; GUI
: Graphic User Interface.

; Linear
: A light setting, which causes the light to fall off in a linear manner.

Lumen

Luminance

Luminosity

; Material
: The underlying surface properties of an object or faces on an object. A material is different than a color or a texture. Color is but one component of a material and can be applied to vertices as well, and textures can be applied over a material.

Matte

Matte surface

; Mesh
: A 3D object composed of interconnected faces, usually composed of triangles, quads and n-gons.

; Metaform Subdivision
: A subdivision method which shows the smoothed model with the unsmoothed cage floating about it.

; N-gon
: A face with more than 4 sides.

; Normal
: A vector that extends outward perpendicular to a graphic element.

NURBS

; NURBS curve
: Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines; a mathematically defined curve of infinite resolution.

; Object
: A self contained solid body composed of vertices, edges, and faces also known as a body.

; Opacity
: The level of transparency for a face as set in the Material Editor.

Orbit

; Organic model
: A model of non-manufactured item, such as living (organic) things.

Orthogonal

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Shadz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Shadz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome to Wikibooks==

I'm sorry that your first experience on trying to write on Wikibooks happened with an almost immediate deletion of what you wrote.  You should have had at least a warning first, and a lot more patience toward what you wrote.

Still, I would strongly recommend that you review [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for more information about our project here.  Your Wikibook, [[The Ultimate Chance]], does seem like a get rick quick scheme and something that we generally try to keep off of Wikibooks in general.  Most business books in general seem to give us some sort of difficulty as the presentation of the idea is often difficult to seperate from a specific set of services.

I tend to be a champion of lost causes, but I want to encourage you to continue to contribute here on Wikibooks.  We need people from as wide of a variety of backgrounds as we can, and I hope that you can find a place to help improve this project as a whole.  There will be some criticisms of what you write here, and I promise that if you take the critcisms to heart as suggestions for improvement, you will become a much better writer and be able to present your idea in a much more clear fashion that will make your ideas stand on their own.  You may also be able to find other people who are interested in the same things that you are interested in.

If there is anything I can do to help you out, please drop me a note on my user talk page:  [[User talk:Robert Horning]]  That will get my attention faster than doing just about anything else.  Dropping an e-mail my way through [[Special:Emailuser/Robert_Horning]] will also bring something to my attention, if you want to say something to me in private.  I am one of the administrators here on Wikibooks, and have been here long enough that many of the participants will at least listen carefully to suggestions I make here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== Copyright problem with [[:Image:Dev 2.JPG]] ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Dev 2.JPG]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Dev 2.JPG]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]].

: Yes, you have to insert copyright tag even if a file is 'just an image'. Insert &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|GFDL-self}}&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|PD-self}}&lt;/tt&gt; to all of your images and the problem will be solved. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[The Ultimate Chance]] ==

I wanted to let you know that I've nominated '''The Ultimate Chance''' as a [[WB:VfD|Vote for Deletion]] candidate.  What this means is that I believe that there are problems with the content in this Wikibook which are against project policy due to the nature of this content.  This should not be seen as something explicitly being against you as an individual, nor are we trying to say that your ideas that have been presented here are wrong.

Keep in mind that we are trying to create a collection of textbooks that can be used in academic settings.  There are a number of policies [[WB:WIW|that can be found here]] which have been developed over time to try and focus content here, and to keep this website from becoming a more general web content hosting service.

Please, if you want to defend keeping this content on Wikibooks, voice your opinions and state the reason why you think this content ought to remain on Wikibooks.  Or perhaps use this as an opportunity to learn about how to turn this page into something that could be much more useful and easier to read.  And to understand why we do what it is that we do here on this website.

If for some reason you come back to Wikibooks and find out that this book has been deleted before you had a chance to voice objections, you are also free to make a request on [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] requesting that this content be restored.  Decisions about removing content from Wikibooks has been reversed in the past, and for awhile content which is deleted can be restored... even though it may not be visible from the project by a general Wikibooks user.

Please, if you can, try to keep contributing your ideas to Wikibooks.  We are glad that you are here, and are grateful for those contributions you have already made to this project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:59, 22 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Forking Wikipedia ==

Comment from [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: [[Overcoming Procrastination]] started out as a copy of [[Wikipedia:Procrastination]]. Wikipedia was not credited, so it was an obvious violation of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. Also, as a fork of a Wikipedia article, it was against [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]. Thus, I and other users voted to delete it.

However, Wikipedia decided to remove much of the content from its Procrastination article. Thus, I now recopy the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procrastination&amp;oldid=42842587 last Wikipedia version] before removal from Wikipedia. ''This means that I discarded the old version at Wikibooks instead of doing a merge.'' (There was not anything substantial to merge.) As [[Overcoming Procrastination]] is now an expansion of the Wikipedia article, the reason for its deletion is obsolete, so I removed the {{tl|vfd}} tag.

In the coming days, I hope to split this book into subpages, add Authors and History pages (to replace the temporary History section at the top of the book now), provide a PDF version, and remove remnants of Wikipedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

Found this in the wikipedia article.  Doesn't fit there, but it might fit there.  Cheers.--[[User:P-Chan|P-Chan]] 17:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

* Realizing that brain is a complex system and its architecture is a factor contributing to difficulty associated with overcoming procrastination. Concepts like &quot;it's because you are lazy, there's nothing more to it&quot; indicate misunderstanding of the underlying issue, still they are common in population (and prevent success in dealing with procrastination).
* Identifying procrastination as a systematic factor in one's life causing problems. Imagining life without procrastination and identifying possible positive benefits of overcoming procrastination. Decision to begin working systematically on overcoming procrastination to get into the advanced &quot;level&quot; of life.
* Distinguishing clearly between &quot;I know&quot;, &quot;I want&quot;, and &quot;I enjoy&quot;.
* Stopping thinking in terms of &quot;I must&quot; and starting thinking in terms of &quot;I want to&quot;. For example no one has to complete a university exam. The student has always a free choice whether to complete an exam or not. However if the exam is not completed, the student gets kicked out of the university. Because he wants to complete the university, he actually wants to complete the exam.
* Identifying truly and realistically individual problems caused by procrastination.
* Proposing a solution to these problems and identifying a &quot;theoretically optimum&quot; behaviour.
* Establishing a TODO list mechanism (a software or a notepad) and considering the act of scratching over a completed entry a magic ritual indicating success in overcoming procrastination.
* Writing things into TODO list as soon as they come into mind and then freeing mind from them.
* Breaking down difficult complicated tasks in the TODO list into smaller, easier units.
* Abstaining from perfectionism.
* Defining two formal states of person: &quot;behaving optimally&quot; and &quot;procrastinating&quot;. Mentally associating positive outcomes with the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; state and negative outcomes and problems with the &quot;procrastinating&quot; state. Then, in course of day, spotting the transition from the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; into &quot;procrastinating&quot; state and asking oneself, if he wishes to continue remaining in the &quot;procrastinating&quot; state despite all the problems associated with this state and all the pleasurable things associated with the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; state.
* Systematically scheduling pleasurable activities in certain reasonable ratio into the activity stream. This makes sure that after completion of a boring activity, a pleasurable one will eventually come, and motivates the person to complete the boring activity.

The basic requirement behind this is to have a module '''Main''' with an entry point called '''main''' and of type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- thingamie.hs
module Main where

main = putStrLn &quot;Bonjour, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We already know how to load this into GHCi, but here's how we compile it and then run it independently:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ghc --make -o bonjourWorld thingamie.hs
$ ./bonjourWorld
Bonjour, world!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Voilà! You now have a standalone application built in Haskell.

== Other modules ==

Most programs grow to be complicated enough to split across different files. Here is a toy example of an application which uses two modules.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Hello.hs
module Hello where

hello = &quot;Bonjour, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- thingamie.hs
module Main where

import Hello

main = putStrLn hello
&lt;/source&gt;

We can compile this fancy new program in the same way as before. The &lt;tt&gt;--make&lt;/tt&gt; flag tells GHC to automatically detect dependencies in the files you are compiling.  That is, since &lt;tt&gt;thingamie.hs&lt;/tt&gt; imports a module &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt;, GHC will search the Haskell files in the current directory for files that implement &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt; and also compile them. If Hello depends on other modules, GHC will automatically detect those dependencies as well.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ghc --make -o bonjourWorld thingamie.hs
$ ./bonjourWorld
Bonjour, world!
&lt;/pre&gt;

You may have noticed that the file with the &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; module, &lt;tt&gt;thingamie.hs&lt;/tt&gt;, does not have a name matching the module name, which goes against what we said in the [[Haskell/Modules#Modules|Modules]] chapter. That is not a problem because the point of having matching module and file names is allowing GHC to find the files automatically. Since that process always begins from &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt;, whose file we specify in the command line when calling GHC, the file of the &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; module need not follow the convention.

If you want to search in other places for source files (including a nested structure of files and directories), you can add the starting point for the dependency search with the &lt;tt&gt;-i&lt;/tt&gt; flag. This flag takes multiple, colon-separated directory names as its argument.

As a contrived example, the following program has three files all stored in a &lt;tt&gt;src/&lt;/tt&gt; directory. The directory structure looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
HaskellProgram/
   src/
      Main.hs
      GUI/
           Interface.hs
      Functions/
           Mathematics.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Main module imports its dependencies by searching a path analogous to the module name — so that &lt;code&gt;import GUI.Interface&lt;/code&gt; would search for &lt;tt&gt;GUI/Interface&lt;/tt&gt; (with the appropriate file extension).

To compile this program from within the HaskellProgram directory, invoke GHC with:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ghc --make -isrc -o sillyprog Main.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Derek Andrews. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Derek Andrews~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I'm also found on IRC from time to time (#wikibooks), under the name TubularBell, should you want to talk to me more directly.

== Your welcome message ==

Thank you for the welcome to wikibooks ([[User talk:Derek Andrews]]). I have added a few pages to the book ([[woodturning]]) and would really appreciate it if you could spare the time to take a look and make sure I am on the right lines before I go too far with this.

There is great online community of woodturners and I hope that between us we can make a wonderful resource for newcomers to our craft.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Glenda. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Glenda~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tallgirl. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tallgirl~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial is intended for users already familiar with Wings 3D commands to some extent.&lt;br&gt;
With the technique demonstrated, a Wings 3D user should be able to able to duplicate items around a center rather quickly.

== Starting point ==
[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_01.jpg]]

Let's say we want to duplicate the twisted column on the right in a circle around the point indicated by the red spot.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Setting up duplication ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_02.jpg]]

First figure out what number of times you want the object to go around the point.&lt;br&gt;
Create a new cylinder with the number of sides set to this number.&lt;br&gt;
To set the number of sides on a cylinder either right click on cylinder or on the adjacent box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You may need to enable advanced menus first in preferences.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Place this cylinder so that its axis passes through the desired centerpoint.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

== Make an extrusion ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_03.jpg]]

Pick a side on the cylinder and extrude it outward by an arbitrary amount.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Loop cut ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_04.jpg]]

Loop cut the extrusion from the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Combine ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_05.jpg]]

Select the extruded bit and the object to be duplicated and combine them.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Select interior face ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_06.jpg]]

Hide the cylinder. Select the face on the extruded bit that was facing the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Use Put-On ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_07.jpg]]

Without deselecting the face, unhide the cylinder.&lt;br&gt;
Right click on the Put-On command.&lt;br&gt;
Select all visible faces on the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Almost there ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_08.jpg]]

After executing the Put-On, you should see all your columns duplicated around the central cylinder.&lt;br&gt;What's this? Something's not quite right. A column is missing.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Select errant object ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_09.jpg]]

Fret not, fellow Wings3D user! There's a sort of bug in the Put-On command that occasionally makes it behave funny.&lt;br&gt;On random occasions it will rotate items being put on.&lt;br&gt;In this case the missing column is spotted poking through the bottom.&lt;br&gt;Clicking on it in body (object) mode will select it and its corresponding extruded bit.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Rotate to fix ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_10.jpg]]

Without deselecting the item from before, click rotate about selection.&lt;br&gt;
Select the face as shown. (It has the blue arrow sticking out of it, if not too clear otherwise.)&lt;br&gt;
Rotate 180°.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Check placement ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_11.jpg]]

Now the &quot;missing&quot; column is rotated into its proper position.&lt;br&gt;
That wasn't so hard to fix, was it?
&lt;hr&gt;

== Discard temporary objects ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_12.jpg]]

Select all the extruded bits in the center in body (object) mode. (All associated columns should select too.) Select separate from the menu. Go back and delete the cylinder and the extruded bits.
&lt;hr&gt;

== End result ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_13.jpg]]

If completed correctly, you should have columns going around the center.&lt;br&gt;
This technique should be handy for anything that gets repeated in a circle, not just architectural columns. This could be lug nuts on a wheel, decorative stars, spokes, meat grinder spikes, tire treads, etc. Have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Code wrapfloatbox not working ==

For some strange reason, the code in wrapfloatbox gives me a number of errors, of which the most important seems to be:
Missing \begin{document}...
Apparently, something goes wrong with the @ symbol, because in the output the text starts with:
simplerule[2]fs@cfont 12
simplerules@capt@@simplerule s@iftopcapt

I couldn't find a way around it yet, but in any case it would be nice to make the code self-contained. To run that example, people also have to remember to add the package wrapfig to the preamble.

== Text overlapping figures ==

Can we put a section about how to have a transparent figure legend placed over a full page picture, as this is something I really want to be able to do. 

== Errors in Wrapping figures ==

I modified Andy Robert's [http://andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial6/wrapping.tex wrapping.tex] according to instructions on additional parameters of wrapping and it did not work. The image was not wrapped, but sticked out of page. I was using latex + dvipdf because pdflatex had problems with .eps file.

If these examples do not work, perhaps, we should remove them? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:yes, the example you tried didn't work. Now I have fixed everything, improving the article. It should be fine now [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 15:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
:: Thanks! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== PDF's and .tex sources ==

I removed mention of .tex sources at the end of this chapter. I think that everything has already been used here, but if you want to link them again, see http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial6.html. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Aligning Captions ==

The captions under figures always are in the centre of the page, regardless of where the figure is. How can this be changed? --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 03:49, 5 July 2007 (UTC)
: what do you mean exactly? do you want to change the position or the alignment of the captions?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 15:43, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Footnotes in Floats ==

Quite often one (me as well) would like to have footnotes in captions or in the body of a table. For example to explain the variables or the source of the information.

Two information I've found are:
for tables: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=footintab
for captions: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=ftncapt

The general (but for some reason disliked) solution is to put everything in a minipage. Should we add this to the page?

== placeins ==
We should mention the package placeins [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/placeins.html] somewhere (it &quot;Defines a \FloatBarrier command, beyond which floats may not pass; useful, for example, to ensure all floats for a section appear before the next \section command.&quot;)

== inside floats, \centering is better than \begin{center} ... \end{center} ==
We should mention that somewhere. It's documented at, e.g., [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/4c403107d4719e7e/67c315102e0e6743?lnk=gst&amp;q=centering+or+begin{center}#67c315102e0e6743]: &quot;with the combination of figure and  center you get a doublespacing before and after, whereas the combination of figure and \centering only gives you the spacing from figure.&quot;

== p placement specifier ==
[http://www.hep.manchester.ac.uk/u/jenny/jcwdocs/latex/figures.html]: &quot;...The placement specifier p  lets the figure take up a full page without waiting until the end of the chapter&quot;. Controlling placement of full-page figures is a very annoying problem for the unexperienced users. Clear explanation of [p] in this document would be very useful.

== Subfloats ==

Hey I just wanted to mention that subfig package overrides the definition of captions for the KOMA-Script package. 
Since koma is widely used I thought it should be mentioned here too. 
The remedy to this is to use the '''subfigure''' package, which is much more comprehensive and does not overide the KOMA-Script settings. 
If no body changes this note here, I will edit the main article and add this. Cheers, Oz.

I think that'd be the prober way, Oz. I'm a LaTeX newbie and I got confused since I don't have a '''subfig''' package with '''subfloats''', but a '''subfigure''' package using '''subfigures'''. Otherwise this article is a great resource. Weeeeeeee, Jack. (10:41, 23 March 2010 JackSchnippes)

The ''subfigure'' and ''subfig'' packaged are NOT under current developement anymore so I would suggest to replace subfig to ''caption'' and ''subcaption''
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{width}
Picture\caption{Text}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

File:Latex example subfig.png&lt;br /&gt;
The shown example picture is quite misleading, as no horizontal spaces between figures are defined in the code itself but are visible in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;

:You're right, so I've tweaked the code to match the image as I don't have the source figures.  Also in testing this I noticed that the description in the list below the example didn't seem to be quite right, so I changed it to match the behaviour I can produce here.  It didn't 'feel' quite right anyway given the handling of whitespace elsewhere (just in case there could be a difference in implementation I'm using MikTeX 2.9 on Windows XP.

Changed the subfloat-part according to [[User:Nobelium|Nobelium's]] suggestion. &lt;code&gt;subfig&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subfigure&lt;/code&gt; are listed as deprecated in the newest (german) version of [ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/german/l2tabu/l2tabu.pdf l2tabu.pdf]. -[[User:Konteki|Konteki]] ([[User talk:Konteki|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Konteki|contribs]]) 10:06, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

: forgotten [width=\textwidth] on include graphics, because \includegraphics takes a picture size way too big by default and the width must be \textwidth because subfigure is basically a minipage environment and thus \textwidth is already a third of the page's \textwidth Otherwise results in overlapping figures with pdflatex (TexLive 2012 Debian).

I just wanted to mention that I have had many headaches with the subcaption package. It does not seem to play nicely with a lot of templates for academic journals. For example the templates for the Institute of Physics, and the publisher Springer. Despite being deprecated I find myself dropping back to the subfigure package. I think the incompatibilities need to be addressed before subcaption can be recommended for widespread use, alternatively it should be presented as just one option amongst subfigure and subfig.

== the &lt;code&gt;h!&lt;/code&gt; specifier ==

In the examples the &lt;code&gt;h!&lt;/code&gt; specifier is often used but it isn't accepted as a good specifier. I admit that it should be explaned but it should'n be used in the example. The way I learned to use specifiers is:
# make your document without specifiers
# once a chapter is completely written, add the specifier &lt;code&gt;[hb]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[ht]&lt;/code&gt; to the figures that aren't placed like you want.
# if that doesn't help: use the &lt;code&gt;[h]&lt;/code&gt; specifier
# as last option, if it's still not looking good, you can use &lt;code&gt;[h!]&lt;/code&gt;. But if you have to use &lt;code&gt;[h!]&lt;/code&gt; a lot, your document is'n well written and contains to much figures compared to the amount of text.
::That feels like a good approach, but the last comment about the ratio of graphics to text isn't necessarily true - it depends what you're writing, a 3 page paper doesn't give you as much flexibility as a book, for example.

== auto reorder floats ==

IS there a way to have LaTeX automatically reorder my float numbers based on the order that I reference them? i.e. if I move a reference to Figure 2 up above the reference for figure 1, can I set it up so that I don't have to move the figure to get it to become figure 1?

Paul - a good use for Put-On, I thought - just thought I'd mention that using Face | Extract &gt; Normal &gt; O (instead of 3, 4) would save user a step. 

I've also come across the bug / issue. Manually selecting all the faces in step 7, except for the one used for extraction / extrusion purposes seemed to give better results than going - Select Face, Select Similar (I) - and getting them all.
I doubt it's a 'proper' solution - just seemed to be better when I tried it.

&lt;hr&gt;
I renamed all the steps involved. It seemed a bit redundant to see the content listed as &quot;1 Step 1&quot;. Hopefully the names are more descriptive in that regard. Yet they still might need further clarification.

== Picture flagged for deletion? ==

Anyone know why one of the pics in this tutorial is flagged for deletion. (Or at least I see that in my messages here. Sorry, haven't logged in in a loong time.) I thought it was a fairly straight forward process to release a screen shot as public domain. Especially one from an open source software with no known usage restrictions. I'm confused.

===Question 1===

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
100=ab^0 &amp; \mbox{therefore} &amp; a=100 \\
200=ab^1 &amp; \mbox{therefore} &amp; b=\frac{200}{100}=2
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

====Part A====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^3=100\times2^3=800\mbox{ people}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Part B====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^{\frac{1}{2}}=100\times\sqrt{2}=141.41\dots\approx141\mbox{ people}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Part C====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^{\frac{7}{4}}=100\times\sqrt[4]{2^7}=336.35\dots\approx336\mbox{ people}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Question 3===
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
ab^0=35200 &amp; \mbox{therefore} &amp; a=35200 \\
           &amp;                  &amp; b=1.06

&lt;/math&gt;

====Part B====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^{\frac{1}{2}}=35200\times\sqrt{1.06}=36240.61\approx36241
&lt;/math&gt;

====Part C====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^{-10}=35200\times\frac{1}{1.06^{10}}=19655.49\approx19655

===Question 6===
&lt;math&gt;
a=440\,

====Part A====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
ab^{12} = 2a           \\
b^{12}  = 2            \\
b       = \sqrt[12]{2} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Part B====
&lt;math&gt;
ab^{-9}=440\times\frac{1}{\sqrt[12]{2^9}}=261.62\approx262\mbox{ Hz}

I am removing the section title &quot;Chinese Checkers Strategy by Darren A. Chilton(http://puzzle.roxr.com). Possibly &quot;Darren A. Chilton&quot; was one of the authors of this page, but I could identify nothing in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_checkers&amp;action=history edit history] with this name. As for http://puzzle.roxr.com, it offers a computer game called &quot;Advanced Chinese Checkers v0.90&quot;, but the download link does not work, so I wonder whether the game actually exists. I am removing the link; if they fix their site and the game works, then someone can add the link again. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:13, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

I have now become a member, and I can confirm that I created the original text for this. Obveously in traditional wiki style I added my knowledge as no-one had anything on the strategy of the game. I am dissapointed that all of the editing was never positive, and surprised that there are no good players out there who want to share their knowledge.
If you like you could put it as my strategy on the game in hoping that some grand master might put their strategies too.

Unfortunately the web site was continuously suffering from download problems, and indeed www.roxr.com have closed, so my web site is no more.
My game does exist, it is free, but I have no website to host it yet.

Since external links are better at the bottom of the page like : author game which lead to this wiki page (link...); I would like to be able to offer my game that I developped in my spare time to those who liked my rules of good playing, so that they can see them brought to life.

== Chinese Checkers play strategy ==


My name is Elaine, and I have been playing chinese checkers with different folks for 30 years.  There is nothing wrong with Darren Chilton's strategy guide.  Of course, I have other opening strategies, but the information he presented is the best of the basic best.

--Reply-- With so much experience you could put some of your strategies? --[[User:DarrenChilton|DarrenChilton]] 17:34, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heartworm''' is a parasitic roundworm (''Dirofilaria immitis'') that is spread from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm affects dogs, cats, wolves, coyotes, foxes, and some other animals, such as ferrets, sea lions, and even humans, but it is unusual for humans to become infected. The parasitic worm is called a &quot;heartworm&quot; because the parasite, in the final reproductive stage of its life cycle, resides in the heart of its host where it can stay for many years, until it kills its host through congestive failure of the heart.

==Prevention==

Prevention of heartworm infection can be obtained through a number of veterinary drugs. Most popular are [[w:ivermectin|ivermectin]] (sold under the brand name ''[[w:Heartgard|Heartgard]]''), [[w:milbmycin|milbmycin]] (''[[w:Interceptor|Interceptor]]'') and moxidectin (''[[w:ProHeart|ProHeart]]'') administered as pills or chewable tablets. These drugs are given monthly during the local mosquito season. Moxidectin is also available in a six-month sustained release injection administered by veterinarians, but the injectable form of Moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns. [[w:Selamectin|Selamectin]] (''Revolution''), on the other hand, is a topical preventive that is likewise administered monthly. Some of these drugs also kill other parasites, including intestinal worms. In addition, Selamectin controls fleas, ticks, and mites. 

Preventative drugs are highly effective, and when regularly administered will protect more than 99 percent of dogs from infection. Most failures of protection result from irregular and infrequent administration of the drug. However, the monthly preventives all have a reasonable margin for error in their administration such that if a single month's dose is accidentally missed, adequate protection is usually provided so long as the next two monthly doses are administered on schedule.  

Monthly heartworm prevention should be administered beginning within a month of the onset of the local mosquito season and continued for a month after the cessation of local mosquito activity. In warm climates, such as the warm temperate climate along the immediate Gulf coast of the United States and in tropical and subtropical regions, heartworm prevention must be administered year round. Some authorities recommend year round administration even in colder climates on the theory that mosquito activity may occur during the occasional unseasonable warm spell, but others argue that computer models indicate heartworm transmission is highly unlikely under such circumstances.

==Symptoms of infestation==

Dogs show no indication of heartworm infestation during the 6 month long prepatent period prior to the worms' maturation, and current diagnostic tests for the presence of microfilariae or antigens cannot detect prepatent infections. Rarely, migrating heartworm larvae get &quot;lost&quot; and end up in unusual sites such as the eye, brain, or an artery in the leg, which results in unusual symptoms such as blindness, seizures and lameness. 

Many dogs will show little or no sign of infection even after the heartworms have matured. To some degree these dogs may be described as seeming to age slightly faster than normal as the worms slowly damage the lungs, kidneys and liver. These animals usually have a light infection and live a fairly sedentary lifestyle. However, active dogs and those with heavier infections will quickly show the classic symptoms of heartworm disease. Early symptoms include a cough, especially on exercise, and early exhaustion upon exercise. More advanced cases progress to severe weight loss, fainting, coughing up blood, and, finally, congestive heart failure.

==Testing==

Heartworms can be detected by blood test. The filtration test finds microfilariae in the blood; the occult tests (antigen and antibody) are used to detect adult worms. Many veterinarians prefer to do both tests, since the absence of microfilariae in the blood does not necessarily mean that there are no adult worms in the heart. Both tests are done with a single blood draw, preferably in the early spring before daily temperatures warm above 57&amp;deg; F.

X-ray radiographs and, to a lesser extent, ultrasound can also detect the presence of adult heartworms in the heart and lungs. X-rays also can provide a good estimate of the amount of lung damage caused by the presence of heartworms.

==Treatment==

If either a blood test or the onset of symptoms betray the presence of heartworms, treatment is indicated. Treatment is highly efficacious if the disease is caught early in the disease process. Before the worms can be treated, however, the dog must be evaluated for good heart, liver, and kidney function to ensure the animal can survive the treatment. Any insufficiencies in these organs must be dealt with first, before treatment, as the eradication process can be taxing on organ function. Usually the adult worms are killed with an arsenic-based compound. The currently recommended compound, Melarsomine dihydrochloride, is marketed under the brand name ''Immiticide''. It has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than previous formulation (Thiacetarsamide sodium, sold as ''Caparsolate'') which makes it a safer alternative for dogs with late-stage infestations.

After treatment, the dog must rest (restricted exercise) for several weeks so as to give its body sufficient time to absorb the dead worms without ill effect. Otherwise, when the dog is under exertion, dead worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing respiratory failure and death.

The course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests come back negative, the treatment is considered a success.

Surgical removal of the adult heartworms is also a treatment that may be indicated, especially in advanced cases with substantial heart involvement.

Long term monthly administration of ivermectin (but apparently not moxidectin, milbemycin or selamectin) year round for at least three years at the dose normally used for heartworm prevention also removes most adult heartworms from most dogs. However, this is not the treatment of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. First, not all dogs are completely cleared of heartworms by this treatment. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until some 18 months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable under most circumstances. This treatment is normally reserved for dogs that are not likely to tolerate treatment with the harsher, but more effective, melarsomine or instances where the owner cannot afford the more expensive melarsomine treatment.

From time to time various &quot;homeopathic,&quot; &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; products are touted as cures or preventives for heartworm disease. However, such products have never been proven effective by rigorous scientific methods, and the claims should be viewed with skepticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout Christian history, the topic of how or when a believer in Jesus as the Risen Christ becomes a Christian has been debated, and the debate continues into the modern era. Honestly, the debate is based on the divide between the High Churches (those which are highly ritualized, like the Catholic and Orthodox Churches) and Low Churches (those that are highly informal, like the Baptists, Pentecostals, and the several &quot;Free&quot;/&quot;Non-Denominational&quot; Churches), and it is centered on whether simply holding the belief inside one's heart and acting as a Christian (which includes &quot;confession&quot; of Jesus as Lord and Savior), is enough to enter the community of believers, or whether the convert should be entered into the community only after receiving certain rituals, like Baptism and First Communion. And the major problem in resolving the issue is that both sides have scripture that supports their position.

At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus gives us two commandments beyond that of always act in love in all ways. He first tells his disciples to share the Communion meal, and then, in Mat 28, commissions them to &quot;Go forth and baptize all nations in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.&quot; Along with many passages in the letter of James and elsewhere, this is the Scripture that the High Church uses to justify their position. The Low Church, by contrast, prefers to use the scriptures which suggest a more free-form version, such as those in Acts or Paul's letters, in which all that is necessary to be admitted into Christian community is right belief.

In any case, all Christian denominations do celebrate the sacrament of Baptism, the ritual for which always begins with a reading of Scripture, followed by a profession of faith (in the High Churches, this is done by a short responsory to the Apostle's Creed), the immersion or imposition of water, and finally the anointing of the newly baptized.

The process that made you an administrator on the MediaWiki project that you are working on has made you one of the most visible members of that community.  Either you are starting out a brand new project, or you have been elected from your peers to take a larger role in moderating discussion.

== Becoming an Administrator ==

=== Starting a Completely New Project ===

If you have decided to take the path of starting a completely new project from scratch, as the founding member you are usually given administrator rights to get things going right away, and often even more.  This founding user is by definition the older person on the project.

Other sections of this book will deal with how to get a project to grow, especially just simply trying to get something started at all, but it is important to remember the implications of your position as the founder of a project.  Generally your opinion is going to be strongly considered, and you have available to you the ability to take drastic steps in controlling the community... particularly if you also have direct access to the physical computer equipment that is running the project.

Keep in mind that most people will have a sort of reverence toward the founder, even if the founder decides to go into semi-retirement and leave the main organization of the community to other people.  This is deserved in part because any on-line community only gets to where it is at because of the efforts of this founder.  It takes quite a bit of effort to get something going in the first place, and with enough different websites around the world nobody is simply going to get to a website simply because it exists.  This is in particular where the leadership principles come into place on a social level.

Often what is needed is simply a model example for what you as a founder want the project to look like.  In the initial stages, you need to demonstrate leadership both by showing examples, and gently trying to remind people when inappropriate content is being added.  How permissive or how abrasive you are toward new users is going to have a huge effect on the growth and popularity of the project, regardless of the merits of what you do or the quality of the content.

It is also important to realize that you can't be pleasing to everybody on every point.  The most successful leaders will always have detractors and possibly out right enemies.  The successful leader will know when they are being abusive and need to pull back, and when perhaps they have gone too far and created too many enemies that should be their friends.  Unfortunately, the only real way to learn how to do that is simply experience and getting opportunities to practice leadership ideas.

=== Being Chosen by Your Peers ===

There are several ways that you can become an administrator, but most likely you have been chosen by being an outstanding contributor to the project.  Often this selection is made through some sort of formal nomination process where other members of the community also have a chance to support your nomination in a sort of election.  The exact process is something that is specific to the project you are working on, but you should take the nomination as a sign of recognition that you have already done an outstanding job.

In this situation, you are going to need to learn the policies and procedures of the project in a little more depth.  This is not exactly an easy situation, and it is surprising how many policies that you didn't realize existed prior to becoming an administrator, even if you were a very active user previously.

== Moderate, Don't Dominate ==

One aspect of becoming an administrator is that you are now a part of the group that is enforcing policies.  If you have been vocal in the past, you need to tone down some of the arguments from the style you have used in the past, understanding that you need to help moderate the tone of the discussions you are involved with.

As a general philosophy, it would be wise to not immediately implement drastic changes to the project, especially in areas that require the extra privileges that come from being an administrator.  Seek input from the other people involved in the project before you make any major changes, and implement community decisions even if it goes against your own personal opinion.

Also, don't hesitate to admit that you might be wrong occasionally.  You will be making mistakes along the way as an administrator, especially if you are new to doing this sort of task.  Discover the different ways you can communicate to the other users in your community, including Water Cooler type pages, e-mail, user talk pages, article discussion pages, project e-mail lists, phone numbers and instant message accounts.

== Innovation and Project Development ==

One aspect of project leadership also takes on the social responsibility of project innovation and development.  It is likely that there was always some task you felt wasn't being adequately dealt with in some manner before you became an administrator, and now you have the opportunity to try and fix things in a way you couldn't before.

Innovation might also take many forms.  You can start new sections of your project, or try to fill in holes that weren't covered before.  In addition, if you were elected to become an administrator it is likely that you have a small group of supporters already who are interested in what you are doing, and it is possible to help motivate those supporters to work together and get some things accomplished as well.</text>

&lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; wraps the whole HTML document. The opening tag is placed directly after the doctype declaration, the end tag at the end of the document.

It is recommended that the primary language of the document is indicated with either the &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt;  attribute for HTML or the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute for XHTML. XHTML 1.0 documents served with a MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; should use both &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt;.

== Example ==
An English language HTML 4.01 document.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

An English language XHTML 1.0 document.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Required attributes ==
==== xmlns ====
In XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; is required. &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; defines the XML namespace. Its value in XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 is &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Standard attributes ==
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#dir|dir]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#lang|lang]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#xml:lang|xml:lang]]

== Notes ==
This tag is optional in HTML 4.01, but it is strongly recommend to use it.

It is required in XHTML.

Multiple elements can be assigned to the same class (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), as well as a single element belonging to multiple classes (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo bar&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

===code===

===codebase===

===dir===
With this attribute you can define which direction the text is written for a given element, either &lt;code&gt;ltr&lt;/code&gt; for left-to-right or &lt;code&gt;rtl&lt;/code&gt; for right-to-left.

===height===
Setting this attribute with a numerical value defines the height of an element in pixels (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div ''height=&quot;150&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)

===id===
This attribute allows you to define a unique identifier for each element. This would be useful for hyperlinks that link to a specific section of a page or when styling using a style sheet.

===lang===
With this attribute you can specify a language that is used for an element.

===style===
This attribute allows you to apply specific styling to a given element.

===title===

With this attribute you can define what will be displayed when a user hovers the element. It is not available for [[../Tag List/base|base]], [[../Tag List/head|head]], [[../Tag List/html|html]], [[../Tag List/meta|meta]], [[../Tag List/param|param]], [[../Tag List/script|script]], [[../Tag List/style|style]], and [[../Tag List/title|title]].

===width===
Setting this attribute with a numerical value defines the width of an element in pixels (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div ''width=&quot;230&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)

==More attributes==

===accesskey===

The &lt;code&gt;accesskey&lt;/code&gt; attribute defines a keyboard shortcut for a hyperlink or form element.
The combination of keys need to activate the shortcut varies from browser to browser. In Microsoft Internet Explorer the user must press Alt+''accesskey''. If the shortcut is for a link the user must then press Enter to follow the link. The choice of Alt+''accesskey'' means that access keys can clash with shortcuts built-in to the browser.

It is quite common to use numbers for the access keys since these don't clash with any major browser's built-in shortcuts, e. g.
* 1 = Home Page
* 0 = List of access keys on this website.

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;2&quot; href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;/accesskeys&quot;&gt;Access keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is no standard way to let users know the access keys that are available on the page. Some suggestions can be found in [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accesskeys Accesskeys: Unlocking Hidden Navigation].

|next=Model a Silver Goblet cylinder|Model a Silver Goblet from a cylinder
|previous=Model a Goblet}}
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.75}}

==Basic Shape==
[[image:Blender3d Silver goblet extrusion plan.jpg|right|200px]]

At first glance, the goblet looks like it is composed of cylinders. However, while it is possible to model the goblet with a cylinder mesh, it is easier to make a goblet by using cubes.  Cubes make the goblet faster to make and it makes fewer vertices to track. Now, lets start making the basic shape of the goblet.


Start with the default cube and go to Edit Mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}). Toggle off &quot;limit selection to visible&quot;. Move to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Toggle to ortho view. Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the top edges of the cube. Extrude ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Regions'') upward about one grid square. Hold down {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} while extruding, for incremental movement, and press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to restrict movement to the Z-axis. This extrusion is called E1. Repeat 2 more times for extrusion 2 and 3 (E2 and E3). 


Now Extrude a longer piece upwards, for the Goblet's stem, of 10 grid squares (E4). Next we will define the area for the 2 top knobs and the bottom of the glass by Extruding upwards 5 more times at 1 grid square each (E5-E9). Next do another upward Extrusion of about 10 grid squares (E10). This is the actual glass itself.
{{clear}}

=== Inflate the Glass ===
[[Image:Blender3d_Silver_goblet_e2_scaling.jpg|right|400px|Sizing the first knob]]
Now, let's begin to inflate the glass. First, clear all selections by hitting the {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}. Make sure you are still in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the bottom most cube (all 8 vertices, not just the bottom 4). Then expand it outward by scaling ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}), then pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to lock/prevent any scaling in height along the Z-axis and finally pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|4}} to quadruple its size. Next, deselect all vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the 4th pair of vertices (E2), scale them ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}), lock scaling ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) and triple the vertices in size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|3}}). 


Do the same for E5 and E7 (the 7th and 9th pairs of vertices, respectively). Then expand ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) the top, Goblet rectangle (E9 and E10) to 6 times its current size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|6}}).

=== Make the cup's interior ===
[[Image:Bcup3.png|All extrusions|left]] [[Image:Bcup4.png|View of the finished basic goblet|right]]
Last is the cup's interior. Once again, you should still be in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the very top most vertices of the Goblet (E10). Once selected, get a better view by changing to 'Orbit Up' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM8}}). With the top surface selected, initiate an Extrusion ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}), followed by a termination with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESCAPE}}. It will appear as if nothing has happened, but new, overlapping edges have been created and are now selected (this also creates E11). Next Scale ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}) the selected vertices to 4/5ths of the original size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|.8}}). This creates the inside lip of the cup. Now, Extrude ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}) the interior lip, along the Z-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) downward ({{B3D:N2P/Do|-10}}) to create the bottom interior of the Goblet (E12). Finish off by selecting all, and then a 'Remove Doubles' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; '''Remove Doubles'''), for good measure. It should look something like this.

'''Notes:'''

''Note:'' For some reason, when I extruded the interior of the cup to -10, I would have a lip sticking out of the bottom of the cup when I applied the subsurf. To resolve this, I extruded to -9. I was also left with a space at the bottom of the cup (i.e. you could see all the way to the base of the goblet) so I selected the bottom most vertices, pressed F, extruded and hit ESC, merged, selected the center vertice and translated that down -1. This gave me a nice looking bottom for the cup.

''Note:'' If the thickness of the vessel sides or bottom is too thin, the Goblets interior faces may 'bleed through', affecting the exterior of the Goblet when you apply a subsurf.

''Noob Note:'' When you create the interior of the cup with .8, be sure to hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to restrict it to just the X and Y axis, or when you extrude your glass downwards by 10, it will go through the bottom of the glass

''Noob Note:'' You may want to try modelling the inside/bottom of the Goblet (sim. to &quot;Die Another Way&quot; tutorial). Turning on &quot;Occlude Background Geometry&quot; ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) will be helpful, as it turns off the ability to see &amp; select through the model. The button icon is that of a &quot;ISO Cube&quot; located with the 3 select mode buttons (4 dots, 2 lines, &amp; a triangle) of the 3D Toolbar, in Edit Mode.

''Pro Note:'' If you wish for a more detailed cup, extrude the bottom of the cup, then scale it by .2097. Then translate (in layman's terms, that's &quot;grab&quot;) it .7181 along the negative Z axis (or -.7181 along the Z axis). Through the use of creasing and control loop-cuts, you can get a ''very'' nice goblet.

==Smoothing and Defining==

Time to take the mesh and turn it into a proper goblet.  Add a subsurf level 2 ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|2}})to the mesh.  Change to Object Mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}) and select the Set Smooth button under ''Links and Materials''.  The cube-looking mesh will now look like an object that was created from a cylinder.
This has removed all our crisp edges, and our globlet is looking very unstable!  Let's rectify things by flattening the bottom.

'''Noob Note:''' ''If your goblet has a bulge in it after applying the subsurf, go to '''Edit mode''' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}), select all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, and select &quot;Remove doubles&quot;. (If a menu for boolean operations appears when you hit the {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, then you're not in '''Edit mode'''; change immediately to Edit mode and try the {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} again.)''

Select the four edges that surround the small circle at the very bottom (the very lowest set of edges) and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do| E}} to enable creasing.  Now drag the mouse up and down to select the level of the crease. When you're satisfied, hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}. Repeat the process for other edges you want to be sharp. I've turned on Draw Creases under ''Mesh Tools 1'' to illustrate which edges have been creased (highlighted yellow) in this example.

That concludes the creation of the goblet. Save the scene for use in the lighting tutorial.

'''Notes:'''

''Note:'' Due to the vagueness of this tutorial I had problems trying to follow what was wanted. I got around it by bevelling the goblet (for the cup-edge/thickness), and then merging necessary vertex. Here is how it turned-out:

[http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k185/captheathmalc/gobletinblender.jpg Goblet][http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k185/captheathmalc/goblet.jpg Render]

[[Image:Bcup5.png|Applied subsurf modifier]] [[Image:Bcup6.png|Crease edges]]

''Note:'' I found that if you select the bottom 4 vertices and extrude them 2 times down along the Z-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} -.5 twice) and then you select the bottom 8 vertices and scale by 1.5 along the X and Y axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} -&gt; Shift+Z -&gt; 1.5) it makes for a more realistic looking goblet base.

&lt;small&gt;'''Note:''' The draft Table of Contents for the Statewide Water Plan was written by the [[Georgia Water/External Links/Organizations/Georgia Water Resources Council|Georgia Water Resources Council]] and submitted to Governor Sonny Perdue on January 6, 2004.  This 2004 draft [http://www.gadnr.org/gwrc/Assets/Documents/Comprehensive_Water_PlanTOC.pdf] may be revised as the state planning process unfolds.&lt;small/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

:#Description of how existing and in-progress regional plans will be integrated into the state plan. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Integrating existing plans|Status]]''')


===Guiding Principles &amp; Policy Framework===

====General Guiding Principles====
The Council believes the following principles (from the work of the JWSC) should guide the development of the State Water Plan:
#Effective water resources management protects health and the safety and welfare of Georgia’s citizens;
#Water resources are managed in a sustainable manner so that current and future generations have access to adequate supplies of quality water that supports both human and natural systems;  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Sustainability|Status]]''')
#All citizens have a stewardship responsibility to conserve and protect the water resources of Georgia; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Stewardship responsibility|Status]]''')
#Water management efforts recognize that economic prosperity and environmental quality are interdependent; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Economic prosperity|Status]]''') 
#Water quality and quantity and surface and ground water are interrelated and require integrated planning as well as reasonable and efficient use; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Integrated planning|Status1]]''') and [[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Reasonable use|Status2]]''')
#A comprehensive and accessible database must be developed to provide sound scientific and economic information upon which effective water management decisions can be based; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Database|Status]]''')
#Water resources management encourages local/regional innovation, implementation, adaptability, and responsibility for watershed and river basin management; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Local responsibility|Status3]]''') and ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Local capability|Status4]]''')
#Sound water resources management involves meaningful participation, coordination, and cooperation among interested and affected stakeholders and citizens, as well as all levels of governmental and other entities managing or utilizing water; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Public involvement in decisions|Status5]]''') ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Coordination|Status6]]''')
#Periodic revisions of the comprehensive statewide water management plan may be required to accommodate new scientific and policy insights as well as changing social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Scanning|Status7]]''') and ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Updating procedure|Status8]]''')

====Current Statutory, Regulatory, and Water Management Policy Framework====
:The Law Department would be enlisted to provide a description of Georgia’s current water quality and water quantity management statutory framework. A description of Georgia’s water quantity management statutory framework – produced by the Law Department - has already been completed for other purposes, and may require editing for inclusion in a State Water Plan.  Additionally advice and guidance should be sought from the governor’s legal counsel.  As the State agency with principal water management regulatory responsibilities, EPD would be assigned the task of describing the current regulatory requirements related to the statutory framework completed by the Law Department. Before completing this section, EPD would seek input from other State government entities having water management responsibilities under Georgia law.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Policy Framework|Status]]''')

====Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues====
:If the sub-state strategies for managing water are to meet the goals defined for the Plan, development of these strategies must be guided by clearly articulated guidance – from the State – on a number of critical public policy issues.  This section of the Plan would address itself to these critical water public policy issues.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues|Status]]''')


===Planning Standards===
:This section of the Plan would provide a description of minimum planning standards that would guide the sub-state planning regions in developing sub-state resource management components of the Plan. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Planning Standards|Status]]''')


===Executive Summary of Sub-State Components of State Water Plan===
:This section of the “State Components” of the Plan would provide an executive summary of each of the sub-state components of the State Plan. Such a summary will not be possible for many of the sub-state components until some time after completion of the “State Components”; however as the State Plan must be a ‘living’ document, these substate executive summaries can/should be added whenever the sub-state plans have been completed.
:This summary might also generally address itself to an appropriate subset – or all - of the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/issues.php 42 issues] the JWSC identified during the conduct of its work.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#42 issues|Status]]''') 

====Water Quantity Management====

:*Highlights
:*Planning Area Boundary Issues
:'''Water Quantity Management Summary by Planning Area'''
:*Water Quantity Management to Meet Present and Anticipated In-Stream Needs 
:*Water Quantity Management to Meet Present and Anticipated Off-Stream Needs

:*Data Management Systems ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Data Management Systems|Status]]''')
:*Real Time Water Management ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Real Time Water Management|Status]]''')
:*Additional Data and Research Needs :('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Additional Data and Research Needs|Status]]''')

====Implementation====

:*Enforcement ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Enforcement|Status]]''')
:*Funding ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Funding|Status]]''')
:*Schedule/mechanism to monitor and report on the implementation of the Plan ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Implementation reporting|Status]]''')
&lt;br/&gt;



===SUB-STATE COMPONENTS OF STATE WATER PLAN (for each Region)===
'''Outline for each Regional Plan'''
(The State Water Plan would eventually include several regional water plans that are developed – and integrated – in accordance with guidance developed early in the state water planning process.  The configuration of the sub-state regions, while not yet determined, should at a minimum take into consideration both natural and political boundaries.  Some of the expected major topic areas of the sub-state plans are shown below.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I live in Tacoma, Washington.  Photograph available. [http://www.plu.edu/~jensenmk/]  I was born on August 13, 1951, in Bethesda, Maryland.  I am married and have one son.  E-mail: jensenmk@plu.edu

My areas of specialization as a faculty member at Pacific Lutheran University, where I have taught since 1989, are 19th-century French literature and French.  I have taught 18th-century and 20th-century French literature as well, as well as modern European literature generally.  More broadly, I majored in history at Princeton University and am interested in modern European and American history, with additional interests in world history, the philosophy of history, and the history of ideas.

After briefly studying law, I pursued literary interests while working in a San Francisco bookstore and decided to return to graduate school in 1980.  I hold a Ph.D. in French literature from the University of California, Berkeley.  I find the Wikibook project interesting from every point of view.  I had been contributing to Wikipedia for about a year when I became aware of Wikibooks in January 2006.

In recent years I have become politically active in the peace movement at the local level, and am involved in several groups in Pierce County, Washington.  This has led me to develop new interests:  national security, 20th-century U.S. history, media studies, etc. 

I am fluent in French and am an experienced translator from French to English with have a particular interest in translating the work of the French literary historian and critic Paul B&amp;eacute;nichou (1908-2001).  I have published a translation of B&amp;eacute;nichou's &lt;I&gt;Le Sacre de l'&amp;eacute;crivain&lt;/I&gt; (1973) entitled &lt;I&gt;The Consecration of the Writer, 1750-1830&lt;/I&gt; (U. Nebraska, 1999), and am currently at work on a translation of &lt;I&gt;Le Temps des proph&amp;egrave;tes&lt;/I&gt; (1977).

I maintain a home page. [http://www.plu.edu/~jensenmk/]  I also am active on the web on the pages of United for Peace of Pierce County [http://www.ufppc.org] and People for Peace, Justice, and Healing. [http://www.tacomapjh.org]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Items in the Glossary are alphabetically listed. The following format will be used throughout the glossary:

Carnivore (T-Rex): A meat eating animal.  See also Omnivore and Herbivore.

Thus, the entry will be listed in its alphabetical order, followed in parenthesis by the section first listed and defined in. Following that, if available, should be related terms that could be looked up for further information.

== Glossary ==

*
'''Carnivore''' ([[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/T-Rex|T-Rex]]): A meat eating animal.  See also Omnivore and Herbivore. [[Image:Trex skelleton 2.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''T. rex'' skeleton from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]]

* 
'''Jurassic Period''': The time period when the super continent of pagea began to break apart between 199 and 145 million years ago. Dinosaurs were the dominant land animals of this period.

*
'''Mesozoic Era''': An Era when dinosaurs lived on the Earth between 251 million years ago and 65 million years ago. It is divided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and the Cretaceous geological periods (See also Era, Geological Period).

*
'''Omnivore''': An animal that eats both plants and meat.  See also Carnivore and Herbivore.

*
'''Paleontologist''': A scientist who studies Dinosaurs.

*
'''Predator''': An animal that hunts down and kills animals for food.

*
'''Prey''': An animal hunted or caught for food.

*
'''Scavenger''': An animal that feeds on animals that are already dead.

* 
'''Triassic Period''': The time period when dinosaurs first evolved, between 251 and 199 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pastor Rex Humbard once said, the Christian life is like a bicycle, either go on or go off. Thus, after the believer turns to Jesus, there are certain things required:
*To grow in Christ. (Eph. 4: 15)
*To grow in grace and knowledge of the things of God (2 Peter 3: 18)
*To grow as the Word is read. (1 Peter 2: 2)
*To love one another. (John 13: 35) (1 Cor. 13)
*To be a witness of Jesus to others (Acts 1: 8)
*To give to God what is God’s. (Luke 20: 25)
*To pray always. (1 Thess. 5: 17) 
*To pray in the Holy Spirit. (Jude 20)
*To receive help from the Holy Spirit when we do not know how to pray. (Rom. 8: 26)
*To join a body of believers. (Heb. 10: 24,25)
::With oneness in unity of purpose. (Rom. 12: 5)
::With oneness, but different ministries. (Eph. 4: 11,12)
::With oneness in symbols. (Rev. 19: 7)
::With oneness in testimony. (Rev. 12: 10,11)
::With oneness as children of God. (Matt. 5: 9)

:''And if the Holy Spirit is in you, He who raised up Christ from the dead will add to your mortal existence such abundant Life as comes with the indwelling of His Spirit. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are under no obligation to live a life ruled by our baser instincts. For if you follow that path, death is near; but under the powerful sway of the Spirit, when you put those inclinations aside, you will live. For all who are led by the Holy Spirit are children of God.'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;(Romans&amp;nbsp;8:&amp;nbsp;11-14&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Modernity)&lt;/CENTER&gt;

==Vectors==

Physical effects involve things acting on other things to produce a change of position, tension etc. These effects usually depend upon the strength, angle of contact, separation etc of the interacting things rather than on any absolute reference frame so it is useful to describe the rules that govern the interactions in terms of the relative positions and lengths of the interacting things rather than in terms of any fixed viewpoint or coordinate system. Vectors were introduced in physics to allow such relative descriptions.

The use of vectors in elementary physics often avoids any real understanding of what they are. They are a new concept, as unique as numbers themselves, which have been related to the rest of mathematics and geometry by a series of formulae such as linear combinations, scalar products etc.

Vectors are defined as &quot;directed line segments&quot; which means they are lines drawn in a particular direction. The introduction of time as a geometric entity means that this definition of a vector is rather archaic, a better definition might be that a vector is information arranged as a continuous succession of points in space and time. Vectors have length and direction, the direction being from earlier to later.

Vectors are represented by lines terminated with arrow symbols to show the direction. A point that moves from the left to the right for about three centimetres can be represented as:

[[Image:relvectsym.gif]]

If a vector is represented within a coordinate system it has components along each of the axes of the system. These components do not normally start at the origin of the coordinate system. 

[[Image:Relvector2.jpg]] 

The vector represented by the bold arrow has components a, b and c which are lengths on the coordinate axes. If the vector starts at the origin the components become simply the coordinates of the end point of the vector and the vector is known as the position vector of the end point.

===Addition of Vectors===

If two vectors are connected so that the end point of one is the start of the next the sum of the two vectors is defined as a third vector drawn from the start of the first to the end of the second:

[[Image:Relvectoradd.jpg]] 

&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; is the sum of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;:

&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;

If a components of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; are a, b, c and the components of &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; are d, e, f then the components of the sum of the two vectors are (a+d), (b+e) and (c+f). In other words, when vectors are added it is the components that add numerically rather than the lengths of the vectors themselves.

Rules of Vector Addition

1. Commutativity &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

2. Associativity (&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) + &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + (&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;)

If the zero vector (which has no length) is labelled as 0

3. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + (-&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) = 0

4. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;b&gt; + 0 = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

===Rules of Vector Multiplication by a Scalar===

The discussion of components and vector addition shows that if vector &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; has components a,b,c then q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;b&gt; has components qa, qb, qc. The meaning of vector multiplication is shown below:

[[Image:relvectormult.jpg]] 

The bottom vector c is added three times which is equivalent to multiplying it by 3.

1. Distributive laws q(&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;b&gt;) = q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + q&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; and (q + p)&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; = q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + p&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

2. Associativity q(p&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) = qp&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

Also 1 &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

If the rules of vector addition and multiplication by a scalar apply to a set of elements they are said to define a vector space.

===Linear Combinations and Linear Dependence===

An element of the form:

&lt;math&gt;q_1\mathbf{a_1} + q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m \mathbf{a_m}&lt;/math&gt;

is called a linear combination of the vectors.

The set of vectors multiplied by scalars in a linear combination is called the span of the vectors. The word span is used because the scalars (q) can have any value - which means that any point in the subset of the vector space defined by the span can contain a vector derived from it.

Suppose there were a set of vectors (&lt;math&gt;{a_1,a_2,.... ,a_m}&lt;/math&gt;) , if it is possible to express one of these vectors in terms of the others, using any linear combination, then the set is said to be linearly dependent. If it is not possible to express any one of the vectors in terms of the others, using any linear combination, it is said to be linearly independent. 

In other words, if there are values of the scalars such that:

(1). &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1} = q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m\mathbf{a_m}&lt;/math&gt;

the set is said to be linearly dependent.

There is a way of determining linear dependence. From (1) it can be seen that if &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to minus one then:

&lt;math&gt;q_1\mathbf{a_1} + q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m\mathbf{a_m} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So in general, if a linear combination can be written that sums to a zero vector then the set of vectors (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1,a_2,.... ,a_m})&lt;/math&gt; are not linearly independent.

If two vectors are linearly dependent then they lie along the same line (wherever a and b lie on the line, scalars can be found to produce a linear combination which is a zero vector). If three vectors are linearly dependent they lie on the same line or on a plane (collinear or coplanar).

===Dimension===

If n+1 vectors in a vector space are linearly dependent then n vectors are linearly independent and the space is said to have a dimension of n. The set of n vectors is said to be the basis of the vector space.

===Scalar Product===

Also known as the 'dot product' or 'inner product'. The scalar product is a way of removing the problem of angular measures from the relationship between vectors and, as Weyl put it, a way of comparing the lengths of vectors that are arbitrarily inclined to each other.

Consider two vectors with a common origin:

[[Image:relscalar.jpg]]

The projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; on the adjacent side is:

&lt;math&gt;P = | \mathbf{a} | cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a} | &lt;/math&gt; is the length of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

The scalar product is defined as:

(2) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . b} = | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{b} | cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is zero if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular. This means that if the scalar product is zero the vectors composing it are orthogonal (perpendicular to each other).

(2) also allows &lt;math&gt;cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; to be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;cos \theta = \mathbf{a . b} / ( | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{b} |)&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of the scalar product also allows a definition of the length of a vector in terms of the concept of a vector itself. The scalar product of a vector with itself is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . a} = | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{a} | cos 0&lt;/math&gt;

cos 0 (the cosine of zero) is one so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . a} = a^2&lt;/math&gt;

which is our first direct relationship between vectors and scalars. This can be expressed as: 

(3) &lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt{\mathbf{a . a}} &lt;/math&gt;

where a is the length of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Properties:

1. Linearity &lt;math&gt;[G\mathbf{a} + H\mathbf{b}].\mathbf{c} = G\mathbf{a.c} + H\mathbf{b.c}&lt;/math&gt;

2. symmetry &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = \mathbf{b.a}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Positive definiteness &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.a}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to 0

4. Distributivity for vector addition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{(a + b).c} = \mathbf{a.c + b.c}&lt;/math&gt;

5. Schwarz inequality &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a.b} | \leq ab&lt;/math&gt;

6. Parallelogram equality &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} |^2 + | \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} |^2 = 2( | \mathbf{a} |^2 + | \mathbf{b} |^2)&lt;/math&gt;

From the point of view of vector physics the most important property of the scalar product is the expression of the scalar product in terms of coordinates. 

7. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the length of a vector in terms of coordinates (Pythagoras' theorem) from:

8. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.a} = a^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of 7 is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1\mathbf{i} + a_2\mathbf{j} + a_3\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors along the coordinate axes. From (4) 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = (a_1\mathbf{i} + a_2\mathbf{j} + a_3\mathbf{k}) .\mathbf{b} = a_1\mathbf{i}.\mathbf{b} + a_2\mathbf{j}.\mathbf{b} + a_3\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; 

but &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = b_1\mathbf{i} + b_2\mathbf{j} + b_3\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = b_1a_1\mathbf{i .i} + b_2a_1\mathbf{i .j} + b_3a_1\mathbf{i .k} + b_1a_2\mathbf{j.i} + b_2a_2\mathbf{j.j} + b_3a_2\mathbf{j.k} + b_1a_3\mathbf{k.i} + b_2a_3\mathbf{k.j} + b_3a_3\mathbf{k.k}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i .j, i .k, j .k,}&lt;/math&gt; etc. are all zero because the vectors are orthogonal, also &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i .i, j.j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k.k}&lt;/math&gt; are all one (these are unit vectors defined to be 1 unit in length).

Using these results:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrices==

Matrices are sets of numbers arranged in a rectangular array. They are especially important in linear algebra because they can be used to represent the elements of linear equations.

11a + 2b = c

5a + 7b = d

The constants in the equation above can be represented as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
11 &amp; 2 \\
5 &amp; 7 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of matrices are usually denoted symbolically using lower case letters:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Matrices are said to be equal if all of the corresponding elements are equal.

Eg: if &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}= b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Addition===

Matrices are added by adding the individual elements of one matrix to the corresponding elements of the other matrix.

&lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; 

or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix addition has the following properties:

1. Commutativity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Associativity &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + (\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt;

and

3. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + (-\mathbf{A}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + 0 = \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

From matrix addition it can be seen that the product of a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and a number p is simply &lt;math&gt;p\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; where every element of the matrix is multiplied individually by p.

Transpose of a Matrix

A matrix is transposed when the rows and columns are interchanged:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A^T} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{21} &amp; a_{31} \\
a_{12} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{32} \\
a_{13} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

 
Notice that the principal diagonal elements stay the same after transposition.

A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose eg: &lt;math&gt;a_{kj} = a_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is skew symmetric if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A^T} = -\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; eg: &lt;math&gt;a_{kj} = -a_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;. The principal diagonal of a skew symmetric matrix is composed of elements that are zero.

Other Types of Matrix

Diagonal matrix: all elements above and below the principal diagonal are zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Unit matrix: denoted by I, is a diagonal matrix where all elements of the principal diagonal are 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Multiplication===

Matrix multiplication is defined in terms of the problem of determining the coefficients in linear transformations.

Consider a set of linear transformations between 2 coordinate systems that share a common origin and are related to each other by a rotation of the coordinate axes.

 

Two Coordinate Systems Rotated Relative to Each Other

If there are 3 coordinate systems, x, y, and z these can be transformed from one to another:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}y_1 + a_{12}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}y_1 + a_{22}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

 

&lt;math&gt;y_1 = b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_2 = b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

 

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = c_{11}z_1 + c_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = c_{21}z_1 + c_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

 

By substitution:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}(b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2) + a_{12}(b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}(b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2) + a_{22}(b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;x_1 = (a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}(b_{21})z_1 + (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22})z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = (a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}(b_{21})z_1 + (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})z_2 &lt;/math&gt;


Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;c_{11} = (a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}(b_{21})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{12} = (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{21} = (a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{22} = (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})&lt;/math&gt;
 

The coefficient matrices are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\
b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} &amp; c_{12} \\
c_{21} &amp; c_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From the linear transformation the product of A and B is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AB} =
\begin{bmatrix}
(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the discussion of scalar products it was shown that, for a plane the scalar product is calculated as: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt; where a and b are the coordinates of the vectors a and b.

Now mathematicians define the rows and columns of a matrix as vectors:

A Column vector is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} \\
b_{21} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And a Row vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 

Matrices can be described as vectors eg:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_{1}} \\ 
\mathbf{a_{2}} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\
b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{b_{1}} \mathbf{b_{2}} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix multiplication is then defined as the scalar products of the vectors so that:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_1.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_2} \\
\mathbf{a_2.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of the scalar product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1.b_1} = a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}&lt;/math&gt; etc.

In the general case: 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_1.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_n} \\
\mathbf{a_2.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_n} \\
. &amp; . &amp; . &amp; . \\
\mathbf{a_m.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_m.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_m.b_n} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is described as the multiplication of rows into columns (eg: row vectors into column vectors). The first matrix must have the same number of columns as there are rows in the second matrix or the multiplication is undefined.

After matrix multiplication the product matrix has the same number of rows as the first matrix and columns as the second matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
6 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3 \\
7 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; has 2 rows and 1 column &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
39 \\
35 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

ie: first row is &lt;math&gt;1*2 + 3*3 + 4*7 = 39&lt;/math&gt; and second row is &lt;math&gt;6*2 + 3*3 + 2*7 = 35&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
2 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\
3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; has 2 rows and 3 columns&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
21 &amp; 11 &amp; 13 \\
16 &amp; 7 &amp; 16 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

Notice that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{BA}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be determined because the '''number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix''' to perform matrix multiplication. 


Properties of Matrix Multiplication

1. Not commutative &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} \ne \mathbf{BA}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Associative &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A(BC)} = \mathbf{(AB)C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(k\mathbf{A})\mathbf{B} = k(\mathbf{AB}) = \mathbf{A}(k\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

3. Distributative for matrix addition

&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AC} + \mathbf{BC}&lt;/math&gt;

matrix multiplication is not commutative so &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{CA} + \mathbf{CB}&lt;/math&gt; is a separate case.

4. The cancellation law is not always true:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = 0&lt;/math&gt; does not mean &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=0&lt;/math&gt;

There is a case where matrix multiplication is commutative. This involves the scalar matrix where the values of the principle diagonal are all equal. Eg:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} =
\begin{bmatrix}
k &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; k &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; k \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AS} = \mathbf{SA} = k\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If the scalar matrix is the unit matrix: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AI} = \mathbf{IA} = \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linear Transformations===

A simple linear transformation such as:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}y_1 + a_{12}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}y_1 + a_{22}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{Ay}&lt;/math&gt;

eg:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
*
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and
&lt;math&gt;y_1 = b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_2 = b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;


as: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Bz}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the associative law:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{Bz}) = \mathbf{ABz} = \mathbf{Cz}&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AB} =
\begin{bmatrix}
(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

as before.

==Indicial Notation==

Consider a simple rotation of coordinates:

[[Image:relrotate2.jpg]]

&lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^'&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} =g_{\mu \nu} x^\mu x^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and is called the metric tensor for this 2D space. 

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s.s} = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;g_{11} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{21} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{22} = 1&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_{1}^' + x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

If there is no rotation of coordinates the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_1 + x_2x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which is Pythagoras' theorem.

===The Summation Convention===

Indexes that appear as both subscripts and superscripts are summed over.

&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} x^\mu x^\nu = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

by promoting &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; to a superscript it is taken out of the summation ie:.

&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu}^\nu x^\mu x^\nu = g_{1\nu} x_1x_{\nu}^' + g_{2\nu} x_2x_{\nu}^'&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Multiplication in Indicial Notation===

Consider:

Columns times rows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_1 &amp; y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 y_1 &amp; x_1 y_2 \\
x_2 y_1 &amp; x_2 y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Matrix product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{XY} = x_iy_j &lt;/math&gt; Where i = 1, 2 j = 1, 2 

There being no summation the indexes are both subscripts.

Rows times columns:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 &amp; x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 y_1 &amp; x_2 y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{XY} = \delta_{ij} x^iy^j &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is known as Kronecker delta and has the value 0 when &lt;math&gt;i \ne j &lt;/math&gt; and 1 when &lt;math&gt;i = j &lt;/math&gt;. It is the indicial equivalent of the unit matrix:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

There being summation one value of i is a subscript and the other a superscript.

A matrix in general can be specified by any of:

&lt;math&gt;M_{i}^j&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M^{i}_j&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depending on which subscript or superscript is being summed over.

===Vectors in Indicial Notation===

A vector can be expressed as a sum of basis vectors.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

In indicial notation this is: &lt;math&gt;x = a^ie_i &lt;/math&gt;

===Linear Transformations in indicial notation===

Consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{Ay}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; are coordinate matrices.

In indicial notation this is: 

&lt;math&gt;x^{\mu} = A^{\mu}_{\nu} x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; 

which becomes:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11} x^{'}_1+ a_{12} x^{'}_2+ a_{13} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21} x^{'}_1+ a_{22} x^{'}_2+ a_{23} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_3 = a_{31} x^{'}_1+ a_{32} x^{'}_2+ a_{33} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

===The Scalar Product in indicial notation===

In indicial notation the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x.y} = \delta_{ij} x^i y^j &lt;/math&gt;

==Analysis of curved surfaces and transformations==

It became apparent at the start of the nineteenth century that issues such as Euclid's parallel postulate required the development of a new type of geometry that could deal with curved surfaces and real and imaginary planes. At the foundation of this approach is Gauss's analysis of curved surfaces which allows us to work with a variety of coordinate systems and displacements on any type of surface.

Elementary geometric analysis is useful as an introduction to Special Relativity because it suggests the physical meaning of the coefficients that appear in coordinate transformations.

Suppose there is a line on a surface. The length of this line can be expressed in terms of a coordinate system. A short length of line &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; in a two dimensional space may be expressed in terms of Pythagoras' theorem as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta s^2 = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/SUP&gt;Suppose there is another coordinate system on the surface with two axes: x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;, &lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, how can the length of the line be expressed in terms of these coordinates? Gauss tackled this problem and his analysis is quite straightforward for two coordinate axes: 

'''Figure 1:'''

[[Image:constudtensor.gif]]

It is possible to use elementary differential geometry to describe displacements along the plane in terms of displacements on the curved surfaces:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Y}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Delta Z = \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Z}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The displacement of a short line is then assumed to be given by a formula, called a metric, such as Pythagoras' theorem

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = \Delta Y^2 + \Delta Z^2&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta Z &lt;/math&gt; can then be substituted into this metric:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = ( \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Y}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2} )^2 + ( \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Z}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} )^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which, when expanded, gives the following:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} ) \Delta x_1 \Delta x_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; +( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} ) \Delta x_2 \Delta x_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; + ( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} ) \Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; + ( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} ) \Delta x_2 \Delta x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be represented using summation notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 =  \sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2 (\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_i}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_k}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_i} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_k} ) \Delta x_i \Delta x_k &lt;/math&gt;

Or, using '''indicial''' notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = g_{ik} \Delta x^i \Delta x^k &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt; g_{ik} = (\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x^i}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x^k}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x^i} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x^k} ) &lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are not merged then &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on both sets of coordinates. In matrix notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta s^2 = \mathbf{g} \Delta \mathbf{x} \Delta \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 &amp; \Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 \\
\Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where a, b, c, d stand for the values of &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1a + \Delta x_2c &amp; \Delta x_1b + \Delta x_2d \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 \\
\Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which is:

&lt;math&gt;(\Delta{x_1}a + \Delta{x_2}c) \Delta{x_1} + (\Delta{x_1}b + \Delta{x_2}d) \Delta{x_2} = \Delta{x_1}^2a + 2\Delta{x_1}\Delta{x_2}(c + b) + \Delta{x_2}^2d&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \Delta{x_1}^2a + 2\Delta{x_1}\Delta{x_2}(c + b) + \Delta{x_2}^2d&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2&lt;/math&gt; is a '''bilinear form''' that depends on both &lt;math&gt;\Delta{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be written in matrix notation as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \mathbf{\Delta{x}^T A \Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A is the matrix containing the values in &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the bilinear form known as the quadratic form because the same matrix (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;) appears twice; in the generalised bilinear form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{x^TAy}&lt;/math&gt; (the matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; are different).

If the surface is a Euclidean plane then the values of gik are:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp; \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \\
\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp; \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which become:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the matrix A is the unit matrix I and:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \mathbf{\Delta{x^T} I \Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \Delta{x_1}^2 + \Delta{x_2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem yet again.

If the surface is derived from some other metric such as &lt;math&gt;\Delta{s^2} = -\Delta{Y}^2 + \Delta{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; then the values of gik are:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
-\delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp;  -\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \\
-\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp;  -\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which allows the original metric to be recovered ie: &lt;math&gt;\Delta{s^2} = -\Delta{x_1}^2 + \Delta{x_2}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

It is interesting to compare the geometrical analysis with the transformation based on matrix algebra that was derived in the section on indicial notation above:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s.s} = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

Now, 

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

ie:
&lt;math&gt;g_{11} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{21} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{22} = 1&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_{1}^' + x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

If there is no rotation of coordinates the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_1 + x_2x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem. However, the reader may have noticed that Pythagoras' theorem had been assumed from the outset in the derivation of the scalar product (see above).

The geometrical analysis shows that if a metric is assumed and the conditions that allow differential geometry are present then it is possible to derive one set of coordinates from another.  This analysis can also be performed using matrix algebra with the same assumptions.

The example above used a simple two dimensional Pythagorean metric, some other metric such as the metric of a 4D Minkowskian space:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = - \Delta T^2 + \Delta X^2 + \Delta Y^2 + \Delta Z^2&lt;/math&gt;

could be used instead of Pythagoras' theorem.</text>

    {{:Book/Chapter name}}

And the chapter already includes the chapter name then in the contents menu on the print version the chapter's name will appear twice, one as a subtitle of the other.

Doesn't this need to be changed? [[User:Glich|Glich]] ([[User talk:Glich|talk]]) 16:29, 23 July 2008 (UTC)


== Deeper explanation of &quot;Creating separate page for print version&quot; required? ==
Could someone take some time to provide a more in depth explanation of the steps needed in the section &quot;Creating separate page for print version&quot;. For example, step 3 mentions &quot;Copy the TOC as an ordered list&quot;. Does this mean just the text on the web page as I see it, or the wikitext or html code which is behind the TOC? I looked at the proposed reference work (Python Programming) but don't quite understand whether they created their TOC, or whether there is a way for wikibooks to create it for me that I am supposed to use. 

Can someone provide some clarification? Many thanks. --[[User:Codinghead|Codinghead]] ([[User talk:Codinghead|talk]]) 11:18, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright inclusion ==
In [[Ada Programming]] we already have a &quot;print version&quot; in [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] so I followed the additional recomendations and have added the template and included the GFDL text. I wonder whether this last inclusion is really necessary; it adds too much text to the page and what is worst, it adds the page to the [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]]. Could an administrator at least use the noinclude tag around the category? Otherwise we need other method for including the GFDL text. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

: Ok, done, adding noinclude helped.
: About GFDL problem: yes, it is strictly required that any print version of text under GFDL license has full text of the license. In fact, we should also include it in all our pages, but we &quot;cheat&quot; a bit by providing only link to the license text. Yes, GFDL is a stupid license, but unfortunately when Wikibooks were created there was no better alternative (like CC-BY-SA license). It's too late to change anything so we are stick to GFDL forever. Remember, when you create your own wiki, never ever use GFDL, maybe except dual-licensing ;-) --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:13, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::I reread the license and I don't think we are cheating since we follow the requirements of section titled [[GNU Free Documentation License#6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS]].   Actually I don't see any problem on using the GFDL for a wiki. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Automatic generation of print version pages from a navigational map ==

Take a look at [[m:User:Nigelk/Nav]] and [[m:User:Nigelk/ConcatPages]]. This extension could be used to keep the TOC of the book synchronized with the print version. This extension also automatically adds next/up/previous links to the pages listed in the TOC page, aka nav map. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

== No Print Question ==

If I do the following:

:To prevent block of text from being printed, cover it with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

and the block of text contains a header. Is there a way to also not show the header in the TOC?
:Try &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;   It solved some problems for me [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 14:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Inclusion of Module Sections? ==

Is there a way to link a module's section from the print version's page, but not include the entire module as well? I was thinking about creating an Endnotes page for some books instead of having footnotes at the end of each chapter. I tried &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Book/Module#SectionName}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but no luck. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 23:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

: Not quite sure what, precisely, you're asking. If you want to include only parts of the module in the &quot;all-pages&quot; version, you can use the &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt; tag to mark the parts that you don't want included. If you want all the endnotes included, you may have to make each module's endnote section a seperate page and include it both at the end of each module as well as in the &quot;all-pages&quot; endnote page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:47, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

== Patent and PDF ==

I noticed that PDF is the file type of choice. Due to the various patents surrounding this format, it should be avoided. Wikimedia takes a stance against similar formats such as MP3, AVI and, to a lesser extent, GIF/JPG. How about promoting the use of ODF and other unencumbered (but equally powerful) formats? --[[User:OldakQuill|OldakQuill]] 15:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
: AFAIK JPG cannot be substituted and I haven't heard of any instructions from any Wikimedia project to avoid JPG files. Currently, PDF is the only reasonable publication format: it can be viewed in various web browsers and operating systems. I don't see any alternative and in my opinion it's not Wikimedia Foundation role to promote free software and new standards. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
::I'm not simply talking about advocacy. Patents often put a burden on Wikimedians to pay various companies whenever they create a file in a patented format. This is precisely the reason why we do not allow MP3 files. ODF is a very viable, flexible alternative. PNG can be used in the place of most JPG files. --[[User:OldakQuill|OldakQuill]] 12:39, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

::: Certainly I'm all in favor of open file formats, including the [[w:OpenDocument]] format (ODF) developed by OASIS. Certainly *some* patent holders require a license fee to use their license. However, the wikipedia article on pdf [[w:pdf]] claims that PDF is also an open file format. Also, according to the wikipedia article on pdf, &quot;Anyone may create applications that read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to Adobe Systems; Adobe holds a number of patents relating to PDF but licenses them royalty-free for use in developing software that complies with its PDF specification.&quot;
::: Likewise, since the LZW patent has expired, [[w:GIF]] is now a open file format (and free). But PNG is technically superior to GIF, even if it is no longer &quot;morally&quot; superior, so I still recommend converting all GIFs to PNG.
::: I don't know enough about ODF vs PDF to know whether one is technically superior to another. But it seems reasonable to me for ODF advocates to post ODF versions, so that users have a choice of viewing a Wikibook in HTML/XHTML, PDF, or ODF.

== Don't over complicate task of book making ==

I can understand the open source community has its roots in programming but word processing is a common thing. You don't need to use a programming language to make pdfs or even E-books the programming has already been done for you from many many sources. If you can have an HTML page you can make it into an RTF page, if you can make it into an RTF page you can edit it in any number of word processing programs and print it out into PDF form or MSReader form or Palm Doc form. I've done all this countless times. I've taken text files off of Gutenberg.org and done everything from making them into paperbacks you can hold in your hand to e-books for e-readers -- ALL FROM COMMONLY AVAILABLE PROGRAMS (pardom my volume) -- MSWord and WordPerfect being the most common. The point is DON'T set it up as a specialist's task but one countless people can accomplish from their home computers. ALL the Wikibooks should be available in downloadable format. Infact MULTIPLE formats ... HTML, palm Doc, MSWord Doc, MSReader, PDF and whatever else format is requested. Set a place where the source text is available for book makers and you'll get them back from home book makers as quick as you can write or devise them. -- Thank you. JN

== Print version tag prints! ==

I have including the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Print version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag on the [[A-level Computing]] page, as I am trying out the print version to see how it looks (no where near finished i know!).  However the tag appears on the printed version, [[A-level Computing/Print version]].  Using the div noprint tag doesn't get rid of it!?!  any suggestions [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 14:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== More tips on PDF creation ==

Can you explain me, step by step, how do you create PDF files from print versions? I tried method described in [[Help:Print versions#PDF versions]] but it did not work. I was saving true print version (without navigation bar, print version notice and so on) as HTML file with images using Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer and opening them as HTML file in OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 and Microsoft Word 2003. None of these combinations worked. The thing I got in word processor was text with print version notice, section edit links and so on. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

:I save articles as &quot;Web page complete&quot;. MS Word displays the files properly for me (looking like the Print Version) provided they are small (under 50 pages). Larger files may need breaking into parts for viewing. Recently I have used Wordpad to &quot;top and tail&quot; the files before viewing. I remove all the unnecessary code before the BODY tag and after the end of text, before the /BODY tag. I just stick the standard HTML HEAD /HEAD sequence in front of the BODY tag. 

:Once the file has been saved as a word processor file it looks like the Print Version but does have irritating additions such as section templates still in place. I chop off the Print Version heading and any Table of Contents and use recorded macros in Word to cut out all the repeating elements that are not needed such as &quot;edit&quot; links and templates. I then page through the whole file looking for headings that have the wrong 'level', links that are incorrect and missing graphics. If there is a missing graphic I go to the online version and copy and paste the graphic into place. Once the text looks OK I insert a Cover Page and Table of Contents at the start. The whole process takes about 45 minutes for a 200 page book so it is a labour of love if you are a busy person. Once the Word Document is complete I print it to file using PDF Creator and upload.  

:Some books make Word 'hang' when you try to view them as HTML. The only way round this (that I have found) is to chop them into pieces, top and tail the small files with HTML tags and combine them in Word. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)


== How to stop template appearing in print version ==

How can I stop a navigational template from appearing in a print version? [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 15:05, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:there are a number of ways to go about doing this, although the nuances can be tricky. The easiest way to stop something from appearing in a print version is to surround the text of the navigational aide in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. The templates will still appear on the print version page, but will not appear on the paper when you print it. If you need a better solution, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

== Something that editors may find useful ==

To create manual page breaks in the print version, use {{tl|Print version page break}}. According to an HTML comment inside the template, it only works in Firefox. [[User:JeremyMcCracken|JeremyMcCracken]] ([[User talk:JeremyMcCracken|talk]]) 21:52, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

== MediaWiki to LaTeX conversion for printing ==

I've written a [http://www.osresearch.net/wiki/index.php/LaTeX_and_MediaWiki MediaWiki to LaTeX] conversion script that ties into the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Pdf_Export ExportPDF extension] to produce high-quality PDF documents on the fly from Mediawiki pages.  There are also a set of templates that go with the script to allow index generation, references, citations, abstracts, epigraphs, equations and figures.  There is preliminary support for fairly complicated markup like the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, which is converted into floating subfigures, and tables, which are converted into floating tables inside of figures.  I'm still working on bibliographies and style sheets.

It is still very much in beta, but I hope that it proves useful for other users.

== Move to the Help namespace ==

I propose we move this page to the Help namespace. It is, in essence, a page helping users get a task done on Wikibooks, not about the Wikibooks site or community.

== Subchapters ==

The help pages explains how to create chapters. What I miss is a description explaining how to create subchapters.

E.g. [[GLPK]] has a chapter [[GLPK/Compiling GLPK]] which contains a subchapter [[GLPK/Linux OS]].

Now in the printout I want every heading level of [[GLPK/Linux OS]] to be one level more indented than in a chapter.

== [[Template:Printable]] ==

I would like to talk about [[Template:Printable]] in this page, because it's a simpler, quicker and dynamic alternative. As anyone can see into [[Microsoft SQL Server/Print version]], adding a chapter on the TOC will add it into the printable version at the same time.

It's only withdraw I would say, is that its regex doesn't recognize the &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; syntax as &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Book name/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; yet.

== Could be simplyfied ==

You may use simple boxes instead of circles and then slapping a SubSurf modifier on the model. Or spinning a profile of the whole cup. --[[User:DanMan|DanMan]] 10:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Very confusing and not specific enough. ==

There are many parts in this tutorial that just simply do not explain what is going on.  In te first part it doesn't even say how far to extrude the cube face, because in the picture is is obviously not the same length of the cube.  Secondly, when it says extrude 12 more times, once again, it does not explain how far to extrude each face.  Some extrusions are extremely long while others are much shorter.  This need much better directions.

I added a better image showing the extrusion blueprint [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 03:15, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

== User Notes From Main Article ==

(User note: I didn't do this tutorial because it didn't explain important things. I suggest you skip this tutorial and move on.)

(Fallen Fate: I think that this is a good tutorial to try out your creativity skills because it allows the user to fill in the blanks so to speak while giving the main idea.)

(User note: i found it much easier to use the spin method that was used to make the simple hat)

== Potential Problem ==

Although this tutorial is rather unspecific, I was able to use the images, instruction and my own idea of what the author was aiming for to create the &quot;box version&quot; of the goblet. Following this, however, I had significant amounts of grief trying to get the curved look of the cup part of the goblet as shown in the tutorial photo (labeled &quot;Applied SubSurf modifier&quot;). No matter what I tried I couldn't get the SubSurf function to behave the way I wanted it to. The body instead looked like a cylinder with a flat bottom. I used the Set Smooth function like he said and even the smooth ability multiple times, as well as other functions I am less familiar with to try to bevel the bottom part of the container. In the end, the entire problem was remedied with the simple vertex command Remove Doubles. Apparently there were too many excess vertices which interfered with the Subsurf modifier. 

I just figured I might save someone out there an hour or so by sharing ...


== Extra part ==

I found the beginning of the tutorial fine. They didn't specify the amount you extrude and scale by but you sound be able to work it out instead of being spoon-fed

I could not get the base right however. 

But what I most found difficult was the extra part. My goblet did not look like the one in the final picture at all. It did not have that &quot;glass&quot; look. Are we suppose to do something with the colour in the plane??

== Page now links to the new Cylinder version ==
I've done a version of this tutorial but starting from a cylinder rather than a cube as here.

I've modified the forward link to insert the new page between this page and &quot;Simple Vehicle Part I&quot;.

Hope you like the new page.

==Problem with Shadow?==
I found a surefire way to get that transparent shadow-- open your light settings-whether a lamp, spot, sun, etc. Under &quot;Shadow and Spot&quot;, there are two main buttons: RayShadow and Buf. shadow. The default should be Buf. shadow. But Buf. Shadow (shadow buffer) is a plain shadow. Click &quot;Rayshadow&quot; and It will use Raytracing for the shadow, allowing for that perfect Transparent shadow. Note: Render times will extend a little bit more.

== General Suggestion ==

The tutorial gets completely confusing for newbies, when people start discussions and adding notes on the tutorial page. 

Suggestion: All disscussions, notes, remarks, whatsoever should be moved to this discussion page.

==Streamline the tutorial with functions mentioned in the previous tutorials==
I think later tutorials should build on the knowledge from the previous tutorials to speed up learning.
For example, in this tutorial we could assume the reader is already familiar with the multi-cut knife tool.
If that's the case then the first part of the tutorial is tedious and ineffective. Instead of extruding the same face 12(!) times, 
we can:&lt;br/&gt;
1) make a single extrusion of length 5&lt;br/&gt;
2) cut it with the multi-cut tool along the X axis into 10 pieces &lt;br/&gt;
3) select unnecessary edge loops and delete them&lt;br/&gt;
4) make 2 extrusions on the other side&lt;br/&gt;

== Your building a sky scraper ==

== combining the transparent glass section with the lighting page ==
I think the bottom half of this page needs to go into the lighing tutorial that follows it, with a better quick breakout of how to light it, and get a transparent, or a reflective ray tranced surface [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 19:48, 14 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[User:EyalDr|EyalDr]] 20:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC) &quot;Student&quot; can be translated as תלמיד/תלמידה and as סטודנט/סטודנטית. It depends if we're talking about a high school student (תלמיד) or a college student (סטודנט).

----

Not to be a stickler and comment on every page I come across here on WikiBooks.org, but there is an error with the transliteration of the phrases for asking how someone (m or f) is.

Rather than being transliterated as: &quot;How are you? (to a man, Ma sh'lome)&quot; and &quot;How are you? (to a woman, Ma sh'loma)&quot; it should read as &quot;How are you? (to a man, Ma sh'lomcha)&quot; and &quot;How are you? (to a woman, Ma sh'lomech)&quot;

The examples given on the page are completely wrong. Even taking into account this missing chet transliteration for each example, even the genders have been mixed up and dont match with the given hebrew of each example.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Xanth. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Xanth~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Commonly referred to as a 'kennel', this is an ideal sleeping area for your dog if you live in confined places.  Many can be used for travel, including airplanes.
